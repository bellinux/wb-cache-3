Since then, the splitting of energy levels proportional to an external magnetic field has been called the "Zeeman effect". The "Zeeman resonance effect " causes magnetic resonances which are classified under radio frequency spectroscopy (rf spectroscopy). In these resonances, the transitions between two branches of a single energy level split in an external magnetic field are measured in the megahertz and gigahertz range. In 1944, Jevgeni Konstantinovitch Savoiski discovered electron paramagnetic resonance.

High constitutive NF-kappaB activity and low I kappaB-alpha expression was found in a number of these cell lines. Moreover, some of these cells showed a high p 100 expression, responsible for the cytoplasmic sequestration of most of p 65 complexes. Treatment of these cells with TNF-alpha or other NF-kappaB activating agents induced only weakly nuclear NF-kappaB activity without significant p 100 processing and led to a very weak transcription of NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene. Induction of NF-kappaB activity can be restored by expression of the Tax protein or by treatment with antisense p 100 oligonucleotides.

40|$|In resting T lymphocytes, the {{transcription}} factor NF-kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm via interactions {{with members of}} the I kappa B family of inhibitors, including IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta. During normal T-cell activation, IkappaBalpha is rapidly phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, thus permitting the release of functional NF-kappaB. In contrast to its transient pattern of <b>nuclear</b> <b>induction</b> during an immune response, NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in cells expressing the Tax transforming protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV- 1). Recent studies indicate that HTLV- 1 Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, it remains unclear how this viral protein induces a persistent rather than transient NF-kappaB response. In this report, we provide evidence that in addition to acting on IkappaBalpha, Tax stimulates the turnover Of IkappaBbeta via a related targeting mechanism. Like IkappaBalpha, Tax-mediated breakdown of IkappaBbeta in transfected T lymphocytes is blocked either by cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors or by mutation Of IkappaBbeta at two serine residues present within its N-terminal region. Despite the dual specificity of HTLV- 1 Tax for IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta at the protein level, Tax selectively stimulates NF-kappaB-directed transcription of the IkappaBalpha gene. Consequently, IkappaBbeta protein expression is chronically downregulated in HTLV- 1 -infected T lymphocytes.

Therefore, the temporal induction of FOS-like protein in rat brain was examined following IP administration of 60 mmol/kg cocaethylene. Immunoreactivity for the protein was detectable at 1 h in striatal neurons and had virtually disappeared 6 h after drug treatment. Administration of specific dopaminergic (SCH- 23390; 0. 5 mg/kg) and glutamatergic (MK- 801; 1 mg/kg) receptor antagonists prior to cocaethylene indicated a significant role for dopamine (D 1) and Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor subtypes in mediating the <b>nuclear</b> <b>induction</b> of the aforementioned transcription factor protein.

In addition, we uncovered a differential sensitivity of Long–Evans rats to the behavioral effects of cocaethylene, with the psychoactive metabolite producing significantly less behavioral activity (e. g., locomotion, rearing, and continuous sniffing) than that produced by cocaine (molar equivalent of 60 mmol/kg cocaethylene).

We recently identified the TRE 17 /ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP 6) oncogene as the first de-ubiquitinating enzyme to activate NF-κB. TRE 17 /USP 6 is translocated and overexpressed in aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), a pediatric tumor characterized by extensive bone degradation and inflammatory recruitment. In the current study, we explore the mechanism by which TRE 17 induces activation of NF-κB, and find that it activates the classical NF-κB pathway through an atypical mechanism that does not involve IκB degradation. TRE 17 co-precipitates with IκB kinase (IKK), and IKK activity is augmented in stable cell lines overexpressing TRE 17, in a USP-dependent manner.

His colleagues at Oxford were sceptical, but they did the experiment anyway, and were staggered to obtain clear signals (Hoult et al 1974; Radda 1998). [Much earlier than that, Felix Bloch had observed a strong proton NMR signal in 1946 when he put his finger into the probe coil of his <b>nuclear</b> <b>induction</b> apparatus (Bloch et al 1946), but although this could be called the first biological NMR experiment it did not provide any biological information apart from confirming that human tissues are not harmed by intense magnetic fields. ] It subsequently became clear that NMR allows measurement of the concentrations of metabolites, not only in fresh tissue but also in living organisms, including humans, as originally suggested by Britton Chance (Chance et al 1978). Initially this approach was restricted to 31 P NMR: this is much less sensitive than proton NMR, but nearly all 31 P nuclei in living cells occur in a rather small set of different environments, whereas the number of different proton environments is so large that there was little hope of resolving all of the superimposed proton signals with the instruments available 30 years ago.

40|$|Intracellular {{signaling}} by receptor tyrosine kinases regulates {{many different}} aspects of cell behavior. Recent studies in our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the EphA 2 receptor tyrosine kinase critically regulates tumor cell growth, migration and invasiveness. Although the cellular consequences of EphA 2 signaling have {{been the focus of}} recent attention, the biochemical changes that are triggered by ligand-mediated activation of EphA 2 remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that ligand stimulation of EphA 2 promotes the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of ERKs, followed by an increase in <b>nuclear</b> <b>induction</b> of the Elk- 1 transcription factor. Ligand-mediated activation allows EphA 2 to form a molecular complex with the Shc and Grb 2 adaptor proteins. Specifically, we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylated EphA 2 interacts with the PTB and SH 2 domains of Shc. We also show that the interaction of EphA 2 with Grb 2 is indirect and mediated by Shc and that this complex is necessary for EphA 2 -mediated activation of ERKs and subsequent stimulation of the Elk- 1 transcription factor. These studies provide a novel mechanism to demonstrate how EphA 2 can convey information from the cell exterior to the nucleus. ^ Another aspect of the ephrin-A 1 /EphA 2 interaction is its influence on the mechanisms that govern EphA 2 gene expression. Our present studies demonstrate that EphA 2 gene expression is positively regulated by its own ability to bind ligand (ephrin-A 1). Treatment of aggressive (MDA-MB- 231) or non-aggressive (MCF 10 A) breast epithelial lines with artificial ligands induced EphA 2 gene expression whereas antagonists of EphA 2 -ligand binding decrease EphA 2 mRNA levels. We also demonstrate that ephrin-A 1 -mediated induction of EphA 2 gene expression requires intracellular signaling through the MAP/ERK pathway. These findings provide intriguing evidence that EphA 2 expression and function are intimately linked in both non-transformed and malignant epithelial cells. Ultimately, the results in this thesis will help to understand the mechanisms that cause the increased expression of this important and influential oncogene in human cancer. ...|$|E

Although it was reported that necrostatin- 1 —a specific inhibitor of necroptosis—inhibited TNF-induced necroptosis in L 929 cells, it has not been elucidated whether the cells eventually die by apoptosis in the presence of necrostatin- 1. In this paper, induction of apoptosis was demonstrated in TNF-treated L 929 cells in the presence of necrostatin- 1. Co-treatment with cycloheximide expedited apoptosis induction in necrostatin- 1 /TNF-treated L 929 cells: typical apoptotic morphological changes, including membrane blebbing and <b>nuclear</b> fragmentation, <b>induction</b> of caspase- 3 activity, proteolytic activation of caspases- 3, - 8, and - 9, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (a well-known substrate of caspase- 3) were observed.

In contrast, co-treatment with Z-Asp-CH 2 -DCB (a caspase inhibitor preferential to caspase- 3) inhibited apoptosis without expediting necroptosis.

40|$|Traditional {{continuous}} wave methods of observation of NMR and NQR is now almost completely superseded by pulse Fourier transform spectroscopy. Compared with {{the method of}} continuous frequency scanning, pulse Fourier transform spectroscopy has advantages, which consists in a high sensitivity, increased spectrum resolution, much less distortion of the lines shape. In addition, pulse spectroscopy provides {{a reduction in the}} time of observation compared with stationary methods. The aim of the paper is to determine the effectiveness of assessment of output materials for photoelectronics by NQR hardware methods. The comparison of the NQR spectra obtained by the method of continuous passage of the resonance lines and the pulse method with a fast Fourier transformation are performed in this paper. Research was done both on the nitrogen containing substance and the annealed GaSe and InSe crystals important for heterostructures production. Resonance of nitrogen 14 N nuclei is in the low-frequency region (100 kHz – 5 MHz) and has a weak intensity, caused by small value of the quantum transitions energy. Obtained results indicate a higher resolution of NQR pulse spectroscopy in comparison with continuous spectroscopy. Based on these experimental results it can be concluded that the same signal / noise ratio, methods of continuous frequency scanning and pulsed excitation provide identical results, but the shapes of resonance lines obtained using these methods are different. In the pulse method there is a simultaneous response of all resonant transitions, i. e. it is recorded that response of <b>nuclear</b> <b>induction</b> over which the Fourier transform is made. In case of stationary technique – slow passage of resonance while maintaining a quasi-equilibrium nuclear spin excitation conditions is made at a single frequency. This leads to a decrease in the spectrometer sensitivity, so that the registration process is much longer. Application of NQR pulse method of fast Fourier transform for the study of layered semiconductors is more appropriate than the stationary method based on continuous frequency scanning in resonance area. Pulse method provides better spectra resolution, and also enables to determine a time of nuclear spin relaxation. It was found that in both cases the spectra with the same values of the signal / noise ratio can be obtained, while in the pulse method the time of spectra determination is for an order of magnitude smaller compared with the method of continuous passage.

Встановлено, що в обох випадках можна отримати спектри з однаковими значеннями сигнал / шум, при цьому в імпульсному методі час реєстрації спектрів є на порядок меншим порівняно з методом неперервного проходження. Крім того, застосування імпульсного методу забезпечує кращу роздільну здатність в спектрі у разі неспотвореної форми резонансних ліній, що є важливим під час дослідження шаруватих напівпровідникових матеріалів, резонансні спектри яких є складними і займають широкий частотний діапазон...|$|E
40|$|Purified rat liver nuclei covalently bound {{low levels}} of seven {{aromatic}} [14 C]hydrocarbons to <b>nuclear</b> DNA. <b>Induction</b> with 3 -methylcholanthrene increased the binding of six carcinogenic hydorcarbons, but did not {{raise the level of}} binding of noncarcinogenic anthracence. Removal of the nuclear envelope by Triton N- 101 eliminated binding and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities and cytochrome P- 450 from the nuclei. Binding of two of two strong carcinogens, benzo[a]pyrene and 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, to nuclear DNA was compared to the levels of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and cytochrome P- 450 in nuclei from uninduced and benz[a]anthracene-, 3 -methylcholanthrene-, and phenobarbital-induced rats. Microsomal hydroxylase and cytochrome P- 450 were also assayed. Induction with 3 -methylcholanthrene gave the largest increases in nuclear activities: 11 times as much hydroxylase, 6 times as much cytochrome P- 450, and 4 times as much binding of both hydrocarbons. Benz[a]anthracene and phenobarbital induced these nuclear activities 0 - to 4 -fold. In the presence of added NADPH, binding of benzol[a]pyrene to DNA by nuclei increased rapidly for at least 20 min. When NADPH was not added, the reaction stopped at a low level in 5 min. When CO was bubbled through the reaction mixture with or without added NADPH, binding of benzo[a]pyrene and 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was partially inhibited, indicating that cytochrome P- 450 plays a role in this activation. Since no nuclear hydroxylase activity was seen without added NADPH or in the presence of CO, activation and subsequent binding of hydrocarbons to nuclear DNA, at least in part, does not require the activated oxygen used in monooxygenase reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} progestins on estrogen-inducible {{mechanisms}} of neuroprotection was investigated. Previously, {{we showed that}} estrogen and progesterone are neuroprotective against excitotoxicity, whereas the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; Provera) is not. Here, we demonstrate that 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and progesterone (P 4) treatment of hippocampal neurons attenuated the excitotoxic glutamate-induced rise in intracellular calcium concentration. Although MPA had no effect alone, MPA completely antagonized E 2 -induced attenuation of intracellular calcium concentration. Activation of extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) is required for estrogen-induced neuroprotection and calcium regulation. Paradoxically, E 2, P 4, and MPA all elicited similar rapid and transient activation of ERK, presenting a contradiction between the dependence on ERK for gonadal hormone-induced neuroprotection {{and the lack of}} neuroprotection induced by MPA. Subcellular analysis of ERK demonstrated that the phospho-ERK signal is transduced to the nucleus only by E 2 and P 4, not by MPA. These results indicate that the profile of nuclear translocation of ERK is consistent with the neuroprotective profile. Further, the E 2 -induced nuclear translocation of ERK was blocked by coadministration of MPA. Results of this study reveal that <b>nuclear</b> ERK <b>induction</b> by ovarian steroids is predictive of the neuroprotective effects of estrogen and progestin treatments, revealing a hitherto unrecognized divergence of progestin signaling through the src/MAPK pathway. These results have much broader implications encompassing the impact of progestins on estrogen-mediated effects in multiple tissues. The recent results from the Women's Health Initiative trial, which used MPA as the progestinal agent, indicate that differences between progestin formulations are crucial to health outcomes in women...|$|R
40|$|Growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{following}} glucose depletion (the diauxic shift) {{depends on}} a profound metabolic adaptation accompanied by a global reprogramming of gene expression. In this study, we provide evidence for a heretofore unsuspected role for Isc 1 p in mediating this reprogramming. Initial studies revealed that yeast cells deleted in ISC 1, the gene encoding inositol sphingolipid phospholipase C, which resides in mitochondria in the post-diauxic phase, showed defective aerobic respiration in the post-diauxic phase but retained normal intrinsic mitochondrial functions, including intact mitochondrial DNA, normal oxygen consumption, and normal mitochondrial polarization. Microarray analysis revealed that the Δisc 1 strain failed to up-regulate genes required for nonfermentable carbon source metabolism during the diauxic shift, thus suggesting a mechanism for the defective supply of respiratory substrates into mitochondria in the post-diauxic phase. This defect in regulating <b>nuclear</b> gene <b>induction</b> {{in response to a}} defect in a mitochondrial enzyme raised the possibility that mitochondria may initiate diauxic shift-associated regulation of nucleus-encoded genes. This was established by demonstrating that in respiratory-deficient petite cells these genes failed to be up-regulated across the diauxic shift {{in a manner similar to}} the Δisc 1 strain. Isc 1 p- and mitochondrial function-dependent genes significantly overlapped with Adr 1 p-, Snf 1 p-, and Cat 8 p-dependent genes, suggesting some functional link among these factors. However, the retrograde response was not activated in Δisc 1, suggesting that the response of Δisc 1 cannot be simply attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest a novel role for Isc 1 p in allowing the reprogramming of gene expression during the transition from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effect of}} silver nanoparticles (Ag-np) {{has resulted in}} their incorporation into consumer products. While the population exposed to Ag-np continues to increase with ever new applications, Ag-np remains a controversial research area {{with regard to their}} toxicity in biological systems. Here a genotoxic and cytotoxic approach was employed to elucidate the activity of Ag-np in vitro and in vivo. Characterization of Ag-np using scanning electron microscopy revealed a size range of 90 - 180 nm. Cytotoxic potential of Ag-np was evaluated in human lymphocytes via cell viability assay (Trypan blue dye exclusion method, MTT and WST assay). The uptake and incorporation of Ag-np into the lymphocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry. Additionally apoptosis (AnnexinV-FITC-PI staining) and DNA strand breaks (comet assay) in human lymphocytes revealed that Ag-np at concentration 25 μg/ml can cause genotoxicity. In vivo experiments on plants (Allium cepa and Nicotiana tabacum) and animal (Swiss albino male mice) showed impairment of <b>nuclear</b> DNA. <b>Induction</b> of oxidative stress was also studied. The DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations raise the concern about the safety associated with applications of the Ag-np. A single ip administration of Ag-np gave a significant (P≤ 0. 05) increase in the frequency of aberrant cells and Tail DNA percent at concentrations 10 mg/kg body weight and above. Results of comet assay in A. cepa and N. tabacum demonstrated that the genotoxic effect of Ag-np was more pronounced in root than shoot/leaf of the plants. The present study indicated a good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore the biological applications employing Ag-np should be given special attention besides adapting the antimicrobial potential. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Memory of past {{cellular}} responses is {{an essential}} adaptation to repeating environmental stimuli. We addressed {{the question of whether}} gamma interferon (IFN-) -inducible transcription generates memory that sensitizes cells to a second stimulus. We have found that the major histocompatibility complex class II gene DRA is relocated to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) <b>nuclear</b> bodies upon <b>induction</b> with IFN-, and this topology is maintained long after transcription shut off. Concurrent interaction of PML protein with mixed-lineage leukemia generates a prolonged permissive chromatin state on the DRA gene characterized by high promoter histone H 3 K 4 dimethylation that facilitates rapid expression upon restimulation. We propose that the primary signal-induced transcription generates spatial and epigenetic memory that is maintained through several cell generations and endows the cell with increased responsiveness to future activation signals. Antigen presentation is a central process for the develop-ment and function of the adaptive immune system. It is medi-ated by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mole-cules that present peptides to effector cells. MHC class II (MHC-II) proteins are the major antigen-presenting determi-nants of exogenous peptides to helper T cells to initiate th...|$|R
