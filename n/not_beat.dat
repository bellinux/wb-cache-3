5|$|Samoa Joe and Booker T {{started a}} rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship {{following}} Slammiversary. On the June12 episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did <b>not</b> <b>beat</b> {{him at the}} event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could <b>not</b> <b>beat</b> Booker T in a one-on-one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July13 for the title. On the July10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not}} know which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would be there to watch. At the event, Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail.

Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell. The match result was ruled a no-contest, with Joe retaining the title.|$|E

On the June12 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did <b>not</b> <b>beat</b> him at the event due to interference from Joe's mentor Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could <b>not</b> <b>beat</b> Booker T in a one-on-one match. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title.

Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{started the}} second half in attacking fashion, as they had chances immediately. A Silvestre run down the pitch {{resulted}} in a pass that found Van Nistelrooy {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool penalty area, but his shot went high and wide of the goal. He had another chance a minute later, but despite beating the offside trap set by the Liverpool defence, he could <b>not</b> <b>beat</b> Westerveld, who saved his shot. United's attacking start to the half was underlined by a third chance in as many minutes, but Scholes' shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. However, two minutes later, United's pressure told and they scored. A move that involved Beckham, Keane and Ryan Giggs resulted in the ball being played to Van Nistelrooy, who went around Westerveld and subsequently scored to reduce Liverpool's lead to 2–1. Beckham came close to levelling the match in the 62nd minute when he had two chances to score; he was unable to get his shot on target after Liverpool failed to clear a cross from Giggs and he was unable to score with a long-range shot.|$|E

At the Lerkendal Stadion, Rosenborg scored two goals inside the first 15 minutes, but Benfica regained their {{aggregate}} lead with a goal on the 19th minute.

The win reduced the gap to Sporting to just 4 points. Four days later, Benfica and Inter Milan had an entertaining seven-goal thriller in the second leg of the UEFA Cup. At half-time, the teams were level, but in the 10 minutes between the 60th and 70th minute, Inter scored three to Benfica's one, opening a two-goal cushion. Benfica later reduced the lead to 4–3, but this was insufficient to prevent an elimination. Benfica closed March on the 28th. Two early goals allowed the team to cruise past Alverca, bringing their win tally to five wins in eight games.|$|E

The following week during The Miz's Miz TV talk show, Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero revealed herself as the one who signed Lesnar to a new contract to impress McMahon. On the February 25 episode of Raw, Lesnar once again attempted to attack McMahon, only to get into a brawl with the returning Triple H, which resulted in Lesnar legitimately having his head split open and requiring eighteen stitches. The following week on Raw, Triple H issued a challenge to Lesnar, requesting a rematch with him at WrestleMania 29, which Lesnar accepted but only after Triple signed a contract and Lesnar named the stipulation. After Triple H signed the contract and assaulted Heyman, the stipulation was revealed as No Holds Barred with Triple H's career on the line. At WrestleMania 29 on April 7, Lesnar lost to Triple H after a Pedigree onto the steel steps. On the April 15 episode of Raw, Lesnar attacked 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre, and Jinder Mahal) before Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules, which Triple H accepted the following week. At the event on May 19, after interference from Heyman, Lesnar defeated Triple H to end their feud. Lesnar returned on the June 17 episode of Raw, attacking Heyman's fellow client CM Punk with an F-5. Despite the accusations from Punk, Heyman claimed that he was not behind Lesnar's attack on him. However, Heyman turned on Punk in July, and claimed that Punk could <b>not</b> <b>beat</b> Lesnar, which led to Lesnar making his return and attacking Punk on the July 15 episode of Raw. The following week on Raw, Punk challenged Lesnar to a match at SummerSlam on August 18, where Lesnar defeated Punk in a no disqualification match.|$|E
