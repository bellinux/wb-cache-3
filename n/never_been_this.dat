It is to be noted that Nielsen had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>this</b> light in his career.

On October 2 it was announced that Lesnar pulled out of his Carwin bout due to an illness. UFC President Dana White said Lesnar had been ill for three weeks, claiming he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>this</b> sick in his life and that it would take him a while to recover, therefore his fight with Carwin was rescheduled for UFC 108 on January 2, 2010. Lesnar initially sought treatment in Canada, but later told reporters that he had received [...] "Third World treatment" [...] at a hospital in Brandon, Manitoba and that seeking better treatment in the United States saved his life. Lesnar went on to criticize Canadian health care further and stated that he shared his experience in an effort to speak [...] "on the behalf of the doctors in the United States that don't want health care reform to happen".|$|E

[...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>this</b> good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E

[...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>this</b> nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

Hogan then joined Gawker to the ongoing action against Heather Clem in state court in Florida, alleging invasion of privacy, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking $100 million in damages.|$|E

She was false to her love, she was false to herself, false to the man to whom she had sold herself. [...] "Oh! Why did I yield!" [...] she cried. She was a coward; she belonged to the luxurious class that would suffer anything rather than lose position. Fallen had she as low as any of them; gold had been the price of her soul.
