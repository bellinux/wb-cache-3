5|$|Eventually the British {{government}} {{decided that the}} campaign in Sudan was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the effort required and left a garrison in Suakin. The New South Wales Contingent sailed for home on 17 May, arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885. Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Tories promised {{changes in}} {{agricultural}} policies. Many Canadian farmers {{were unable to}} find buyers for their wheat; the PC party promised generous cash advances on unsold wheat and promised a protectionist policy regarding foreign agricultural products. The Liberals argued that such tariffs were <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the loss of bargaining position in efforts to seek foreign markets for Canadian agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|The {{railways}} {{arrived on}} Anglesey {{with the construction}} of the Chester and Holyhead Railway, of which the section from Llanfairpwll to Holyhead opened in 1848, two years before the Britannia Bridge was finished. The Chester and Holyhead railway surveyed a branch to Llangefni in 1852, but chose not to proceed. George Stephenson notably reported that the line was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> building.|$|E

5|$|After Milrow was conducted, {{there was}} {{continued}} {{pressure on the}} part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger Cannikin test, while the Federation of American Scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete. In May 1971, Gravel sent a letter to U.S. Atomic Energy Commission hearings held in Anchorage, in which he said the risk of the test was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> taking.|$|E
5|$|After {{being told}} {{by a panel of}} Senators that Fringe Division is <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the human or fiscal cost, Broyles is given the {{transformation}} device by Peter so Broyles can justify Fringe Division remaining active. In a separate scene, Agent Jessup is shown working at a computer, annotating an image of the creature from The Transformation with biblical verses, notably from the Book of Revelation. The final scene reveals that Charlie is actually the shapeshifter, who disposes of the real agent's body in a furnace beneath the hospital.|$|E
5|$|By 1963 McNamara had {{convinced}} Kennedy that the Zeus was simply <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> deploying. The earlier concerns about cost and effectiveness, {{as well as}} new difficulties in terms of attack size and decoy problems, led McNamara to cancel the Zeus project on 5 January 1963. In its place they decided to continue work on Nike-X. Nike-X development was based in the existing Nike Zeus Project Office until their name was changed to Nike-X on 1 February 1964.|$|E

5|$|Falke {{departed}} Montevideo {{and crossed}} the Atlantic to Dakar, proceeding to Las Palmas and then Lisbon. There she was visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. She arrived in Danzig on 15 April, after {{five and a half}} years abroad. The ship was decommissioned on 20 January, and an evaluation determined that she was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> overhauling. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to the seizure of the American vessels, Congress debated and approved the Naval Act of 1794, which authorized the building of six frigates, four of 44 guns and two of 36 guns. Supporters were mostly from the northern states and the coastal regions, who argued the Navy would result in savings in insurance and ransom payments, while opponents from southern states and inland regions thought a navy was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the expense and would drive the United States into more costly wars.|$|E

5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, {{even if they did}} not change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration were <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not obligatory, so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included an icon of Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 {{there was no need for}} a high-altitude fighter and it was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> reducing the production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E
5000|$|The ABC News / Washington Post poll {{conducted}} June 3-6, 2010 similarly {{reported that the}} majority 62% of Republicans think the almost-nine-year war imposed on that country has been worth its costs to the U.S., while the majority two-thirds, 66%, of Democrats and 53% of independents think it has <b>not</b> been <b>worth</b> fighting. In fact, the majority 54% of Democratic-leaning Americans [...] "strongly" [...] think that the war has <b>not</b> been <b>worth</b> fighting.|$|R

5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the effort it takes to wait.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{agreement}} between the hospital authorities, the LBSCR, and its successors, the hospital authorities were obliged to keep the railway in good repair to allow its use by main-line wagons. With a greatly reduced need for goods traffic to the hospital following the conversion of the boilers, it was decided that the railway was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the expense of continued maintenance and necessary upgrading, and the line was officially closed on 25March 1959 following the departure of the last coal wagon.|$|E
5|$|Wheelwright was {{initially}} given until March {{to leave the}} colony, but when ordered not to preach during the interim, he refused, and was then given two weeks to depart the jurisdiction. When asked to give security for his peaceful departure, he declined, but later realized the futility of defiance after spending a night in custody. When directed not to preach during his two weeks of preparation, he again refused, {{and this time the}} court determined that such an injunction was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> pursuing.|$|E

5|$|Basilicata {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Campania. Both ships were built on the same slipway. They were launched {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on Basilicata, and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, Basilicata was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik at the southern end of the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the cost, and so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E
5|$|Browning {{supervised}} {{the newly formed}} division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades raised and assigned to the division, and new equipment tested. Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary, he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry, and demonstrated a knack for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. As the airborne forces expanded in size, the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft. The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war, and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st Airborne Division was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> the drain on Bomber Command's resources.|$|E
