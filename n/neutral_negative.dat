25|$|Even {{though in}} most {{statistical}} classification methods, the neutral class is ignored {{under the assumption}} that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier, several researchers suggest that, as in every polarity problem, three categories must be identified. Moreover, it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the Max Entropy and the SVMs can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification. There are in principle two ways for operating with a neutral class. Either, the algorithm proceeds by first identifying the neutral language, filtering it out and then assessing the rest in terms of positive and negative sentiments, or it builds a three-way classification in one step. This second approach often involves estimating a probability distribution over all categories (e.g. naive Bayes classifiers as implemented by the NLTK). Whether and how to use a neutral class depends {{on the nature of the}} data: if the data is clearly clustered into <b>neutral,</b> <b>negative</b> and positive language, it makes sense to filter the neutral language out and focus on the polarity between positive and negative sentiments. If, in contrast, the data are mostly neutral with small deviations towards positive and negative affect, this strategy would make it harder to clearly distinguish between the two poles.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that survival processing and recall of survival-relevant materials increases both true and false memory recall. Howe and Derbish suggested that if human memory does benefit from survival processing, this benefit must include both an increase in true recollection of information actually present and also a reduced susceptibility to false memory illusions. Further, Howe and Derbish state, if survival information is more distinctive and processed at an item-specific contextual level, false memory rates should be low. To test this, Nairne's survival/pleasantness experiment was modified to manipulate the type of processing along with the information being processed (eliminated the possibility of recollection of survival-related material due to arousal or emotionality; <b>neutral,</b> <b>negative</b> or survival related). It was concluded that participants in the survival condition had higher rates of false recognition than participants in the pleasantness condition. Evidence for a survival recall advantage {{has been found to}} be accompanied by higher false recall rates and results in lower rates of net accuracy (ratio of true recall to recall as a whole). The survival recall advantage appears to occur when only true recall is considered. When total output is taken into account and net accuracy is calculated, the survival recall advantage disappears.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that, during stress, resilient individuals use positive emotion regulation {{strategies and}} experience {{a greater number}} of positive emotions than those who are less resilient. Therefore, differences could be expected in attentional biases towards emotional stimuli based on resilience. The current study investigated attentional biases towards <b>neutral,</b> <b>negative</b> and positive images in response to varying levels of resilence and mood induction conditions (<b>neutral,</b> <b>negative</b> and positive). Sixty participants viewed a series of pre and post-mood induction slides in order to measure attentional biases to emotional stimuli. The study provided evidence for the presence of trait and state congruent attentional biases. More resilient individuals demonstrated an initial bias towards positive stimuli and once emotion was aroused, the bias was away from negative stimuli. Additionally, mood congruent attentional biases were observed for participants induced into positive and negative mood states.

This research used a quasi-experimental research with the population of seventh grade students of Junior High Schools in Klaten Regency which have implemented curriculum 2013 in the Academic Year 2013 / 2014. The sampling technique used stratified cluster random sampling and three schools selected namely SMPN 1 Delanggu, SMPN 1 Prambanan and SMPN 2 Wedi.

The first part of thesis focuses on selected chapters of media, linguistic and semiotic theories regarding bias.

At first, I used quantitative analysis to determine if the newspapers were balanced and provide comparable space to the both candidates. Then I applied the qualitative analysis to find out what language and semiotic components used the authors from newspapers to inform the public about the candidates of the second round of direct elections. Depending on the findings, I divide the articles into positive, <b>neutral,</b> <b>negative</b> categories for Karel Schwarzenberg and positive, <b>neutral,</b> <b>negative</b> for Miloš Zeman. After the victory of Miloš Zeman the bias was discussed.

The main objective of the current experiments was to test developmental trends in the evolutionary foundation of memory using different types of stimuli and paradigms.

Experiment 2 examined developmental trends in the survival processing paradigm using <b>neutral,</b> <b>negative,</b> and survival-related pictures. A survival processing advantage was found for survival-related pictures in adults, for negative pictures in 11 / 12 -year-olds, and for neutral pictures in 7 / 8 -year-olds. In Experiment 3, 11 / 12 -year-olds and adults had to imagine the standard survival scenario or an adapted survival condition (or pleasantness condition) that was designed to reduce the possibilities for elaborative processing. We found superior memory retention for both survival scenarios in children and adults. Collectively, our results evidently show that the survival processing advantage is developmentally invariant and that certain proximate mechanisms (elaboration and distinctiveness) underlie these developmental trends...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine children’s affective, cognitive, and {{behavioral}} responses to maternal feedback that varied with regard to content and tone. Participants were 62 children ages four to five years old (M = 59. 82 months, SD = 7. 35) recruited from local pre-schools, volunteer lists, and the medical school listserv. Children were read three stories in which the child did something (e. g., drawing, writing, building) and made a small mistake. They were randomly assigned to receive one of four types of feedback. The content of the feedback was either <b>neutral</b> or <b>negative,</b> and the tone was either <b>neutral</b> or <b>negative.</b> After hearing a story and receiving feedback, children answered a series of questions about their feelings, self-evaluation, expectations, and causes of the event, and about the mother’s feelings and evaluation of the child’s product. Mothers reported about their current level of depressive symptoms and their parenting behavior. Multiple regression analyses examined the main effects and two-way interactions of content (<b>neutral</b> vs. <b>negative),</b> and tone (<b>neutral</b> vs. <b>negative).</b> Separate analyses were conducted that included children’s age, maternal depression, and parenting as possible moderators. Results revealed that the content of mothers’ words affected children’s reported affect, cognitions, and behaviors, and these relations tended to vary by children’s age. Older children responded to neutral feedback more positively than younger children, and older children gave higher mother liking ratings in the neutral than in the negative content feedback conditions. Children receiving negatively toned feedback responded more helplessly to a puzzle task compared to those receiving neutrally toned feedback. Neither current maternal depressive symptoms nor parenting moderated the relations between condition and children’s responses.
