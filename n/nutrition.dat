5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} for a national survey on <b>nutrition.</b> Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators {{and a lack of}} support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on <b>Nutrition</b> and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work.|$|E
5|$|The food {{industry}} {{is also a}} major consumer of amino acids, in particular, glutamic acid, which {{is used as a}} flavor enhancer, and aspartame (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie artificial sweetener. Similar technology to that used for animal <b>nutrition</b> is employed in the human <b>nutrition</b> industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.|$|E
5|$|Though she officially {{retired in}} 1954, Morgan {{continued}} {{to come to}} the office for nearly the rest of her life. Just after Morgan's retirement, the University of California System decided to offer home economics only at the Davis and Santa Barbara campuses, and the <b>nutrition</b> program was continued at Berkeley. Forty of her papers were published after her retirement date. After suffering a heart attack in early July 1968, Morgan died on July 20. At the time of her death, she still headed the selection committee for new fellows of the American Institute of <b>Nutrition.</b>|$|E

25|$|A 1985, US National Research Council report {{entitled}} <b>Nutrition</b> Education in US Medical Schools {{concluded that}} <b>nutrition</b> education in medical schools was inadequate. Only 20% {{of the schools}} surveyed taught <b>nutrition</b> as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%. Membership by physicians in leading professional <b>nutrition</b> societies such as the American Society for <b>Nutrition</b> has generally declined from the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|UNICEF's <b>nutrition</b> program aims {{to improve}} child survival, growth and {{development}} through life-cycle <b>nutrition</b> security interventions. UNICEF's <b>nutrition</b> programs in the Philippines include: increasing access among pregnant and lactating women and children under 5 years old to interventions that prevent under-nutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies; treatment of acute malnutrition; sustaining positive <b>nutrition</b> behavior in vulnerable local government units; and supports the government in promoting breastfeeding and Infant and Young Child Feeding practices.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} {{development}} of these compounds, much more research has been conducted, and {{has been applied to}} human <b>nutrition</b> products in a similar manner to the animal <b>nutrition</b> experiments that pioneered the technology.

25|$|Canada's Food Guide {{is another}} example government-run <b>nutrition</b> program. Produced by Health Canada, the guide advises food quantities, {{provides}} education on balanced <b>nutrition,</b> and promotes physical activity in accordance with government-mandated nutrient needs. Like other <b>nutrition</b> programs around the world, Canada's Food Guide divides <b>nutrition</b> into four main food groups: vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives. It {{is interesting to note}} that, unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian guide references and provides alternative to meat and dairy, which {{can be attributed to the}} growing vegan and vegetarian movements.|$|E

25|$|School meals {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} the nutritional status of school-age children in a variety of ways. For example, there is a notable reduction in malnutrition via diet diversification and an increased absorption of micronutrients. Overall, the amount of kilocalories in a child's diet is expanded when they are given nutritional resources that they would otherwise have little to no access to. By increasing the amount of <b>nutrition</b> a child receives at school, that child's family's <b>nutrition</b> status also increases as their familial demand and requirement for food is decreased. Targeted take-home rations therefore increase the <b>nutrition</b> of the family as a whole, and not just the members of a given family that are of primary-school age. However, criticisms of school meals' impacts on <b>nutrition</b> stem from the idea that increased <b>nutrition</b> through school meals is only a temporary fix and does not target the underlying causes of malnutrition, such as high food prices and poor food distribution systems that prevent food security.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{jellyfish}} {{are most}} {{closely related to}} the spotted jellyfish (Mastigias papua) that inhabit the nearby lagoons. They are similar to the spotted jellyfish in that they derive part of their <b>nutrition</b> from symbiotic algae (Zooxanthellae) that live in their tissues and part of their <b>nutrition</b> from captured zooplankton.|$|E

25|$|Plant <b>nutrition</b> is {{the study}} of the {{chemical}} elements that are necessary for plant growth.
