40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the mechanical properties and the correlations of mechanical properties of a state-of-the-art nanostructured hardfacing filler metal deposited by SMAW process. The nanostructured hardfacing deposit was characterized as hypereutectic with high abrasion resistance due to the combination of presence of nanocarbides in a nanostructured matrix, high carbide volume fraction and high hardness. FE-SEM and BED were used to obtain the <b>Niobium</b> <b>carbides</b> at nanoscale which were around 91 nm. A carbide volume fraction of 5. 3 % for <b>Niobium</b> <b>carbides</b> at nanoscale was associated to the low mass loss obtained after performing the abrasion tests. Nonetheless, there was not any relationship between percentage of dilution and microstructure, since after evaluating the second layer-application the results {{very similar to those}} found in the single-layer application. The hardness of the deposit was around 1029 HV 2 on single-layer application was related to the presence of carbides. However, it explains the lack of relationship between hardness and welding parameters within the range stablished at the welding procedure specification. SEM images, allowed to characterize the cracks found as hot cracks which clearly stated the harmless impact on these kinds of welding applications. A comparison between the pin-on-disk results and the dry sand/rubber results and the results showed that the variation in mass loss was related to the nature of each abrasive test. Additional experiments were performed to achieve the differences in mass loss between base metal and the nanostructured hardfacing application for the pin-on-disk tests.

Thermodynamic calculations show that temperatures of the order of 1200 °C would be necessary to dissolve these coarse Nb-rich carbides so as to reprecipitate them as nanoparticles in the matrix.

The presence of fragile <b>niobium</b> <b>carbides</b> {{in the structure of}} the alloy was identified as the main cause of this situation, which originated as a result of the slow speed cooling. Because of large grain size compared to gauge length diameter, crystal orientation of individual grains also plays an important role.

Grain oriented with axis parallel to tensile direction has platelet carbides oriented perpendicular to the tensile axis. In that position carbides crack easily at low grain deformation.

In the present study, the effect of niobium and carbon additions on the ductility of a Fe 3 Al-type alloy is investigated. The constant-deflection mode of the small punch test is used to compare fracture properties and their temperature dependence in the alloy with different amounts of carbon.

50|$|These zones also act {{as local}} {{galvanic}} couples, causing local galvanic corrosion. This condition {{happens when the}} material is heated to temperature around 700 °C for too long time, and often happens during welding or an improper heat treatment. When zones of such material form due to welding, the resulting corrosion is termed weld decay. Stainless steels can be stabilized against this behavior by addition of titanium, niobium, or tantalum, which form titanium carbide, <b>niobium</b> <b>carbide</b> and tantalum carbide preferentially to chromium carbide, by lowering the content of carbon in the steel and in case of welding also in the filler metal under 0.02%, or by heating the entire part above 1000 °C and quenching it in water, leading to dissolution of the chromium carbide in the grains and then preventing its precipitation. Another possibility {{is to keep the}} welded parts thin enough so that, upon cooling, the metal dissipates heat too quickly for chromium carbide to precipitate. The ASTM A923, ASTM A262, and other similar tests are often used to determine when stainless steels are susceptible to intergranular corrosion.
