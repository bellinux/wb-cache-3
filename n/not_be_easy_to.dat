5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It {{is a place where}} you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

Nevertheless, progress on innovative materials and methodologies has been demonstrated with some patents granted about new nanomanufacturing devices for future commercial applications, which also progressively helps in the development towards nanorobots with the use of embedded nanobioelectronics concepts.|$|E

25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine {{ourselves}} {{to the effects of}} the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of the evil of the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.|$|E

He was aware of how different the two tracks were and said that it would be [...] "exciting" [...] to visit the city for the first time. His team wanted to maximise every detail feasible and could not wait to drive on the track. Mahindra driver Felix Rosenqvist stated that his target for the event was to continue the momentum his team built at the season's previous round. He wanted to extract the maximum amount possible from his car's package as soon as he could even at the cost of still learning slightly more about his vehicle. However, he was unsure whether the track's layout suited him because it required a different driving style and rhythm than in Hong Kong.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intent of}} a {{preventive}} strike on Pearl Harbor was to neutralize American naval {{power in the}} Pacific, thus removing it from influencing operations against American, British, and Dutch colonies. Successful attacks on colonies were judged to depend on successfully dealing with the Pacific Fleet. Planning had long anticipated a battle in Japanese home waters after the U.S. fleet traveled across the Pacific, under attack by submarines and other forces all the way. The U.S. fleet would be defeated in a [...] "decisive battle", as Russia's Baltic Fleet had been in 1905. A surprise attack posed a twofold difficulty compared to longstanding expectations. First, the Pacific Fleet was a formidable force, and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> defeat or to surprise. Second, Pearl Harbor's shallow waters made using conventional aerial torpedoes ineffective. On the other hand, Hawaii's distance meant a successful surprise attack could not be blocked or quickly countered by forces from the continental U.S.|$|E

An Islamic student association based in Lahore, Pakistan, handed out pamphlets requesting individuals to boycott Facebook; the pamphlet stated: [...] "The west is conspiring against the honour {{of the prophet}} and of Muslims.

[...] A representative of the Karachi-based Internet company Creative Chaos named Shakir Husain told The Guardian that a ban of Facebook would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> carry out due to the ability to circumvent it using tactics such as proxy servers. Husain noted, [...] "By banning this web page, it will just make people more curious. It's pouring petrol on a small fire that could become a lot bigger. You can't police the Internet. The Saudis have tried it, as have other governments, and all have failed. It's a waste of state money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Pieces of a Man {{received}} little critical attention, {{with the exception}} of the critical praise it received from Rolling Stone. Later, the album gained much critical acclaim, as it was praised for Scott-Heron's lyrical artistry and political awareness, and for its influence on modern hip hop. Despite little mainstream success or critical notice during the time of its release, music journalist Vince Aletti of Rolling Stone praised the album in a July 1972 article, stating [...] "Here is an album that needs discovering. It's strong, deeply soulful and possessed of that rare and wonderful quality in this time of hollow, obligatory [...] "relevance" [...] – intelligence.... the material is tough and real, [...] "relevant" [...] while avoiding, on the one hand, empty cliche and, on the other, fierce rhetoric, its own kind of cliche.... It may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find, but it's an involving, important album (especially so because of its successful and accessible use of jazz) and it's worth looking for." ...|$|E
