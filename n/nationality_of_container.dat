50|$|Article 4d {{provides}} that neither marriage nor {{dissolution of marriage}} shall automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> either spouse, nor shall a change <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> their spouse. Common practice among states {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was that a woman was to have the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a married woman was no longer dependent on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.|$|R

50|$|Many {{countries}} {{have in the}} past regarded marriage as an important status changing event in people's' lives and encouraged the special relationship that exists between spouses, sentiments which continue to be valued today. The common practice within and among states {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century was that a woman should have the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, and lose her previous nationality, often with the reciprocal recognition by the other country. Even after the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a married woman was no longer dependent on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and men becoming subject to military service obligations. There has been a shift towards a principle that neither marriage nor dissolution of marriage automatically affecting the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> either spouse, nor of a change <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by one spouse during marriage automatically affecting the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> their spouse. However, in many jurisdictions spouses can still obtain special and fast processing of applications for naturalisation.|$|R
40|$|This policy brief {{deals with}} loss of {{citizenship}} of the European Union (EU) due to the loss <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a Member State. To hold <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> an EU Member State is the master key to European citizenship. Only the nationals of a Member State possess European citizenship. Consequently, the loss <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a Member State also implies the loss of European citizenship. Due {{to the fact that}} Member States are in principle autonomous in nationality matters, their rules on loss <b>of</b> <b>nationality,</b> and implicitly loss of the citizenship of the European Union, differ considerably. However, Member States have to respect international law and general principles of European law when dealing with loss <b>of</b> <b>nationality...</b>|$|R
