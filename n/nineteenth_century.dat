5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father.

Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
