However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly. However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog is likely to take over the training session.|$|E

25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.|$|E

[...] Copsey concluded his review praising the song and Rihanna, writing [...] "Like Rihanna herself, it's hectic, confident and unashamedly sexual." [...] Meghan Brownfield for the Columbia Missourian praised the song as a track which people will want to dance to as well as writing that the lyrics ensure that the listener pays attention to the lyrics, saying [...] "It is a song you would hear in a club that everyone would want to dance to. This song makes you want to move, and it also has some strong lyrics that make you focus on what she is saying." [...] Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine, however, was critical of the song, writing that the song is a [...] "boring dubstep-normalizing dance number reminiscent of LMFAO," [...] as well as Rihanna's own [...] "We Found Love".|$|E

60|$|Indeed, as this {{observation}} suggests, {{it will be}} well, before tracing the mode in which exact science finally emerges from the merely approximate judgments of the senses, and showing the non-serial evolution of its divisions, to note the non-serial character of those preliminary processes of which all after development is a continuation.

That completeness of classification for which the unfolding of the perceptions paves the way, is impossible without a corresponding progress in language, by which greater varieties of objects are thinkable and expressible. On the one hand {{it is impossible to}} carry classification far without names by which to designate the classes; {{and on the other hand}} it is impossible to make language faster than things are classified.|$|E

Their competition, too, in several kinds of affairs will slowly but certainly provoke resentment, and moreover expose them to temptations which will distinctly lower the morality of their sex. All these changes, and many more having a similar effect and significance, are occurring with amazing rapidity, and the stated results are already visible to even the blindest observation.
