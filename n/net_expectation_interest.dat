40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the determinants of financial market participation. Financial market participation will be reasearched in a very broad context including stock market participation, savings, loans and credit, credit card usage/ownership, and insurance coverage. The drivers tested in this thesis include risk tolerance, optimism, <b>expectations,</b> safety <b>net</b> <b>expectations,</b> sensation seeking tendency, social capital, sociability and political preference. Furthermore, I research the impact of open-mindedness which has not priorly been investigated in this context. DATA The data used is from a comprehensive survey, the RISC Monitor 2009, conducted by TNS Finland during the first quarter of 2009. The final sample size is within the range of 3, 400 to 5, 000 respondents. RESULTS Various attitude and expectations-related determinants are found to have an impact on financial market participation. Especially interesting are the positive impact of social capital, risk tolerance and right-wing political orientation on stock market participation. On the other hand, a big contribution is the result indicating that positive safety <b>net</b> <b>expectations</b> lead to decreased stock ownership. There is no indication of sensation seeking, optimism or sociability having any influence on participation. Safety <b>net</b> <b>expectations</b> have a negative impact on savings while right-wing political orientation has a slight positive influence. Positive expectations are however found to have a positive impact on housing loans. Optimism and sensation seeking both have a positive effect on all types of loans. Risk tolerance and sensation seeking are found to lead to increased usage or ownership of credit cards while positive safety <b>net</b> <b>expectations</b> have a slight negative effect, contrary to what was hypothesized. Insurance coverage is decreased with risk tolerance and positive safety <b>net</b> <b>expectations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Citizen's Charter is {{essentially}} a charter for consumers of public services rather than a blueprint for enhancing the constitutional and political rights of the citizen. In the private sector, consumers {{of goods and services}} are protected by legislation governing the sales of goods which bestows entitlements upon them, and reinforces their <b>expectation</b> <b>interest.</b> The relationship between purchaser and provider is contractual so that if goods are faulty or the service does not match its description or the expectation of the consumer, there is an entitlement to seek redress in the form of exchange of goods, refund or damages. Whilst most public services cannot be so precise in content and objectives as private goods and services, the Citizen's and service charters nevertheless established an expectation {{on the part of the}} consumer that quality, choice, standards and value would be provided and that there would be redress in the form of compensation or, at the very least, an explanation and apology if the service did not meet expectations. Therefore it could be argued that an <b>expectation</b> <b>interest</b> was implicit in the use of a service reflecting the customer's ability to cite the objectives of the relevant charter in a dispute about a service received. This article explores the extent to which there is a legitimate <b>expectation</b> <b>interest</b> for the user of public services and examines how far New Labour's plans for strengthening the Charter enhance that <b>expectation</b> <b>interest</b> byfocusing on entitlements of citizenship, as well as consumerism...|$|R

The employment response of establishments to changing <b>net</b> employment <b>expectations</b> for the short-run is, primarily, suggestive of their reliance on fixed-term contracts as a buffer to cushion short-run changes in demand as well as to shield permanent workers from downward workforce adjustments. In contrast, their response to changes in <b>net</b> employment <b>expectations</b> for the long-run mostly hints on the use of fixed-term contracts as a screening device. Therefore, policies providing financial incentives to convert fixed-term into permanent contracts –thus targeting firms’ using fixed-term contracts as a screening device, are likely to only have limited effectiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effects of self-efficacy beliefs, parental outcome expectations, outcome <b>expectations,</b> and <b>interests</b> on Asian American college students 2 ̆ 7 career goals in the Investigative and Social career domains. Participants were 152 Asian American college students from five different state universities in the Midwestern United States. Separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted across gender and various career domains with self-efficacy beliefs, parental outcome expectations, self outcome <b>expectations,</b> and <b>interests</b> as predictor variables and career goals as a criterion variable. Findings indicated that the hypothesized effects of self-efficacy beliefs, parental outcome expectations, self outcome <b>expectations,</b> and <b>interests</b> on Asian American students 2 ̆ 7 career goals were different across gender and career domains, with a better fit in the Investigative (i. e., Math/Science) domain than in the Social domain. In the Investigative domain, the effects of all four predictor variables on career goals were significant for both genders. The effects of self outcome <b>expectations</b> and <b>interests</b> on career goals were direct, whereas the effects of self-efficacy and parental outcome expectations were indirect through self outcome expectations in the Investigative domain. In the Social domain, only parental outcome expectations, outcome <b>expectations,</b> and <b>interests</b> were significant predictors of female Asian American students 2 ̆ 7 career goals. For male Asian American students, interest was not a significant predictor of career goals in the Social domain. Across gender and career domains, the influence of parental outcome expectations on career goals was mediated by self outcome expectations. Self outcome expectation was the strongest predictor of Asian American students 2 ̆ 7 career goals in the Investigative and Social domains.

We document that along with the shifts in monetary policy regimes towards inflation targeting, expected monetary policy has become more important as a determinant of bank lending rates. Overall, our results provide support for the hypothesis that monetary policy has become more effective by successfully influencing private sector expectations.

The South African approach is in this way quite contrary to English law, where damages are preferred, and where specific performance is a special discretionary remedy that may be sought only in certain circumstances. A claim for specific performance may be for the payment of a sum of money (ad pecuniam solvendum), a claim {{for the performance of}} some positive act other than payment of money (ad factum praestandum) or a claim to enforce a negative obligation.|$|R

While specific performance can be in the form of any type of forced action, it is usually to complete a previously established transaction, thus being the most effective remedy in protecting the <b>expectation</b> <b>interest</b> of the innocent party to a contract. It is usually the opposite of a prohibitory injunction, but there are mandatory injunctions that have a similar effect to specific performance.|$|R

Boot-strapping procedures revealed that the relationships between social class, self-efficacy, and outcome expec-tations were mediated through learning experiences. Furthermore, the relationship between social supports and goals was mediated by self-efficacy and interests and the relationships between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and goals were mediated by interests. Contrary to hypotheses, the relationship between barriers and goals was not mediated by self-efficacy and interests.

40|$|Restatement Second of Contracts {{provided}} that contract law serves to protect {{one or more}} of three interests: the <b>expectation</b> <b>interest,</b> the reliance interest, and the restitution interest. There is, however a fourth interest that contract law should and does protect: the disgorgement interest, which is the promisee 2 ̆ 7 s interest in requiring the promisor to disgorge a gain that was made possible by the promisor 2 ̆ 7 s breach, but did not consist of a benefit conferred on the promisor by the promisee. It is not clear why Restatement Second excluded the disgorgement interest. Perhaps the drafters believed that this position was compelled by positive law. That proposition, however, would have been doubtful even when Restatement Second was published, and it is clearly wrong today: some appellate cases, and a handful of trial court cases, have denied protection to the disgorgement interest, but a dozen or so American appellate cases, as well as cases decided by the highest courts of several other common law jurisdictions, have afforded such protection. Alternatively, the drafters of Restatement Second may have believed that the disgorgement interest should not be protected as a normative matter That proposition also cannot be supported. On the contrary, there are strong efficiency reasons, as well as moral reasons, for protecting the disgorgement interest, because in certain categories of cases, protection of that interest in contract law is necessary to provide efficient incentives to the promisor, to effectuate contracts, or to prevent unjust enrichment. Of course, the disgorgement interest should not be protected in all cases in which a promise is legally enforceable, any more than the reliance interest, the restitution interest, or for that matter the <b>expectation</b> <b>interest</b> are protected in all cases.
