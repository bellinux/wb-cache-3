A common, shared terminology service, providing proper interface both for human and machine clients seemed to be the proper tool towards conceptual consistency (later interoperability) among the different systems, notably ensuring transparency and cross-search ability in the quickly accumulating <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> related data, information and knowledge. There will be internal and external machine clients of the terminology service, as the <b>new</b> European <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> surveillance system (TESSy), the epidemics intelligence supporting information systems (EPIS, TTT 3), the ECDC WEB site, the Eurosurveillance journal, the Knowledge and Information service (KISatECDC 4) etc. The human users will be internal and external experts, the public health and the <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> scientific community.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for integrated, sustainable; and cost-effective approaches to the management of infectious diseases. For example, an emerging disease in one country may already be endemic in another country but nearing elimination in a third. A coordinated approach by WHO towards infectious diseases is therefore needed that will facilitate more effective support of on-going efforts for the prevention and control of endemic diseases, intensify efforts against those diseases targeted for eradication and elimination, and result in better preparedness and response to new and re-emerging diseases. In order to meet these challenges, WHO has created a <b>new</b> Programme on <b>Communicable</b> <b>Diseases</b> (CDS), which will replace the former Division of Emerging and other <b>Communicable</b> <b>Diseases</b> (EMC). The <b>new</b> Programme will better integrate surveillance, prevention, control, and research over the whole spectrum of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> CDS will function as focal point for global data and information exchange on infectious diseases, and inter alia, will reinforce laboratory-based surveillance of bacterial, viral, and zoonotic diseases to ensure early detection of threats to international public health.

40|$|Surveillance and {{diagnosis}} of <b>new</b> and emerging <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in remote regions, {{such as the}} Amazon, is a challenging task. These regions {{can be difficult to}} reach, are sparsely populated, and have limited medical and ICT infrastructure. Medical practitioners and community health agents who work in such regions often have very basic qualifications, and therefore have limited knowledge of new and emerging diseases. The increasing capabilities of mobile devices, such as tablets and smart phones, have made them a useful platform for delivery of medical services in remote locations. In this paper we introduce a system that could potentially support {{diagnosis of}} vector-borne diseases such as Bartonellosis and Leishmaniasis in areas where specialist healthcare is scarce.

To build this capacity, for > 35 years the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has worked with countries around the globe to develop Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs). FETP trainees conduct surveillance activities and outbreak investigations in service to ministry of health programs to prevent and control infectious diseases of global health importance such as polio, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.

40|$|Abstract Once epidemic, {{tuberculosis}} has reemerged, {{often in}} newly drug-resistant forms. This public health threat calls for strong public action {{as well as}} improved private care. Action has been hampered by failures in public health infrastructure and legal-philosophical support for government intervention. Josephine Gittler's ac-companying article usefully suggests rebuilding public-health agencies and adapting traditional authority and controls {{from the age of}} epidemics to takc account of today's circumstances and sensibilities. Most of us comfortably assume that medical science defeated tuberculosis years ago. Wrong. As Josephine Gittler explains in this issue of JHPPL, <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases,</b> especially TB, once loomed very large in Ameri-can life-and death. Addressing such contagion is a core function of public health. Over time, better public health measures and curative drug therapy, along with better living conditions, drastically curbed the spread and toll of such disease. Alas, success bred complacency, and by the early 1980 s fiscal limitations and privatizing zeal further undercut public interest in public health. Then came HIVIAIDS. This wholly <b>new</b> scourge put <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> back into the public agenda and sparked intense debates about what public health controls, if any, are appropriate. Now comes TB. This old threat has reemerged, increasingly in newly predominant strains of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Too many patients lack access to private medical care, for reasons of finance and location of providers. Too many physicians, who seldom see TB, misprescribe therapy. Too many patient...|$|R

40|$|<b>Communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> are a {{significant}} cause of lost time for the mining workforce in Papua New Guinea and in many other developing nations. Risk management is widely accepted within the mining industry as leading practice in managing occupational health and safety. The purpose of this thesis {{was to develop a}} methodology for evaluating risk management systems that deal with <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> and to apply and validate this methodology through case studies of the Ok Tedi, Porgera and Lihir mining operations in Papua New Guinea. Literature research topics include risk management system frameworks, risk management processes, maturity models and context for the case studies relating to both Papua <b>New</b> Guinea and <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> The culmination of the risk management and maturity model literature research was the establishment of development parameters for a risk management maturity model within the context of managing <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in the PNG mining industry. A major contribution to knowledge of the study is the development of a risk management maturity model which is aligned with the framework and process elements of the ISO 31000 : 2009 risk management guidelines and utilises the most rigorously developed and proven maturity journey type identified in the literature (the CMMI and BPMM maturity model journey). The risk management maturity model developed may be applied to evaluating the maturity of risk management systems in line with the international standard. The field research component of the study involved analysis of documentation of the occupational health and safety and medical management systems in place at the Ok Tedi, Porgera and Lihir mining operations to enable evaluation of maturity. Cross case analysis is presented which compares the sites and identifies themes arising from the maturity evaluations across the sites. Comparative analysis is also presented which investigates the relationships between the maturity of each element of the risk management system within each site and compares these relationships across the three sites. The results of the cross case analyses provide some validation for the structure and content of the maturity model and identify key practices at the three sites which contributed towards higher levels of maturity to enable clear sharing of lessons learnt from the case studies...|$|R

40|$|Background: In many {{countries}} public and political interest {{exists on the}} <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects of prison crowding, prompting standards on minimum floor area of sleeping accommodation per person. Yet the extent and reliability of the worldwide evidence on the association between prison cell spatial density and <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> is uncertain. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature for articles that reported on the association between prison cell spatial density and <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects in prisoners. Included studies were assessed for quality. A draft report was peer-reviewed by an independent researcher. Some revisions were made in light of reviewer comments. Findings: 3, 532 articles were identified and 6 were included. Studies were conducted in the US (1980 s), Pakistan (2003) and Nigeria (2012, 2013). <b>Communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects/outcomes included pneumococcal disease/acute pneumonia, mycobacterium tuberculosis, infectious skin conditions, and <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> reporting to the prison clinic. There was mostly consistent evidence that cell spatial density is associated with <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> The associations and statistical precision observed suggest a â€˜slightâ€™ <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> impact of cell spatial density on prisoners. However, {{it is possible that}} these associations are due to confounding, bias and/or chance. Conclusion: The evidence provides some support that <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects are associated with cell spatial density but care should be taken in the interpretation of the findings.

40|$|Background: Although notable {{advances}} in disease prevention have been accomplished, <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> are still important {{at the international}} scale. Many epidemiologic {{studies have been conducted}} about the epidemiology of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in Iran, but less {{attention has been paid to}} generating an atlas of all disease. Some experts believe that mapping diseases such as malaria is the first step toward establishing early warning systems and managing disease control. In this manuscript, we tried to gather information about the <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> of Iran in a geo-database, and draw maps with high accuracy. Methods: Initially reportable cases of diseases were gathered from the Iranian <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> control center. Then, these data were arranged in a geo-referenced database in the Arc-GIS software and then the related maps were generated. Results: Twenty five maps of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> were created in 2008. Some diseases like malaria had considerable foci and some other disease according to their condition did not have a considerable dispersion. Conclusion: Although the history of preparing an atlas of diseases goes back to the 19 th century, papers about mapping diseases in Iran are restricted to single diseases or these atlases are not easily accessible.
