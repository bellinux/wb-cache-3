We investigated the suitability of this method to characterize the effects of two silver nanomaterials and a soluble silver salt.

The results were compared with substrate-induced respiration (OECD TG 217). Results: The standard <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> test using lucerne meal suggested that the test materials had no effect, whereas significant effects were identified with the other two test procedures. The absence of effects with lucerne meal probably reflected the sorption of silver ions to the additional organic nitrogen source, thus reducing its bioavailability, or blocking the silver nanomaterial oxidation sites by sorption of organic matter. Conclusions: This common test used in the context of chemical registration is therefore unsuitable for the detection of potential effects caused by silver nanomaterials and soluble silver salts because it can yield false negative results. We instead recommend the use of an inorganic nitrogen source. The observed effects were not specific to nanomaterials. The time course of the effect in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> test based on (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and the potential ammonium oxidation test varied according to the test substance, indicating different kinetic behaviors of ion release...|$|E

40|$|Seawater {{microbes}} as well {{as those}} associated with macrobiota are increasingly recognized as a key feature affecting nutrient cycling. Tidepools are ideal natural mesocosms to test macrofauna and microbe interactions, and we quantified rates of microbial nitrogen processing using tracer enrichment of ammonium (15 N NH 4) or nitrate (15 N NO 3) when tidepools were isolated from the ocean during low intertidal periods. Experiments were conducted during both day and night {{as well as}} in control tidepools and those from which mussels had been removed, allowing us to determine the role of both mussels and daylight in microbial nitrogen processing. We paired time series observations of 15 N enrichment in NH 4 +, NO 2 − and NO 3 − with a differential equation model to quantify multiple, simultaneous <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformations.</b> Mussel presence and daylight increased remineralization and photosynthetic nitrogen uptake. When we compared ammonium gain or loss that was attributed to any tidepool microbes vs. photosynthetic uptake, microbes accounted for 32  % of this ammonium flux on average. Microbial transformations averaged 61  % of total nitrate use; thus, microbial activity was almost 3 times that of photosynthetic nitrate uptake. Because it accounted for processes that diluted our tracer, our differential equation model assigned higher rates of nitrogen processing compared to prior source–product models. Our in situ experiments showed that animals alone elevate microbial <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformations</b> by 2 orders of magnitude, suggesting that coastal macrobiota are key players in complex microbial <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformations...</b>|$|R

Natural zeolite and nitrification inhibitor (NI) are widely used during composting and land application for nitrogen conservation, respectively. Three composting reactors (A-the control, B-natural zeolite addition, and C- 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) addition) were established to investigate the influence of NI and natural zeolite addition on organics degradation and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> during sludge composting conducted at the lab scale. The results showed that, in comparison with the control, natural zeolite addition accelerated organics degradation and the maturity of sludge compost was higher, while the DMPP addition slowed down the degradation of organic matters. Meanwhile, the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> functional genes including those responses for nitrification (amoA and nxrA) and denitrification (narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ) were quantified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) to investigate the effects of natural zeolites and DMPP addition on <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation.</b> Although no significant difference in the abundance of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> functional genes was observed between treatments, addition of both natural zeolite and DMPP increases the final total nitrogen content by 48. 6 % and 23. 1 %, respectively.

In this study, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformations</b> in intensive laboratory-scale Chinese catfish (Clarias fuscus) aquaculture systems were investigated by identifying and quantifying N 2 O emissions. Results indicated that about 1. 3 % of the nitrogen input was emitted as N 2 O gas. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and feeding rates had significant effects on N 2 O emissions. Higher N 2 O emissions were obtained in aquaculture systems with lower DO concentrations and higher feeding rates. Both nitrification and denitrification appeared to be responsible for the emissions of N 2 O. Key factors which correlated with the N 2 O emission rate in aquaculture systems were NO 2 -, DO and total ammonia nitrogen concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

We found that the test is unsuitable for the detection of effects caused by silver nanomaterials and soluble silver salts, suggesting that the deficiency relates not to the testing of nanomaterials but substances that release soluble ions in significant amounts that are the basis of the observed toxicity. We therefore recommended an incubation period of the soil of at least 28 days according to OECD TG 216 and the use of an inorganic nitrogen source instead of organic nitrogen or the periodical measurement of potential ammonium oxidation instead of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> [4]. Finally the effect development time course in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> test with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and the potential ammonium oxidation activity test may provide a useful indicator for the stability of silver nanomaterials, although additional experiments are required to characterize this relationship in more detail.|$|E
40|$|Two main transformations {{occur in}} water environments [...] one {{due to the}} effect of {{microorganisms}} and the other due to chemical reactions. Both transformations are very closely interwoven. Of the transformation processes in the water environment, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> is perhaps the most interesting because nitrogen and its compounds (both organic and mineral), affect the development of practically all aquatic microorganisms and therefore determine the trophic state and the quality of a water environment. Nitrogen compounds are present in sewage and other waste water discharged into water bodies. Therefore, it is quite understandable why during the last few years <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> is the subject of study at descriptive and experimental levels, as well as by mathematical modeling techniques. This paper reports on the results of a collaborative study between IIASA and the Institute of Experimental Biology and Ecology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Bratislava, on nitrogen transformations. The data of twelve experiments covering a broad set of initial conditions in nitrogen concentrations and at two temperatures (180 degrees Celsius and 120 degrees Celsius) are presented in this report.

40|$|Oxygen minimum {{zones are}} {{expanding}} globally, and at present account for around 20 - 40 % of oceanic nitrogen loss. Heterotrophic denitrification and anammox-anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite-are {{responsible for most}} nitrogen loss in these low-oxygen waters. Anammox is particularly significant in the eastern tropical South Pacific, {{one of the largest}} oxygen minimum zones globally. However, the factors that regulate anammox-driven nitrogen loss have remained unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive nitrogen budget for the eastern tropical South Pacific oxygen minimum zone, using measurements of nutrient concentrations, experimentally determined rates of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> and a numerical model of export production. Anammox was the dominant mode of nitrogen loss at the time of sampling. Rates of anammox, and related nitrogen transformations, were greatest in the productive shelf waters, and tailed off with distance from the coast. Within the shelf region, anammox activity peaked in both upper and bottom waters. Overall, rates of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation,</b> including anammox, were strongly correlated with the export of organic matter. We suggest that the sinking of organic matter, and thus the release of ammonium into the water column, together with benthic ammonium release, fuel nitrogen loss from oxygen minimum zones...|$|E
40|$|As filter feeders, sponges {{are highly}} {{integrated}} with their environment. Many sponges also host diverse communities of bacteria, including many that are hypothesized {{to carry out}} a variety of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformations.</b> The presence of these bacteria makes sponges {{an integral part of the}} nitrogen cycle in their habitats and suggests that sponges are an excellent bioindicator of environmental conditions. To test these hypotheses, we collected sponge tissue from two Oregon estuaries and extracted microbial DNA from these samples. To assess bacterial diversity, we performed Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) on a fragment of the 16 S gene. We also examined nitrogen cycling in sponges by examining the sponge samples for the presence of the amoA and nirS genes, which encode for enzymes in the nitrification and denitrification pathways, respectively. DGGE results showed diverse bacterial communities, with clear differences between the sites. The results also showed little variation within sites, but were suggestive of seasonal variation. Both functional genes were present in all five species of sponge that we collected. These results suggest that sponges and their associated bacterial communities play a critical role in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformations</b> within these bays and that these sponge-associated bacterial communities are bioindicators of environmental variation...|$|R

Two types of undulating littoral zones were selected: natural reed belt and bare lakeshore. The reed belt affected <b>nitrogen</b> <b>transformation</b> and was sink for internal-lake nitrogen, whereas the bare lakeshore showed little effect. During the growing season, NO(3) (-) -N concentration increased {{by up to}} 3 - 5 times from open water to reed belt, while NH(4) (+) -N concentration decreased. It suggested that nitrification was the main nitrogen process in reed belt.

Significant temporal variation of dissolved nitrogen occurred and was similar in both the littoral zone and the open water. Maximum TDN and NH(4) (+) -N concentrations occurred in January, and NO(3) (-) -N in March. Minimum NH(4) (+) -N and NO(3) (-) -N concentrations occurred in July and August, respectively.
