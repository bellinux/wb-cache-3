40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{development}} of recent footpath projects in Japan. These projects commonly intend to promote local empowerment : attracting visitors who could enjoy beautiful landscapes or experience {{the life of}} people in each area by walking through footpaths, facilitating access to original sightseeing spots, and stimulating local residents to rediscover the fascination of their life and the imagination for local development through the communication with the visitors. Our case study on six footpath projects in Honshu and Hokkaido verified that they actually had those merits of recreation, easy access, and rediscovery for local empowerment. The key to understanding the development and problems of the footpath projects is to highlight the social structure composed of “two axes” and “four actors”. The two axes correspond {{to the number of}} <b>residents</b> and <b>land</b> <b>owners</b> around footpaths, and the level of involvement of local governments in the footpath projects. Four actors are local governments, community action groups including NPOs and voluntary organizations, local residents, and visitors, each of which has been involved in footpath projects with different standpoints and values. According to dispositions of four actors on two axes, the development of the six footpath projects can be divided into two types. The first type of footpath projects, especially shown in Honshu cases, was originally planned and formed by local governments {{as a part of the}} local development policy. Then, they promoted the projects by asking community action groups or local residents for participation, and providing administrative shared resource or money. On the contrary, the founders and facilitators of the second type footpath projects were the voluntary groups formed by local <b>residents</b> and <b>land</b> <b>owners,</b> which was clearly shown in two Hokkaido cases. Their main purpose on the projects is to share their lifestyle or the greatness of their area with visitors. In the process of their development, both types of footpath projects confronted same difficulties in negotiation with other <b>residents</b> and <b>land</b> <b>owners</b> around the footpath courses. To relieve their concerns over privacy and security, the facilitators must spend enormous time and effort persuading them or reinforcing patrols of footpaths...|$|R

The interests of <b>residents,</b> <b>land</b> <b>owners,</b> farmers, farmer cooperatives, and local communities have been taken into account regarding conservation but conflicting interests remain. Even though the Mexican government designated the area as a biosphere reserve most of {{the area of the}} preserve is owned by 38 ejidos, seven indigenous communities and 16 private holdings.The survival of the species depends on a large number of habitats from Canada, the United States and Mexico during its annual migration cycle. The three countries adopted a plan in 2008 for the conservation of the butterfly’s habitat through its migration routes. Within the Biosphere in Mexico, the greatest threats to the butterfly habitat are deforestation, illegal logging, unorganized tourism, forest fires and lack of cooperation among various authorities. Most of these dangers come from the surrounding human settlements, which put pressure on the natural areas to provide agricultural space and forestry products such as fuel and wood for manufacturing furniture and other crafts. The main human communities in the area are Contepec, Temascalcingo, Angangueo, Ocampo, San Felipe del Progreso, Zitácuaro, Villa de Allende and Donato Guerra. The closest urban center is Zitácuaro, whose growth has promoted the growth of the other, more rural settlements.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} {{methods of}} the sawmill {{owned and operated by}} James Dickson & Co became headline news in Sweden when the manager and director of the company, James Dickson Jr, was taken to court on 15 June 1850, accused of encouraging his suppliers upstream to supply him with logs that did not belong to them. Dickson's defence was {{that he did not know}} that a large part of the logs that the sawmill was processing belonged to the Crown. The Crown was, however, said to be well aware of the fact that much of the wealth the sawmill was creating for local <b>residents</b> and <b>land</b> <b>owners,</b> for which the local population was very grateful, came from illegal felling of timber on Crown land. By swearing to his honesty and his lack of knowledge of what had happened Dickson was able to escape a conviction, which was allowed under Swedish law at that time, in cases where all evidence was circumstantial.|$|R
