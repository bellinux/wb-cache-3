According to the method of water requirement in depth, the {{quantity of}} irrigation water was 14. 6 mm/day (61, 000 m^s/day) by testing evapotranspiration and percolation, and calculating the equation of Thornthwaite, but the <b>net</b> <b>duty</b> of water was assumed 24 mm/day (81, 600 m^ 3 /day) in consideration of the safety factor for water loss and seepage of the groundwater. The <b>net</b> <b>duty</b> of water obtained by this method was corresponded to the reslt gained by the water balance law, therefore, optimum duty of water (81, 600 m^ 3 /day) in this area have dicreased by approximately 34, 400 m^ 3 /day (29. 7 %) {{in comparison with the}} result (116, 000 m^ 3 /day) in 1972. Nevertheless, the paddy field area has only decreased by 12. 8 % (from 390 ha to 340 ha) during these three years.

50|$|The {{instrument}} {{parameters and}} data yield implied a 3 σ point source sensitivity of 30 UFU in one day's operation (1 UFU = 2.66−12 erg/cm2-s-keV). Each detector was about 0.1 {{of the area}} of the Uhuru instrument. The instrument background at low geomagnetic latitudes was ~16 counts/s. Of this background, ~6 counts/s comes from the diffuse cosmic X-ray background, with the rest being instrumental. Assuming a conservative 10% data return, the <b>net</b> source <b>duty</b> cycle in scanning mode was 1.4 × 10−3, implying a source exposure of 120 seconds per day. For a background of 16 counts/s, the 3 σ error in determining the flux from a given sky bin was then 4.5 counts/s, or about 45 UFU, after 1 day. A limiting sensitivity of 30 UFU was obtained by combining both detectors. A comparable error existed in the flux determination for moderately bright galactic sources. Source confusion due to the 5° FOV projected along the scan direction complicated the observation of sources in the galactic bulge region (approximately 30° > l > -30°, |b| < 10°).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESISInitial Design of a Dual Fluidized Bed ReactorbyMinyoung YunMaster of Science, Graduate Program in Chemical and Environmental EngineeringUniversity of California, Riverside, March 2014 Dr. Joseph Norbeck, ChairpersonSteam hydro-gasification (SH) {{of biomass}} holds great {{potential}} to produce transportable and storable fuels to replace fossil fuel. There {{is a critical}} task which {{needs to be addressed}} in order to scale up the process. SH is an endothermic reaction which requires external heat to operate. The use of two highly coupled reactors: one for SH and the other for combustion of solid feedstock may provide sufficient and efficient heat management and produce an outlet product with high carbon conversion. A dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasifier has been selected for this purpose. A cold mode DFB was built with acrylic plastic to simulate the gasifier in order to develop insight for the optimization of the reactor for SH. This is the main objective of my thesis. Hydrodynamics tests were carried out to better understand the solid flow behavior in the cold mode DFB. The mixing test found that the gases from two reactors within the cold DFB mixed in the fast bed. The mixing level decreased with increase in the gas velocity in the fast bed and the BFB. Also the degree of gas mixing decreased with the increase in solid inventory. The hydrodynamics test found that increase in the gas velocity in the fast bed and the BFB leads to increase in the solid holdup in the fast bed. This same trend was observed with the three sizes of sand. Design modifications are made to improve the design of DFB for SH based on the cold model studies. Heat and mass balance of SH in the DFB was calculated using the aspen plus simulation tool. Combustion of 13. 8 % of char from SH produces the required heat for SH with the <b>net</b> heat <b>duty</b> of - 0. 4 kw, when 1 dry ton/ day of pine wood is fed into SHR. The results of these studies are presented in the thesis and will {{contribute to the development of}} the dual fluidized bed reactor optimized for SH with a potential for commercialization of the process...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing the {{importance}} of cooperatives in development, a bill which sets the comprehensive guidelines pertaining to the operations {{of all types of}} cooperatives, has been finally signed into law. A related bill creating the Cooperative Development Authority (CODA) in charge of registration and regulation of cooperatives, has also been signed into law. 1 / These laws, especially the one pertaining to the operations of the cooperative or the cooperative code, pose a question as to how the entire cooperative movement, specifically generally adopted the existing policies and procedures like the registration requirements, allocation of <b>net</b> surplus, <b>duties</b> and rights of the members, tax treatment, objectives of the cooperatives, capitalization, etc., which are already being followed by the cooperative movement. It is interesting to note, however, that the Code formally "acknowledges" that cooperative unions may assist the national and local governments in the latter's development activities in their respective jurisdictions. It also highlights special provisions for agrarian reform cooperatives, public service cooperatives, cooperative banks, cooperative insurance societies, and credit cooperatives. The final product of the two recently enacted laws on the cooperative movement has yet to be determined since the specific guidelines have not yet been formulated. But the guidelines which will concretize the provisions in the laws can help spur or retard the growth of the cooperative movement. This is where understanding the behavior of the different segments of the cooperative movement counts a lot in the formulation of such guidelines. Unfortunately, however, there only very few studies which can help us understand the behavior of the various segments of the cooperative movement. A man on the street usually associates any cooperative with the past failures of so many government-sponsored cooperatives that had been ubiquitously mentioned in the press. If limited to this set of knowledge, one can reasonably expect the kind of guidelines which would emerge from the laws. That is, the guidelines would aim at policing, instead of promoting, the cooperative movement. This study, therefore, tries to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} behavior of one segment of the cooperative movement. The cooperative credit union (CCU) system was chosen because it is the most successful of all types of cooperatives. Yet, its role in the financial markets has not-yet been fully understood nor appreciated...|$|R

Chinese customs data are used to construct, for the first time, quarterly unit value and volume series that are then used to estimate foreign trade income and price elasticities. The estimated export supply price elasticities are negative and became even more negative after the reforms in 1985. The import price elasticity {{is very close to}} minus one. These results suggest that administrative controls still have a dominant effect on China’s trade and may also suggest that reforms in the management system of Chinese enterprises were not sufficient to create profit maximizing behavior by managers.
