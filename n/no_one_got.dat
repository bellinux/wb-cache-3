If {{the young}} people hadn't been at a crowded public dance overseen by extensive security (19 guards were at CHAC on Saturday night) where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>got</b> hurt, the kids would likely have been out at unchaperoned and completely unregulated house parties—not after the dance, but all night. And, without a fat calendar of all-ages events, that's {{where they would be}} every weekend. Because without organized all-ages dances and live-music events, house parties and parking lots are all kids have.|$|E

Next, he gave it to volunteers who had never had polio before. They all began to produce antibodies, with previously infected people creating a high amount of them.

2500|$|When {{it first}} launched, the company offered one [...] "Groupon" [...] {{per day in}} each of the markets it served. The Groupon worked as an {{assurance}} contract using ThePoint's platform: if a certain number of people signed up for the offer, then the deal became available to all; if the predetermined minimum was not met, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>got</b> the deal that day. This reduces risk for retailers, who can treat the coupons as quantity discounts as well as sales promotion tools. In the early years before revenue splits began to adjust as necessary, Groupon made money by keeping approximately half the money the customer pays for the coupon. Currently, that split can vary depending on many factors.|$|E

60|$|When we came {{to start}} from the station on our run to London, we {{reflected}} {{that there were a}} great many of these bicyclers, and that they would probably crowd us in our third-class compartment. So, as we had bought an excellent supper in baskets, such as they send you on the trains everywhere in England, and wished to eat it in quiet, we sought out the guard who was lurking near for the purpose, and bribed him to shut us into that compartment, and not let any one else in. There we remained in darkness, with our curtains drawn, and when, near train-time, the bicyclers began to swarm about the carriages, we heard them demanding admittance to our compartment from our faithful guard, if that is the right way to call him. He turned them away with soft answers, answers so very soft that we could not make out what he said, but he seemed to be inviting them into other compartments, which he doubtless pretended were better. The murmurs would die away, and then rise again, {{and from time to time}} we knew that a baffled bicycler was pulling at our door, or vainly bumping against it. We listened with our hearts in our mouths; but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>got</b> in, and the train started, and we opened our baskets and began to eat and to drink, like two aristocrats or plutocrats. What made our inhuman behavior worse was that we were really nothing of the kind, but both professed friends of the common people. The story might show that when it comes to a question of selfishness men are all alike ready to profit by the unjust conditions. However, it must be remembered that those people were only bicyclers. If we could have conceived of them as masses we should have known them for brothers, and let them in, probably.|$|E
