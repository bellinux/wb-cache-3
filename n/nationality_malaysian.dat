40|$|Concern {{about privacy}} is an {{important}} consideration for users of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT), particularly when using computer-mediated communication (CMC), i. e. Internet usage. Several researchers have studied privacy issues by taking into account the views of users to include individuals, organisations, privacy policy makers, governments and trust organisations. This thesis investigates whether an individual’s perspectives about privacy are culturally relevant when using the Internet. This research used a survey {{in the form of a}} questionnaire in two countries, namely, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia to compare online privacy perspectives of young and mature (male and female) Saudi and Malaysian students. The research examines the relationship of the effect of the cultural background including the effect of social norms, religious belief, Internet regulation and IT skills of these Internet users upon their attitude towards privacy online and their perspectives about privacy. It also examines the effect of <b>nationality</b> (<b>Malaysian</b> and Saudi), gender and age groups. In this study, online privacy perspectives are a synthesis of three perceptions; what is ‘personal’ information online, the online privacy concerns and the Internet trust, whereby the cultural effects are the effect of religious beliefs, social norms, Internet regulation and IT skills in the privacy attitudes of keeping personal information safe, caring about their and others’ privacy online and when revealing personal information. The demographic factors in this research are nationality, gender and age. To study these relationships, the research uses t-test, ANOVA, and single regression methods as data analysis techniques. The results show that the level of concern and degree of trust exhibited by Malaysian students with regard to submitting personal information via the Internet was affected the most by their gender, and social norms upon their online privacy attitudes. For Saudi students, the level of concern and trust with regard to submitting personal information via the Internet was found to be related to the effect of their age, gender, and religious beliefs on their online privacy attitudes. The other cultural factors, i. e. Internet regulation in force in each country and the IT skills of participants, are likely to have equal effects on both Malaysian and Saudi privacy perspectives. This research adds the cultural background, age and gender effects to the model of the calculus of the privacy concern that is proposed by Dinev and Hart (2006, pp. 63 - 64). The research also establishes what is ‘private’ in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, by identifying “what counts as personal information with regard to Internet users” and provides a comparison in this concept between the two countries, their gender and age groups. For examples, Malaysian students consider name, e-mail address, date of birth, nationality and religion as ‘personal’ information and Saudi students consider home address, phone number, photographic image and credit card number as ‘personal’ information. In addition Saudi females tend to consider, particularly, home address, phone number, and photographic image as ‘personal’ information more than Saudi males. These findings should help both web designers and Internet policy makers in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia to consider these cultural effects when designing the privacy policies of their websites...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{quantitative}} study {{looking at the}} passengers‘ awareness and perception on airport safety and security measures and procedures (ASMP) related to demographic factors. This current study is also looking at the difference between passengers with <b>Malaysian</b> <b>nationality</b> and passengers with non-Malaysian nationality in term of the awareness of ASMP in general, ASMP after 9 / 11, readiness of airport security service in handling unlawful acts, and consistency of ASMP among airports. A total of 100 passengers with international destination (22 <b>Malaysian</b> <b>nationality</b> and 78 non-Malaysians) at sterile area of the satellite building of Kuala Lumpur International Airport were selected via simple random sampling method {{to participate in this}} study. The scale for passengers‘ perception and awareness on ASMP was self-developed by the researcher, and statistical methods like t-test, gamma test, Cramers‘ V and Phi were utilized to test the hypotheses. Internal consistency reliability scores (Cronbach‘s alpha) were found to be above. 60. Results showed that passengers with <b>Malaysian</b> <b>nationality</b> are significantly more aware of ASMP, both in general (p =. 02) or after 9 / 11 (p =. 00) compared to passengers from other nationality. It was also found that compared to passengers from other <b>nationality,</b> <b>Malaysians</b> passengers are significantly more aware on the readiness of airport security service in KLIA to confront any unlawful acts (. 00) and they were also more aware on the consistency of ASMP among airports (. 00). Out of several demographic factors studied in this research in term of their relationship with perception on ASMP, it was found that gender was the one with no significant relationship with the perception of ASMP (p =. 883). Age group is strongly and significantly related to the perception of ASMP (gamma =. 849; p =. 00), while marital status is also significantly related to the perception of ASMP (p =. 00). Meanwhile, educational level and perception of ASMP have very weak and insignificant relationship (gamma =. 129; p=. 414). Perception of ASMP and ethnicity have significant relationship (Phi =. 665; Cramer‘s V =. 470; p =. 00). While being Malaysians and Non-Malaysians have no significant difference in term of the perception of ASMP (p =. 809), frequency of air-travels was strongly and significantly related to the passenger perception of ASMP (gamma =. 616; p =. 00), as well as income level (gamma =. 784; p =. 00) ...|$|R

These participants were undergraduate medical students, and their participation was purely on a voluntary basis. The students belonged to three different Malaysian ethnic races, i.e., Malays, Chinese, and Indians (Malaysian Indians). The study was done after obtaining ethical clearance from the institutional ethics committee (IEC No: 348 / 2016).

This study examined the state of national pride of Malaysian youth based on the degree of their pride in owning a Malaysian identity card. Primary data were gathered from a field survey of 1500 randomly sampled Malaysian youth aged between 15 and 30 distributed over all of the fourteen states. Results of the statistical analysis showed that over 90 per cent of youths from all zones, states, religions, ethnic groups and ages were proud of having a Malaysian identity card and wanted to be known as a <b>Malaysian</b> <b>nationality.</b> This augured well for the continuation of existing patriotism programmes...|$|R

Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk presents an opposing view, arguing that stereotypes are common but [...] "handled with some sensitivity - all except for Tin-Tin, a literal China doll". Kate Hunt of the University of Glasgow, author of a study of the series' presentation of tobacco smoking, observes that in marked contrast with prolific smokers such as Penelope, Tin-Tin is [...] "incongruously" [...] and [...] "inconsistently" [...] seen with a cigarette in only one episode ("The End of the Road"). She writes that the character occupies a socially-ambiguous position within her home environment, appearing variously as [...] "adopted daughter, secretary, and occasional member of the International Rescue team".|$|R

This {{was taken to}} mean that the Malays were accorded deference as the definitive people of Malaya — i.e. being a Malayan {{would be the same}} as being a Malay — and in the eyes of many, gave Malaya a Malay identity. One academic suggested that [...] "The Malays have a deep-rooted feeling that they alone are the bumiputras, the sons of the soil, and as such have certain special rights over the land." [...] Indeed, the Tunku said in 1964 that [...] "It is understood by all that this country by its very name, its traditions and character, is Malay. ... In any other country where aliens try to dominate economic and other fields, eventually there is bitter opposition from the indigenous people. But not with the Malays. Therefore, in return, they must appreciate the position of the Malays..." [...] It has been suggested that a <b>Malaysian</b> <b>nationality</b> did not emerge because [...] "all the national symbols in Malaysia were derived from the Malay tradition".|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the Willems et al. model was verified on a collected sample of Malay (<b>Malaysian</b> <b>nationality)</b> children. This sample was split in a reference sample to develop a Malay-specific prediction model based on the Willems et al. method and in a test sample to validate this new developed model. Next, the incorporation of third molars into this model was analyzed. Panoramic radiographs (n[*]=[*] 1, 403) of Malay children aged between 4 and 14. 99 years (n[*]=[*] 702) and subadults aged between 15 and 23. 99 years (n[*]=[*] 701) were collected. The left mandibular seven permanent teeth {{of the children were}} scored based on the staging technique described by Demirjian and converted to age using the Willems et al. method. Third molar development of all individuals was staged based on the technique described by Gleiser and Hunt modified by Kohler. Differences between dental age and chronological age were calculated and expressed in mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The Willems et al. model verified on the collected Malay children overestimated chronological age with a ME around 0. 45 year. Small differences in ME, MAE, and RMSE between the verified Malay-specific prediction model and the Willems et al. model were observed. An overall neglected decrease in RMSE was detected adding third molar stages to the developed permanent teeth model. status: publishe...|$|R
