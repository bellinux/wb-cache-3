40|$|This article {{would like}} to give some {{insights}} about <b>nuclear</b> dual-use <b>items,</b> i. e. goods {{that can be used for}} both civil and military purposes. The contemporary world faces great challenges how to curb nuclear proliferation and provide for legitimate use of items for declared purposes. Effective export control of dual-use items addresses a number of stakeholders – from a single exporter, research institutes, larger companies, national agencies to international fora and non-governmental organisations. The first part of the article intends to encompass several international, legally binding instruments, fora and different groups that deal with the export control of nuclear and other dual-use items. These mechanisms are used by those states which follow their international obligations in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It includes control of exports, as well as transfers, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The second part will touch upon Slovenian experience in this sphere, in particular its participation in the work of international bodies and organisations, domestic legislation, national inter-agency co-operation and obligations within the European Union (EU). The third part shows a few practical examples of <b>nuclear</b> dual-use <b>items</b> as well as some thoughts about challenges with regard to effective export control. ...|$|R

40|$|Inspection {{procedures}} {{involving the}} sampling of items {{in a population}} often require steps of increasingly sensitive measurements, with correspondingly smaller sample sizes; these {{are referred to as}} multilevel sampling schemes. In the case of nuclear safeguards inspections verifying that there has been no diversion of Special Nuclear Material (SNM), these procedures have been examined often and increasingly complex algorithms have been developed to implement them. The aim in this paper is to provide an integrated approach, and, in so doing, to describe a systematic, consistent method that proceeds logically from level to level with increasing accuracy. The authors emphasize that the methods discussed are generally consistent with those presented in the references mentioned, and yield comparable results when the error models are the same. However, because of its systematic, integrated approach the proposed method elucidates the conceptual understanding of what goes on, and, in many cases, simplifies the calculations. In nuclear safeguards inspections, an important aspect of verifying <b>nuclear</b> <b>items</b> to detect any possible diversion of nuclear fissile materials is the sampling of such items at various levels of sensitivity. The first step usually is sampling by ``attributes`` involving measurements of relatively low accuracy, followed by further levels of sampling involving greater accuracy. This process is discussed in some detail in the references given; also, the nomenclature is described. Here, the authors outline a coordinated step-by-step procedure for achieving such multilevel sampling, and they develop the relationships between the accuracy of measurement and the sample size required at each stage, i. e., at the various levels. The logic of the underlying procedures is carefully elucidated; the calculations involved and their implications, are clearly described, and the process is put in a form that allows systematic generalization...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the definition of a}} Material Balance Area (MBA) as a well-defined geographical area involving an Integral operation, the building housing the BFS- 1 and BFS- 1 critical facilities is considered to consist of one MBA. The BFS materials are in the form of small disks clad in stainless steel and each disk with nuclear material has its own serial number. Fissile material disks in the BFS MBA can be located at three key monitoring points: BFS- 1 facility, BFS- 2 facility and main storage of BFS fissile materials (storage 1). When used in the BFS- 1 or BFS- 2 critical facilities, the fissile material disks are loaded in tubes (fuel rods) forming critical assembly cores. The following specific features of the BFS MBA should be taken into account for the purpose of computerized accounting of nuclear material: (1) very large number of <b>nuclear</b> material <b>items</b> (about 70, 000 fissile material items); and (2) periodically very intensive shuffling of <b>nuclear</b> material <b>items.</b> Requirements for the computerized system are determined by basic objectives of nuclear material accounting: (1) providing accurate information on the identity and location of all items in the BFS material balance area; (2) providing accurate information on location and identity of tamper-indicating devices; (3) tracking nuclear material inventories; (4) issuing periodic reports; (5) assisting with the detection of material gains or losses; (6) providing a history of nuclear material transactions; (7) preventing unauthorized access to the system and data falsification. In August 1995, the prototype computerized accounting system was installed on the BFS facility for trial operation. Information on two nuclear material types was entered into the data base: weapon-grade plutonium metal and 36 % enriched uranium dioxide.

40|$|Nuclear {{energy and}} nuclear {{proliferation}} programs are potentially inter-twinned, {{which is a}} point {{to be taken into}} account when analysing the development of civil nuclear energy, both domestically and as foreign investment. International agreements ensure that the adhering countries fulfil their obligations and do not abuse civil nuclear programs for the production of nuclear weapons. Uranium enrichment is the process currently most focussed on in this respect by recent news and recent technological and commercial developments. But also the so-called reactor-based pathway, with extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel by reprocessing remains in the spotlight of inspectors. Two of the main and complementary pillars on which the prevention of such diversion relies, are Strategic Export Control and International Safeguards. Strategic export control is a key barrier against nuclear proliferation. In many countries including the EU it is set by a legal framework, envisaging implementation, enforcement and prosecution. The goods that can exported only with authorisations are those identified by the international export control regimes; primarily the Nuclear Suppliers Group in the case of <b>nuclear</b> <b>items.</b> It is complemented by nuclear safeguards measures, and especially in the past few years, by the IAEA State Level concept, which looks at the overall country’s potential, including its industrial structure to derive conclusions on the absence of undeclared activities. However, the strict control of goods and knowledge is a moving target, since technological developments, globalisation and the intensifying exchange of information via the worldwide web offer increasing opportunities to proliferators to acquire sensitive items and competences, and create bigger challenges to enforcement, calling for new responses. Research and development programmes must be directed towards supporting the adaptation of current proliferation containment systems to these new challenges. The proposed paper will address the nature of strategic trade controls challenges, describe a few emerging threats and stress the key role of exporters’ awareness and compliance in this respect. JRC.

40|$|Nuclear {{facilities}} hold a {{great amount}} of safety classified items. Production of the items in different safety classes must adhere to the requirements set by STUK. Previously, it has been stated that commercial-grade items commonly used in industrial applications have reached or even surpassed nuclear-grade Safety Class 3 (SC 3) items in quality. A case study was conducted to investigate these statements. Metso Flow Control (MFC) compiled and provided a requirement specification followed in their Oil & Gas (OG) shut-off valve deliveries. This specification was compared qualitatively with a requirement specification of a nuclear-grade SC 3 shut-off valve. The findings showed that several requirements in the specifications are identical or similar. For example, structural design and most factory tests can be done according to same standards. Differences were identified for example in the inspection scope and in design bases requirements regarding tolerability of seismic events or radiation. Additionally, the case study attempted to compare quantitatively the failure rates of nuclear- and commercial-grade isolation valves. It was found that the failure rates are compiled in a fundamentally different way and that MFC couldn’t allow access to the original failure data because of its sensible nature. Therefore the failure rates could not be compared in this study. This study included also an interview study, where a total of nine experts from different organizations were interviewed. According to the findings, in order to accept commercial-grade <b>items</b> for <b>nuclear</b> use, the deviations from <b>nuclear</b> <b>items</b> must be identified and compensated for. This was seen as the way to confirm that the commercial-grade items meet the safety level of nuclear-grade items. The interviewees emphasized the role of cooperation in closing the gap between nuclear- and commercial-grade items. Additionally, it was found that nuclear requirements are partly perceived as unclear. Cooperation between all stakeholders was also stated to improve clarity of requirements and the public image of nuclear power. Reaching a more explicit requirement level and a better public image were said to improve the cost-effectiveness of nuclear power. The new requirement for a Requirement Specification Document (RSD) was unanimously seen as a step towards more clarity, and the interviewees agreed that the licensees could definitely cooperate when compiling the RSDs. This was said to reduce overlapping efforts...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} of short-notice random inspections (SNRIs) for inventory-change verification {{can enhance the}} effectiveness and efficiency of international safeguards at natural or low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel fabrication plants. According to this approach, the plant operator declares the contents of <b>nuclear</b> material <b>items</b> before knowing if an inspection will occur to verify them. Additionally, items about which declarations are newly made should remain available for verification for an agreed time. Then a statistical inference {{can be made from}} verification results for items verified during SNRIs to the entire populations, i. e. the entire strata, even if inspectors were not present when many items were received or produced. A six-month field test of the feasibility of such SNRIs took place at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation Commercial Nuclear Fuel Division during 1993. Westinghouse personnel made daily declarations about both feed and product items, uranium hexafluoride cylinders and finished fuel assemblies, using a custom-designed computer ``mailbox``. Safeguards inspectors from the IAEA conducted eight SNRIs to verify these declarations. They arrived unannounced at the plant, in most cases immediately after travel from Canada, where the IAEA maintains a regional office. Items from both strata were verified during the SNRIs by meant of nondestructive assay equipment...|$|R

The dedication process qualified the commercial off-the-shelf components to be applied as basic components. In past fifteen years, Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) has actively performed the dedication service to help local nuclear power plants solve their procurement problems of <b>nuclear</b> grade <b>items,</b> due to reduced availability of qualified suppliers and/or obsolete issues of qualified components. The Scope of dedication includes material, electrical and mechanical components located in mild and harsh environment. Thousands of components such as piping, fitting, breaker, relay, motor, and control device etc., have already been dedicated to and successfully used in local nuclear power plants. The Commercial-Grade Item dedication process is based on EPRI documentations. Besides, the technical evaluation and equipment qualification are included during the dedication process. The requirements for equipment qualification are described in IEEE standards. Although the codes and standards for dedication in Taiwan refer to those in USA, the challenges may happen due to different regulators, utility, manufacture’s quality culture, and personal responsibility. The key to successful dedication will be dependent on the well-defined component requirements and good project planning.

40|$|Australian students' {{attitudes to}} nuclear weapons were {{considered}} {{in relation to}} sex-role identification and political orientations. By including a measure of sex-role orientation, we hoped to clarify earlier confusion surrounding gender as a predictor of nuclear views. Our hypothesis was that men and women with feminine sex-role orientations would display the strongest antinuclear feelings. Also, we predicted that an authoritarian political stance advocating strict law-and-order on the domestic front would predict support for nuclear weapons in international defense. The subjects were 46 male and 62 female first-year university students. The measure of nuclear attitudes was a 23 -item inventory (NARQ) which had previously been extensively refined and validated for Australian populations (Jennings & Lawrence, 1986). The BSRI (Bem, 1974) measured sex-role orientation. An Australian law-and-order scale was also developed for this research. Latent trait models for rating data were applied to NARQ and law-and-order scales. The results revealed sex differences on approximately one-third of the <b>nuclear</b> opinion <b>items,</b> with men expressing stronger support for nuclear weapons in every case. Authoritarian law-and-order attitudes likewise predicted support for nuclear weapons in both men and women.

40|$|Export of commodities, {{encouraged}} {{by both the}} private sector and the Federal Government, helps to improve our position in the global economy and is in the national interest of the US. However, exports of commodities or technologies, without regard to whether they may significantly contribute to the military potential of individual countries or combination of countries or enhance the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction, may adversely affect the national security of the US. The Federal Government, therefore, implements several laws, Executive Orders, and regulations to control the export of certain commodities and technologies. These commodities and technologies require a license for export.

40|$|A {{high-quality}} {{materials accounting}} system and effective international inspections in uranium fuel-fabrication facilities depend heavily upon accurate nondestructive assay {{measurements of the}} facility`s <b>nuclear</b> materials. While <b>item</b> accounting can monitor {{a large portion of}} the facility inventory (fuel rods, assemblies, storage items), the contents of all such items and mass values for all bulk materials must be based on quantitative measurements.

However, to cover the full range of process materials and to provide timely accountancy data on hard-to-measure items and rapid verification of previous measurements, radiation-based nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques play an important role. NDA for uranium fuel fabrication facilities relies on passive gamma spectroscopy for enrichment and U isotope mass values of medium-to-low-density samples and holdup deposits; it relies on active neutron techniques for U- 235 mass values of high-density and heterogeneous samples.

JRC has carried out a support task to IAEA to identify main trade data sources and explore uses for safeguards. In this context a software tool has been developed in support to nuclear trade analysis. The tool, called The Big Table (TBT), allows IAEA¿s analysts to search control lists, identify items of interest to trade-related case studies, and link these to technical documentation and descriptors needed to retrieve global trade data. A distinguishing trait of TBT is that it enables searching in an ¿inter-related way¿ a collection of reference documents for export controls on <b>nuclear</b> and nuclear-related <b>items.</b> Reference documents include: regulatory documents, technical handbooks and the Harmonized System, the taxonomy of goods by the World Customs Organization used by traders to declare exports and imports to customs.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{heuristic}} argument {{in support of}} the assertion that QCD will exhibit a mass gap, if the Callan-Symanzik function β(g) obeys the inequality β(g) 0. We begin by summarizing the standard lore attributed to QCD: (A) QCD must have a mass gap, i. e., every excitation above the vacuum state must have energy � △, where △ is a positive constant. The key idea that infrared slavery requires the generation of a mass gap (dynamical gluon mass) in QCD was enunciated in a pioneering paper by Cornwall in 1982 [1]. (B) QCD must exhibit “quark confinement”, i. e., the observed (physical) particle spectrum (pion, proton, [...] .) are color SUC(3) invariant, despite the fact that QCD is described by an underlying Lagrangian of quarks and non-abelian gluons, which transform non-trivially under color SUc(3) symmetry. (C) QCD must exhibit chiral symmetry breakdown, i. e., the flavor axial-vector charges Qα 5 (α = 1, 2 [...] . 8) must break the flavor SU L F (3) ⊗ SUR F (3) spontaneously, | 0 〉 ̸ = 0, so that the vacuum is only invariant under a subgroup of i. e. Q α 5 Dedicated to honor George Sudarshan on his 75 th birthday 1 the full symmetry group acting on the quark fields, in the limit of vanishing current quark masses (Number of flavors, F = 6) [2]. Item (A) is essential to understand the short-range of the <b>nuclear</b> force. <b>Item</b> (B) is essential to account for the absence (unobservability) of individual free quarks. Finally, item (C) is essential to justify the spectacular current algebra predictions of the 1960 ’s. In this note, we present a heuristic argument to validate Item I, under the following assumptions: (a) Elitzur’s theorem holds [3]: local gauge invariance cannot be spontaneously broken: local gauge invariance is really a tautology [4], stating the redundancy of variables. As a consequence, the vacuum is generically non-degenerate and points in “no particular direction ” in group space and there cannot be massless, Nambu-Goldstone bosons (Colored, in QCD) [5]. (b) Federbush-Johnson-Schroer theorem holds [6]: In a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, if a local operator annihilates the vacuum state, then the operator must vanish identically. We will elaborate on this theorem later, with a crucial and important clarification due to Greenber...|$|R
40|$|Chinese {{policies}} and behaviour regarding the nonproliferation {{of weapons of}} mass destruction (WMD) have changed gradually over the last two decades. Since the early 1980 s, China has limited its exports of sensitive <b>nuclear</b> and missile <b>items</b> and expanded its nonproliferation commitments. Although China continues to provide some missile assistance to Pakistan, Iran and other countries, from a nonproliferation perspective China's policies - on balance - have improved. The dissertation argues that US policy, in the form of economic and political incentives and disincentives, played a significant and enduring role in shaping these changes. US diplomacy sensitized China to international and US nonproliferation concerns; encouraged China to accept nonproliferation principles and join international accords; coerced China into strict compliance with some of its commitments; catalyzed institutionalization of such pledges; and helped foster the development of a Chinese community of arms control and nonproliferation specialists. These changes in China's nonproliferation behaviour were also influenced by three internal factors: the degree of China's acceptance of specific nonproliferation norms; China's institutional/bureaucratic capacity to understand and implement its nonproliferation commitments; and Chinese foreign policy priorities. These three variables enabled and constrained US efforts to shape China's nonproliferation policies. US policy was most successful in encouraging changes in China's approach to nuclear nonproliferation but were far more limited in shaping its missile nonproliferation behaviour. The dissertation further maintains that persistent and high-level US diplomacy resulted in the widely held Chinese perception that some of its nonproliferation pledges are political commitments and that adherence to them is linked to the overall US-China political relationship. As a result, US policies which China perceives as undermining its core security interests, such as missile defence, have pushed China away from supporting nonproliferation and arms control principles and agreements. This dissertation presents four case-studies. The first one covers US-China negotiations on nuclear nonproliferation, the second covers bilateral interactions on missile nonproliferation, the third addresses bilateral debates on missile defences, and the fourth case study examines the evolution of China's community of nonproliferation and arms control specialists...|$|R
40|$|The Seals and Identification Laboratory (SILab) is a {{laboratory}} within the Traceability & Vulnerability Assessment Unit, {{part of the}} Institute for the Protectionand Security of the Citizen from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. SILab develops technologies and equipment based on ultrasonic control methods and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) techniques, suitable for sealing and/or identification of <b>nuclear</b> or commercial <b>items.</b> This paper presents the work carried out {{in collaboration with the}} European Directorate General TAXUD (Taxation and Customs Union) and the Italian Customs authorities, aiming at proving the potentialities of modern electronic seals for commercial container sealing. Actually, European Customs officers in general and Italian in particular, have problems very similar to nuclear transportation and storage. Some harbours have no more possibility of extension on the sea side and they are building "inland harbours" (hubs) where the dispatching (or temporary storage) of the goods will be done. Each place is {{under the control of the}} Customs authorities, but during the transports between the sea harbour and the inland hub these authorities must also ensure that no goods are diverted. This presentation describes the tests of JRC patented RFID seals carried out in Livorno harbour and Prato hub (Italy). In particular, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sealing systems have been demonstrated to Customs and Port authorities by simulating different scenarios of seal application, in particular: - Application of RFID seals to a container - The container was not authorized to leave the harbour - The container was authorized to leave the harbour and the seals were correctly setup - Spot check of seals status between Livorno and Prato with portable readers - The container arrives at destination Customs gate with integer seals - The container arrives at destination Customs gate with open seals The results were positive as the JRC demonstrated that the secure transport of containers subjected to Customs obligations is possible with a system that has a very low impact on harbour and hub infrastructures. These obligations are not far from nuclear safeguard ones. With quite few developments, these systems can also be deployed for the purpose of the nuclear safeguards. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{regulatory}} control of nuclear materials (nuclear safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to maintain the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is implemented by the Nuclear Materials Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor nuclear material holders in Finland. <b>Nuclear</b> dual-use <b>items</b> and instrumentation for the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction are being licensed, imported and installed. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. STUK maintains a national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to verify that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and materials. In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The results of STUK’s nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2016 continued to demonstrate that Finnish licence holders take good care of their nuclear materials. There were no indications of undeclared nuclear materials or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the stakeholders' declarations. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2016. By means of their nuclear materials accountancy and control systems, the stakeholders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. In safeguards, STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2016, the number of inspection days was significantly higher at a total of 98, owing to the system inspections carried out during the year as a part of STUK’s periodic inspection programme. In contrast to this, there was no survey campaign to verify the design of the planned geological repository, resulting in only 12 IAEA inspection days in 2016, whereas, the Commission needed 18 inspection days to fulfil its duties in 2016. A major goal of all current Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties {{that it is impossible to}} make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task as demonstrated twice during 2016. The human resources development at the Nuclear Materials Section during 2016 was focused on nuclear material control: in particular, standard operational procedures were addressed within the nuclear regulator departments. At the Nuclear Materials Section, the new nuclear materials database was developed in this context. Due to the need to regulate the construction of the disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site, safeguards instrumentation was under development, in particular the passive gamma emission tomography for the verification of spent fuel. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK also contributed to EU-funded projects in Tanzania and Vietnam, respectively. STUK and Finnish Customs finalised the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officer training and the updating of the technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting the establishment of the Saudi Arabia’s regulatory authority in relation to its nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts continued practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|R
40|$|Management review In 2016, all Finnish {{nuclear power}} plants {{operated}} safely and caused no danger to their surrounding environment or employees. The collective radiation doses of employees were yet again historically low in {{almost all of the}} plant units and radioactive releases into the environment very small. The low employee radiation doses were the result of short annual outages and improvements implemented at the {{nuclear power plants}}. In spring 2016, three leaking fuel assemblies were replaced at Olkiluoto 1 during an extra refuelling outage, and then three more assemblies were replaced in connection with the annual outage due to subsequent leaks. The fuel leaks were one reason why the employee radiation doses at the plant unit were somewhat higher than in the previous years. Over the course of 2016, Fortum Power and Heat Oy (Fortum) submitted to STUK a total of 20 operational event reports. The operational events did not compromise nuclear or radiation safety. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the periodic inspection programme during the annual outage. During the annual outages, Fortum inspected – according to a programme agreed with STUK – that there was no hydrogen flaking in the reactor pressure vessel of the power plant unit 1. Hydrogen flaking could have occurred during manufacture of the pressure vessel. A similar inspection on the pressure vessel of Loviisa 2 was performed in 2014. No hydrogen flaking was detected in either of the pressure vessels. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on the Fortum’s organisation, inspecting Fortum’s management, competence, resource and procurement processes. Also in 2016, Fortum completed a major organisational renewal, and STUK oversaw its implementation and initial impact as part of its regulatory oversight. In 2016, Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) submitted to STUK 11 operational event reports. Some radioactive materials were released into the environment in the case of two of the events. One of the events involved fuel leaks and the other an error during maintenance. The set limits were not exceeded and neither of the events compromised radiation safety of the population. Both events increased the radiation level inside the plant, which was taken into account when planning the work to be done by the employees. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the periodic inspection programme during the annual outage. TVO implemented a new organisation and operations model in 2015. Based on inspections by STUK, the new operations model has been largely established, but there are still some challenges pertaining to the atmosphere at the company and the adequacy of resources. STUK will continue to monitor as part of its regulatory oversight the situation and the actions taken by TVO to maintain the organisation’s safety culture during the challenging change. At both Olkiluoto and Loviisa, modifications required for improving safety continued. New main steam line safety valves were installed at Loviisa 1 during the 2016 annual outage. They will also operate in a case where water flows through them in addition to steam. A similar installation was carried out at Loviisa 2 in 2014. New main steam line radiation measuring instruments were also installed and commissioned at Loviisa 1. Of the improvement measures started after the Fukushima accident, further improvements of the flood protection and securing the cooling of the fuel pools are still remaining. Their planning proceeded in 2016. An improvement project of the diesel fuel storage and transfer system was completed in 2016. STUK continued its review of the Loviisa I&C renewal documents and supervised installation work of the renewal’s first phase during the 2016 annual outage. The first phase included a preventive safety function control and indication system as well as modernisation of the I&C status monitoring system. The rest of the I&C renewal installations will be completed during the 2017 and 2018 annual outages. As a result of the Fukushima accident, Olkiluoto will improve, for example, systems used to cool the reactor and add whole new systems for pumping water into the reactor in case of a complete loss of AC power. Another ongoing project at Olkiluoto is an upgrade of the reactor coolant pumps and the emergency diesel generators. In 2016, first of the six reactor coolant pumps in Olkiluoto 1 was replaced. TVO plans to commission the new reactor coolant pumps between 2016 and 2018. STUK continued its review of documents pertaining to the modifications and the supervision of manufacture. The installation and construction work of Olkiluoto 3 are nearing the end, and full-scale testing of the systems and components was started in 2016. Testing of the I&C systems started {{at the beginning of the}} year and the first process system tests were performed in April 2016. TVO submitted an operating licence application for the plant unit to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in April 2016. At the same time, TVO submitted the documents on the plant and its operation required by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Decree to STUK for approval. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on review of the operating licence application and on oversight of the remaining installations and the commissioning activities. While reviewing the operating licence application, STUK also prepared implementation decisions for Olkiluoto 3 of the updated YVL Guides that were published in 2013. The new YVL Guides will enter into force for Olkiluoto 3 as soon as the operating licence is granted. Due to suspected product forgeries involving manufacturers in France, STUK required reports from the power companies on whether the suspicions involve manufacture of the components used at Olkiluoto 3 or whether any components from the said manufacturers have been used at the operating nuclear power plants. The report on Olkiluoto 3 must be submitted to STUK by the end of April 2017. No forgeries have been detected at the operating plant units, but the reports on Loviisa will be supplemented in early 2017. In June 2015, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE a construction licence application for a new nuclear power plant. At the same time, Fennovoima submitted to STUK for review documents required by the Nuclear Energy Decree. Fennovoima has supplemented and will supplement the construction licence application in stages between 2015 and 2018. Delivery of documents has been delayed from the schedule of the first licensing plan due to slower organisation than expected of the project and its supply chain and due to a lack of resources in the design organisation. STUK monitored the development of Fennovoima’s management system and quality management, and assessed the company’s organisational resources to begin construction of a nuclear power plant. In September 2015, STUK launched the inspections included in the regulatory inspection programme, and a total of 15 inspections of Fennovoima and key organisations of the plant supplier were carried out in 2016. Furthermore, STUK’s experts participated as observers in audits of the plant supplier and its subcontractors, arranged by Fennovoima. The handling and storage of spent nuclear fuel and operational waste and the disposal of operational waste were implemented safely, and no events compromising safety were detected at the Loviisa or Olkiluoto nuclear power plants. Due to the successful planning of operations, the plants accumulated clearly less operational waste than nuclear power plants on average. An important positive development in the waste management of the plants was the fact that operation of a solidification facility for liquid radioactive waste at the Loviisa nuclear power plant started on 15 February 2016 after STUK had approved the related application. Fortum continued the planning of repairs of the damage observed in the outer surface of the concrete vault in the solidified waste disposal facility, which is why the disposal of solidified waste could not be started yet. The operating licence for the research reactor FiR 1 of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is valid until the end of 2023. VTT shut down the research reactor for financial reasons in June 2015 and has been preparing decommissioning of the research reactor ever since. STUK has conducted all the measures necessary for the oversight of the reactor that was shut down and prepared for the review of the application on the decommissioning of the reactor. VTT submitted a nuclear waste management plan for the research reactor to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in September 2016. The report described all measures since the 2015 report and all planned measures up until 2022. STUK stated in its statement to the MEAE that VTT had clearly progressed with the planning of the research reactor’s decommissioning over the course of the past year. The most important open issues regarding the decommissioning of the research reactor involve the return of spent fuel to the United States and the storage and disposal of dismantling waste. After Posiva Oy received a construction licence from the Government on 12 November 2015, STUK’s oversight has focused on the construction of the encapsulation and disposal facility. The regulatory oversight during the construction stage covers design, manufacture, construction and installation of the nuclear waste facility and its safety-classified systems, structures and components. This stage also includes the nuclear waste facility’s commissioning stage, at which time STUK will oversee Posiva’s operations, review testing programmes and results, and perform commissioning inspections. In 2016, STUK’s oversight focused particularly on the assessment of Posiva’s readiness for construction after the submission of the construction licence. STUK continued to oversee construction of the underground research facility by Posiva, Posiva’s system design, activities of the Posiva organisation and development of Posiva’s safety analyses. An important stage in 2016 was the start of the construction of the disposal facility according to the construction licence. STUK comprehensively assessed Posiva’s readiness for construction before the construction work was started. In June 2016, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE its environmental impact assessment programme on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel as required in the 2010 decision-inprinciple. The submission of the EIA programme started Fennovoima’s spent fuel disposal project and the selection process of the disposal facility site. Fennovoima has proposed Sydänneva in Pyhäjoki and Eurajoki as the potential sites. The more exact research area in Eurajoki has not been determined as of yet. In its statement on the EIA programme, STUK emphasised the fact that the proposed process would last a long time, the need to regularly assess the programme to ensure that it is up to date and the fact that the exact research area in Eurajoki must be determined as soon as possible. In addition to the operation and construction of a nuclear facility, the use of nuclear energy as laid down in section 2 of the Nuclear Energy Act includes the possession, manufacture, production, transfer, handling, use, storage, transport, export and import of nuclear material. Furthermore, components, systems and information required by nuclear facilities are subject to licensing and oversight by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Act. In 2016, STUK became aware of two cases of import without the proper licence. Nuclear safeguards in Finland were implemented in compliance with the international treaties. Nuclear safeguards ensure that nuclear materials and other <b>nuclear</b> <b>items</b> remain in peaceful use in compliance with the relevant licences and declarations and that nuclear facilities and related technologies are only utilised for peaceful purposes. STUK maintains a national control system which aim is to take care of the necessary oversight of use of nuclear energy for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. STUK processed reports and declarations on nuclear materials and performed safeguards inspections together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission. STUK actively promoted with the IAEA and the European Commission the development of nuclear safeguards for the disposal of spent fuel. Key issues in this development work were the development of a new oversight model and a new fuel measuring technology...|$|R
