The processing of the laterite ores through the Caron process comprises of three important stages, namely: (1) Reduction-roasting of the laterite ore; (2) Leaching of roaster product and precipitation to form an intermediate product of <b>basic</b> <b>nickel</b> carbonate; and (3) Decomposition and reduction of <b>basic</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate</b> and <b>nickel</b> oxide to form nickel metal.

40|$|Amorphous <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{particles}} are catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which plays {{a critical role}} in the electrochemical splitting of water. The amorphous <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate</b> particles can be prepared at a temperature as low as 60 degrees C by an evaporation-induced precipitation (EIP) method. The products feature hierarchical pore structures. The mass-normalized activity of the catalysts, measured at an overpotential of 0. 35 V, was 55. 1 Ag(- 1), with a Tafel slope of only 60 mVdec(- 1). This catalytic activity is superior to the performance of crystalline NiOx particles and -Ni(OH) (2) particles, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art RuO 2 catalysts. The activity of the amorphous <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate</b> is remarkably stable during a 10000 s chronoamperometry test. Further optimization of synthesis parameters reveals that the amorphous structure can be tuned by adjusting the H 2 O/Ni ratio in the precursor mixture. These results suggest the potential application of easily prepared hierarchical <b>basic</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate</b> particles as cheap and robust OER catalysts with high activity...|$|R

The various elemental reactions and fundamental phenomena {{that contribute to the}} change of the physical and chemical characteristics of the samples during the processes taking place in Ni metal production through gas/solid-reduction processes have been identified and thoroughly investigated. The following phenomena affecting the final-product microstructure were identified as follows: (1) chemical changes, i. e., decomposition, reduction reactions, and oxidation reactions; (2) NiO and Ni recrystallization and grain growth; (3) NiO and Ni sintering and densification; and (4) agglomeration of the NiO and Ni particles...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation has}} been carried out {{to determine the effects of}} temperature, reduction/oxidation time, and partial pressure of hydrogen on the extent of the oxygen and sulfur removal during <b>basic</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate</b> (BNC) processing under laboratory conditions. It has been shown that increasing the temperature and reduction time increases the extent of oxygen and sulfur removal. Decreasing the hydrogen partial pressure tenfold lowers the extent of oxygen removal and results in the formation of residual NiO (incomplete reduction). The microstructure characteristics of industrial plant samples are correlated with the results obtained from the laboratory studies to identify the underlying elementary reactions and phenomena occurring and to understand the mechanisms of formation of the residual NiO in the final nickel product during industrial processing. As a result of these studies, it is recommended that the actual process is carried out at temperatures below 600 &# 0176;C to avoid the formation of this residual NiO...|$|R
40|$|New {{environmental}} and chemical policy regulations require further optimisation of current nickel production processes. This paper outlines recent fundamental research {{in support of}} improvements in nickel production process through the Caron Process. The research focuses on two major areas: (i) reduction roasting of nickel laterite, and (ii) reduction of <b>basic</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate</b> (BNC) and NiO to nickel. Nickel in laterite is associated with Fe-rich goethite and serpentine/olivine particles. Results indicate that the nickel recoveries from the limonite ores correspond closely to values predicted by thermodynamic modelling; nickel recoveries from serpentine ores are however significantly lower than these chemical equilibrium values. The nickel recovery from serpentine/olivine appears to be higher for particles with Mg to Fe mol ratio of lower than 8. In relation to the reduction of BNC and NiO, the change of phase, product surface, internal microstructures taking place during reduction/oxidation of BNC at 110 oC to 900 oC; {{as well as the}} kinetics and microstructure transformation mechanism during reduction of synthetic NiO at 400 oC to 1000 oC have been studied. A clear link has been established between the rates of reduction, the nickel product morphology, and the reaction mechanisms occurring at the Ni-NiO interface. A change in the reduction behaviour was observed between 600 and 800 oC depending on the hydrogen partial pressures and reduction time. The phenomena affecting the final-product microstructure were identified as follows: (1) chemical changes, i. e. decomposition, reduction and oxidation reactions; (2) NiO and Ni recrystallisation and grain growth; (3) NiO and Ni sintering and densification; and (4) agglomeration of the NiO and Ni particles...|$|R

40|$|RECENT {{investigation}} of samples labelled zara-tite from the Lord Brassey Mine, near Heazle-wood, Tasmania, in the mineral {{collection of the}} Museum of Victoria revealed {{the presence of the}} rare <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonate,</b> otwayite, and the rare nickel hydroxide, theophrastite. X-ray diffrac-tion, electron microprobe and infrared analysis were utilised in the study, which failed to confirm the presence of zaratite. The Lord Brassey Mine is situated near the summit of Mt. Grey, 1. 5 km northeast of the Waratah-Corinna Road bridge over the Heazle-wood River, in western Tasmania. The mine is the type locality for two nickel-bearing minerals, heazlewoodite (Petterd, 1910; Peacock, 1947) and hellyerite (Williams et al., 1959). The nickel ore occurs as narrow veins within a body of serpentinite 4 km long and 800 m wide, forming part of a large Cambrian ultrabasic complex consisting of pyroxenites and peridotites (Williams, 1958). The main ore consists of heazlewoodite with minor pentlandite and miller-ite generally intergrown with magnetite. In shear planes and fracture fillings a waxy, translucent, emerald-green amorphous mineral referred to as zaratite by Williams (1958) has been deposited along with thin coatings of pale blue hellyerite. Given that the secondary <b>nickel</b> <b>carbonates</b> and hydroxides from Lord Brassey Mine transect massive magnetite and serpentine minerals, and given their associations in other deposits, it is most likely that they precipitated from meteoric fluids which permeated the nickel sulphide ore-body via shear planes and fractures.
