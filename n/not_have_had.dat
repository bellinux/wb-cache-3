5|$|At {{the time}} of Tomlinson's death, Patel was on the Home Office's {{register}} of accredited forensic pathologists. He qualified as a doctor at the University of Zambia in 1974, and registered to practise in the UK in 1988. The Metropolitan Police had written to the Home Office in 2005 raising concerns about his work. At {{the time of}} Tomlinson's death he did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{a contract with the}} police to conduct post-mortems in cases of suspicious death.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having enough money to make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> enough money to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} bat's {{discovery}} in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed {{as a result}} of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.|$|E

5|$|There are notable {{mainstream}} {{acts that}} feature or have featured Christian members. While these bands {{may or may}} <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> lyrics using Christian themes or symbolism, some have caused controversy in their claims to Christianity, such as Tom Araya of Slayer. Others, such as Alice Cooper Killswitch Engage, Linkin Park, Iron Maiden and Megadeth also have members who are Christian and often use spiritual themes.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened {{the weight of the}} skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> any specific function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hockey, Iginla played baseball {{as a young}} man and was the catcher on the Canadian national junior team. He credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to play sports at a high level if not for his grandfather's support. Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the right wing. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the Alberta Midget Hockey League in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{outbreak}} {{coincided with the}} deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found {{he was unable}} to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. At the time the reasons for LeMond's increasing difficulties were not entirely known. At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders. In 2007, however, LeMond speculated that he might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated they would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> children if {{they were able to}} do it over again.|$|E
5|$|Wear facets {{are areas}} of a tooth that show {{evidence}} {{of contact with}} a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as occlusion). Flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at {{the front and back}} margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest the presence of a protocone (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on Asfaltomylos, a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in Ambondro and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a functional protocone.|$|E

5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1952, General Tire {{purchased}} the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations {{and the rights}} to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post). Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of Mutual. That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined. Mutual might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester, partly because of the cost and partly because Cheshire was a palatine county and the earl had {{authority}} over who was permitted to build castles. The earls were involved in the civil war of King Stephen’s reign {{in the middle of the}} 12th century commonly known as the Anarchy and the revolt against Henry II in 117374, both of which may have prompted castle building. Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester wanted control of the earldom of Carlisle but during the Anarchy it and much of northern England come under Scottish control. The construction of Buckton Castle may have been to safeguard Cheshire. These civil wars and rebellions would also have provided a context for the deliberate destruction of the castle. Alternatively the castle could have been built by William de Neville when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl of Chester between 1181 and 1186, though he may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the financial means to do so.|$|E

5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents that he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently {{a large part of}} it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E
5|$|The king again {{employed}} Ealdred as {{a diplomat}} in 1056, when he assisted earls Harold and Leofric {{in negotiations with}} the Welsh. Edward sent Ealdred after the death in battle of Bishop Leofgar of Hereford, who had attacked Gruffydd ap Llywelyn after encouragement from the king. However, Leofgar lost the battle and his life, and Edward had to sue for peace. Although details of the negotiations are lacking, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn swore loyalty to King Edward, but the oath may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> any obligations on Gruffydd's part to Edward. The exact terms of the submission are not known in total, but Gruffydd was not required to assist Edward in war nor attend Edward's court. Ealdred was rewarded with {{the administration of the}} see of Hereford, which he held until 1061, and was appointed Archbishop of York. The diocese had suffered a serious raid from the Welsh in 1055, and during his administration, Ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter's rights. Ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the Welsh in charge.|$|E
