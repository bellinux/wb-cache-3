The station Friedrichstraße <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{terminal}} point of the separated West and East Berlin S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between West Berlin and West Germany. Friedrichstraße station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners to change to S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-Süd-Bahn and the U6 line of the Berlin U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a border crossing into East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|In {{part due}} to the Israeli-Palestinian {{discourse}} engendered by Peace Now and its activists, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin and Yasser Arafat succeeded in signing the Declaration of Principles/Oslo Accords on the lawn of the White House on 13 September 1993. Peace <b>Now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first Israeli organisation to meet with the PLO, at a time when such an undertaking was deemed illegal by the Israeli government.|$|E
25|$|What {{remained}} <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{development of}} a suitable system for delaying the signal on demand, thereby allowing {{the direction of the}} beam to be scanned. The key problem was to change the speed of the signal on demand so the phase could be adjusted. After several concepts, the team finally settled on a wave-guide consisting of two parallel plates with overlapping barriers on the vertical sides (the front and back of the wave-guide). By mechanically varying the spacing between the two plates, the speed of propagation along the waveguide changed, and steering was achieved.|$|E

25|$|New urban {{plans and}} new villages (for example Carloforte, Calasetta and Santa Teresa di Gallura) were {{realised}} between the 18th and the 19th centuries. They often followed the urban model of Turin, which <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{capital of the}} Reign of Italy. New infrastructures were built under King Carlo Felice. The main road from the south (Cagliari) to the north (Sassari) was enhanced (the road still exists today and it still bears the name of Carlo Felice). Also, the first ferry route between the island and Genoa was established, using steamboats such as the Gulnara. The first railway was inaugurated in 1871. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century the Royal Railways had received 30 locomotives, 106 passenger cars, and 436 cargo cars.|$|E
25|$|Events {{moved so}} quickly that {{additional}} capital was needed, and Rockefeller felt that the Cleveland banks could not {{be counted on to}} keep his loan requests confidential. On January 2, 1872, Standard Oil issued 4,000 new shares of stock {{in the form of a}} dividend. Stock was issued on a pro rata basis, which gave Stone another 200 shares. Later that same day, another issue of stock was made. This constituted 11,000 shares, of which 3,000 were given to John D. Rockefeller, 1,400 to Henry Flagler, 4,000 to the owners of Clark, Payne and Company (one of the largest oil refineries in Cleveland), 700 to refiner Jabez A. Bostwick, 200 to refiner Joseph Stanley, and 500 to Peter Watson (who by <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> president of the SIC). Another 1,200 shares were given to John D. Rockefeller to retain as a reserve. On January 2, 1872, a third new issue of 10,000 shares occurred, and was given to Rockefeller to hold in reserve. Although these new issues had diluted Stone's investment to just 2 percent of Standard Oil's stock, it was enough to give him a strong financial interest in the company and to allow John D. Rockefeller to tighten his influence over railroads Stone directed.|$|E
25|$|The {{retribution}} began immediately. Hugh Despenser {{the elder}} {{had been captured}} at Bristol, and despite some attempts by Isabella to protect him, was promptly executed by his Lancastrian enemies– his body was hacked to pieces and fed to the local dogs. The remainder of the former regime were brought to Isabella. Edmund Fitzalan, a key supporter of Edward II and who had received many of Mortimer's confiscated lands in 1322, was executed on 17 November. Hugh Despenser the younger was sentenced to be brutally executed on 24 November, and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer, and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be drawn and quartered as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England. Simon of Reading, one of the Despensers' supporters, was hanged next to him, on charges of insulting Isabella. Once {{the core of the}} Despenser regime had been executed, Isabella and Mortimer began to show restraint. Lesser nobles were pardoned and the clerks {{at the heart of the}} government, mostly appointed by the Despensers and Stapleton, were confirmed in office. All that was left <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> question of Edward II, still officially Isabella's legal husband and lawful king.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, WTVJ tried several {{different}} formats to accompany or {{add to their}} existing newscasts; these included a news/lifestyle hybrid show called South Florida at 4:30, anchored by Ana Azcuy and Ed O'Dell; a 5:30 newscast with separate anchors (Teresa Rodriguez and Steve Abrams) at both the main studio and a Fort Lauderdale studio for news coverage from {{that part of the}} area; and an hour long 5:00 show called 4 News Now anchored by Tony Segreto that was focused on breaking news and long-form stories; 4 News <b>Now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> longest-lived of these efforts, lasting until the spring of 1994 when the 5:00 hour was reverted to a normal newscast and a half-hour 4:30 broadcast was added. In August 1992, when Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida, WTVJ was the only station to provide non-stop coverage of the storm with the assistance of meteorologist Bryan Norcross; WTVJ's coverage of the hurricane earned the station several local Emmy Awards in 1993. Most of WTVJ's archival footage from 1949 to 2004 (as well as footage from other Florida television stations) is stored at the Lynn and Louis Wolfson II Florida Moving Image Archives in downtown Miami. In 1997, WTVJ and the South Florida Sun-Sentinel began co-producing a nightly 10 p.m. newscast on then-WB affiliate WDZL. The program was broadcast from a secondary set at WTVJ's studio facility. The program ended its run after eleven years on August 31, 2008, as the now-WSFL's owner Tribune Broadcasting opted not to renew its news share agreement with the station.|$|E
500|$|The {{ground work}} for his successes had {{certainly}} been laid by others: Michael III, {{who broke the}} power of Melitene at Lalakaon; Basil I, who destroyed the Paulicians; Leo VI the Wise, who founded the vital theme of Mesopotamia; and Empress Zoe, who extended Byzantine influence again into Armenia and founded the theme of Lykandos. It was Kourkouas and his campaigns, however, that incontrovertibly changed {{the balance of power}} in the northern Middle East, securing the frontier provinces against Arab raids and turning Byzantium into an expansionist power. In the words of historian Steven Runciman, [...] "a lesser general might [...] have cleared the Empire of the Saracens and successfully defended its borders; but [...] did more. He infused a new spirit into the imperial armies, and led them victoriously deep into the country of the infidels. The actual area of his conquests was not so very large; but they sufficed to reverse the age-old roles of Byzantium and the Arabs. Byzantium <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> aggressor... was the first of a line of great conquerors and as the first is worthy of high praise." ...|$|E
500|$|Krueger {{reported}} that [...] "Michaelmas Task Force {{tried hard to}} block these escape routes. But the torrential rain, the ruggedness of the country with its impenetrable rain forests and jungles and impassable rivers, and the resistance of enemy troops pushed forward from Madang to guard the trails leading eastward, made this effort fall short of success". Australian commanders were critical. In a letter to Blamey, Berryman, who had visited Krueger {{in an attempt to}} ensure that the Japanese would not escape, wrote that [...] "about 8,000 semi-starved, ill-equipped and dispirited Japanese bypassed Saidor. It was disappointing that the fruits of victory were not fully reaped, and that once again the remnants of the 51st Division escaped our clutches." [...] Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead of New Guinea Force reported to Blamey that Michaelmas Task Force appeared not to have made [...] "any appreciable effort" [...] to cut off the retreating Japanese. Sadly for the men of the 32nd Infantry Division, many of these Japanese would later have to be fought again under less advantageous circumstances in the Battle of Driniumor River. Krueger officially terminated Operation Dexterity, of which Michaelmas was a part, on 10 February 1944. All that remained <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> final act of the Huon Peninsula campaign: the capture of Madang.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} case, Turnabout Visitor, Edgeworth finds {{a dead body}} in his office. He learns that the murderer was Jacques Portsman, a {{prosecutor}} who {{was working for the}} smuggling ring, and was trying to steal evidence from the murder ten years ago from Edgeworth's office; as a detective got too close, Portsman killed him. The fifth case, Turnabout Ablaze, takes place at the former Cohdopian embassy; civil tension in Cohdopia forced the country to split into Allebahst and Babahl, which share the same embassy building. The two countries planned to announce their reunification at the embassy when the fake Yatagarasu appeared, setting fire to the building and killing two people. The bodies are found at the embassies' respective offices; one of them is discovered to be the former secretariat of the Cohdopian embassy, who <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> secretariat for Babahl. Shih-na is revealed to be Calisto in disguise; she insists that she did not murder the secretariat, and is revealed to be an accessory to the crime. As she is taken away, she reveals that she is not Cece's sister, that [...] "Calisto" [...] was just an alias she took while working for the smuggling ring, and that she became part of Yatagarasu on orders from the ring's leader. Edgeworth reveals the ring's leader to be Allebahst's and formerly Cohdopia's ambassador Quercus Alba, who had committed murders and covered the tracks of the ring, and brought counterfeit money into Zheng Fa. Alba, Amano and others are convicted of their crimes, while Edgeworth and his companions recommit to their vows to defend the truth.|$|E
