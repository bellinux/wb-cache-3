5|$|By 1939, Low Fell {{had become}} the select suburb of Gateshead and had {{substantial}} and independent shopping facilities. All of the houses between Shipcote and the village were private and the owners added 'Low Fell' to their addresses, at times not even mentioning Gateshead, although, if we adhere to the original boundaries, they did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Low Fell at all".|$|E
5|$|On 10 December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Peter Hancock would become Bishop of Bath and Wells in 2014. A few days earlier, the Church Commissioners had announced that the new bishop would work, but <b>not</b> <b>live,</b> <b>in</b> the Palace; it was later announced that he would instead live, at least temporarily, at The Old Rectory a few miles away at Croscombe.|$|E
5|$|By January 1943, Himmler {{reported}} that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million {{residents of the}} annexed Polish territories, {{as well as from}} Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour. Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).|$|E

Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
5|$|The Pawnees did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{their villages}} year-round. In the spring, they planted and hoed crops near their villages. In mid-June, they left on their summer buffalo hunt. In September, they {{returned}} to harvest the crops and to hold their harvest festival; they then cached {{a portion of their}} food in their villages and left on the winter buffalo hunt, from which they did not return until planting time in the spring. Thus the villages were deserted for at least eight months of the year.|$|E

5|$|William Morton Wheeler {{comments}} that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species. This means the ant did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{the soil and}} nested in trees instead. He assumed this due to its long legs, strong claws and long mandibles; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious, equipped with a well developed and powerful sting that was most likely used to kill prey. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations, and is even more primitive in its body structure than Myrmecia. Female stylopids were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{was opposed}} to the {{traditional}} practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts, preferring that diplomats <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who, as Taft put it, would recognize an American when they saw one. High on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France, Henry White, whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe. White's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics. Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London, Whitelaw Reid, but Reid, owner of the New-York Tribune, had backed Taft during the campaign, and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports. Reid remained in place until his 1912 death.|$|E

5|$|The Alford {{area was}} one of the largest medical {{practices}} in the United Kingdom, and in the winter months Forbes often had to travel through ten-foot snowdrifts in a converted Universal Carrier. These conditions were not entirely unfamiliar; a trip to see an uncle in St. Moritz at the age of thirteen had led to him taking up skiing and figure-skating, and winning a number of bob sled races. He did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Alford, but remained at Brux, appointing a medical assistant to live in the town. The farm, left {{in the hands of a}} small resident staff, quickly ran into financial troubles. To raise a large amount of money quickly, Forbes sold the practice in Alford, and returned to the farm in 1952, running it directly as a going concern from then on.|$|E
5|$|The Columbian mammoth shared its habitat {{with other}} now-extinct Pleistocene mammals (such as Glyptodon, Smilodon, ground sloths, Camelops and the American mastodon), horses and buffalos. It did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Arctic Canada, which was {{inhabited}} by woolly mammoths. Fossils of woolly and Columbian mammoths {{have been found}} in the same place in a few areas of North America where their ranges overlapped, including the Hot Springs Site. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths entered southern areas when Columbian mammoth populations were absent. The Columbian mammoth coexisted with the other extinct proboscideans Stegomastodon mirificus and Cuvieronius tropicus at sites in Texas and New Mexico during the early Irvingtonian.|$|E
5|$|The castle was garrisoned {{throughout}} most of the 17th century. In the civil war of the 1640s between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was held for Parliament, {{under the control of the}} Governor of Poole. The castle was refortified and in 1644, Parliament ordered that four pieces of artillery and four chests of muskets be sent to the castle, which by 1646 had a garrison of 20 men. During the Interregnum, the wealthy merchant Sir Robert Clayton bought the surrounding island. Clayton probably did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the castle, however, and it fell into disrepair; by the end of the century the town of Poole refused to garrison the decaying defences.|$|E

5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> camps.
