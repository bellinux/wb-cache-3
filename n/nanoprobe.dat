2500|$|Nanoprobes are {{microscopic}} {{machines that}} inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes perform {{the function of}} maintaining the Borg cybernetic systems, as well as repairing damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed, as well as protecting them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each {{about the size of}} a human red blood cell, travel through the victim's bloodstream and latch on to individual cells. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular DNA, altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body such as electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin, similar to cancers or tumors, which can lead to severe deformation in the skin. In [...] "", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the <b>nanoprobe</b> technology from [...] "Species 149". In addition, the nanoprobes work to maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, allowing both sets of components regenerative capabilities.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nanoprobes</b> with {{multimodal}} functionality {{have attracted}} significant interest recently {{because of their}} potential applications in nanomedicine. This paper reports the successful development of lanthanide-doped Y 2 O 3 <b>nanoprobes</b> for potential applications in optical and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The morphology, structural, and optical properties of these <b>nanoprobes</b> were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and photoluminescence (PL). The cytotoxicity test showed that the prepared lanthanide-doped Y 2 O 3 <b>nanoprobes</b> have good biocompatibility. The obvious contrast enhancement in the T 1 -weighted MR images suggested that these <b>nanoprobes</b> {{can be used as}} a positive contrast agent in MRI. In addition, the clear fluorescence images of the L- 929 cells incubated with the <b>nanoprobes</b> highlight their potential for optical imaging. Overall, these results suggest that prepared lanthanide-doped Y 2 O 3 <b>nanoprobes</b> can be used for simultaneous optical and MR imaging...|$|R
30|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} (Ag) have analogous {{properties to}} gold nanoparticles. Thus, {{they have been}} used in two recent studies to prepare Ag <b>nanoprobes</b> for the detection of target DNA molecules [45, 46]. In these studies, the presence of target DNA was detected by spectral changes in surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles and visual inspection. The advantage of Ag <b>nanoprobes</b> over Au <b>nanoprobes</b> is that due to the greater extinction coefficient of silver nanoparticles in comparison with gold nanoparticles, much lower concentrations of Ag <b>nanoprobes</b> are required to analyze spectral absorption, and thus the sensitivity of Ag <b>nanoprobes</b> are more than that of Au nanoparticles with the same concentration.|$|R
30|$|Another {{problem may}} be related to the {{preparation}} of gold and silver <b>nanoprobes.</b> This step may add some complicacy in the procedure of protein detection with iLAMP-nanoprobe method. However, if the same DNA signal is used for different protein targets, the <b>nanoprobes</b> are the same for different proteins. This can lower the need for preparation of new <b>nanoprobes</b> for every protein target.|$|R

50|$|In summary, a hard X-ray <b>nanoprobe</b> {{provides}} advantages such {{as being}} noninvasive and quantitative, requiring minimal sample preparation, giving sub-optical spatial resolution, having the ability to penetrate inside a sample and study its internal structure, and having enhanced ability to study processes in situ. Another important distinction from charged-particle probes is that X-rays do not interact with applied electric or magnetic fields, which is an advantage for in-field studies. The design of the <b>nanoprobe</b> beamline aims to preserve these potential advantages.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{near-infrared}} emitting long-persistence luminescent Zn 3 Ga 2 Ge 2 O 10 :Cr 3 + (ZGG) nanoparticles with diameters of 30 – 100  nm {{and bright}} luminescence were prepared by a sol–gel synthesis method. After the surface amination, the nanoparticles were further bioconjugated with breast cancer-specific monoclonal antibody (anti-EpCAM) to form ZGG-EpCAM <b>nanoprobes</b> which can specifically target breast cancer cell lines (MCF 7) in vitro. The results of in vitro images {{show that the}} luminescence signals from the cells treated with ZGG-EpCAM <b>nanoprobes</b> are stronger than those from cells treated with ZGG-unconjugated antibody, indicating that the prepared ZGG-EpCAM <b>nanoprobes</b> possessed excellent specific recognition capability. Furthermore, due to their long afterglow properties, the imaging could persist more than 1  h. Therefore, these <b>nanoprobes</b> could not only provide a high specificity detection method for cancer cells but also realize the long-time monitoring. Developed near-infrared emitting long-persistence luminescent <b>nanoprobes</b> {{will be expected to}} find new perspectives for cell therapy research and diagnosis applications.|$|R
40|$|Neutrophils play an {{important}} role in implant-mediated inflammation and infection. Unfortunately, current methods which monitor neutrophil activity, including enzyme measurements and histological evaluation, require many animals and cannot be used to accurately depict the dynamic cellular responses. To understand the neutrophil interactions around implant-mediated inflammation and infection it is critical to develop methods which can monitor in vivo cellular activity in real time. In this study, formyl peptide receptor (FPR) -targeting near-infrared <b>nanoprobes</b> were fabricated. This was accomplished by conjugating near-infrared dye with specific peptides having a high affinity to the FPRs present on activated neutrophils. The ability of FPR-targeting <b>nanoprobes</b> to detect and quantify activated neutrophils was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. As expected, FPR-targeting <b>nanoprobes</b> preferentially accumulated on activated neutrophils in vitro. Following transplantation, FPR-targeting <b>nanoprobes</b> preferentially accumulated at the biomaterial implantation site. Equally important, a strong relationship was observed between the extent of fluorescence intensity in vivo and the number of recruited neutrophils at the implantation site. Furthermore, FPR-targeting <b>nanoprobes</b> may be used to detect and quantify the number of neutrophils responding to a catheter-associated infection. The results show that FPR-targeting <b>nanoprobes</b> may serve as a powerful tool to monitor and measure the extent of neutrophil responses to biomaterial implants in vivo...|$|R

The distribution of the composite nanostructures that are contained in the endosomal system is discussed {{on the basis of}} surface enhanced Raman scattering SERS mapping, quantitative laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry LA ICP MS micromapping, and cryo soft X ray tomography cryo soft XRT.

With advances in the fabrication of zone plate optics, coupled with an optimized beamline design, the performance goal is a spatial resolution of 30 nm.

40|$|<b>Nanoprobes</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components in several fields of nanoscience to study materials, molecules and particles. In scanning probe microscopes, the <b>nanoprobes</b> consist on silicon tips coated with thin metallic films to provide additional properties, such as conductivity. However, if the experiments involve high currents or lateral frictions, the initial properties of the tips can wear out very fast. One possible solution is the use of hard coatings, such as diamond, or making the entire tip out of a precious material (platinum or diamond). However, this strategy is more expensive and the diamond coatings can damage the samples. In this context, the use of graphene as a protective coating for <b>nanoprobes</b> has attracted considerable interest.

50|$|A <b>nanoprobe</b> in {{the real}} world, as opposed to fiction, is an optical device. It was {{developed}} by tapering an optical fiber to a tip measuring 100 nm = 1000 angstroms wide. Also, a very thin coating of silver nanoparticles helps to enhance the Raman scattering effect of the light. (The phenomenon of light reflection from an object when illuminated by a laser light {{is referred to as}} Raman scattering.) The reflected light demonstrates vibration energies unique to each object (samples in this case), which can be characterised and identified. The silver nanoparticles in this technique provides for the rapid oscillations of electrons, adding to vibration energies, and thus enhancing Raman Scattering—commonly known as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).
