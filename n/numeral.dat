5|$|The {{original}} NBN logo, {{featuring the}} <b>numeral</b> three inside a ring {{was replaced by}} several others over the years. The three was used due to the station's frequency allocation, being transmitted on VHF channel 3 from a transmitter atop Mount Sugarloaf near Newcastle. On 22 November 1979 the logo was updated with the letters NBN replacing the <b>numeral</b> three. The blue and green logo coincided with the renaming of the station from Channel Three to the current name, NBN Television, and its parent company renaming from the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation to NBN Limited.|$|E

50|$|<b>Numerals</b> (often called {{numbers in}} Unicode) are {{characters}} or sequences of characters that denote a number. The same Arabic-Indic <b>numerals</b> are used widely in various writing systems {{throughout the world}} and all share the same semantics for denoting numbers. However, the graphemes representing these <b>numerals</b> differ widely from one writing system to another. To support these grapheme differences, Unicode includes encodings of these <b>numerals</b> within many of the script blocks. The decimal digits are repeated in 23 separate blocks: twice in Arabic. Six additional blocks contain the digits again as rich text primarily {{to serve as a}} palette of graphemes for specialized mathematical use. In addition to many forms of the Arabic-Indic <b>numerals,</b> Unicode also includes several less common <b>numerals</b> such as: Aegean <b>numerals,</b> Roman <b>numerals,</b> counting rod <b>numerals,</b> Cuneiform <b>numerals</b> and ancient Greek <b>numerals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>numerals</b> {{used when}} writing numbers with digits or symbols {{can be divided}} into two types that might be called the {{arithmetic}} <b>numerals</b> (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and the geometric <b>numerals</b> (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric <b>numerals</b> and the positional systems use only the arithmetic <b>numerals.</b> A sign-value system does not need arithmetic <b>numerals</b> because they are made by repetition (except for the Ionic system), and a positional system does not need geometric <b>numerals</b> because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses both arithmetic and geometric <b>numerals.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractSymbolic and non-symbolic <b>numerals</b> {{activate}} semantic {{information in}} number comprehension. This study explored whether semantic processing of <b>numerals</b> in production is also produced irrespective of number format. We indexed semantic access with the interference effect {{observed in the}} blocking paradigm (Kroll & Stewart, 1994). Symbolic and non-symbolic <b>numerals</b> were named in a mixed context (<b>numerals</b> and other semantic categories were intermixed) and a blocked context (<b>numerals</b> were grouped by category). Semantic interference was found for non-symbolic <b>numerals</b> but not for symbolic <b>numerals.</b> We concluded that number production does not imply semantic mediation necessarily and that number format makes the difference...|$|R
25|$|Up {{until the}} end of 1942, the RAF always used Roman <b>numerals</b> for mark numbers. 1943–48 was a {{transition}} period during which new aircraft entering service were given Arabic <b>numerals</b> for mark numbers but older aircraft retained their Roman <b>numerals.</b> From 1948 onwards, Arabic <b>numerals</b> were used exclusively. This article adopts the convention of using Roman <b>numerals</b> for the Mks I-XVI and Arabic <b>numerals</b> for the Mks 17–24.

5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a <b>numeral</b> was determined by its position; as a <b>numeral</b> shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Charles was crowned as Charles XI {{does not mean}} that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles.

This {{descendant}} was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E

The Provisional Government of Ireland (Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann) overprints were initially issued on 17 February 1922, with eight low-value and three high-value stamps overprinted by Dollard and four by Thom. This overprint is composed of the four words Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann and the <b>numeral</b> date 1922 arranged in five lines of seriffed text.
