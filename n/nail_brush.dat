The leather is then moisturized and recolored, bringing it back as close to original condition as possible. Connollising involves the leather surface more than the leather itself. Connollising can not fix cracks or extremely dry leather. Connollising fixes the [...] "wear and tear" [...] of the surface due to typical usage and age (and possibly some neglect).|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if nail picks and nail brushes are effective in providing additional decontamination during a surgical hand scrub. One hundred and sixty four operating department staff were randomised to undertake one of the following three surgical hand scrub protocols; chlorhexidine only, chlorhexidine and a nail pick or chlorhexidine and a <b>nail</b> <b>brush.</b> Bacterial hand sampling was conducted before and one hour after scrubbing using a modified version of the glove juice method. No statistically significant differences in bacterial numbers were found between any two of the three intervention groups. Nail brushes and nail picks used during surgical hand scrubs do not decrease bacterial numbers and are unnecessary...|$|E

40|$|Three {{groups of}} {{premises}} (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. Salmonellas were not detected, but Escherichia coli, {{and to a}} lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. Contamination of hands, towels and <b>nail</b> <b>brushes</b> was related to poor working practices. The presence of E. coli or Str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. A number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with E. coli, and many also contained Clostridium perfringens. Fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. The use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. In general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. The possible reasons for this finding are discussed...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods used to detect and kill pathogens. The most effective, as expected, is to cook the meat to a high enough {{temperature}} to kill all growth, but meat can be re-contaminated during any step of the food production process, especially if workers handle both raw and cooked products. The risk of disease from a ready-to-eat (RTE) product such as chicken nuggets is significantly higher {{due to the fact that}} many consumers do not re-cook them, believing them to be safe. E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella have all been found in RTE products. A study of working practices in shops selling raw meats (including butcher’s shops, supermarkets and general stores) published in the Journal of Hygiene, found pathogens on slicing machines, wiping cloths, worker’s hands, towels, and <b>nail</b> <b>brushes.</b> This facilitated the contamination of already cooked meats. This example shows the need of a method of detection. The traditional method is based on using cultures examined under a microscope, which is time-consuming. A method tested in 2005 in a study published in Meat Science, is called multiplex PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and is based on the analyzing of nucleic acid and had promising results.|$|R
40|$|Green nails" or chloronychia is an {{infection}} mostly caused by Pseudomonas ueruginosa {{but also by}} other bacterial or fungal contamination. The clinical appearance consists in a typical triad: green discoloration of the nail plate associated with proximal chronic paronychia and disto-lateral onycholysis. Exposition to moist environment, microtraumatisms, oaychotillomania and associated nail diseases such as psoriasis may promote infection by Pseudomonas. Treatment consists in cutting of the detached <b>nail</b> plate, <b>brushing</b> the <b>nail</b> bed with a 2 % sodium hypochlorite solution twice daily and eviction of the repeated immersions by wearing cotton and latex gloves.

40|$|HCV {{infection}} is a worldwide common health problem having a high affinity for long persistent infections which may develop to considerable changes in liver like hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. HCV is inherently unstable, {{giving rise to}} multiple genotypes and more than 50 subtypes. Mutations that occur during viral replications result in its substantial heterogeneity and overtime in one entity multiple dozen mutant strains may be found. Due to geographical distribution of several different genotypes of Hepatitis C Virus in the world, many of them giving out multiple routes of infection. Constant response to treatment of HCV genotype is a burly forecaster. Assessment of rating and phase is used in evaluating histological outcome in clinical trials or as variables in statistical analyses of progression or therapeutic response. Beginning of amalgamation treatment with ribavirin and interferon has deliberately enhanced clinical result. The achievement of these treatments may be measured in conditions of biochemical comeback and virohistological response. Keeping the above facts in observation the current research is planned {{to find out the}} genotyping of HCV RNA causing persistent hepatitis in interior Sindh and to investigate its association with mode of transmission, histological staging and grading, threat and response to therapy. This multi centric study was conducted at Research Medical Centre of LUMHS Jamshoro, Pathology Department of PUMHS Nawabshah and Biotechnology Department of Karachi University, during August 2006 to December 2009. Blood samples of 344 (239 male and 105 female) patients were collected from medical wards of PUMHC Hospital, LUMHS Hospital, CMC Hospital Larkana, and Muhammadi Medical College Hospital Mirpurkhas to cover the population of the whole the interior Sindh. The suspected patients were informed about the study and who also signed a consent form. ELISA for the presence of HCV antibodies was performed and positive patients were submitted to a laboratorial protocol. The clinical and epidemiological data were recorded on a proforma and various biochemical tests were performed. HCV RNA was detected by RT PCR (Quantitative and Qualitative methods), the first viral load was low in 295 (85. 96 %) cases, medium in 29 (8. 43 %) cases, high in 15 (4. 36 %) and very high in 5 (1. 45 %) cases. The genotying was performed and the results of genotyping revealed that HCV 3 a was the major genotype in 242 (70. 34 %) cases, followed by genotype 3 b in 19 (5. 52 %) cases, genotype 1 a in 10 (2. 61 %) cases, genotype 1 b in 5 (1. 45 %) cases, genotype 2 in 4 (1. 16 %) cases, genotype 5 in 3 (0. 87 %) cases and mixed genotype in 9 (2. 61 %) cases. However no other genotype could be identified in 52 (15. 11 %) cases and hence were considered as â€œuntypableâ€�. Determining the risk factor, majority of the patients 135 (39. 24 %) had parental history of multiple use of needles/syringes followed by minor/major surgery in 64 (18. 60 %) cases and dental procedures, transfusion of blood and blood products in 50 (14. 53 %) cases, needle accidents in 34 (9. 88 %) cases, history of <b>nail</b> clippers, tooth <b>brushes</b> shaving razors, and piercing instruments in 35 (10. 17 %) patients, 10 (2. 9 %) cases had promiscuous sex act history, I/V drug users in 8 (2. 32 %), and tattoo marks in 3 (0. 78 %) cases. The commonest route of transmission in genotype 1 a and 1 b (60 %) was major/minor surgery, each followed by multiple use of needles/syringes needle accidents and IV drug use. While the commonest route of transmission in genotype 3 a, 3 b, 2, 5, mixed and untypable was multiple use of needles and syringes followed from the past blood products, transfusion of blood, surgery, history of shaving of razors etc, I/V drug use promiscuous sexual practice (act) and tattoo marks. Histopathological analysis indicates 38 (11. 04 %) cases in grade A 1, 151 (43. 89 %) in A 2, 117 (34. 01 %) in A 3 and 38 (11. 04 %) cases in A 4 and no case in A 0. Fibrosis seen in stage F 2 and F 1 in 121 (35. 17 %) and 102 (29. 65 %), followed by F 3, F 4 and F 0. In correlation with genotypes most of the cases of 1 a and 1 b fall into A 3, A 4,F 3 and F 4, while most of cases of genotype 3 a, 3 b, 2, 5 fall in A 1, A 2,A 3,F 1 and F 2. The response to combined 6 - 12 months (depending upon genotype) therapy, 276 (80. 23 %) cases showed positive response, while 68 (19. 76 %) showed no response which include 1 a, 1 b, 3 a, mixed and untypable genotypes mostly with high and very high viral load cases. The sustained response to combined therapy showed that 276 (80. 23 %) had positive response after 6 - 12 months of combined therapy, while 214 (62. 20 %) cases had sustained response after 6 months of stopping the combined therapy. Out of 276 cases of positive response with combined antiviral therapy, 272 (98. 55 %) cases showed low level of initial viral load, while out of 68 unresponsive 48 (66. 1 %) showed medium, high and very high level initial viral load. The current study verifies the results of various international researches this is the first ever study conducted which covers the data of the whole interior Sindh. The information gained out of the current study will help improving our understanding of HCV which will be beneficial for clinicians in treating these patients with precise therapy. Furthermore, investigating the association of genotype with histological staging and grading, threat and response to treatment will also show its impact on progression of persistent hepatitis C and curing stratigies...|$|R
