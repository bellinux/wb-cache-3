5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees liability for their acts. This {{is an area that}} has long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E
25|$|The second phase, against 107 {{defendants}} {{consisting of}} suppliers and other product liability parties, {{went to trial}} about 45 days later. After nine months of trial, the Court directed verdicts of <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> in favor of three defendants: Johnson Controls, Inc., represented by Chicago’s Arnstein & Lehr, LLP; Barber Colman, Inc., represented by Boston’s Cooley, Manion, Moore & Jones; and Quantum Chemical, represented by Louisville, Kentucky’s Brown, Todd & Heyburn. A number of the other defendants had settled and trial resumed against 36 remaining defendants on May 14, 1990.|$|E
25|$|Being free ports, as the British Parliament had {{no right}} to levy taxes in the Islands and the Islands {{themselves}} not wishing to levy taxes on goods brought to and then exported again from the Islands, The Channel Islands could import goods from anyone who was not an enemy of Britain, free of British taxes. The local merchants would buy up and supply goods at favourable prices, especially goods taken by privateers. There were no restrictions on whom the goods were sold to, and <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> on the Islanders if the ship subsequently landed those goods without declaring them and paying taxes at their destination.|$|E

Accounting leverage is 1 to 1. The notional amount is $100 ($100 of oil), there are <b>no</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and there is $100 of equity, so notional leverage is 1 to 1. The volatility of the equity {{is equal to the}} volatility of oil, since oil is the only asset and you own the same amount as your equity, so economic leverage is 1 to 1.|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} to Slutzkin of selling instead of liquidating {{the company was}} that selling would be a capital transaction, and therefore tax-free, whereas in liquidation the final dividend distribution would be taxed as income. Cadiz required the company to have only cash assets, and <b>no</b> <b>liabilities,</b> so bank term deposits were called in and remaining liabilities paid out.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} {{contrasting}} judgments where employees have given lifts in their vehicles, during hours of employment, {{as to whether}} their employers can be vicariously liable. Two similar cases demonstrate this problem. The first, Conway v George Wimpey & Co Ltd involved a driver, who, despite express prohibitions, gave a lift to an employee of another firm, and negligently injured him in an accident. <b>No</b> <b>liability</b> was imposed on the employer, as this was deemed to be an activity outside of the employee's duties. This {{can be compared to}} Rose v Plenty, where liability was imposed where a small boy was injured in a road accident, while helping a milkman on his rounds. It has been stated that these two decisions are not reconcilable. However, Lord Denning offered some justification in Rose v Plenty for the distinction, stating that the employee, in allowing the boy to assist him, was not acting outside of his employment, but acting in furtherance of it (through the boy assisting his duties).|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} English textile worker Nellie Kershaw in 1924 from {{pulmonary}} asbestosis {{was the first}} case to be described in medical literature, and the first published account of disease attributed to occupational asbestos exposure. However, her former employers (Turner Brothers Asbestos) denied that asbestosis even existed because the medical condition was not officially recognised at the time. As a result, they accepted <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> for her injuries and paid no compensation, either to Kershaw during her final illness or to her bereaved family after she had died. Even so, {{the findings of the}} inquest into her death were highly influential insofar as they led to a parliamentary enquiry by the British Government. The enquiry formally acknowledged the existence of asbestosis, recognised that it was hazardous to health and concluded that it was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust. Having established the existence of asbestosis on a medical and judicial basis, the report resulted in the first Asbestos Industry Regulations being published in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932.|$|E
500|$|Palsgraf {{was soon}} adopted by some state courts, {{at times in}} {{different}} contexts: Though some state courts outside New York approved it, others did not, sometimes feeling that foreseeability was an issue for the jury to consider. According to Posner, writing in 1990, Cardozo's holding that there is <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> to a plaintiff who {{could not have been}} foreseen [...] "has been followed by a number of states besides New York, but it remains the minority rule. Most states continue to muddle along with the nebulous 'proximate cause' approach, which emphasizes the proximity in time and space of the defendant's careless act to the plaintiff's injury; that was the approach taken by Judge Andrews's dissent in Palsgraf." ...|$|E

500|$|Social hosts {{are given}} more {{liability}} protection than licensed businesses in that a private person is generally only {{liable for the}} actions of guests over 21 if their blood alcohol content is above 0.15, and the lawsuit involves drunk driving injuries. As long as a guest is not underage, a social host has <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> for assaults, falls, and other non-DUI injuries. Although most alcohol-related lawsuits involve parties injured by drunk drivers, there have been cases in New Jersey where drunk drivers were able to successfully sue the establishment that served them.

500|$|Section 2(5) of the Act {{provides}} {{that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> for [...] "risks willingly accepted as his by the visitor", an application of volenti non fit injuria. An occupier can also restrict or exclude liability via a notice providing warnings and conditions of entry, although under section 65 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) this cannot exclude liability for death or personal injury due to negligence where the premises are occupied for the business purposes of the occupier. Before CRA it was treated differently; in Ashdown v Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd [...] 1 QB 409 the Court of Appeal held that an occupier could exclude liability by displaying a notice disclaiming as such, even if the claimant had not read the notice. This provision of the Act has been heavily criticised by commentators.|$|E
500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf {{principle}} to mean that [...] "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf." ...|$|E

5000|$|As a charity, the Children's Hospital held {{a strong}} appeal for the public, and was {{supported}} entirely by contributions and income from paying patients.

500|$|Although some {{perceive}} the settlement as {{an admission of}} guilt, the settlement agreement specifically stated that Jackson admitted no wrongdoing and <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> and legally, a settlement cannot be used as evidence of guilt in future civil and criminal cases. The settlement payment was [...] "for alleged personal injuries arising out of claims of negligence and not for claims of intentional or wrong acts of sexual molestation." [...] In the settlement, both parties agreed they would not speak about the case details in public {{but it did not}} prevent the Chandlers from testifying in a criminal trial or sharing information with authorities in a criminal investigation. The settlement document adamantly states there is no admission of wrongdoing on Jackson's part and no admission of molestation or immodesty and that under no circumstances shall any payment be withheld from the complainants, even if they were to testify against Jackson.|$|E
