5000|$|Necking {{results from}} an {{instability}} during tensile deformation when a material's cross-sectional area decreases by {{a greater proportion}} than the material strain hardens.

5000|$|<b>Necking,</b> <b>in</b> {{engineering}} or materials science, is {{a mode of}} {{tensile deformation}} where relatively large amounts of strain localize disproportionately in a small region of the material. The resulting prominent decrease in local cross-sectional area provides {{the basis for the}} name [...] "neck". Because the local strains in the neck are large, necking is often closely associated with yielding, a form of plastic deformation associated with ductile materials, often metals or polymers. The neck eventually becomes a fracture when enough strain is applied.|$|E

50|$|EMR {{during the}} micro-plastic {{deformation}} and crack propagation from several {{metals and alloys}} and transient magnetic field generation during <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> ferromagnetic metals were reported by Misra (1973-75), which have been confirmed and explored by several researchers. Tudik and Valuev (1980) were able to measure the EMR frequency during tensile fracture of iron and aluminum in the region 1014¬¬ Hz by using photomultipliers. Srilakshmi and Misra (2005a) also reported an additional phenomenon of secondary electromagnetic radiation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys. If a solid material is subjected to stresses of large amplitudes, which can cause plastic deformation and fracture, emissions such as thermal, acoustic, ions, exo-emissions occur. With the discovery of new materials and advancement in instrumentation to measure effects of EMR, crack formation and fracture; the EMR emissions effect becomes important.|$|E

Meanwhile, Charles announces {{he has lost}} his investments, which makes Samuel realize that the Blaisdells are in no position of making wise financial decisions. Obligated by Samuel, Norton refuses a loan, after which Charles begs the Pennocks for money. Pennock Senior (Paul McVey) refuses the loan to Charles and leaves with wife and son Carl the party, which makes clear that the engagement is off. Much to Harriet's distress, the Blaisdell family returns to their old lifestyle. At the end, Roberta reveals that 'John' has won the first prize at an art show, having secretly entered his paintings. Samuel immediately leaves the house to avoid the press, and realizes that the Blaisdells now {{think of him as}} the grandfather he could have been.|$|E

50|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> ductile materials {{is associated with}} geometrical instability in the system. Due to the natural inhomogeneity of the material, {{it is common to}} find some regions with small inclusions or porosity within it or surface, where strain will concentrate, leading to a locally smaller area than other regions. For strain less than the ultimate tensile strain, the increase of work-hardening rate in this region will be greater than the area reduction rate, thereby make this region harder to be further deform than others, so that the instability will be removed, i.e. the materials have abilities to weaken the inhomogeneity before reaching ultimate strain. However, as the strain become larger, the work hardening rate will decreases, so that for now the region with smaller area is weaker than other region, therefore reduction in area will concentrate in this region and the neck becomes more and more pronounced until fracture. After the neck has formed in the materials, further plastic deformation is concentrated in the neck while the remainder of the material undergoes elastic contraction owing to the decrease in tensile force.|$|E
5000|$|Michael's longest {{relationship}} {{to date has}} been with Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), his original-then-former boss from Corporate. Starting with a one-night stand after they closed their business deal at Chilli's in [...] "The Client" [...] (which featured guest star Tim Meadows as the eponymous client), Michael and Jan begin awkward dating, become an official couple, and eventually move in together after Jan is fired from her job — although {{it should be noted}} that Jan usually treated Michael with contempt. After Michael fails to defend Jan in her Wrongful Dismissal suit against Dunder Mifflin, they remain together for a short while, but end up blowing up at each other during an ill-fated dinner party and eventually break up. He also dated Carol (played by Carell's wife Nancy Walls), a real estate agent from whom Michael bought his condominium. Michael was much more interested in Carol than vice versa, and after he made an unwanted and rejected impromptu public marriage proposal, Michael's decision to Photoshop pictures of himself over Carol's ex-husband in her family pictures resulted in their breakup. On a business trip to Winnipeg, Michael & [...] "Concierge Marie" [...] become close, and Michael does not wish to leave her after they are caught <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> her suite. After Jim and Pam's wedding, Michael begins dating Pam's mother Helene (much to Pam's horror), but he breaks up with her on her birthday after discovering she is turning 58. Near the end of season six, Michael begins dating Donna (Amy Pietz), the manager of a local bar, but later finds out that she's married and he is, as he puts it, [...] "the mistress". He continues seeing her until the disgust of his employees drives him to listen to his conscience and break things off with her. In Season 7's [...] "Sex Ed", Michael reunites (in person or by telephone) with all of his aforementioned past girlfriends when he believes that he has contracted herpes. In doing so, he realizes that Holly was the only one he truly loved.|$|E

The effect of rate sensitivity is included in a material model that accounts for a change of yield surface curvature in a rate-insensitive porous ductile solid. Shear band formation under plane strain and axisymmetric tension, and localized <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> biaxially stretched sheets are analyzed by using the present material model. The results illustrate the interactions of the effects of void nucleation and growth, material rate sensitivity and plastic potential surface curvature on plastic flow localization.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} basis is established {{for analysis of}} finite deformation of metals. The observation that finite deformation of such elastoplastic materials {{may be viewed as}} a process rather than an event leads to derivation of a complete initial and boundary value problem distinguished by its quasilinear nature. This feature of the formulation motivates adoption of an incremental approach to numerical problem solving. Numerical solution capability is established for problems of plane stress and plane strain. The validity of the theory and numerical analysis is demonstrated by consideration of a number of problems of homogeneous finite deformation for which analytic solutions are available. Subsequently the analysis is employed for the investigation of <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> flat metal tensile bars. The results of this investigation provide the first full numerical solutions for tensile <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> plane stress and plane strain. In addition a basis is provided for assessment of the validity of stress-strain relations inferred from tensile test data...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{laminated}} composites {{consisting of}} LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene), Al-foil (Aluminum foil) and an adhesive interface layer is focused. The defects like <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> LDPE, Al-foil layer and interfacial delamination can significantly impact the loading {{capacity of the}} laminated material. However, the influence mechanisms of the defects are still unclear, and no appropriate research tool is available. Therefore, the FEM model based on already available techniques in ABAQUS is developed in this work. The aim with the model {{is to create a}} robust numerical analysis tool for further research work. In the modeling process, possibility of <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> substrates and interfacial delamination between material layers is considered. The constitutive material behaviour is elastic-plastic complemented with progressive damage, based on Hooke’s Law, the J 2 yield criterion, isotropic hardening, associated flow-rule and ductile damage model are formulated to demonstrate necking behavior of substrates. In ABAQUS, three modeling techniques, namely VCCT, Cohesive Element, and XFEM, have been used to simulate interfacial delamination. The simulation results are compared with the theoretical results. A uniaxial tension test consisting of a two material laminate is simulated by using these three modeling techniques. The special modelling skills for respective modeling techniques, element type, meshing technique of each model, are also introduced. The comparison with the theoretical results shows <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> substrates and interfacial delamination are also achieved in all three models as expected. Deformation results of the simulation are very close to that of the theoretical analysis. Technique features of VCCT, Cohesive Element and XFEM in modelling of interfacial delamination are analyzed and concluded. These three FEM models can all be utilized according to the requirements of subsequent research.

40|$|International audienceLocalized necking {{is often}} {{considered}} as precursor to failure in metal components. In modern technologies, functional components (e. g., in flexible electronic devices) {{may be affected}} by this necking phenomenon, and to avoid the occurrence of strain localization, elastomer substrates are bonded to the metal layers. This paper proposes {{an investigation of the}} development of localized <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> both freestanding metal layers and elastomer/metal bilayers. Finite strain versions of both rigid–plastic flow theory and deformation theory of plasticity are employed to model the mechanical response of the metal layer. For the elastomer, a neo-Hookean constitutive law is considered. Localized necking is predicted using both bifurcation (whenever possible) and Marciniak–Kuczynski analyses. A variety of numerical results are presented, which pertain to the prediction of localized <b>necking</b> <b>in</b> freestanding metal layers and metal/substrate bilayers. The effects of the constitutive framework and the presence of an elastomer substrate on strain localization predictions have been specifically highlighted. It is demonstrated that the addition of an elastomer layer can retard significantly the occurrence of localized necking. It is also demonstrated that the results of the Marciniak–Kuczynski analysis tend towards the bifurcation predictions in the limit of a vanishing size for the geometric imperfection...|$|E
