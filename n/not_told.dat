5|$|Contingency {{plans for}} the {{continuity}} of government and the evacuation of leaders were implemented soon after the attacks. Congress was <b>not</b> <b>told</b> that the United States had been under a continuity of government status until February 2002.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, WWE {{announced}} {{on its website}} that a supplemental draft would take place on June 25 at noon ET. The supplemental draft, like the previous year, was conducted randomly, with each brand receiving random draft selections. Wrestlers affected by the televised draft were exempt from the supplemental draft. Because professional wrestling is scripted, outcomes are usually predetermined. Unlike years past, during this draft, many employees in WWE were <b>not</b> <b>told</b> whether they were scripted to change brands.|$|E
5|$|The three {{story lines}} are told nonlinearly, each {{separated}} by five centuries. The three periods are interwoven with match cuts and recurring visual motifs; Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play {{the main characters}} in all three narratives. Even within a given narrative, the elements of that particular story are <b>not</b> <b>told</b> in chronological order.|$|E

5|$|Women {{have also}} {{been the subject of}} abuse in health care research, such as the {{situation}} revealed in the Cartwright Inquiry in New Zealand (1988), in which research by two feminist journalists revealed that women with cervical abnormalities were not receiving treatment, as part of an experiment. The women were <b>not</b> <b>told</b> of the abnormalities and several later died.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were <b>not</b> <b>told</b> any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were <b>not</b> <b>told</b> their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors had <b>not</b> <b>told</b> Ruth {{that he had}} cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, buying them expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand near the front, but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was <b>not</b> <b>told</b> about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Howard was <b>not</b> <b>told</b> {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{operation}} until 2May, 1944. His orders were to seize the bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal at Bénouville and Ranville intact and hold them until relieved. The relief force would initially be a company from the 7th Parachute Battalion under Howard's command. When {{the remainder of the}} parachute battalion arrived, he would hand over to their commander Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Pine-Coffin. The 3rd Infantry Division and the commandos of the 1st Commando Brigade were scheduled to land at Sword at 06:00 on the day then advance to the bridges where they were expected to arrive at 11:00.|$|E

5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is <b>not</b> <b>told.</b> The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|On November 24, 1922, Cather {{wrote to}} a friend, Edwin H. Anderson, {{director}} of the New York Public Library, {{that she was the}} author of the entire book except for the first chapter. Burton J. Hendrick had written the first installment, but it had been based largely on rumor. McClure asked her to complete the series because she was regarded as impartial. For the rest of the installments, she told Anderson, no expense had been spared in verifying Milmine's material. McClure had promoted her to managing editor {{on the basis of the}} work. She ended the letter by asking Anderson to keep the information confidential; she added that had <b>not</b> <b>told</b> the truth about it to anyone before this, but felt that someone ought to know.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{arrived at}} Addu Atoll {{on the evening}} of 9 February, and {{anchored}} there to refuel and take on supplies. This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were <b>not</b> <b>told</b> where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted to go ashore, but regarded the sight of the tropical atoll as a welcome change from the arid Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.|$|E

5|$|The jury {{consisted}} of seven men and five women, including one Afro-Caribbean woman. They were <b>not</b> <b>told</b> {{that it was}} Silcott's fourth murder trial, {{that he had been}} out on bail for the murder of Anthony Smith when Blakelock was killed, or that he had subsequently been convicted of that murder. Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided that he should not take the stand to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been cases of {{available}} treatment being withheld during clinical trials. In 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, the drug company Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that {{was known to be}} effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial. Goldacre writes that 11 children died, divided almost equally between the two groups. The families taking part in the trial were apparently <b>not</b> <b>told</b> that the competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available from Médecins Sans Frontières in the next-door building.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{somewhat}} similar to {{elements of the}} 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was <b>not</b> <b>told</b> the reason why.|$|E

5|$|Though Taylor's {{friendship}} and partnership with Clough had been strong, their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion. While at Derby in 1971, Taylor was riled {{when he learned}} that Clough had failed to disclose to him that he had received a pay rise of £5,000 from chairman Sam Longson. He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work with the players. The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough. Taylor had <b>not</b> <b>told</b> Clough that he was writing the book and did not give him a share of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Tomlinson's {{death was}} {{confirmed}} {{in a statement}} that accused protesters of having hampered police efforts to save his life. His family were <b>not</b> <b>told</b> he had died until nine hours after his death. The police and IPCC told journalists that his family were not surprised to hear he had had a heart attack. Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp testified {{after the}} gunfight that {{five or six}} weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel. Ike told Wyatt that Doc Holliday had told him he knew of Ike's {{meetings}} with Wyatt and about Ike providing information on Head, Leonard, and Crane, {{as well as their}} attempted robbery of the stage. Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about these conversations. Earp testified that he told Ike he had <b>not</b> <b>told</b> Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town.|$|E
