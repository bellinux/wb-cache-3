40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} <b>NPK-fertilizer</b> on wheat agronomic parameters and identify the couple of maximum yield and rate of fertilizer according to a response curve. Study Design: A pot (277. 75 cm 2) trial was conducted in randomized complete block design composed of three replications. Place and Duration of the Study: The study was carried out in the botanic center of Felix Houphouet-Boigny University, in Abidjan city located in south Côte d’Ivoire, during three successive cropping cycles of wheat in 2015. Methodology: In 18 pots containing 5 kg of soil as substact, six <b>NPK-fertilizer</b> (15 - 22 - 22) rates (100 kgha- 1, 200 kgha- 1, 300 kgha- 1, 400 kgha- 1, 500 kgha- 1 and 600 kgha- 1) was applied as basal fertilizer. At tillering and boosting stages, 35 kgha- 1 of urea (CO(NH 2) 2; 46 %N) was applied for each pot respective. Results: Wheat response was highly significant (p< 0. 0001) for both linear and quadratic trends of wheat grain yield (GY) {{as well as for the}} total dry matter (TDM). The rates of 400 kgha- 1 and 425 kgha- 1 were relevant to the highest grain yields and total dry matter (11. 02 and 40. 35 g/pot) though, more pronounced trend was accounting significantly for 300 kgha- 1 across the successive trials. Conclusion: Consequently, the rate of 400 kgha- 1 of NPK (15 - 22 - 22) should be the optimum recommended for durum wheat production in the forest zone of south Côte d’Ivoire. Therefore, an investigation of wheat response to K-fertilizer is still required for the improvement of plant vigor...|$|E

In the presented study the energy-plant Sida hermaphrodita (Malvaceae) {{will be used to}} evaluatethe potential to grow this high potential energy-crop on a marginal sandy soil in combination with fertilization viadigestate from biogas production. With this dose-response experiment we will further identify an optimum dose,which will be compared to equivalent doses of <b>NPK-fertilizer.</b> Further, lethal doses and deficiency doses will beobserved. Two weeks old Sida seedlings were transplanted to 1 L pots and fertilized with six doses of digestate(equivalent to a field application of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 t/ha) and three equivalent doses of <b>NPK-fertilizer.</b> Controlplants were left untreated. Sida plants will grow for 45 days under greenhouse conditions. We hypothesize that thenutrient status of the marginal soil can be increased and maintained by defined digestate applications, compared tocontrol plants suffering of nutrient deficiency due to the low nutrient status in the marginal substrate. The dose of 40 t/ha is expected to give a maximum biomass yield without causing toxicity symptoms.

We tested rehabilitation of tracks in a second rotation Acacia mangium plantation in Sabah, Malaysia, by tilling with additions of <b>NPK-fertilizer,</b> ash and organic material {{to a depth of}} 15 – 20 cm. Two years after planting total basal area of A. mangium seedlings was 62 % higher outside tracks compared to unimproved tracks, while on NPK-fertilized tracks performance was 700 % higher compared to unimproved tracks.

For ‘non-tracked’ areas wilting-point (- 1500 kPa) was not reached during 17 days of dry weather, and more meso-pores were present. Consequently, depending on rainfall after planting the effect of soil rehabilitation on tree performance may be less positive than shown here, because dry periods of 2 weeks length are common in the humid tropics. Bulk density on plots outside tracks in this second-generation plantation was 60 % higher than have been reported in similar first generation plantations.

40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{alternative to}} the cultivation of food-based energy crops is the cultivation of dedicated energy crops on marginal lands. To further increase the sustainability of energy cropping the dependency on synthetic fertilizers needs to be reduced via closed nutrient loops in the biomass production cycle. We evaluated {{the growth of the}} high potential energy plant Sida hermaphrodita (sida) on a marginal sandy soil. We compared digestate from biogas production with a commercial mineral <b>NPK-fertilizer</b> and an unfertilized control for a whole growth-period under outdoor conditions, with individual plants growing in large microcosms. To further increase independency from synthetically produced N-fertilizers, the legume plant Medicago sativa was intercropped to fix atmospheric N 2 into the cropping system and to produce additional biomass. NPK fertilization resulted in rapid growth in the first months after planting compared to the organic digestate application, but the latter extended the vegetation period of sida by 20 days. Both fertilization treatments showed a clearly increased biomass production compared with the control plants without any fertilization. Intercropped legume plants fixed additional N into the cropping system and could increase biomass production even though they reduced the yield of sida. We conclude that marginal lands with soil characteristics that do not meet the requirements for conventional crops can be used for biomass production using perennial energy-crops such as Sida hermaphrodita in specially adapted production systems...|$|E

We applied different fertilization treatments using either digestate from biogas production or a commercial mineral <b>NPK-fertilizer.</b> To further increase independence from synthetically produced N-fertilizers, the legume plant Medicago sativa was intercropped to introduce atmospherically fixed nitrogen and potentially facilitate the production of additional S. hermaphrodita biomass. We found digestate to be the best performing fertilizer because it produced similar yields as the NPK fertilization but minimized nitrate leaching. Legume intercropping increased the total biomass yield by more than 100 % compared to S. hermaphrodita single cropping in the fertilized variants. However, it negatively influenced the performance of S. hermaphrodita in the following year. We conclude that a successful establishment of S. hermaphrodita for biomass production in marginal soils is possible and digestate application formed the best fertilization method when considering a range of aspects including overall yield, nitrate leaching, nitrogen fixation of M. sativa, and sustainability over time...|$|E

However, the cultivation of these plants can cause land use conflicts since agricultural soil is mostly used for food crop production. A sustainable alternative to the conventional cultivation of food-based energy-crops is the cultivation of non-food energy crops on marginal lands. To further increase the sustainability of energy crop cultivation systems the dependency on synthetic fertilizers needs to be reduced via closed nutrient loops in the production chain for bioenergy. In the present study Sida hermaphrodita {{was used to evaluate}} its potential as an energy crop to be grown on a marginal sandy soil in combination with a fertilization using digestate from biogas production. With this dose-response experiment we identified an optimum digestate dose of 40 t ha- 1 corresponding to the highest biomass production, which was compared to an equivalent dose of mineral <b>NPK-fertilizer.</b> Further, 240 t ha- 1 had lethal effects on Sida hermaphrodita. A digestate dose of 5 t ha- 1 showed no fertilization effect. Digestate fertilization built up a pool of soil organic matter (SOM). The slow release of nitrogen from this organic pool could serve as long term fertilization and help to limit the high risk of leaching on marginal soils. Accordingly we see a potential of biogas digestate as a sustainable alternative to mineral fertilizers for the cultivation of the energy crop Sida hermaphrodita on marginal soils...|$|E
40|$|Seagrasses {{continue}} to decline {{at an alarming}} rate throughout the planet's temperate regions. After a decline recolonization or restoration starts from small patches of single shoots which then propagate vegetatively. We investigated the effects of plant density within a patch and nutrient resources on growth and survival of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), the dominant seagrass species in the northern temperate zone. We created small (0. 5 m(2)) eelgrass patches by planting single shoots in circular plots at high (20 cm) and low (40 cm distance between shoots) density. In a factorial design, the sediment was nutrient-enriched (1) through biodeposition of transplanted mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) (2) by a slow-release <b>NPK-fertilizer</b> or (3) not enriched. The experiment was run over 1 growth period at a relatively nutrient-poor site (< 30 mu mol NH 4 + l(- 1) porewater) in the Baltic Sea. Mussels increased NH 4 + concentrations and the fertilizer increased both NH 4 + and PO 43 - in the sediment porewater and the overlying water column, but this had only limited effects on eelgrass shoot growth rates and increase in shoot density, which were high overall (up to 75 mm shoot(- 1) d(- 1), doubling shoot density every 3 mo). In contrast, increased plant density had clear positive effects on shoot growth, areal expansion of patches and increase in shoot density. These results suggest that nutrient availability is not a major factor in eelgrass patch colonization or survival in the Baltic.

40|$|Yesterdays common {{fertilizing}} {{strategy was}} to apply phosphor (P) and potassium (K) in the fall {{a few times in}} the crop rotation. In the spring only nitrogen (N) was applied. Recent trials and studies has shown that this strategy, N+P/PK, is ineffective compared with the system where NPK is spread every year in the spring. The strategy with annual <b>NPK-fertilizer</b> in the spring has proven to be better for the crop, the environment and the farmers economy. In the NPK-system the crop responds with higher yields and better quality, especially in the spring cereals. This is mainly because of an interaction between the different nutrients in the fertilizer. Phosphorus increase the crops nitrogen efficiency and potassium increase the phosfor efficiency. Leakage of phosphor must be reduced in order to prevent the ongoing eutrofication of lakes, seas and streams. When applying phosphor in the fall the risk for leakage is greater than if it is applied in the spring. The NPK-strategy therefore means less impact on the environment and better economy because the phosphor stays in the soil available for the crop. NPK-products are more expensive than single fertilizers. Because of this it is often said that the system with annual NPK-fertilizing is more expensive. But when calculating over the entire crop rotation the result is in favour of the NPK-system. This is due to the even more expensive PK-products which are used in the N+PK-system. The N+PK-system also means more applications of fertilizer when spreading P/PK in the fall and the result is additional costs for fuel and labour. The higher yields and improved quality that is often observed in the NPK-system is also beneficial...|$|E

Within the experimental plots, irrigation differentiation was made upon crop evapotranspiration (ETc) measured on a non-weighing lysimeter of 16 m. The treatments included a control, I- 100, irrigated at 100 % of ETc, and two water deficit treatments, I- 80 and I- 60, irrigated at 80 % and 60 %, of ETc, respectively. Prior to planting, all plots received fertilizers broadcast at a rate of 250 kg ha- 1 of <b>NPK-fertilizer</b> (17 %). At 6 -leaf and 12 -leaf stages, ammonium nitrate (34. 5 %) was applied with irrigation water in two applications of 125 kg ha- 1 each. Local groundwater containing 10 mg l- 1 N-NO 3 was used for irrigation. Yield was determined in a final destructive harvest. Crop evapotranspiration reached on the lysimeter a total of 433 mm for a total growing period of 70 days. Results showed that water stress caused by the deficit irrigations significantly reduced leaf number, leaf area index and dry matter accumulation (p< 0. 05). Water deficit also reduced final fresh weight by 20 % to 30 % with comparison to the control. Nitrogen recovery reached 218 kg N ha- 1 at maturity as compared to control, while consistent reductions averaging 35 % and 40 % were observed on I- 80 and I- 60, respectively.

40|$|General {{globalisation}} {{and increasing}} orientation of exporting branches of environmental technology towards {{the so called}} developing countries or threshold countries require new technological approaches which facilitate sustainable management in those countries especially with waste and sewage treatment. In order to protect ground and surface waters and to reduce ecological damages / nutrient discharge there is an urgent demand to remove not only oxygen consuming organic carbon compounds, but for example also ammonia-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater {{in order to prevent}} further eutrophication of the waters. However it is known that this results in a high technological and financial expenditure. The algae reactor developed in the research project makes use of the synergetic effect of heterotrophic and photoauto-/-heterotrophic organisms immobilized on an inert carrier material as biofilm, in order to achieve a purification efficiency that could so far only be reached with costly procedural solutions. The auto- and heterotrophic microalgae and cyanobacteria established in the biofilm contributed to the COD-decomposition and the oxygen supply for the heterotrophic bacteria in the biofilm. This synergetic effect enabled a COD-decomposition of up to 94 %. The developed and tested process allowed for an extensive nitrogen decomposition of up to 80 %. The phosphorus reduction correlated with the content of green algae in the biofilm and amounted up to 40 %. The excess biomass formed during the process could be anaerobically converted into biogas at high methane contents (up to 74 %). Alternatively, the excess biomass could also be utilized as <b>NPK-fertilizer.</b> A first calculation of profitability showed that the compact design and the fact that a technical ventilation of the algae reactor is not necessary because of the oxygen supply for the heterotrophic bacteria by microalgae and cyanobacteria resulted in extensive economies for investment costs and operating expenses compared to an aeration plant dimensioned for 1, 000 pe. The specific technical application of the synergetic effect between photauto-/-photoheterotrophic organisms and heterotrophic bacteria decomposing COD in an algae reactor thus lead to an effective and low-priced decentral sewage treatment process according to the purpose of the project.
