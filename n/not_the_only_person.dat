5|$|Producer Gianni Nunnari was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> {{planning}} {{a film about}} the Battle of Thermopylae; director Michael Mann already planned a film of the battle {{based on the book}} Gates of Fire. Nunnari discovered Frank Miller's graphic novel 300, which impressed him enough to acquire the film rights. 300 was jointly produced by Nunnari and Mark Canton, and Michael B. Gordon wrote the script. Director Zack Snyder was hired in June 2004 as he had attempted to make a film based on Miller's novel before making his debut with the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Snyder then had screenwriter Kurt Johnstad rewrite Gordon's script for production and Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer. Frank Miller's original graphic novel 300 was inspired by the film The 300 Spartans, which Frank Miller first saw at age 6.|$|E

This was supported by female visitors to the set {{who seemed to be}} immediately drawn to Nimoy.|$|E

He believed in [...] "setting aside the area as a pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people" [...] and warned that {{there were those who}} would come and [...] "make merchandise of these beautiful specimens". Worrying the area could face the same fate as Niagara Falls, he concluded the site should [...] "be as free as the air or Water." [...] In his report to the Committee on Public Lands, he concluded that if the bill failed to become law, [...] "the vandals who are now waiting to enter into this wonder-land, will in a single season despoil, beyond recovery, these remarkable curiosities, which have required all the cunning skill of nature thousands of years to prepare".|$|E

In 2002, former Minister for Transport Carl Scully officially {{abandoned}} the corridor, reserved since 1951 for {{the extension of the}} Southern Freeway north to St Peters, and suggested that light rail, bus-only roads or high-frequency train services could run on the corridor. He wished to encourage innovative public transport solutions in the area, while maintaining the green space available near Botany Bay. The plan received support from environmental groups, with environmental transport group EcoTransit proposing their own [...] light rail line to supplement the Illawarra Line on the reservation, called the [...] "Bay Light Express". Since 2005, however, the future of an alternative corridor has been in doubt, with State Treasurer Michael Costa announcing that the corridor would again be reserved for a motorway; however metro lines in Sydney became a reality when the North West Rail Link (now known as simply Sydney Metro Northwest) was approved in 2013 and a rapid transit line supplementing the Illawarra Line may be possible in the future.|$|E
500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E
500|$|The band {{were joined}} by {{familiar}} figures such as Dick Parry and Snowy White, but relations within the band became fraught. [...] Waters took to arriving at the venues alone, departing as soon as each performance was over. [...] On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. [...] The size of the venues was also an issue; in Chicago, the promoters claimed to have sold out the 67,000 person regular capacity of the Soldier Field stadium (after which ticket sales should have been ended), but Waters and O'Rourke were suspicious. [...] They hired a helicopter, photographer and attorney, and discovered that the actual attendance was 95,000; a shortfall to the band of $640,000. [...] The end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who {{felt that they had}} by now achieved the success they originally sought, and that there was nothing else they could look forward to. [...] In July 1977 – on the final date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium – a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who felt depressed about playing to such large audiences, as Gilmour refused to perform a third encore. [...] Waters later spoke with producer Bob Ezrin and told him of his sense of alienation on the tour, and how he sometimes felt like building a wall to separate himself from the audience. [...] The spitting incident would later form the basis of a new concept, which would eventually become one of the band's most successful album releases, The Wall.|$|E

2500|$|Malfatti {{had her own}} solo exhibition, Exposição de Pintura Moderna in São Paulo, Brazil from December 12, 1917 to January 11, 1918. Although Malfatti {{carefully}} chose her artworks {{so as not to}} offendfor example, she omitted her nudes {{from the}} expositionher work was still highly criticized. In New York she had been heralded as another member of the avant-garde artists, but in Brazil her art was not recognized to be a positive contribution in the important search of nationalism and traditions within art. One of the reasons why Malfatti became such a scandal was because her art was displayed as a one-person show. Instead of having many different artists revealing their intentions of bringing Brazilian art into context of globally modernist innovations such as Post-Impressionism or Cubism to Brazil, Malfatti was seen as an individual who caused scandal to the carefully and rather conservatively minded Brazilians whose only desire was to continue the fin-du siecle romantic style. As Batista argues, Malfatti's thought was something similar to, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who paints in this style unfamiliar to you; out there, this is the new, current art many others are experimenting with." [...] However, despite the fact that Malfatti was an artist riding the global wave of thought and style, in Brazil she was simply viewed as an alien artist with no link to the Brazilian culture. Therefore, Malfatti's internationalism only further estranged her from Brazilian's expectations of art and of her art in particular.|$|E
2500|$|Ford was legendary for his {{discipline}} and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; {{he was also}} infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive {{the full force of}} his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a [...] "big idiot" [...] and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from The Searchers) once referred to Ford as [...] "the only man who could make John Wayne cry"[...] He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: [...] "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in Mogambo, was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> to suffer at the hands of John Ford's notorious behaviour. He recalls [...] "Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled {{out in front of the}} entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight." [...] "We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day's work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was as good as his word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour." ...|$|E
