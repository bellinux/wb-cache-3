40|$|Despite the use <b>of</b> <b>windscreens,</b> the {{measurement}} <b>of</b> ambient sound levels or noise emissions in quiet environments can be {{adversely affected by}} wind blowing over the microphone. This is especially true when environmental impact assessments are being carried out for proposed wind turbine power projects where {{the objective is to}} determine the level of background masking noise available as a function of wind speed, since any potential noise impact from the project will only occur under moderately windy conditions. Under calm conditions the project will produce no noise at all. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> products are commercially available for short and long-term sound level monitoring in adverse weather conditions. Generally, these windscreens vary by physical size and the method of preventing water from reaching the microphone. High frequency attenuation effects are usually available from the product suppliers but, in general, low frequency turbulence effects are not available. Consequently, a controlled laboratory test program was carried out in a state-of-the-art wind tunnel at the Fraunhofer Institut fur Bauphysik in Stuttgart, Germany to quantify the level of low frequency interference (down to 6. 3 Hz) associated with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> different foam <b>windscreens</b> and an aerodynamic microphone nose cone. A total of nine configurations were tested with "quiet" airflow only, artificial noise only and noise plus airflow to evaluate both low frequency wind induced noise and high frequency attenuation effects. The test program demonstrated that the largest size foam-based windscreens provided the most protection from flow induced noise due to wind. Flow induced noise by air flow alone was estimated from the study results and compared to community noise measurements at a typical wind turbine site. It was determined that flow induced wind noise does not have a significant or detrimental effect on {{the measurement}} of A-weighted sound levels under wind conditions of concern as long as the suggested measurement techniques described herein are followed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{legislation}} of periodical vehicle inspection, windscreens are examined to see if they fulfil the specifications. Damage to windscreens can cause a decrease of vision and/or crack. On parking places 840 cars were studied at random for such damage. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> laminated glass <b>windscreens</b> has increased much over the last few years. In 1976 / 1977 only 13 % <b>of</b> <b>windscreens</b> were <b>of</b> laminated glass. In 1986 the percentage was already 71 %. Only 5 cars had a crack in the windscreen but in none of these cases was there a real visual hindrance. In the strict application of the current interpretation of the specifications of vehicle inspection more windscreens will be condemned than is really necessary. The presence of cracks in laminated windscreens will generally not lead to sudden visual hindrance. The specifications should therefore be modified...|$|R
40|$|Optimal spatial {{assessment}} of short-time step precipitation for hydrological modelling {{is still an}} important research question considering the poor observation networks for high time resolution data. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to present a new approach for rainfall observation. The idea is to consider motorcars as moving rain gauges with windscreen wipers as sensors to detect precipitation. This idea is easily technically feasible if the cars are provided with GPS and a small memory chip for recording the coordinates, car speed and wiper frequency. This study explores theoretically the benefits of such an approach. For that a valid relationship between wiper speed and rainfall rate considering uncertainty was assumed here. A simple traffic model is applied to generate motorcars on roads in a river basin. Radar data are used as reference rainfall fields. Rainfall from these fields is sampled with a conventional rain gauge network and with several dynamic networks consisting of moving motorcars, using different assumptions such as accuracy levels for measurements and sensor equipment rates for the car networks. Those observed point rainfall data from the different networks are then used to calculate areal rainfall for different scales. Ordinary kriging and indicator kriging are applied for interpolation of the point data with the latter considering uncertain rainfall observation by cars e. g. according to a discrete <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> wiper operation classes. The results are compared with the values from the radar observations. The study is carried out for the 3300 km 2 Bode river basin located in the Harz Mountains in Northern Germany. The results show, that the idea is theoretically feasible and motivate practical experiments. Only a small portion of the cars needed to be equipped with sensors for sufficient areal rainfall estimation. Regarding the required sensitivity of the potential rain sensors in cars it could be shown, that often a few classes for rainfall observation are enough for satisfactory areal rainfall estimation. The findings of the study suggest also a revisiting of the rain gauge network optimisation problem. DW...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to provide a method to simulate the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> laminated glass. The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass is manufactured by pressing a layer of PVB film in between two pieces of glass plates under the high temperature condition. In this study, windscreen models are developed using different combination of glass and PVB with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm & 10 mm). Then each windscreen model was impacted with standard adult headform under LS-DYNA environment and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results show that the behavior <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> developed with double layered shell elements of glass and PVB each with tied element connection simulates best the test results. Furthermore, the influence of fracture stress of glass on the above mentioned windscreen was investigated. It was observed that the area of crack and the peak value of headform acceleration are determined by the critical fracture stress and 50 MPa fracture stress of glass best predicts the headform acceleration level and the cracks <b>of</b> <b>windscreen...</b>|$|R

The wiper motor {{installed}} on the front windshield and worm gears are generally made of one mechanical part. The four-bar linkage of windshield wiper of automobile is driven by motor through worm gears. The method of simulated annealing is a technique that has attracted significant attention as suitable for optimization problems of large scale, especially ones where a desired global extremum is hidden among many, poorer, local extrema.

This time the system's output was not a separate CRT, but instead projected into the existing GGS Mk. II gyro gunsight. The system was fit to Mosquito HK419 some time in late 1943, and sent to the FIU for testing in January 1944. It received widespread praise.|$|R

5000|$|Another wiper design (Fig. 6) is pantograph-based, used on many {{commercial}} vehicles, especially buses {{with large}} windscreens. Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade, with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms. One {{of the arms}} {{is attached to the}} motor, while the other is on an idle pivot. The pantograph mechanism, while being more complex, allows the blade to cover more <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> on each wipe. However, it also usually requires the wiper to be [...] "parked" [...] in the middle <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen,</b> where it may partially obstruct the driver's view when not in use. A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver's side and a normal arm for the passenger. Triumph cars, Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow. The reduced height <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> would need the use of short wiper arms which would not have the reach to the edge <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R

40|$|A good {{knowledge}} of the contact properties between the windscreen and the head during an impact is necessary to obtain a reliable pedestrian-vehicle crash simulation.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the behaviour of a head impact on a windscreen and to design a multibody contact model <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> impact which accounts for rate-dependent damping effects. Subsystem impact tests were used to define contact-impact characteristics that correctly account for damping. Two phases can be distinguished in these characteristics. The first part corresponds to the bending and the fracture <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> whereas the second part corresponds to the bending <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> once it is broken. The characteristics were then implemented in a multibody model and the subsystem impact tests were simulated in order to validate it by comparison with experimental tests. The results from the numerical windscreen model are consistent with the results from the subsystem tests. Comparison of head injury criterion (HIC) values gives an additional validation of the consistency of our model. Contact properties, multibody simulation, pedestrian-vehicle cras...|$|R

40|$|The wear <b>of</b> the <b>windscreens</b> as one {{important}} traffic safety {{problem has been}} observed in many studies. Transmission loss <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> could {{play an important role}} in a person‟s possibilities to detect objects on the road. It has been estimated that up to 90 % of the information used by drivers to drive their cars is visual. When driving with a worn <b>windscreen,</b> the risk <b>of</b> dazzling increases. It can lead to the consequence that the driver does not discover objects or people in the driving environment. The goal with this thesis is to propose a method for quantitative measurement of the visibility degradation on worn windscreens. It should correlate with customer expectations which require a quick and easy method. This test should be possible to apply at the annual quality check of automobiles at motor vehicle inspection. The thesis work was carried out at Industrial metrology and optics, of the school of Industrial Engineering and Management, Kungliga Tekniska högskolan with support of Svenska Glaskontroll AB. The transparency degradation <b>of</b> a <b>windscreen</b> mainly caused by the incident light beam diffusion due to scattering at small surface defects such as scratches and impact sites. As worn windscreens have more surface defects, the scattering of incident light would be stronger than the new ones, which could cause more windscreen transmission loss. In this thesis we measured the light scattering on four windscreens with different mileages by digital photography techniques. The test was undergoing at a fixed light angle, which is according to the test done in the Swedish Road and Traffic Safety Institute (VTI). Four windscreens were investigated with mileages of 0 km, 26000 km, 107945 km, 170000 km.

50|$|First {{seen on the}} 1985 Ford Scorpio/Granada Mk. III in Europe and the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable in the U.S., {{the system}} uses a mesh of very thin heating wires, or a silver/zinc oxide coated film {{embedded}} between two layers <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> glass. The overall effect when operative was defogging and defrosting <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> {{at a very high}} rate. Landrover (UK) also fitted a similar screen to their Discovery range in the early 1990s, some of which were imported to Australia undetected by authorities, because at that stage they were not legal in any state. Owing to the high current draw, the system is engineered to operate only when the engine is running, and normally switches off after 10 minutes of operation. The metallic content of the glass has been shown to degrade the performance of certain windshield-mounted accessories, such as GPS navigators, telephone antennas and radar detectors.|$|R
