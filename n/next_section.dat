5|$|Because of its {{significance}} for planetary cores, the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures {{have also been}} studied extensively. The form of iron that is stable under standard conditions can be subjected to pressures up to ca. 15GPa before transforming into a high-pressure form, {{as described in the}} <b>next</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} started in 1918 and was {{finished}} in 1921. The station, excluding its water tower and restaurant, cost 117,062 Norwegian krone (NOK) to build and took 26,883 man-hours. The station and axillary buildings were designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektkontor. The station opened with {{the first part of}} the Rauma Line on 19 November 1921. It remained the terminus until 25 November 1923, when the <b>next</b> <b>section,</b> to Verma Station, opened.|$|E

5|$|The Y shape {{formed by}} the A8 and the A9 routes was {{originally}} defined by highway planning documents decided upon in Rijeka and Istria, subsequently incorporated in highway planning documents of the Republic of Croatia in 1988. Lupoglav–Cerovlje was the <b>next</b> <b>section</b> to be completed, in 1988. The A8 route was extended to the Rogovići interchange between 1992 and 1998 and the remaining section to Kanfanar was completed in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>section</b> {{accuses the}} Dissenters of {{involvement}} with various notorious and hideous {{events of the}} past century, including the English Civil War and Monmouth's Rebellion. The accusations become increasingly sinister, and at points the speaker directly addresses the Dissenters ("You have butchered one King! deposed another King! and made a Mock King of a third!"). A brief history is given of how past monarchs—from James I to William III—have treated the Dissenters; in the opinion of the speaker, it is too leniently.|$|E
5|$|Haas' early third {{millennium}} dates {{suggest that the}} development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast. The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see <b>next</b> <b>section).</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin {{was removed}} and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was {{extended}} to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector until the <b>next</b> <b>section</b> south to Plainwell opened the next year. After this next freeway segment was opened, M-118 was truncated to end at the freeway.|$|E

5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the <b>next</b> <b>section,</b> to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see <b>next</b> <b>section)</b> of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} clues {{to the location of}} Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see <b>next</b> <b>section).</b> The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} less action-oriented {{segments}} in the game, where players have to solve environmental puzzles, which usually {{function as a}} 3D platformer. With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into the <b>next</b> <b>section</b> of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping time, {{so that he can}} proceed without getting hurt. He can also revive frozen non-playable characters at several specific points of the game.|$|E
5|$|In another {{hundred years}} or more two groups arrived and settled the upper San River basin (270–170 BC) and the Kraków area respectively. This last one, {{together}} with the local population developing at about that time the Przeworsk culture characteristics (see the <b>next</b> <b>section),</b> formed the mixed Tyniec group, in existence 270–30 BC. The rise of the Tyniec group took place in particular about 80–70 BC, when the existing settlements received Celtic reinforcements from the more southern populations being displaced from Slovakia by the Dacians. In the 1st century BC another small group settled probably much further north, in Kujawy. And finally there was the long-lasting (270 BC - 170 AD) mixed Púchov culture, associated based on Roman sources with the Celtic Cotini, whose northern reaches included parts of the Beskids mountain range and even the Kraków area.|$|E
5|$|The District {{also had}} {{parliamentary}} permission to extend westward from Brompton (Gloucester Road) station and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a single track line {{from there to}} West Brompton on the West London Railway. There were no intermediate stations and this service initially operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 additional tracks had been laid between South Kensington to Brompton (Gloucester Road) and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton (Gloucester Road) and Kensington (High Street). East of Westminster, the <b>next</b> <b>section</b> ran in the newly constructed Victoria Embankment built by the Metropolitan Board of Works along the north bank of the River Thames. The line was opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 with stations at Charing Cross (now Embankment), The Temple (now Temple) and Blackfriars.|$|E
