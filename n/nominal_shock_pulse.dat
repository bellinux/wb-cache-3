40|$|The {{propagation}} of <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks</b> is analyzed in a fully specified stochastic intertemporal two-country model. We show {{how to solve}} for the equilibrium analytically and analyze the role of real and nominal propagation mechanisms. First we consider the dynamic implications of <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks</b> having an impact effect due to one-period nominal contracts when the propagation over time runs via a basic real propagation mechanism in open economies (current account). We find that this case is characterized by strong persistency in the real effects of <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks,</b> but the dynamic adjustment path is strongly at odds with empirical evidence. Secondly, we introduce a nominal propagation mechanism {{in the form of}} staggered nominal contracts. This turns out to imply a radical change in the dynamic response to <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks,</b> and to generate a dynamic adjustment path of the form observed empirically.

This propagation mechanism leads to a persistent real e. ect (on relative prices, factor rewards, capital accumulation) of <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks,</b> which disappears gradually through money outflow (trade deficit).

In {{the last two}} decades, the Myanmar kyat exchange rate of the parallel market has exhibited the sharpest fluctuations among Southeast Asian currencies in real terms. Since the move to a managed float regime in April 2012, the question arises of whether exchange rate policies will be effective in stabilizing the real exchange rate. This paper investigates the sources of fluctuations in the {{real effective exchange rate}} using Blanchard and Quah’s (1989) structural vector autoregression model. As <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks</b> can be created by exchange rate policies, a persistent impact of a <b>nominal</b> <b>shock</b> implies more room for exchange rate policies. Decomposition of the fluctuations into <b>nominal</b> and real <b>shocks</b> indicates that the impact of <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks</b> is small and quickly diminishes, implying that complementary sterilization is necessary for effective foreign exchange market interventions...|$|R

We use a time-varying structural vector autoregression to investigate the role of demand, supply and <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks</b> and consider their impact on, and contribution to fluctuations in, the real exchange rate, output growth and inflation in four major economies over the past four decades. Our analysis therefore extends recent empirical research on evolving macroeconomic dynamics which has primarily focused on inflation and output and the time-varying impact of monetary policy on these variables. In addition we generalise recent VAR studies on exchange rate dynamics where the analysis is limited to a time-invariant setting. Our main results are as follows. The transmission of demand, supply and <b>nominal</b> <b>shocks</b> to the real exchange rate, output and inflation has changed substantially over time.
