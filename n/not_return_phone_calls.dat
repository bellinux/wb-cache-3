She later told police that as she entered the bedroom, she noticed the bed in disarray, the comforter draped over the side, and the sheets pulled off one side of the mattress. As she drew closer, she noticed a very small stain of blood, spattered on the bed frame. Carpenter then made her way to the walk-in-closet, where she found Nancy Pfister's lifeless body. Carpenter immediately called 911, and investigators arrived to examine the body before taking it to the crime lab. Nancy Pfister had a large gash in her torso, where she had been struck with an ax. The wounds to Nancy Pfister's face were later determined to have been caused by someone beating her with a hammer. There were no defense wounds on Nancy Pfister's body, which led the medical examiner to believe that Nancy had been beaten while she slept. He determined that the cause of her death was due to blunt force trauma to the head. Pfister's memorial service was held at Hotel Jerome, her favorite place in Aspen.

40|$|Justice Albertis S. Harrison Jr. will shortly {{announce}} his retirement from the Supreme Court of Virginia, sources told the Times-Dispatch yesterday. Harrison, {{a former governor}} and conservative Democrat from Southside Virginia, began his 15 th year on bench in October. Reached yesterday, Harrison {{said he was not}} resigning from the court but added that if he had plans to step down, he would notify the governor first before making any announcement. Gov. John N. Dalton and Gov. -elect Charles S. Robb, both in Williamsburg, said they had heard something of Harrison 2 ̆ 7 s plans. Robb said that Harrison was the one to make any such announcement, though. The announcement is expected to come next week and the retirement to take effect next month to allow the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to appoint his successor. It has been expected for some time. Harrison will be 75 on Jan. 11, the mandatory retirement age affecting him since he was named to the court before July 1, 1970. Justices appointed after that date must retire at age 70. Timing Important The timing of the announcement was considered the only uncertain point. Had Harrison chosen to retire before the next regular legislative session convened, Republican Gov. John N. Dalton would have been entitled to make an interim appointment to the bench. Speculation on his successor is already rife. Possibly topping the list is William B. Spong Jr., 61, former U. S. senator, current dean of the College of William and Mary law school and a former law partner of Lt. Gov. -elect Richard J. Davis. Spong also has been mentioned as a possible Democratic candidate for retiring Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr. 2 ̆ 7 s seat. But sources at the state Capitol and in Williamsburg say Spong would prefer a seat on the state Supreme Court. Colleagues of Spong 2 ̆ 7 s say privately that he has been approached in recent weeks to see if he would be interested in filling a coming court vacancy. Spong has <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> from reporters inquiring about his plans. But there are others on the list of potential successors, particularly some of those disappointed when the legislature chose Roscoe B. Stephenson Jr. of Covington to succeed Chief Justice Lawrence W. I 2 ̆ 7 Anson last year. Former Lt. Gov. Henry Howell and circuit judges Marvin F. Cole of Richmond, Charles S. Russell of Arlington, Nelson T. Overton of Hampton, Douglas M. Smith of Newport News and Austin E. Owen of Virginia Beach were among those considered last year before Stephenson was chosen. Another judge, Thomas R. McNamara of Norfolk, was mentioned as well last time. Nor can someone from Southside be ruled out. A native and lifelong resident of Lawrenceville, in Brunswick County, Harrison provided a justice from that area of the state, and geographic balance on the court may be a point the legislature would take into consideration. The court Harrison has served on has had a reputation for being conservative in its opinions, and most observers believe he fit well into that type of court. Harrison was the first ex-governor to be appointed to the state 2 ̆ 7 s highest court since 1811. Gov. Mills E. Godwin Jr. named him in 1967 to succeed Justice C. Vernon Spratley of Hampton. Over the course of a 30 -year political career in Virginia, Harrison rose slowly but surely through the ranks of elective office, moving from the commonwealth attorney 2 ̆ 7 s office in his home county to the governor 2 ̆ 7 s mansion in Richmond. A 1928 graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, Harrison served for a period as town attorney of Lawrenceville and for 14 years as commonwealth 2 ̆ 7 s attorney for Brunswick County after winning his first election in 1934. In 1948, {{he was elected to the}} state Senate from the area and served 10 years. He ran successfully for attorney general in 1958, but resigned in 1961 to successfully run for governor. As governor, Harrison strongly emphasized improvements in education and industrial development. The beginnings of the community college system and the creation of new centers for technical education, new highways, increased industry and improvements to Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s ports and a smoother system of tax collection are considered his legacy...|$|R
40|$|The Democratic state central {{committee}} decided {{yesterday that the}} party 2 ̆ 7 s 1982 U. S. Senate candidate will be chosen at a convention in Roanoke June 4 - 5. The June 4 - 5 date means the Democrats will be choosing their Senate nominee the same weekend as state Republicans and will mark {{the first time in}} modern Virginia political history that the two parties have held conventions at the same time. But few members of the Democratic committee [...] its dominant mood was euphoric because of the party 2 ̆ 7 s sweep of the three statewide offices last month [...] expressed concern about the conflict of dates with the Republicans who will stage their convention in Richmond. The euphoria also was reflected in the standing ovations and cheers that greeted Gov. -elect Charles S. Robb and his running mates, Lt. Gov. -elect Richard J. Davis and Attorney General-elect Gerald L. Baliles. Each made a short thank-you speech and envisioned the leadership Democrats, who had not elected a governor since 1965, would provide Virginia. And the euphoria was reflected when James S. Cremins, a Richmond railroad lawyer who is state party treasurer and who ordinarily speaks in conservative tones, gave not a financial report, but a rousing post-election pep talk. Democrats, Cremins said, are a 2 ̆ 2 vital force 2 ̆ 2 again. But the euphoria was coupled with uncertainty over whom the 1982 Democratic Senate nominee will be and whether {{he will be able to}} maintain the party as Cremins 2 ̆ 7 vital force. Not surprisingly, committee members talked in small groups of prospective candidates; some of whom were present at yesterday 2 ̆ 7 s meeting. Among those there who have been mentioned as possible candidates were former Attorney General Andrew P. Miller, a narrow loser in 1978 to Sen. John W. Warner, and state Sens. Hunter B. Andrews of Hampton and Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. of Fairfax. And Del. Owen B. Pickett of Virginia Beach was there in his role as state party chairman. But the man who emerged as the favorite of many of the committee members was one who was not there [...] former Sen. William B. Spong Jr., who is dean of the College of William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Marshall-Wythe law school and who has <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> from reporters wanting to ask if he would consider running. Spong was the winner of an unscientific, informal poll of committee members who were asked to name their top three choices for Senate nomination. Votes were weighted on a 3 - 2 - 1 point basis and Spong had 137 points. Trailing him were Miller (118), Andrews (95), and Pickett (81). Spong served one term in the Senate and was defeated in 1972 by former Sen. William L. Scott, in part because of poor campaign organization and because he was victim of one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s first negative media advertising campaigns. A possible Spong candidacy reportedly also received warm support at a Friday night meeting of a broad range of white and black party leaders. The meeting drew national committeemen, state party officers, General Assembly members and at least two congressional district chairmen, Angus H. Macaulay of the 3 rd and Robert Crouch of the 5 th. There also were expressions of backing for Pickett, who was viewed as a man who would be able, as Robb did, to command support from the state 2 ̆ 7 s financial establishment. One source denied that the meeting had been designed to launch a stop-Miller movement. But another source said that some at the meeting talked of Miller, who also was a narrow loser to Henry Howell in the divisive 1977 gubernatorial primary, as a 2 ̆ 2 man who has had his chances. 2 ̆ 2 Crouch acted as official spokesperson for those who attended the meeting. His only comment on what was discussed was 2 ̆ 2 we talked about everybody who has been mentioned by the Great Mentioner. 2 ̆ 2 Crouch said the group will meet again in January, with its goal being to achieve party unity behind what it perceives the strongest. A search for party unity was the reason Democrats, who traditionally have chosen candidates in a primary, will name their 1982 Senate candidate at a convention. The Democrats 2 ̆ 7 first convention to name a Senate candidate in more than three decades was in 1978 when Miller was nominated. In voting to hold the 1982 convention in Roanoke, the {{central committee}} endorsed a recommendation by the Democratic steering committee, which met yesterday morning. A proposal by a smattering of Northern Virginia central committee members to hold a primary was rejected by a voice vote. The steering committee briefly considered a May 21 - 22 convention, but abandoned that idea because, one of its members said later, 2 ̆ 2 almost every college and high school in Virginia is holding graduation that weekend. 2 ̆ 2 In other action, the central committee approved the addition of a representative of the Democratic Black Caucus to the policy-making steering committee. The move was urged as a means of recognizing the overwhelming black support for Robb, Davis and Baliles...|$|R
