5|$|In September 1937 the German {{government}} again {{requested that}} Lody's body be exhumed {{and moved to}} a separate grave. This proved impractical for several reasons; he had been buried with seven other men, each coffin had been cemented down and the lapse of time would make identification very difficult. Instead, the British Imperial War Graves Commission suggested that a memorial should be constructed {{in another part of the}} cemetery to bear the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> German civilians who were buried there. The proposal met with German agreement and the memorial was duly installed. During the Second World War, Lody's original headstone was destroyed by misaimed Luftwaffe bombs. It was replaced in 1974.|$|E

Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

5|$|The loyalist force {{marched to}} the Hippodrome, where they drove away most of John's supporters. They then entered the palace, where they found scarce {{opposition}} from John's attendants. John was captured after a short chase in the palace and his head was immediately cut off, to be displayed {{the next morning at}} the Forum of Constantine, while his body was displayed at Blachernae. A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night, while others were captured and tortured to extract the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> conspirators. Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in this affair (he is known to have been in prison in 1203), and the two Komnenos brothers, Alexios and David, seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup's failure.|$|E
5|$|Mick {{encounters}} two vampires who {{are looking}} for Coraline. Once they leave, Mick visits his vampire friend Josef, who tells him that one of them was Lance (Jason Butler Harner), a rich and powerful vampire. Mick finds Coraline at a storage facility working on a compound for the vampire cure. Coraline explains that during the French Revolution there were seven siblings of royal blood who were vampires, two of whom were Lance and Coraline. She then uses the compound to cure Mick's vampirism, although Lance arrives and takes her away. Mick enjoys life as a human, although the cure is only temporary. Beth's boss at BuzzWire is killed, and a new assistant district attorney named Benjamin Talbot (Eric Winter) investigates the murder. Mick and Beth discuss the problems of having a romantic relationship, and although they end up kissing, Mick tells her he needs time to figure things out. Photos of Mick getting hit by a vehicle find their way into the hands of Talbot. Mick and Beth decide to start a romantic relationship, and go to a restaurant for their first date. When Beth quits her job at BuzzWire and becomes unemployed, Talbot offers her a job as a civilian investigator. Talbot receives a list of <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> vampires in the area, including Mick, from an unknown source. Beth tells Mick that she cannot continue to date him because of their vampire-human situation, but Mick says that he loves her and they kiss.|$|E

It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh's solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others. The inside of the original propeller spinner can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This propeller spinner was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. The propeller spinner that is on the Spirit of St. Louis now was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{early years}} of the CFL saw corrupt and reform {{elements}} battle for control. The CFL's constitution required an election for the presidency every six months, which encouraged instability, and a new president was elected roughly every year in the organization's first decade. Elections were also rife with fraud and violence. In January 1903, Madden arranged to have the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> reform candidates placed low on the ballot, many names were misspelled to deny the candidate election, and some names omitted altogether. Unions on both sides padded their membership lists in order to have more delegates to the convention. At least seven major brawls broke out on the convention floor, and one man was injured so badly he had to be rushed to the hospital. Only police intervention brought order. The July 1904 election saw such widespread violence (including fistfights in front of the ballot boxes). Three brawlers had to be carried home.|$|E
