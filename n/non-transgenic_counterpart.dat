40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión pre-print. The {{development}} {{of genetically modified}} crops has had {{a great impact on}} the agriculture and food industries. However, the {{development of}} any genetically modified organism (GMO) requires the application of analytical procedures to confirm the equivalence of the GMO compared to its isogenic <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart.</b> Moreover, the use of GMOs in foods and agriculture faces numerous criticisms from consumers and ecological organizations that have led some countries to regulate their production, growth, and commercialization. These regulations have brought about the need of new and more powerful analytical methods to face the complexity of this topic. In this regard, MS-based technologies are increasingly used for GMOs analysis to provide very useful information on GMO composition (e. g., metabolites, proteins). This review focuses on the MS-based analytical methodologies used to characterize genetically modified crops (also called transgenic crops). First, an overview on genetically modified crops development is provided, together with the main difficulties of their analysis. Next, the different MS-based analytical approaches applied to characterize GM crops are critically discussed, and include “-omics” approaches and target-based approaches. These methodologies allow the study of intended and unintended effects that result from the genetic transformation. This information is considered to be essential to corroborate (or not) the equivalence of the GM crop with its isogenic <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|While {{there are}} many reports in the {{literature}} describing the attributes of specific applications of transgenic animals for agriculture, there are relatively few studies focusing on the fitness of the transgenic animals themselves. This work was designed to gather information on genetically modified food animals {{to determine if the}} presence of a transgene can impact general animal production traits. More specifically, we used a line of transgenic dairy goats expressing human lysozyme in their mammary gland to evaluate the reproductive fitness and growth and development of these animals compared to their <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts</b> and the impact of consuming a transgenic food product, lysozyme-containing milk. In males, none of the parameters of semen quality, including semen volume and concentration, total sperm per ejaculate, sperm morphology, viability and motility, were significantly different between transgenic bucks and non-transgenic full-sib controls. Likewise, transgenic females of this line did not significantly differ in the reproductive traits of gestation length and litter size compared to their <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts.</b> To evaluate growth, transgenic and non-transgenic kid goats received colostrum and milk from either transgenic or non-transgenic does from birth until weaning. Neither the presence of the transgene nor the consumption of milk from transgenic animals significantly affected birth weight, weaning weight, overall gain and post-wean gain. These results indicate that the analyzed reproductive and growth traits were not regularly or substantially impacted by the presence or expression of the transgene. The evaluation of these general parameters is an important aspect of defining the safety of applying transgenic technology to animal agriculture...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} with 26 maize hybrids including two genetically modified (Bt-transformation) ones and their <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts</b> was aimed to observe infection by maize car rot caused by Fusarium species and infestation by European corn borer.

40|$|The insect {{resistant}} maize YieldGard MON 810 was {{studied to}} assess {{the extent to which}} introduction of a transgene may putatively alter the expression of endogenous genes by comparison of various GM lines vs. their <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts.</b> To assess the extent to which introduction of a transgene may putatively alter the expression of endogenous genes, GM lines of the insect resistant maize YieldGard MON 810 were compared with <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts.</b> For a more in-depth study, high-throughput deep sequencing together with microarrays were used to compare the transcriptomes of immature embryos of the MON 810 variety DKC 6575, with a cryIA(b) transgene, and its near-isogenic variety Tietar, grown under controlled environmental conditions. This technique also allows characterisation of the transgenic mRNAs produced. 3 ′UTR-anchored mRNA-seq produced 1, 802, 571 sequences from DKC 6575 and 1, 170, 973 from Tietar, which mapped to 14, 712 and 14, 854 unigenes, respectively. Up to 32 reads from the transgenic embryos matched to the synthetic cry 1 A(b) sequence, similar to medium-abundant mRNAs. Gene expression analysis, using the R-bioconductor packages EdgeR and DEseq, revealed 140 differentially expressed genes mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism and chromatin organisation. Comparison of the expression of 30 selected genes in two additional MON 810 and near-isogenic variety pairs showed that most of them were differentially expressed in the three pairs of varieties analysed. Analysis of functional annotation and the precise moment of expression of the differentially expressed genes and physiological data obtained suggest a slight but significant delay in seed and plant maturation of MON 810 plants. However, these transcriptomic changes were not associated to undesirable changes in the global phenotype or plant behaviour. Moreover, while most expression changes in MON 810 immature embryos were maintained in other transgenic varieties, some gene expression was found to be modulated by the genetic background in which the transgene was introduced through conventional breeding programs...|$|R

Abstract: Genetically modified (GM) crops {{account for a}} large proportion of modern agriculture worldwide, raising increasingly the public concerns of safety. Generally, according to substantial equivalence principle, if aGMcrop is demonstrated to be equivalently safe to its conventional species, {{it is supposed to be}} safe. In this study, taking the advantage of an established non-target metabolomic profiling platform based on the combination of UPLC-MS/MS with GC–MS, we compared the mature seed metabolic changes in transgenicmaize over-expressing the Aspergillus niger phyA 2 with its <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart</b> and other 14 conventional maize lines. In total, levels of nine out of identified 210 metabolites were significantly changed in transgenic maize as compared with its <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart,</b> and the number of significantly altered metabolites was reduced to only four when the natural variations were taken into consideration. Notably, those four metabolites were all associated with targeted engineering pathway. Our results indicated that although both intended and non-intended metabolic changes occurred in the mature seeds of this GM maize event, only intended metabolic pathway was found to be out of the range of the natural metabolic variation in the metabolome of the transgenic maize. Therefore, only when natural metabolic variation was taken into account, could non-targeted metabolomics provide reliable objective compositional substantial equivalence analysis on GM crops.

40|$|Competitive {{ability of}} {{transgenic}} oilseed rape transformed with a pea lectin gene was estimated by comparisons of its performance when grown {{in a mixture}} with its <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart</b> and when grown singly, with and without pollen beetles present. The experiments were carried out in cages, once with bumblebees as pollinators and once without. In the absence of herbivory but {{with the presence of}} bumblebees, singly grown plant lines without lectin generally performed better than lines with lectin. Pollen beetles affected plant growth and reproduction, but there were no consistent differences between the lectin and non-lectin plant lines indicating that the transgenic trait did not protect plants from pest attack. Herbivory reduced the number of seeds when bumblebees were present. In the absence of bumblebees, however, plants produced more seeds with pollen beetles than without, indicating that some pollination was carried out by the beetles. Efficient pollination affected the competitive abilities of the lines; lectin lines were more competitive with bumblebees present and the reverse was true when bumblebees were absent. In the presence of bumblebees, lectin lines gained from being grown mixed with its <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart.</b> Because the transgenic plants expressed pea lectin in developing pollen it is possible that pollen quality in those plants was reduced, which may explain why the lectin lines had an advantage over non-lectin lines when exchange of pollen between the two plant types was facilitated by bumblebees...|$|E

Methodology: To investigate the role of mutant p 53 in lung tumorigenesis, a lung specific p 53 (273 H) transgenic mouse model was developed. Rates of lung cancer formation in the transgenic animals and their littermates were evaluated by necropsy studies performed in progressive age cohorts ranging from 4 to 24 months. In order to establish the influence of other common genetic abnormalities in lung tumor formation in the animals, K-Ras gene mutation and p 16 INK 4 a (p 16) promoter methylation were evaluated in a total of 281 transgenic mice and 189 non-transgenic littermates.

40|$|The {{influence}} of food deprivation on {{the rate of}} oxygen consumption {{and the rate of}} mobilization/utilization of energy reserves in F 2 generation growth-enhanced transgenic Atlantic salmon were compared relative to their <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts,</b> over a pre-smolt weight interval of 8 to 55 g. Throughout most of the 8 weeks of food deprivation, transgenic fish exhibited a greater rate of oxygen consumption compared to control salmon, but also exhibited a more rapid decline in oxygen consumption as starvation progressed. Consequently, depending on initial weight and length of food deprivation, the rate of oxygen consumption of transgenic fish declined to where it equalled or was less than the oxygen consumption of control fish. Transgenic fish depleted body protein, dry matter, lipid and energy at a faster rate than did the controls. Additionally, in both groups, lipid was catabolized faster than was protein. Although transgenic fish demonstrated the ability to reduce their metabolic rate during starvation, as also observed in the non-genetically modified control salmon, their persistence in maintaining a higher metabolic rate, combined with their lower initial endogenous energy reserves, suggests that the likelihood of growth-enhanced transgenic salmon achieving maximum growth or even surviving outside intensive culture conditions may be lower than that of non-transgenic salmon. ...|$|R

Time-course metabolic changes of wild and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants after insecticide treatment were investigated by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A combined statistical strategy of 2 -way ANOVA and multivariate analyses (principal component analysis and hierarchal cluster analysis) was performed to find the stress-associated effects. The results reveal that {{a wide range of}} metabolites were dynamically varied in both varieties as a response to insecticide, in multiple metabolic pathways, such as biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, TCA cycle, and the shikimate/phenylpropanoid pathway, and most of the changes were correlated with the exposure time and dependent on the variety. A set of stress defenses were activated, including phytohormone signaling pathway, antioxidant defense system, shilcimate-mediated secondary metabolism, and so on. In particular, insecticide led to much stronger regulations of signaling molecules (salicylate and the precursor of jasmonate) and antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol and dehydroascorbate/ascorbate) in Bt-transgenic variety at the early stage.

New and diverse plant varieties have been obtained which are pest and disease resistant, more productive and with improved nutritional quality, flavour and shelf life. In spite of all these potential benefits, some apprehension persist regarding genetically modified organisms putative effects over human health and environment. One of the main concerns regards GMO’s potential allergenicity. One of the possibilities is that {{the introduction of a}} new/ altered gene may putatively alter the expression of others, namely endogenous allergens. In maize, there are already some proteins characterized as allergens, namely a lipid transport protein (Pastorello et al. 2000), a tioredoxin Zea m 25 (Weichel et al. 2006), two glutelins Zea m 27 kD (Frisner et al. 2000) and 50 kD Zein (Pasini et al. 2002) and one trypsin inhibitor (Pastorello et al. 2000).

In general, {{there were no significant differences}} in oviposition between the transgenic and the non-transgenic cultivars under protected and unprotected conditions. The larval numbers were significantly lower on the transgenic hybrids during the 2004 rainy season under high infestation, but the differences in larval density between the transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids during 2002 and 2003 seasons under low levels of infestation were quite small. Bollworm damage in squares and bolls was significantly lower in the transgenic hybrids than in the non-transgenic ones, although there were a few exceptions. Differences in seed cotton yield between the transgenic and the non-transgenic hybrids were not significant under unprotected conditions at moderate levels of infestation during the 2002 and 2003 cropping seasons (except in the case of Mech 184). However, significant differences in seed cotton yield were observed during the 2004 cropping season under heavy bollworm infestation. Seed cotton yield of the first picking in transgenic hybrids was significantly greater than that of the <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Transgenic hybrids suffered low shoot damage by spotted bollworm, Earias vittella.

40|$|Growth hormone {{transgenic}} (GHTg) Atlantic salmon have enhanced growth {{when compared}} to their <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts,</b> and this trait is beneficial for aquaculture production. However, there are concerns regarding the potential impacts of transgenic fish on wild populations. The culture of sterile triploid GH transgenic (3 NGHTg) Atlantic salmon would prevent interbreeding of transgenic fish and wild stocks, thus minimizing environmental impacts. Generally, the growth performance of triploid salmon relative to diploid siblings remains an area of investigation. Growth rate of 3 NGHTg Atlantic salmon families were found to significantly vary between families in a breeding program. In order to identify gene expression correlates of enhanced growth in 3 NGHTg Atlantic salmon, a functional genomics approach (32 K cDNA microarrays followed by QPCR) was used to identify and validate liver transcripts that are differentially expressed between two fast-growing 3 NGHTg Atlantic salmon families (AS 11, AS 26) and one slowgrowing 3 NGHTg Atlantic salmon family (AS 25). Of 687 reproducibly informative microarray features, 143 features (116 more highly expressed in fast-growing, and 27 more highly expressed in slow-growing) were identified in the AS 11 vs. AS 25 microarray study, while 544 features (442 more highly expressed in fast-growing and 102 more highly expressed in slow-growing) were identified in the AS 26 vs. AS 25 microarray study. In order to identify growth-relevant transcripts that were consistently differentially expressed between fast-growing and slow-growing 3 NGHTg families, the AS 11 vs. AS 25 and AS 26 vs. AS 25 microarray gene lists were further analyzed using Venn diagrams. Forty microarray features (39 associated with fast growth and 1 associated with slow growth) were present in both microarray comparisons. The expression levels of 15 microarray-identified transcripts were studied using QPCR with individual RNA samples to validate the microarray results and to study biological variability of transcript expression. The QPCR results agreed with the microarray results for 12 of 13 putative fast-growth associated transcripts, but QPCR did not validate the microarray results for 2 putative slow-growth associated transcripts. Many of the 39 microarray features that were consistently associated with fast-growing 3 NGHTg salmon (including ACBP, APOAI, APOAIV, B 2 M, D 5 DP, FTM, GAPDH, and NUPR 1) were involved in carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, iron homeostasis and oxygen transport, and immune-or stress-related responses. The {{results of this study}} increase our knowledge of family-specific impacts on growth rate and hepatic gene expression in 3 NGHTg Atlantic salmon. In addition, this study provides a suite of rapid growth rate associated transcripts that may lead to the development of molecular markers (e. g. intronic, exonic or regulatory region SNPs) for the selection of GHTg Atlantic salmon broodstock that will give rise to sterile triploids of desired growth performance for future commercial applications...|$|R
40|$|People {{experience}} the irritating tearing and burning sensation of lachrymatory factor (LF, propanthial S-oxide) when cutting or chopping onion bulbs. LF {{is produced by}} lachrymatory factor synthase (LFS) specifically from 1 -propenyl sulfenic acid, a breakdown product of trans- 1 -propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (1 -PRENCSO) by alliinase. This thesis describes strategies to produce a tearless onion by using RNA interference (RNAi) silencing. To determine whether a gene silencing cassette can silence lfs gene transcripts from onion (Allium cepa L.), a crop recalcitrant to genetic transformation, a gene silencing assessment system was developed by using a model plant as a host for the gene of interest. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants transgenic for LFS enzyme activity from onion were first produced by introducing a CaMV 35 S-onion-lfs gene construct. These plants were then subjected to a second transformation with an RNAi construct directed against the lfs gene sequence. LFS enzyme activity assay showed that the transgenic plants, containing both the lfs gene and the RNAi construct, had significantly reduced LFS activity. This observation was supported by Western analysis for the LFS protein and further validated by quantitative RT-PCR analysis that demonstrated {{a significant reduction in}} the lfs transcript level in the dual transformants. This work demonstrated that the RNAi construct is a suitable candidate {{for the development of a}} tearless onion. This model plant RNAi system has wide reaching applications for assessment and targeting of plant secondary pathway genes, from poorly studied or recalcitrant plant species, that are important in pharmacological, food and process industries. The functional RNAi vector identified in the model system was transformed into onion. Endogenous lfs transcript levels were successfully reduced by up to 43 -fold in six transgenic lines. In consequence, LFS enzyme activity was decreased by up to 1573 -fold and this observation was supported by Western analysis for the LFS protein. Furthermore, the production of the deterrent LF upon tissue disruption was reduced up to 67 -fold. Subjective olfactory assessment of silenced lines indicated that the pungent odour given off by the leaf and bulb material was much reduced compared with that of <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterparts,</b> and that this was replaced by a sweeter milder onion odour. A novel colorimetric assay demonstrated that this silencing had shifted the 1 -PRENCSO breakdown pathway so that by reducing LFS protein, more 1 -propenyl sulfenic acid was converted into di- 1 -propenyl thiosulfinate. A consequence of the raised thiosulfinates levels was a marked increase in the downstream production of a non-enzymatically produced zwiebelane isomer that has never previously been identified, and other volatile compounds, di- 1 -propenyl disulfides and 2 -mercapto- 3, 4 -dimethyl- 2, 3 -dihydrothiophenes, which had previously been reported either in small amounts or had not been detected in onions. These raised volatile sulfur compounds provide an explanation for the unique flavour notes of the LF reduced onion and are predicted to have health benefits akin to those found in garlic. These results demonstrated that silencing of LFS enzyme activity by introducing an RNAi construct directed against the lfs gene sequence simultaneously reduced levels of the deterrent LF and increased the desirable thiosulfinates in onions...|$|R
40|$|Micraspis discolor (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} coleoptera predator in southern Asia in rice ecosystem, and adult M. discolor feed on both rice pollen and soft-bodied arthropods. Bitrophic bioassay and tritrophic bioassay were conducted to evaluate {{the potential impact of}} Cry 1 Ac/Cry 1 Ab-expressing rice Huahui 1 and its <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart</b> Minghui 63 on fitness parameters of adult M. discolor. The results showed that the survival, and fecundity of this beetle' adults were not different when they fed on Bt rice or non-Bt rice pollen or Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) reared on Bt rice or non-Bt rice. Toxicity assessment to ensure M. discolor adults were not sensitive to Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac protein independent from the pollen background, M. discolor adults were fed with an artificial diet containing Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ab or both protein approximately 10 times higher concentration than in Huahui 1 rice pollen. No difference was detected for any of the life-table parameters tested between Cry protein-containing and pure diet. Artificial diet containing E- 64 (N-(trans-Epoxysuccinyl) -L-leucine 4 -guanidinobutylamide) was included as a positive control. In contrast, the pre-oviposition and fecundity of M. discolor were significantly adversely affected by feeding on E- 64 -containing diet. In both bioassays, the uptakes of Cry protein by adult M. discolor were tested by ELISA measurements. These results indicated that adults of M. discolor are not affected by Cry 1 Ab- or Cry 1 Ac-expressing rice pollen and are not sensitive to Cry protein at concentrations exceeding the levels in rice pollen in Huahui 1. This suggests that M. discolor adults would not be harmed by Cry 1 Ac/Cry 1 Ab rice if Bt rice Huahui 1 were commercialized...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Elevated {{tropospheric ozone}} {{severely}} affects not only yield {{but also the}} morphology, structure and physiological functions of plants. Because of concerns regarding the potential environmental risk of transgenic crops, {{it is important to}} monitor changes in transgenic insect-resistant rice under the projected high tropospheric ozone before its commercial release. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) system, we investigated the changes in leaf morphology and leaf ultrastructure of two rice varieties grown in plastic pots, transgenic Bt Shanyou 63 (Bt-SY 63, carrying a fusion gene of cry 1 Ab and cry 1 Ac) and its <b>non-transgenic</b> <b>counterpart</b> (SY 63), in elevated O 3 (E-O 3) versus ambient O 3 (A-O 3) after 64 -DAS (Days after seeding), 85 -DAS and 102 -DAS. Our results indicated that E-O 3 had no significant effects on leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, stomatal length and stomatal density for both Bt-SY 63 and SY 63. E-O 3 increased the leaf thickness of Bt-SY 63, but decreased that of SY 63. O 3 stress caused early swelling of the thylakoids of chloroplasts, {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of total plastoglobule area in the entire cell area (PCAP) and a significant decrease in the proportion of total starch grain area in the entire cell area (SCAP), suggesting that E-O 3 accelerated the leaf senescence of the two rice genotypes. Compared with SY 63, E-O 3 caused early swelling of the thylakoids of chloroplasts and more substantial breakdown of chloroplasts in Bt-SY 63. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the incorporation of cry 1 Ab/Ac into SY 63 could induce unintentional changes in some parts of plant morphology and that O 3 stress results in greater leaf damage to Bt-SY 63 than to SY 63, with the former coupled with higher O 3 sensitivity in CCAP (the proportions of total chloroplast area in the entire cell area), PCAP and SCAP. This study provides valuable baseline information for the prospective commercial release of transgenic crops under the projected future climate...|$|E
