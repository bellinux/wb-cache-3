The Argentine Confederation (headed by Buenos Aires Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas) protested against Britain's actions, and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain. The British troops departed after completing their mission, leaving the area without formal government. Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane, returned to the islands that year to restore the business, but his efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order.

They are then confronted by Mantel—who reveals himself as the Red Testament—and T-elos. T-elos almost kills KOS-MOS, but Shion's pendant activates, apparently transporting them to the planet Miltia fifteen years into the past, which is revealed to be a world within Shion's subconscious. They are attacked by Voyager, who is beaten back by a redesigned KOS-MOS. During the group's time there, Shion learns the true events that caused Miltia's fall; her father, Kevin, Margulis and Mizrahi were attempting to control the Zohar through experiments involving both Shion and her mother, but when U-TIC and Federation forces clashed, Kevin and Margulis released unstable combat Realians which slaughtered <b>nearly</b> <b>everyone</b> in the battle. The trauma caused the young Shion to resonate with the Zohar, summoning the Gnosis and awakening U-DO; it was only Mizrahi's self-sacrifice in sealing away Miltia that prevented the chaos from spreading. The group fight Virgil before he is calmed by the spirit of Febronia—who tended {{him when he was}} injured on Miltia and with whom he formed an attachment prior to her death—and follows her into the afterlife.

An estimated 58. 3 % of US households own pets (AVMA, 2002), and most people consume livestock products {{in the form of}} meat, dairy products, wool, or leather. The health and well being of all these animals depend heavily on relationships with veterinarians. Veterinarians also contribute to public health through the FDA, CDC, USDA, and numerous other government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. Issues of primary concern include food safety, biosecurity, and the numerous emerging (and re-emerging) infectious diseases that are zoonotic in nature. Finally, veterinarians have an additional impact through their research contributions. Virtually all of the laboratory animals used in research are raised, housed, and managed under the care of veterinarians, and veterinary researchers regularly provide valuable contributions to the knowledge base in the biomedical sciences. This study was designed to assess the general trends in pet and veterinary expenditures as well as factors associated with pet ownership and expenditures on veterinary medical services. Providing such key information on the sector of greatest economic importance will enhance the probability of sustained economic viability in the veterinary medical profession as a whole.

40|$|The {{back cover}} text of this {{excellent}} monograph closes with a bold remark on its method-ology: “[T]he {{assumption that the}} fundamental laws of physics are simple {{in terms of the}} fundamental physical properties and relations is pivotal. Without this assumption one gets nowhere ” when trying to “extract the fundamental structure of the world from theories of physics. ” I couldn’t have put it better myself. One caveat, though: I’m not sure ‘simplicity’ is the best name for the cocktail of considerations appealed to here as premises. Arntze-nius privileges spatiotemporally local and separable ontologies, for example, but these strike me as virtues of easy conceptual intelligibility or methodological conservatism rather than simplicity. Regardless, the reader can look forward to a marshalling of non-empirical the-oretical virtues behind various alternative pictures of fundamental reality, in search of the best metaphysical explanation for some of the successes of modern physics. Arntzenius offers no worked-out theory of simplicity and the other virtues, but here he is in good company (<b>nearly</b> <b>everyone’s).</b> In cases where empirically equivalent hypotheses are on the table, we must trust that the intuitions of scientifically-trained scholars typically encapsulate a rough but reliable sense of a theory’s standing with respect to theoretica...|$|R

The 2001 the Belgian Health Interview Survey indicated that the relationship or social support network of Belgian citizens is composed of a mean number of 9 persons (Gisle, Buziarsist, Van der Heyden, Demarest, Miermans, Sartor et al., 2002).

40|$|Calls for a {{more just}} {{international}} economic order are on <b>nearly</b> <b>everyone’s</b> lips today and there are probably not {{many people who are}} honestly convinced that the existing order is beyond suspicion. The globalized economy is criticised as unjust mainly on account of its social effects, that is to say, in the name of social justice. The question whether social justice can be achieved in a globalized world is still disputed in philosophical debates, however, while the definition of its adequate criteria gives rise to far-reaching controversies. As Peter Koller calls to mind, the idea of justice tends to a successive widening of its scope. In its original understanding, the concept applies to specific types of human action, such as the distribution of common goods, the performance of exchanges, and the correction of wrongdoings. In the course of modern history, it has been extended to more complex social arrangements, such as political organisations, social institutions, and legal practices. Around {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, it became common to talk about “social justice” in relation to entire societal orders. Currently, there is a further widening of the idea in regard to the global order, i. e., the growing discussion on “international and global justice”. While this expansion of the idea of justice reflects the need for adapting our common moral standards to an ongoing process of social change, it seems, however, to result in a loss of its clarity...|$|R
40|$|Gary Goertz and James Mahoney are {{masters in}} {{presenting}} methodological messages in an accessible, lucid, {{and at the}} same time focused and precise style. Their Tale of Two Cultures: Qualitative and Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences is another impressive example of this quality. In this book they juxtapose the statistical and the set-theoretical ways of thinking as two distinct and internally “relatively coherent cultures of research” (footnote 2, p. 5). They feel obliged to label these two cultures “quantitative” and “qualitative” because “the qualitative-quantitative distinction is built into <b>nearly</b> <b>everyone’s</b> vocabulary in the social sciences, and it serves as a common point of reference for distinguishing different kinds of work” although they admit that those labels “are quite inadequate for capturing the most salient differences between the two traditions” (p. 5). For Goertz and Mahoney, the two cultures differ basically in two respects: (a) whereas quantitative research is focusing primarily on cross-case analysis, inferences in qualitative studies are drawn primarily on the basis of within-case analysis; (b) quantitative scholars use the sophisticated techniques of statistics; qualitative scholars, in contrast, use—albeit often implicitly—logic and set theory. We agree with Goertz and Mahoney when it comes to the two methodological cultures they describe but we are less convinced by their labeling, because a significant part of what makes research qualitative is not captured by their approach. We will come back to this point when we present our more critical remarks about the book...|$|R

Jedwabne was then transferred to the Soviets {{in accordance with the}} German-Soviet Boundary Treaty of September 28, 1939.

25|$|Poe {{writes about}} five periods in media history: {{the age of}} speech, the age of manuscripts, the age of print, the age of {{audiovisual}} media {{and the age of}} the Internet. He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence and searchability. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because <b>nearly</b> <b>everyone</b> could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and egalitarian, but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.|$|E

40|$|When Hitler assumed {{power in}} 1933, {{he and other}} Nazis had firm ideas on {{what they called a}} racially pure "community of the people. " They quickly took steps against those whom they wanted to isolate, deport, or destroy. In these essays {{informed}} by the latest research, leading scholars offer rich histories of the people branded as "social outsiders" in Nazi Germany: Communists, Jews, "Gypsies," foreign workers, prostitutes, criminals, homosexuals, and the homeless, unemployed, and chronically ill. Although many works have concentrated exclusively on the relationship between Jews and the Third Reich, this collection also includes often-overlooked victims of Nazism while reintegrating the Holocaust into its wider social context. The Nazis knew what attitudes and values they shared with many other Germans, and most of their targets were individuals and groups long regarded as outsiders, nuisances, or "problem cases. " The identification, the treatment, and even the pace of their persecution of political opponents and social outsiders illustrated that the Nazis attuned their law-and-order policies to German society, history, and traditions. Hitler's personal convictions, Nazi ideology, and what he deemed to be the wishes and hopes of many people, came together in deciding where it would be politically most advantageous to begin. The first essay explores the political strategies used by the Third Reich to gain support for its ideologies and programs, and each following essay concentrates on one group of outsiders. Together the contributions debate the motivations behind the purges. For example, was the persecution of Jews the direct result of intense, widespread anti-Semitism, or was it part of a more encompassing and arbitrary persecution of "unwanted populations" that intensified with the war? The collection overall offers a nuanced portrayal of German citizens, showing that many supported the Third Reich while some tried to resist, and that the war radicalized social thinking on <b>nearly</b> <b>everyone's</b> part.
