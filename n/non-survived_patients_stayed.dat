30|$|Conclusion: Our {{study showed}} that vitamin D {{response}} might be different between surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> {{during the course of}} septic shock. Surviving patients had higher day 1 vitamin D levels as compared to <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> Increase in vitamin D level from day 1 to 5 suggests a clinically significant albeit statistically insignificant association of vitamin D and survival, in line with high vitamin D levels in baseline comparisons of the groups, favoring survivors, due to the limited sample size. Further studies in larger groups are clearly warranted.|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: <b>Non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> after TBI have {{initially}} higher CSF lactate {{levels and}} a lower CSF glucose/lactate ratio than survivors. These observations suggest a more profound metabolic brain distress in the non-survivors, who may benefit from an alternative energetic substrate to glucose.|$|R
30|$|The {{association}} {{that we have}} found between increased serum TAC levels and mortality in patients with severe MMCAI could seem initially counterintuitive because improved protection against oxidative processes would instead protect the brain against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage. However, {{we think that the}} findings of previous studies showing a higher oxidative state in patients with ischemic stroke compared with healthy control subjects [10, 13 – 15], and the findings of our study showing higher circulating TAC and MDA levels in non-survivors compared to survivors patients with severe MMCAI could reflect that there is an oxidative state in stroke and that it is higher in <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> We postulate that <b>non-surviving</b> MMCAI <b>patients</b> display higher serum TAC levels to compensate the higher ROS production, as it was observed by our group in severe septic patients [21] and in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [22]; thus, <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> showed higher serum levels of TAC and MDA than surviving patients.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAim of the studyTo {{identify}} outcome improvement {{factors in}} ARDS patients managed with lung protective ventilation and defined {{according to the}} Berlin diagnostic criteria. Patients and methodsA retrospective observational {{study was conducted in}} a total of 41 ARDS patients who were diagnosed according to the Berlin ARDS criteria. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological criteria were assessed for all patients, and sputum, blood, and urine samples were obtained {{on the first day of}} hospitalization and on the day of ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnosis. In addition, fluid balance was assessed by the end of the first week of ventilation. Significant factors associated with survival improvement and predictors of mortality were identified using the bivariate analysis. ROC curves were created to evaluate the accuracy of some of the factors affecting survival. ResultsIn this study 25 variables were significantly correlated with mortality. The <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> had tachypnea and tachycardia; lower diastolic blood pressure, PaO 2 /FiO 2, PO 2, O 2 sat, and HCO 3 values; and higher FiO 2 and PCO 2 values. Additionally, they had lower serum Na and higher K, pH, and creatinine levels. The level of CRP and GCS score were significantly lower in the <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> However, the average fluid balance in the <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> was positive. Additionally, 4 <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> (33. 3 %) developed hospital-acquired pneumonia. A good general condition, indicated by a GCS score was the most accurate improvement prediction factor, then proper oxygenation. In contrast, a delay in ICU admission, increase in serum creatinine level, and a positive fluid balance were accurate predictive factors of mortality. ConclusionsEarly diagnosis and ICU admission, a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio maintained above 90, a GCS score above 9, a negative fluid balance, a serum creatinine level less than 1. 5 mg/dl, and the prevention of HAP were factors associated with an improved outcome in ARDS...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} the association between patient age and cumulative resource use during a 1 -year period among patients in a Japanese hospital, {{as well as the}} equality of resource distribution between age groups. Methods We analyzed the administrative data for 9695 patients 35 years or older at a tertiary hospital. Multiple linear regression models were used to identify factors associated with cumulative resource use, including total charges, diagnostic examination charges, and drug charges, during a 1 -year period. Gini coefficients were estimated to examine equality of cumulative resource use between age groups. Results Multiple linear regression analyses revealed a quadratic relationship between age and cumulative charges for all fees, diagnostic examinations, and drugs among surviving patients. However, age did not significantly associate with cumulative resource use among <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> On the other hand, the cumulative duration of hospitalization (natural log-transformed) was strongly associated with resource use among all patients, both surviving and non-surviving. Cumulative resource use for inpatients was substantially unequal, but these inequalities of resource use did not correspond to age divisions. Conclusions No linear association was found between patient age and cumulative resource use during a 1 -year period among either surviving or <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> on multivariate regression analyses and the inequality of resource use among <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> differed by age group. ...|$|R
40|$|Sepsis is {{a complex}} disease that is {{characterized}} by activation and inhibition of different cell signaling pathways according to the disease stage. Here, we evaluated genes involved in the TLR signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative metabolism, aiming to assess their interactions and resulting cell functions and pathways that are disturbed in septic patients. Blood samples were obtained from 16 patients with sepsis secondary to community acquired pneumonia at admission (D 0), and after 7 days (D 7, N = 10) of therapy. Samples were also collected from 8 healthy volunteers who were matched according to age and gender. Gene expression of 84 genes was performed by real-time polymerase chain reactions. Their expression was considered up- or down-regulated when the fold change was greater than 1. 5 compared to the healthy volunteers. A p-value of ≤ 0. 05 was considered significant. Twenty-two genes were differently expressed in D 0 samples; {{most of them were}} down-regulated. When gene expression was analyzed according to the outcomes, higher number of altered genes and a higher intensity in the disturbance was observed in non-survivor than in survivor patients. The canonical pathways altered in D 0 samples included interferon and iNOS signaling; the role of JAK 1, JAK 2 and TYK 2 in interferon signaling; mitochondrial dysfunction; and superoxide radical degradation pathways. When analyzed according to outcomes, different pathways were disturbed in surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and superoxide radical degradation pathway were among the most altered in <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> Our data show changes in the expression of genes belonging to the interacting TLR cascades, NADPH-oxidase and oxidative phosphorylation. Importantly, distinct patterns are clearly observed in surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> Interferon signaling, marked by changes in JAK-STAT modulation, had prominent changes in both survivors and non-survivors, whereas the redox imbalance (iNOS signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and superoxide radical degradation) affecting mitochondrial functions was prominent in <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim: Hyperglycemia {{is known}} to be closely {{associated}} with increased mortality and morbidity rates in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, studies aiming to determine glycemic control objectives in ICUs reveal contradictory results. In this study, we aimed to determine the glycemic control level in our ICU and its effects on ICU mortality. Material and Methods: This study was conducted in the 9 -bed medical ICU and designed to include inpatients of this unit during a six-month period (November 2008 -April 2009). General characteristics of the inpatients, together with the data related to glycemic control, were gathered and the data from surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> were compared. Blood sugar levels of patients were maintained between 110 - 150 mg/dL and hypoglycemia was considered when this was ≤ 50 mg/dL. Results: A total of 129 patients were included in the study. Mean age of the patients was 67 years and 55 % of the patients were male. Average blood sugar of the patients was 138 mg/dL; average insulin dose applied was 20 unit/day and hypoglycemia frequency was 38 %. The most significant difference between the surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> in the ICU in terms of glycemic control was the frequency of hypoglycemia in the <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> (49 % vs 27 %, p= 0. 012). When the curves for the surviving patients were compared, it was observed that the patients who had the highest surviving rates were those whose blood sugar was between 110 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL (18 days vs 8 days, p= 0. 005). In patients with severe hypoglycemia, not only were the lengths of stay {{in the intensive care unit}} extended, but also mortality rates increased (9 days vs 20 days; p= 0. 001). Conclusion: No studies have yet been able to reveal a precise target value for blood sugar in order to reduce mortality and morbidity in ICUs. In this study, it was found that a blood sugar value between 110 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL increased survival rates. Every ICU should determine a target blood sugar level that complies with its own conditions and implement appropriate protocols to achieve this goal long before severe hypoglycemia develops...|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} study, we have {{identified}} {{in the blood of}} long-term ARDS survivors a subset of EVARDS with MSC origin and different phenotype compared to the circulatory EVARDS of <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients.</b> To our knowledge, the presence in the blood of long-term ARDS survivors of a distinct population of circulatory EVARDS with MSC-origin and different biochemical makeup compared to the EVARDS of <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> has not been reported so far. Similar to our observations however, limited studies reported a protective role of leukocyte-derived EVs with an increased count in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage of ARDS patients [41]. More recently, Shaver et al. [42], found a strong association between the lower levels of circulatory EVs and the development of ARDS in patients with sepsis. Nonetheless, the biochemical makeup or mechanism(s) involved remain unknown. We show now that a subset of the EVARDS with MSC origin and increased count comprises the widely expressed TβR 1 /Alk 5 and the Runx 1 transcription factor. The protein expression pattern of two Runx 1 isoforms during the first month in the ICU appears critical for the ARDS outcome: the p 52 isoform shows a continuous expression, while the p 66 isoform is short-lived. Significantly, a high ratio Runx 1 p 66 /p 52 was associated with survival. We have also found that this difference in the temporal expression pattern of Runx 1 isoforms is a characteristic of cultured human bone marrow derived MSCs, as well, consistent with the recent similar reports for cells with non-hematopoietic lineage [43].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Percutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) {{has been}} increasingly employed to treat unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis, with variable success. This {{strategy has been}} applied to patients undergoing drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation for unprotected LMCA stenosis. METHODS: From April 2003 to June 2006, 114 consecutive patients with de novo unprotected LMCA stenosis underwent PCI with DES, and were followed over a mean period of 17. 1 ± 9. 1 months. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (cardiac death, myocardial infarction [MI] or target lesion revascularization [TLR]). RESULTS: LMCA stenting was successfully performed in all patients. In-hospital mortality was 3. 5 %, with no in-hospital non-fatal MI or emergency coronary artery bypass grafts. During the follow-up period, the all-cause mortality rate was 7. 9 %, with 3. 5 % cardiac-related deaths. TLR was performed in 7. 9 % of patients, and the MACE rate was 14. 9 %. All <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> were at high surgical risk (EuroSCORE > 6) and had a significantly higher EuroSCORE than surviving patients that patients with a EuroSCORE ≤ 11 had significantly improved survival rates over those with a EuroSCORE > 11 (p < 0. 0001). Moreover, most of the patients who died of cardiac causes were diabetic (71. 4 % vs. 26. 6 %; p < 0. 05). Acute coronary syndromes, as clinical presentation, and non-ostial LMCA disease were also significantly more common within <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> (100 % vs. 67 %; p < 0. 05, and 92. 3 % vs. 66. 3 %; p ≤ 0. 05, respectively).

40|$|Reduction of the {{inappropriate}} hospital <b>patient</b> <b>stay</b> {{for hospitals}} {{has been an}} important issue for healthcare policy-makers and practitioners.

30|$|Trends in NRBC values {{over the}} time course {{indicated}} that the disappearance of these cells from the peripheral circulation was protective in comparison with patient subgroups with values that never returned to baseline. This was particularly evident when considering the patients surviving ARDS. Our observations {{are in line with}} findings by Shah and colleagues, who described this effect in patients with surgical sepsis [22]. The peak NRBC value tended to occur earlier in patients who survived ARDS, whereas <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> tended to develop NRBC peak values later during their ICU stay. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance in our study, one may speculate that high NRBC peaks that occur relatively late {{in the course of the}} ICU stay might indicate ongoing disease in critically ill patients.|$|R
30|$|Safety {{is another}} key consideration. While most RCTs {{studying}} omega- 3 supplementation in critical illness have reported minimal adverse effects, others have identified important risks that include significantly longer hospital and ICU lengths of stay [30, 34], increased duration of mechanical ventilation [47], fewer ventilator-free and ICU-free days [20], elevated triglyceride levels [29, 37], {{and a higher}} incidence of diarrhoea [20, 25]. Most concerning are reported trends towards increased mortality [20, 28, 31, 39, 49]. Even in meta-analyses that demonstrate a non-significant reduction in mortality [18, 44, 50, 51], as this one does, the upper limit of the CI cannot exclude the potential for increased mortality with omega- 3 supplementation. Detailed data on <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> would be necessary to explore characteristics associated with increased mortality risk with omega- 3 supplementation.|$|R

30|$|Our {{study is}} {{first of its}} kind which proposes an Alk 5 /Runx 1 -mediated {{mechanism}} by which bone marrow-derived MSCs via their released EVs rescue and repair pulmonary microvascular cellular injury in ARDS. Exposure of LPS-injured human lung ECs to EVARDSAlk 5 Runx 1 p 66 increases proliferation and improve junctional integrity; moreover, in LPS-treated mice, these EVARDS bearing the Runx 1 p 66 isoform, decrease lung histological severity. By contrast, exposure to EVARDSAlk 5 Runx 1 p 52 regardless of their long-term survivors or <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> source cannot induce endothelial recovery, strongly supporting the concept that Runx 1 p 66 accounts for the beneficial effects of the EVARDSAlk 5 Runx 1 p 66, and thus for the improved outcome of the long-term ARDS survivors. As the EVARDSAlk 5 Runx 1 p 52 show no therapeutic benefit on LPS-treated ECs and LPS-mouse model of ALI, it appears that even if the EVARDS possess the TβR 1 /TβRII heteromeric complexes, the lack of the Runx 1 p 66 isoform is critical for ARDS resolution and survival.|$|R

DESIGN: Fifty-three consecutive patients with septic and non-septic shock at a mixed-bed intensive care unit were included, as well as 20 age-matched controls. Patients with local infections but without signs of shock served as infectious controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine plasma levels of HBP. RESULTS: There were no differences in serum HBP levels between healthy controls and those with local infections, including urinary tract infections, pneumonia and gastroenteritis, without shock. Levels of HBP were higher in patients with non-septic shock and septic shock than healthy controls. However, there was no difference in serum HBP levels between patients with septic shock and those with non-septic shock. Moreover, HBP levels were not different between patients with low and high APACHE II scores. Plasma levels of HBP were similar in surviving and <b>non-surviving</b> <b>patients</b> with shock.
