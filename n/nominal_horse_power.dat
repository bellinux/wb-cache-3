5000|$|According {{to these}} {{specifications}} the Kaiser Frierdrich {{was designed and}} built with three chimneys (smoke stacks) designated as the number 587 build with the following technical characteristics: length 183 m, width 19.4 m, tonnage [...] and a displacement of 20,100 tons. Fitted with two five cylinder reciprocating steam engines (with cylinder diameter of 109.22 cm, 162.56 cm, 233.68 cm, 2 x 236.22 cm), with quadruple expansion, driving twin three-bladed bronze propellers,with a diameter of 6.19 meters, coupled to crankshafts made by Krupp Steel, the best steel in Germany. The engines were designed to develop a maximum <b>nominal</b> 28,000 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> and {{in conjunction with the}} fact that the pressure in the ten boilers were rated at 15.5 bar, offered, according to the calculations by the Ferdinand Schichau engineers, a significant potential for coal economy. Contrary to common shipbuilding practices of the era, the engineers placed the engines slightly forward, between the second and third boilers. The ship had nine main boilers, each fitted with two coal loading trap doors plus a tenth auxiliary boiler; these were positioned in three watertight compartments each ducted to a smokestack.|$|R

5000|$|The {{commercial}} Hugon engine {{appeared in}} 1865, and in appearance much resembled the Lenoir engine, but with flame ignition and water spray injection into the cylinder {{to control the}} temperatures. It was manufactured in England by Fred B. Vallance at the Alicel Works, Bridge Street, Greenwich.

50|$|The {{need for}} more power comes from {{necessity}} and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives.
