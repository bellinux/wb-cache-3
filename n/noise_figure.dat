25|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} noise in DFAs is Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE), which has a spectrum approximately {{the same as the}} gain spectrum of the amplifier. <b>Noise</b> <b>figure</b> in an ideal DFA is 3dB, while practical amplifiers can have <b>noise</b> <b>figure</b> as large as 6–8dB.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a measure}} of how much noise is {{introduced}} in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is <b>noise</b> <b>figure</b> or noise factor. <b>Noise</b> <b>figure</b> is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.|$|E
25|$|Noise {{typically}} appears as random variations superimposed on the desired echo signal {{received in the}} radar receiver. The lower {{the power of the}} desired signal, the more difficult it is to discern it from the noise. <b>Noise</b> <b>figure</b> {{is a measure of the}} noise produced by a receiver compared to an ideal receiver, and this needs to be minimized.|$|E

40|$|Quarter-micron-gate-length high-electron-mobility {{transistors}} (HEMTs) have exhibited state-of-the-art low-noise {{performance at}} millimeter-wave frequencies, with minimum <b>noise</b> <b>figures</b> of 1. 2 dB at 32 GHz and 1. 8 dB at 60 GHz. At Ka-band, two-stage and three-stage HEMT low noise amplifiers have demonstrated <b>noise</b> <b>figures</b> of 1. 7 and 1. 9 dB, respectively, with associated gains of 17. 0 and 24. 0 dB at 32 GHz. At V-band, two stage and three-stage HEMT amplifiers yielded <b>noise</b> <b>figures</b> of 3. 2 and 3. 6 dB, respectively, with associated gains of 12. 7 and 20. 0 dB at 60 GHz.

25|$|Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are {{resonant}} cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In {{addition to their}} small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads {{to a number of}} advantages, including low power consumption, low <b>noise</b> <b>figure,</b> polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still {{in the early stages of}} research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E
25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a negative voltage {{is applied to the}} gate (for an n-channel device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (off) switch. Due to their low <b>noise</b> <b>figure</b> in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets. Depletion-mode MOSFET families include BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.|$|E
2500|$|An illustrative {{example is}} a {{bistable}} system that can be characterized by a hidden Markov model (HMM) subject to measurement <b>noise</b> (<b>Figure</b> 2). Such models are employed for many biological systems: they have for example been used in development, cell signaling, activation/deactivation, logical processing and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. For instance, {{the behavior of the}} Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) transcription factor in Drosophila melanogaster can be modeled with a HMM. The (biological) dynamical model consists of two states: A and B. If the probability of a transition from one state to the other is defined as [...] in both directions, the probability to remain in the same state at each time step is 1-. The probability to measure the state correctly is [...] (conversely, the probability of an incorrect measurement is 1-).|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{detectors}} for the infrared, such as thermocouples and bolometers, {{are limited}} in their ultimate sensitivity predominantly by Johnson noise rather than temperature <b>noise.</b> Low <b>noise</b> <b>figures</b> are hard to achieve since Johnson noise preponderates temperature noise, {{which is the only}} essential noise for thermal detectors. The dielectric constants of some materials are sufficiently temperature dependent to make a new type of bolometer feasible. The basic theory of a dielectric bolometer, as shown here, promises <b>noise</b> <b>figures</b> below 3 decibels even at chopper frequencies well above the 1 /tau value of the detector.

40|$|Optical {{communication}} links {{are usually}} made with erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, which amplify the signal waves in a phase-insensitive (PI) manner. They {{can also be}} made with parametric fiber amplifiers, in which the signal waves interact with idler waves. If information is transmitted using only the signals, parametric amplifiers are PI and their <b>noise</b> <b>figures</b> are {{comparable to those of}} erbium amplifiers. However, transmitting correlated information in the signals and idlers, or copying the signals prior to transmission, allows parametric amplifiers to be phase-sensitive (PS), which lowers their <b>noise</b> <b>figures.</b> The information capacities of two-mode PS links exceed those of the corresponding PI links by 2 b/s-Hz...|$|R

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{developed}} a maser to provide ultra-low-noise amplification of S-band microwave signals received from deep space probes. This maser used deeply refrigerated hydrogen to chill the amplifier {{down to a}} temperature of four kelvin. Amplification was achieved by exciting a ruby comb with a 12.0 gigahertz klystron. In the early years, it took days to chill and remove the impurities from the hydrogen lines. Refrigeration was a two-stage process with a large Linde unit on the ground, and a crosshead compressor within the antenna. The final injection was at [...] through a [...] micrometer-adjustable entry to the chamber. The whole system noise temperature looking at cold sky (2.7 kelvins in the microwave band) was 17 kelvins. This gave such a low <b>noise</b> <b>figure</b> that the Mariner IV space probe could send still pictures from Mars back to the Earth even though the output power of its radio transmitter was only 15 watts, and hence the total signal power received was only -169 decibels {{with respect to a}} milliwatt (dBm).|$|E

50|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>figure</b> {{measurements}} can be {{made with}} a noise diode, a power supply for the noise diode, and a spectrum analyser. They can also be made with a specialist <b>noise</b> <b>figure</b> meter. The advantage of the <b>noise</b> <b>figure</b> meter is that it will automatically switch the noise diode on and off, giving a continuous reading of Y; it will also have the correct bandwidths in its receiver to average the received noise in an optimum fashion.
