He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E

Despite the announcement generating {{a considerable amount of}} attention, little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months. The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's {{projected}} {{design of}} express passenger locomotive was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> introduction {{during the summer}} timetable of 1925, so a third batch of ten N15s was ordered for construction at Eastleigh. This batch {{was part of an}} outstanding LSWR order to rebuild 15 of Drummond’s unsuccessful 4-cylinder F13, G14 and P14classes 4-6-0s into 2cylinder H15class locomotives. Only the five F13s were converted to H15s; the remaining ten G14 and P14s (Nos.448457, renumbered E448E457) were rebuilt as N15s, implementing modifications to Urie’s original design.|$|E
5|$|The air {{groups of}} the sisters were {{decimated}} in the battle, which forced Zuikaku to return to Japan with Shōkaku for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier {{was able to take}} part in the Battle of Midway in June. En route to Japan, Shōkaku was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used to put out the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months and she was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> action until late August.|$|E

Vettel took sixth position from Michael Schumacher which proved sufficient to retain the title even with Alonso finishing second.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted {{to carry out}} a general war to regain at least a {{significant}} part of the Sinai. This view was notably held by the Minister of War, General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek. However, in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt's Armed Forces were <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a land reclamation war before some five to ten years. Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{preparations}} for another resupply convoy for Malta (Operation Pedestal), Argus returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the Clyde on 2 August for Gibraltar. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5 August for a three-day training exercise to work out coordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> combat. It was ordered {{to return to the}} UK aboard Argus.|$|E

5|$|Daniels and Schur {{first started}} writing the script {{in the summer}} of 2008, when they were {{in the early stages of}} conceiving the series. Like the rest of the series, the pilot was filmed in the same mockumentary style as The Office, the NBC comedy series also {{directed}} by Daniels. About one month before the pilot aired, a focus group report discussing several perceived problems with the episode was leaked to the media, which led to speculation that Parks and Recreation was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> prime-time television. The pilot episode featured a number of cultural references to such people as Bob Knight, Larry Bird and Laura Linney, as well as female political figures to whom Leslie compares herself, such as Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{the castle}} was {{involved}} in an armed stand-off with French naval vessels. After the Fall of France in 1940, some of the French ships had {{made their way to}} British ports, including Portsmouth, but fears rose that the warships might leave and fall into German hands. On 23 June, the castle was ordered to man its guns and to be prepared to fire on the French navy to prevent their departure; one gun, albeit <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> action, was levelled at the fleet and the French destroyer Léopard responded by aiming its guns at the castle, but no shooting ensued. On 3 July, under Operation Grasp, British forces boarded and seized the ships, ending the confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{meets with}} each of his {{employees}} to discuss their job performance. He plunders the employee suggestion box for ideas to impress his own boss, Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), but the ruse backfires and he embarrasses himself. Michael relentlessly pesters Jan about their previous romantic connection but she bluntly rejects him, especially when, during the office's suggestion box meeting, she discovers {{that everyone in the}} Scranton branch is aware of the incident. As Jan storms out of the office, she admonishes Michael before complimenting him and reluctantly stating that she is <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a relationship. Meanwhile, the stunned staff listens in.|$|E

5|$|Puglia {{was built}} by the new Regia Marina {{shipyard}} in Taranto, the first major warship to be built there. Her keel was laid down in October 1893, and she was launched on 22 September 1898. Fitting-out work {{proved to be a}} lengthy process, and she was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> service until 26 May 1901. By this time, her design was over ten years old and the ship was rapidly becoming obsolescent; in comparison, Germany had already commissioned the world's first light cruisers, the , which were significantly faster and better armed. This new type of ship rapidly replaced protected cruisers like Puglia.|$|E
5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek: Enterprise {{follows the}} adventures of {{the crew of the}} {{starship}} Enterprise, designation NX-01. They are the first deep space explorers in Starfleet, using the first Warp 5 equipped vessel. At the start of the series, it is revealed that the Vulcans have withheld advanced technology from humanity since their first contact, concerned that humans were <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> it. This has delayed human space exploration and caused resentment in Captain Jonathan Archer, whose father developed the Warp 5 engine but did not live to see it used.|$|E

5|$|The {{screening}} {{forces of}} each side blundered {{into each other}} during the early morning darkness and heavy weather of 16 December. The Germans {{got the better of}} the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned {{about the possibility of a}} massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn. Incompetent communications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper to avoid an engagement with the battlecruisers. On 27 December, Conqueror accidentally rammed Monarch as the Grand Fleet was returning to Scapa Flow in heavy weather and poor visibility. The latter ship required less than a month of repairs but Conqueror was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> service until March 1915.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E

Joining siblings Milika and Mataika Koyamainavure after Fiji Basketball development officer Laisiasa Puamau confirmed the news. He then was brought into the Otago Nuggets to participate in their 2014 campaign after a respectable showing at the Oceania Championships in New Zealand. Player-coach, Mark Dickel decided to give Sowakula a call once {{they were looking for}} a replacement for fellow Fijian, Marques Whippy. He made his debut starting from the bench during their match against the Taranaki Mountain Airs once he arrived in Dunedin from the previous week. Unfortunately his performances didn't live quite up to Dickel's standards after he believed Sowakula was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the NBL, and instead called in former representative Tom Rowe as cover.|$|E
