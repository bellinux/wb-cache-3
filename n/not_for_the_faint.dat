Test cricket was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E

On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E
500|$|Several anime and manga {{publications}} {{have provided}} praise for Saitō. His fight {{scenes in the}} series, in particular, have also been acclaimed. While reviewing the volume 7 from the manga, Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey applauded the fight between Himura Kenshin and Saito Hajime at the Kamiya Dojo as the [...] "high spot of the [...] high spot". In the volume 14 review for the manga, Lavey described {{the end of the}} fight between Saitō and Usui as [...] "very gruesome and <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> of heart". In the DVD volume 7 review for the anime, Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge described the fight scene between Saitō and Kenshin as [...] "definitely choreographed well". He praised [...] "the viciousness in the attacks, masked under their cold calculating facade" [...] as being [...] "wonderfully done, providing a real feel for these ultimate killers". His appearance in the OVAs has also received praise. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network states that during the character's brief appearances in the [...] OVA series, he appears to be [...] "truly menacing." [...] Mark A. Grey of Anime News Network said that the song [...] "Hoeru Miburo (Howling Wolf of Mibu)" [...] in the anime series [...] "perfectly" [...] represents the character. Reviewing the manga Restoration, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network felt Saitō's was interesting in regards to his philosophy as it contrasted Kenshin's but lamented his lack of appearances in this version. Daryl Surat from Otaku USA considers him as the greatest character from the series based on the impact he brings to the series during his introduction.|$|E

2500|$|Once on Trail #3, hikers climb this trail about 0.6 {{miles to}} its top where the {{observation}} tower is located. [...] The {{trail to the}} observation tower lookout hill is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> of heart. It is very steep and very slippery. It is a one-way trail (in {{the sense that the}} same trail is used in the return trip) and the trail feels even more slippery in the downhill return hike. This trail is made of rocks but, because of the high humidity and low traffic, algae have overtaken the rocks to make the trail very slippery. Walking around the rocks does not always help as the area is muddy - though albeit less slippery. The view and fresh air and breeze make the trek quite rewarding. The views are unobstructed and panoramic 360° views are possible. The tower is 3,537 feet above sea level. Altogether the distance from the visitor's parking area to the tower is 2.14 miles.|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{estimation}} and approximate query processing {{have become}} increasingly prevalent applications for database systems. However, approximation is usually of little use without some sort of guarantee on estimation accuracy, or “confidence bound. ” Analytically deriving probabilistic guarantees for database queries over sampled data is a daunting task, <b>not</b> suitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> of heart, and certainly beyond the expertise of the typical database system end-user. This paper considers the problem of incorporating into a database system a powerful “plug-in ” method for computing confidence bounds on the answer to relational database queries over sampled or incomplete data. This statistical tool, called the bootstrap, is simple enough {{that it can be}} used by a database programmer with a rudimentary mathematical background, but general enough that it can be applied to almost any statistical inference problem. Given the power and ease-of-use of the bootstrap, we argue that <b>the</b> algorithms presented <b>for</b> supporting <b>the</b> bootstrap should be incorporated into any database system which is intended to support analytic processing. ...|$|R

50|$|Brenda Coultas’ {{collection}} of formally innovative fictions, Early Films, seems like McCain and Deanovich {{to be influenced}} by the casually flat tone of New York School poetry, but also like them in wanting to use that tradition for new ends. Coultas also shares with Deanovich a concern for ordinary middle American folks. But where Deanovich treats her characters with generous irony, Early Films is gloriously vicious. This is <b>not</b> a book <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> hearted. Indeed its concerns with pathology, murder, and all sorts of country bumpkin (and urban bumpkin) grotesquerie reminds me most, perversely, of the cheap thrills of a horror genre writer like Joe Lansdale.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Heideggerian {{hermeneutic}} phenomenology {{has been}} used widely to {{understand the meaning of}} lived experiences in health research.

OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to assist midwives to untangle and examine some of the choices they face when they first come to terms with an understanding of this methodology and highlights the methodology 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to reveal midwifery authenticity and holistic practice.
