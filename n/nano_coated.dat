40|$|Abstract- Three phase {{induction}} motors consume 60 % {{of industrial}} electricity. Just 1 % increase in efficiency {{of all the}} motors in India will save 500 MW powers which needs the initial generation cost of 2000 crores. Actions were taken to use the enamel filled with SiO 2 and TiO 2 nanocomposite as the coating for the induction motor to improve its efficiency. The efficiency of the induction motor was increased by 5 % by adding nanocomposites of SiO 2 and TiO 2 (1 : 3) to the enamel used as the coating for the windings of the three phase squirrel cage induction motor. Heat run test was performed on electrical machines to determine the total loss of energy dissipated as heat. The addition of nanocomposites to the enamel has increased the temperature withstanding capacity of the induction motor. The values of electromagnetic inference produced by normal induction motor and <b>nano</b> <b>coated</b> induction motor was also measured and analyzed.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{chameleon}} coating {{is to provide}} optimal performance of material in any environment.

Chameleon coating is supposed to resolve the issues with fluid hydraulics where atmospheric pressure changes under different environments. The chemical properties of fluid hydraulics alter under different atmospheric pressure because liquids and gases expand and condense under different pressures. Thus the goal of chameleon coating is to provide the same lubrication in machines from fluids such as oil but without the drawbacks of the coating or lubrication deteriorating under variable environments.|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{successfully}} fabricated and evaluated the functional properties of PCS nanofibre web by using latest Nano Spider machine, having very high throughput rate. A precise degree of process control {{was carried out}} to fabricate such SiC web. The fabricated SiC web is having average fibre diameters of approximately 1.5  μm. Heat treatment has significant influence on the morphology of PCS nanofibrous web. The as-spun PCS fibre is straight and becomes thinner & more irregular after pyrolization. SiC nanofibrous web is having interconnected fibre and leading to pores network {{and it is also}} confirmed that surface porous structure is deeply rooted, as revealed by 3 D AFM image. The formation of pores network by the interconnected fibres could be exploited for filter applications. There are chances of new crystalline morphology formation during electrospinning of as-spun PCS web as indicated by the XRD and DSC. The formation and growth of new crystalline morphological structure is due to stress on the PCS fluid during the high speed electrospinning process. Surface profilemetry revealed increase in surface roughness with the heat treatment of PCS webs. The SiC web is having highest roughness followed by cured and as-spun PCS webs, as it is confirmed by surface profilemetry in quantitative term and values. A thermally stable SiC web is fabricated, as confirmed by TGA analysis. DSC and TGA results correlate to each other. The ratio of C/Si is approximately 1 in SiC nanofibrous web, confirming high yield of SiC fibres without any impurities or other compounds.

40|$|Today, {{fastening}} articles such as {{screws and}} nails {{are treated with}} different surface coatings to withstand corrosion. The Swedish distributor ESSVE® Produkter AB uses a <b>nano</b> <b>coating</b> called CorrSeal™ for high corrosion protection of their screws. Thermal diffusion galvanization (TDG) is a more environmentally friendly method that the company seeks to use as replacement for the current treatment. This process of zinc diffusion is carried out at around 400 °C for several hours. The aim of the project is to investigate the possibility to surface treat a wood screw using TDG. The elevated temperature is suspected to decrease the hardness of the hardened screw. Therefore, a hardened and tempered screw without surface treatment is sent to a TDG facility. Industrial furnaces are used for similar heat treatments of screws with different hardenings. Both processes are analyzed by evaluating the results of hardness, bending, and microscopy. No immediate correlation between the TDG process and heat treatment in the industrial furnaces is found. Results show that the tested screws softened to a higher degree in the TDG process compared to treatment in the industrial furnaces. The mechanical properties of the tested screws, after the TDG process, are not acceptable. The zinc layer thickness on the screws is uneven yet believed to meet the required demands on corrosion resistance. Results also show that incorporating the TDG process in the tempering step is essential {{to meet the demands}} on hardness. Additionally, changing the composition of the material can lead to higher resistance against softening at the elevated temperatures.
