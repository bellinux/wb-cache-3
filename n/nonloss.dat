40|$|Abstract: A common aim of data {{modeling}} approaches {{is to produce}} schemas whose instantiations are always redundancy-free. This is especially useful when the implementation target is a relational database. This paper contrasts two very different approaches to attain a redundancy-free relational schema. The Object-Role Modeling (ORM) approach emphasizes capturing semantics first in terms of atomic (elementary or existential) fact types, followed by synthesis of fact types into relation schemes. Normalization by decomposition instead focuses on “nonloss decomposition ” to various, and progressively more refined, “normal forms”. <b>Nonloss</b> decomposition of a relation requires decomposition into smaller relations that, upon natural join, yield the exact original population. <b>Nonloss</b> decomposition of a table scheme (or relation variable) requires that the decomposition of all possible populations of the relation scheme is reversible in this way. In this paper we show that the dependency requirement for “all possible populations ” is too restrictive for definitions of multivalued and join dependencies over relation schemes. By exploiting modeling heuristics underlying ORM, we offer better definitions of these data dependencies, and of “nonloss decomposition”, thus enabling these concepts to be addressed at a truly semantic level. ...|$|E
40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} complex (TSC) is a tumor suppres-sor gene disorder {{characterized by}} mutations in the TSC 1 or TSC 2 genes. These mutations {{lead to the}} development of benign tumors involving smooth muscle cells, causing life-threatening lymphangio-leiomyomatosis. We isolated and characterized two types of cells bearing a mutation in TSC 2 exon 18 from a renal angiomyolipoma of a TSC patient: one population of -actin-positive smooth muscle-like cells with loss of heterozygosity for the TSC 2 gene (A cells) and another of <b>nonloss</b> of heterozygosity kera-tin 8 / 18 -positive epithelial-like cells (R cells).

40|$|We {{find that}} the {{pleasure}} of a gain is generally greater than the pleasure of a <b>nonloss</b> and that the pain of a loss is generally greater than the pain of a nongain. These patterns were found when participants reported both how they would feel if these outcomes were to happen (Studies 1 and 2) and how they actually felt when they happened (Study 3). Our results also {{suggest that it is}} stronger cheerfulness (rather than quiescence) that underlies the greater pleasure of a gain and stronger agitation (rather than dejection) that underlies the greater aversiveness of a loss. This set of findings is predicted by our regulatory focus conceptualization of how gain (promotion success) and nongain (promotion failure) versus <b>nonloss</b> (prevention success) and loss (prevention failure) differ in whether they are experienced in relation to a maximal goal or a minimal goal, respectively. Implications for models of emotional experiences and prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) are discussed. © 2000 Academic Press There is considerable interest, especially in the area of decision making, in the intensity of people’s reactions to gains versus losses. Studies have shown that losses generally loom larger than corresponding gains; i. e., losses are experienced more strongly than gains of the same objective magnitude (for a review, see Fishburn & Kochenberger, 1979; see also Galanter & Pliner, 1974). Loss aversion is, in fact, one of the central postulates of Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) influential prospect theory. They propose that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains, so that the subjective experience of pain from a loss of X is greater than the experience of pleasure from a gain of X. Regulatory focus theory (see Higgins, 1997, 1998) offers a novel perspectiv...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory focus (Higgins, 1997) {{builds on}} the classic approach-avoidance {{distinction}} by identifying two important approach orientations: the promotion focus (approaching gains and attainment) and the prevention focus (approaching <b>nonlosses</b> and safety). Though individual differences in regulatory focus have been widely studied in human psychology, it is unknown if such differences exist in other species. To explore this possibility, we designed {{a series of tests}} for laboratory rats, paralleling human regulatory focus research on risk taking. In home-cage tests, rats (N 23) were given an opportunity to prevent a loss by burying a noxious novel object. In solitary tests in a novel enclosure, the same rats had the opportunity to pursue gains (food rewards) and/or safety (darkness). Rats demonstrated stable individual differences on both tests (p’s. 001). Complementing the human research, duration of time spent with the noxious novel object was predicted by an individual’s tendency to pursue safety (p. 01) and not by the tendency to pursue gains (p. 8). Some aspects of these results were compatible with alternative approaches, such as the bold–shy axis and “if-then ” personality profiles (Mischel & Shoda, 1995). Regulatory focus theory, however, was uniquely able to predict the overall pattern, which may be an indication that it could contribute to future research in animal personality, motivation, and welfare...|$|R
40|$|Consumers ’ {{reactions}} to {{a difference in}} price can depend on how it is framed. If buyers interpret paying $ 60 rather than $ 65 as getting a $ 5 discount, then {{they are likely to}} consider paying $ 60 to be a gain and paying $ 65 to be a nongain. Alternatively, if they interpret having to pay $ 65 rather than $ 60 as incurring a $ 5 penalty, then they may consider paying $ 60 to be a <b>nonloss</b> and paying $ 65 to be a loss. Similarly, sellers can also experience gains, nongains, nonlosses, and losses. This article suggests that buyers are prevention focused and consequently place a greater emphasis on loss-related frames, whereas sellers are promotion focused and place a greater emphasis on gain-related frames. Therefore, for equivalent positive outcomes, buyers feel better about nonlosses, but sellers feel better about gains. For equivalent negative out-comes, buyers feel worse about losses, but sellers feel worse about nongains. These effects, however, disappear when there is little motivation to process information about the monetary transaction. Consumers acquire products as buyers and dispose them of as sellers. After they decide to buy or sell, however, they might interpret the price they pay or receive using differen...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveEndovascular {{repair of}} {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysm (AAA) {{is complicated by}} the potential for stent graft migration over time. Factors including the type of fixation, initial proximal fixation length, and dilation and elongation of the infrarenal aortic neck may contribute to device migration. We sought to determine when device migration is a real phenomenon with actual device movement that compromises aneurysm exclusion. MethodsComputed tomographic (CT) scans and computer reconstructions of all patients undergoing endovascular AAA repair with a passive fixation device at our institution from June 1996 to October 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. The distance from the distal renal artery to the proximal end of the stent graft at the time of initial deployment was determined for each patient. Migration was defined as a distance increase greater than 5 mm in the follow-up period; proximal fixation length, aortic neck enlargement and elongation, and neck angle were then measured. Data were further analyzed with respect to AAA growth, development of endoleak, AAA rupture, and the need for reintervention. ResultsA total of 308 patients with endovascular AAA repairs using a passive fixation device had complete postoperative imaging data sets; 48 patients (15. 6 %) with stent graft migration of 5 mm or more were identified, and 25 (8. 1 %) of these had a migration of 10 mm or more. Seventeen (35. 4 %) of 48 migration patients had a total loss of the proximal seal zone (loss patients); their average migration distance was 17. 7 ± 12. 0 mm, with a mean neck shortening of 13. 6 ± 14. 2 mm, and the average proximal fixation length loss was 14. 0 ± 7. 6 mm. Those 31 patients with an intact proximal seal zone (<b>nonloss</b> patients) showed an average migration of 9. 4 ± 3. 7 mm, with a mean neck lengthening of 9. 6 ± 8. 4 mm and an average proximal fixation length change of 0. 7 ± 8. 0 mm. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences between the loss and <b>nonloss</b> patients in follow-up duration (65. 9 ± 20. 4 months vs 45. 9 ± 26. 4 months; P =. 01), neck dilatation at the distal renal artery (4. 6 ± 4. 5 mm vs 1. 8 ± 1. 9 mm; P =. 026), stent graft migration distance (17. 7 ± 12. 0 mm vs 9. 4 ± 3. 7 mm; P =. 001), change in aortic neck length (− 13. 6 ± 14. 2 mm vs 9. 6 ± 8. 4 mm; P <. 0001), change in proximal fixation length (− 14. 0 ± 7. 6 mm vs 0. 7 ± 8. 0 mm; P <. 0001), change in AAA size (1. 8 ± 7. 1 mm vs − 3. 6 ± 9. 7 mm; P =. 033), and use of a stiff body stent graft (47. 1 % vs 19. 4 %; P =. 043). However, only change in aortic neck length was statistically significant on multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0. 75; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 591 - 0. 961; P =. 022). There were no differences between the loss and <b>nonloss</b> patients in time to migration discovery, initial AAA size, initial aortic neck diameter or length, initial device oversizing, initial neck angle, neck angle increase, type II endoleak, or AAA rupture. Eight of the 17 loss patients have been treated with proximal aortic cuffs; the remainder have refused reintervention, died of unrelated causes, or elected to have open repair. ConclusionsPostoperative elongation of the infrarenal aortic neck may create the radiographic perception of migration without necessarily causing a loss of proximal stent graft fixation. Patients with a total loss of the proximal seal zone actually have infrarenal aortic neck shortening, with a degree of neck dilatation beyond initial device oversizing that may compromise proximal fixation length. Conversely, those with an intact proximal seal zone demonstrate aortic neck elongation equivalent to migration, with no loss of proximal fixation length; these patients have a benign natural history without intervention. Thus, aortic neck dilatation beyond oversizing, aortic neck shortening, and loss of proximal fixation length are more clinically relevant predictors of proximal stent graft failure than simple migration distance...|$|E
40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} complex (TSC) is a tumor {{suppressor gene}} disorder characterized by mutations in the TSC 1 or TSC 2 genes. These mutations {{lead to the development}} of benign tumors involving smooth muscle cells, causing life-threatening lymphangioleiomyomatosis. We isolated and characterized two types of cells bearing a mutation in TSC 2 exon 18 from a renal angiomyolipoma of a TSC patient: one population of α-actin-positive smooth muscle-like cells with loss of heterozygosity for the TSC 2 gene (A+ cells) and another of <b>nonloss</b> of heterozygosity keratin 8 / 18 -positive epithelial-like cells (R+ cells). Unlike control aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, A+ cells required epidermal growth factor (EGF) to grow and substituting EGF with insulin-like growth factor (IGF) - 1 failed to increase the cell number; however, omission of EGF did not cause cell loss. The A+ cells constantly released IGF- 1 into the culture medium and constitutively showed a high degree of S 6 K phosphorylation even when grown in serum-free medium. Exposure to antibodies against EGF and IGF- 1 receptors caused a rapid loss of A+ cells: 50 % by 5 days and 100 % by 12 days. Signal transduction mediated by EGF and IGF-I receptors is therefore involved in A+ cell survival. These results may offer a novel therapeutic perspective for the treatment of TSC complications and lymphangioleiomyomatosis...|$|E
