2500|$|In 1978, McCotter {{was criticized}} in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a {{statement}} he made during a sermon about child rearing. The sermon {{was based upon}} the Bible verse Proverbs 20:30 ("Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.") In it, McCotter said, [...] "When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, {{that you want to}} do it so it wounds. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> say ‘wounds,’ it doesn’t mean that you have a bloody mess on your hands necessarily. It doesn’t mean that you have a child ‘wounding’ like he has a broken leg.... And he may, and often will be, black and blue. My children have been many times. And it cleans evil from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the chorus, he sings: [...] "I’m at a {{payphone}} {{trying to}} call home / All of my change I spent on you / Where have the times gone? / Baby, it’s all wrong / Where are the plans we made for two?". Because this is their first song with profanity, [...] "Shit" [...] and [...] "fucking" [...] are intact, but have been replaced with [...] "it" [...] and [...] "stupid" [...] in the song's clean version. The clean version censors Wiz Khalifa's cursing as well. When Khalifa serves his verse, his rhymes don't speak of his love life, but rather his [...] "haters": [...] "I'll be out spending all this money while you sittin' 'round wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin' / Made it from the bottom <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see me I'm stunnin'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} Pan's Labyrinth came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, {{which he says}} are filled with [...] "doodles, ideas, {{drawings}} and plot bits". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Alan honestly, [...] "very beautiful <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{are quiet}} as <b>now,</b> not <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are dancing {{as you did}} the other night without your robes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Allonby nodded. [...] "New Mexico, Arizona, {{or somewhere}} there. <b>Now,</b> just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were {{beginning}} to listen, there's Mr. Torrance wanting me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good. The brigands {{of those}} days must, of course, be dead by this time. <b>Now,</b> sir, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have leisure, let us hasten." ...|$|R
2500|$|Stilwell appealed {{directly}} to President Roosevelt {{for help with}} his dispute with Chiang, and as a result, Roosevelt sent Chiang a message which read: [...] "I have urged time and again in recent months that you take drastic action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to China and to you. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have not yet placed General Stilwell in command of all forces in China, {{we are faced with}} the loss of a critical area... with possible catastrophic consequences". Roosevelt ended his ultimatum to Chiang with the threat to end all American aid unless Chiang [...] "at once" [...] place Stilwell [...] "in unrestricted command of all your forces." [...] General Chennault later claimed that Stilwell had deliberately ordered Sino-American forces out of Guilin as a way of creating a crisis that would force Chiang to give up command of his armies to Stilwell. Stilwell's diary supports Chennault's claim as Stilwell wrote that if a crisis emerged that was [...] "just sufficient {{to get rid of the}} Peanut without entirely wrecking the ship, it would be worth it", going on to write that the entire Kuomintang system had to be [...] "torn to bits" [...] and Chiang would just have to go.|$|E
60|$|LEVER. You did {{n't tell}} me what you were {{thinking}} about just <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> sat there like stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "But she is there--by herself--at that place--what is it called? Ten--bie. Will you not go <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{can do no}} harm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's go {{back around}} the marsh and home {{by way of}} Lover's Lane. Do you feel as disgruntled <b>now</b> as <b>when</b> <b>you</b> started out, Anne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Willingly!" [...] exclaimed Dorothy; [...] "indeed, {{it is of}} no use to me <b>now,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have it you can {{command the}} Winged Monkeys three times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'"We {{will see}} what the doctor says," [...] I answered. [...] "You must stop work <b>now,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go downstairs just say that I wish to see Brunton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye!" [...] sneered Gaston, still writhing with pain, [...] "at my service <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{hope that}} my broken wrist will ensure your impunity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your friends don't {{want you}} just <b>now.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> started for Vancouver, I {{think you ought}} to have told me about your {{ranching}} experiment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (So <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{hear the}} Frogs croaking in a {{particularly}} melancholy way, you may be sure they're trying to guess Bruno's next Shakespeare 'Bit'. Isn't that interesting?) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} much better as <b>you</b> are <b>now</b> than <b>when</b> <b>you</b> indulge that bitter vein of yours, Razumov. And {{nobody in the}} house saw you return--eh? That might have {{appeared}} queer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, ask them," [...] {{said the}} Girton Girl. [...] "Here {{are three of}} them present. <b>Now,</b> honestly, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> talk about us among yourselves, do you gush about our virtue, and goodness, and wisdom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The old man glanced {{about him}} like one who seeks {{a way of}} escape. At last--"If say it you must," [...] he growled, [...] "say it here and <b>now.</b> And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have said it, go." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. I dunno. [She shivers.] I was standin' {{here just}} <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> was talkin', and when I heard 'im, it cam' over {{me to do}} it--like.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you were}} {{watching}} the boat very closely just <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> saw me. What else did you see? Anything before that--before you saw me in the water?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, sir, try again,' said Hob. 'Strike as you {{did when}} the black bull came down. Why cannot you do the like <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are {{tingling}} from Bunce's stroke?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Except {{for your}} mental condition, you're {{in better shape}} <b>now</b> than <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came home." [...] Doctor Bronson peered at Lane from under his shaggy brows, walked to the window, looked out, and returned, evidently deep in thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{never spoken}} {{of it before}} because it's your business, not mine," [...] {{continued}} the girl. I wouldn't have spoken <b>now,</b> but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> referred to your loneliness I thought perhaps you didn't realize the cause of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|She opposed {{him there}} also. [...] "Don't do that--not now. Wait. I have a plan. I'll {{not go into}} it <b>now,</b> but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come back, {{if there is no}} change, we will all go home and I will explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm told it's {{an active}} sort of life. You're fast asleep, and I was just <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were preaching. We'd better go to bed. Nine o'clock for breakfast, I suppose?" ...|$|E
60|$|But even <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{enter the}} building, you lower your voice, and time turns {{backward}} for you, for the atmosphere which you breathe is cold with the exudation of buried generations.|$|E
6000|$|She {{waited in}} all the {{sharpness}} of a trouble {{that for the first}} time since he had known her made her splendidly stern. “How can you understand <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> didn’t understand before?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What was it {{that you}} called me just <b>now,</b> Nada, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> prayed me to protect you? Father, was it not?" [...] and I turned my face towards the blaze of the fire, so that the full light fell upon it.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{surprisingly}} {{another letter}} followed, the angry Kaʻiulani wrote:"Dear Mama Nui,I want another hat. Mama Likelike {{has taken the}} one you sent me. Are <b>you</b> better <b>now?</b> <b>When</b> are <b>you</b> coming coming home? With much love. From your little girl, Kaʻiulani." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And if you had--if {{suffering}} and danger had driven {{it from your}} thoughts--which it has not--you would remember it <b>now,</b> Walter, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> find me poor and abandoned, with no home but this, and no friends but the two who hear me speak!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Florence,' said Walter, 'on {{this last}} night of her bearing her own name, has made me promise--it was only just <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> left us together--that I would tell you--with her dear love--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you think}} of Fitful Head <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> lie awake at night, of gulls shrieking round it, and waves {{tumbling}} in upon it, rather than of the graves under the rectory back-kitchen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a better}} way than that, I tried it once before and it worked well. See <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tell a lie I will not punish you, but you shall punish me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, dearest Elinor, {{do not let}} him {{paint the}} look which you now wear," [...] said her lover, smiling, though rather perplexed. [...] "There: it is passing away <b>now,</b> but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> spoke, you seemed frightened to death, and very sad besides. What were you {{thinking}} of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is no need}} of a promise, my lad. I know it full well; {{but between}} <b>now</b> and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> open fire is a vexing time, during which many a good man has lost his head, {{therefore}} have a care just at this moment." ...|$|R
60|$|KEITH. <b>Now</b> listen, Larry. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> leave here, go {{straight}} home, {{and stay there}} till I give you leave to go out again. Promise.|$|R
