40|$|After the North Korean test {{of seven}} medium and long range {{missiles}} on July 4, 2006 and the partially successful {{test of a}} nuclear explosive on October 9, 2006, the international community acted with unity and strength by way of UN resolutions 1695 and 1718 to prevent further tests of missiles, {{as well as a}} second nuclear test of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). On the one hand, the new international sanctions were designed to punish North Korea for its provocative acts; yet on the other, the door should be kept open to bring them back to the Six-party Talks. For this reason, civil goods were excluded from sanctions. The European Union condemned these tests immediately and participated in the sanctions of the UN. The EU is not a major protagonist in countering the proliferation efforts of the leadership in Pyongyang. On the contrary, {{with the end of the}} Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in May 2006, Brussels had lost its last instrument of influence regarding the nuclear ambitions of North Korea directly. Keeping in mind that the DPRK has become the greatest threat to global proliferation through its retreat from the Non-proliferation Treaty in 2003 and through its declaration to enter the status of a nuclear weapon state in February 2005, the inactivity of the EU comes as a surprise. In 2003 Brussels developed, as an alternative answer to the U. S. invasion of Iraq, its own multilateral strategy to fight the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, mainly by means of diplomacy. In spite of the fact that it has become highly engaged in nuclear nonproliferation efforts in the region, it lacks a comprehensive engagement strategy to counter the nuclear efforts of the North Korean leadership. This report describes Brussels’ relations towards Pyongyang in three areas that were most important for both sides since 1995 : 1. Support of American non-proliferation efforts towards North Korea. 2. Humanitarian aid for the North Korean people and 3. Development of economic trade relations with Pyongyang. Compared to other major protagonists in the region, the EU offered only minor financial assistance to the U. S. led KEDO program with a two percent share. Nearly three times higher, the absolute financial value of its humanitarian food assistance for North Korea was also surpassed by several other countries (e. g. USA, Republic of Korea). Trade relations with North Korea are not important for the EU and can be easily replaced because the DPRK has no goods of strategic value, like crude oil in the case of Iran. For Pyongyang, trade relations with the EU are more important, because it shared 12 percent of its total trade with the European Union. Here the EU has some leverage. As a consequence of the nuclear crisis the EU has reduced its financial support and bilateral economic relations since 2004. Because the outcome of the present nuclear crisis is difficult to predict, two different scenarios are discussed: The best outcome would be the “complete nuclear disarmament” of the DPRK. A less optimal but still constructive outcome would be a “constrained nuclear arms race” in the region. An unconstrained arms competition seems unlikely, beII cause North Korea alone, even if nuclear armed, appears too weak to justify such an effort for major protagonists in the region. Europe has some unique advantages for a greater engagement in order to support the regulation of the nuclear crisis. It was not involved in the Korean war from 1950 - 53 and has no strategic interests at stake. In contrast to major parts of the Bush administration, it rejects a strategy for regime change. Since 2001 the EU and its member states have increased their diplomatic presence in Pyongyang and therefore, compared to other countries like the USA and Japan, have better access to information about the North Korean leadership. This can be used cautiously in order to increase the leverage of Brussels. But a greater engagement of the European Union also faces some serious hurdles. First and foremost, the EU is more interested in U. S. cooperation in order to regulate the nuclear crisis with Iran. Therefore, Brussels has subordinated its non-proliferation policy regarding the DPRK to this goal and has avoided challenging the conservative U. S. government with its alternative non-proliferation strategy. Secondly, the EU members are split about the right strategy to engage North Korea for structural reasons. Some members of the EU (France, UK) possess nuclear weapons; others (Germany, Italy, Greece) are interested in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>commitment</b> of the USA; and others (Sweden, Ireland, Austria) reject the possession of nuclear weapons. Thirdly, the lack of transparency in the North Korean economy and the strong influence of the North Korean military in the economy, which is at present a major obstacle for economic reform in this country, complicates any serious engagement of the European Union. Under these circumstances, the EU can contribute better when multilateral cooperation works between all parties of the Six-party Talks and the DPRK is ready for nuclear disarmament. Political measures to strengthen multilateralism and to support the nonproliferation regime convincingly, can help to create a more conducive environment for negotiations and reduce tensions between the USA and China. EU assistance with economic reforms in the DPRK can increase the political flexibility of the North Korean leadership. In this regard, Brussels can broaden the economic, commercial and social activities of its Chamber of Commerce in Korea; develop a follow-up strategy for its first EU-DPRK country strategy of 2001; negotiate new development programs with Pyongyang; enhance economic transparency for foreign investments in special economic areas; support membership of Pyongyang in the World Bank; and accept negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea, including the special North Korean Kaesong area. Furthermore, measures to support the North Korean nuclear disarmament should strengthen the norms of international non-proliferation, help Pyongyang, and reduce the costs for the five members of the Six-party process. In this regard the EU can try to regain a leading role in the follow-up organization of KEDO; contribute to the delivery of energy and/or revival of the light water reactor program; offer financial and technical assistance for the dismantlement of nuclear facilities and equipment; expand these efforts to other categories of WMD (chemical, biological weapons); contribute to a negative security assurance through France and the United Kingdom; and offer seminars on the transfer of European experience with military transparency and confidence building measures. III This list of possible measures shows that the EU has many tools to support the sixparty process. Because the present status of a North Korean uranium enrichment program is uncertain, it does not seem to be an immediate threat to proliferation. There is still time to resolve it. A compromise on the North Korea plutonium program can pave the way and build the necessary confidence to facilitate a regulation afterwards. If the Six-party process fails and North Korea deploys a rudimentary nuclear deterrence force, compensatory security measures are essential to secure the control of these weapons and to reduce the risk of their inadvertent use, and to prevent a ‘use or lose’ position for reasons of stability. Some kind of predictability and accountability together with transparency (although limited), seems necessary to preserve essential cooperation in the region. Here again, the European Union can assist in linking further economic incentives to the DPRK through the fulfillment of certain minimum standards of military confidence and security building measures. It can supplement this with offers by certain member countries to host seminars on military confidence-building. The DPRK has no resources or capabilities for a quick nuclear build-up and, because the option of unification (and then a fast nuclear disarmament) is always possible, Japan and South Korea should not overreact to a nuclear capable North Korea. The European Union should help the international community to convince Tokyo and Seoul that they should further stay in the Non-proliferation Treaty. However, the EU has only limited means to support the six-party process and it lacks the capability to force the main parties back to the negotiating table. It can use persuasion and offer limited incentives, but without a strategic change in its approach to the Sixparty Talks by one or both of the main protagonists, success seems less likely. And without a better outlook for these negotiations, Europe will be unable to develop a new consensus for the necessary engagement measures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} arguably {{the single most}} {{striking}} contrast in contemporary major energy politics in Europe (and even the developed world as a whole) : the starkly differing civil nuclear policies of Germany and the UK. Germany is seeking entirely to phase out nuclear power by 2022. Yet the UK advocates a ‘nuclear renaissance’, promoting the most ambitious new nuclear construction programme in Western Europe. Here,this paper poses a simple yet quite fundamental question: what are the particular divergent conditions most strongly implicated in the contrasting developments in these two countries. With nuclear playing such an iconic role in historical discussions over technological continuity and transformation, answering this may assist in wider understandings of sociotechnical incumbency and discontinuity in the burgeoning field of‘sustainability transitions’. To this end, an ‘abductive’ approach is taken: deploying nine potentially relevant criteria for understanding the different directions pursued in Germany and the UK. Together constituted by 30 parameters spanning literatures related to socio-technical regimes in general as well as nuclear technology in particular, the criteria are divided into those that are ‘internal’ and ‘external’ to the ‘focal regime configuration’ of nuclear power and associated ‘challenger technologies’ like renewables. It is ‘internal’ criteria that are emphasised in conventional sociotechnical regime theory, with ‘external’ criteria relatively less well explored. Asking under each criterion whether attempted discontinuation of nuclear power {{would be more likely}} in Germany or the UK, a clear picture emerges. ‘Internal’ criteria suggest attempted nuclear discontinuation should be more likely in the UK than in Germany– the reverse of what is occurring. ‘External’ criteria are more aligned with observed dynamics –especially those relating to military <b>nuclear</b> <b>commitments</b> and broader ‘qualities of democracy’. Despite many differences of framing concerning exactly what constitutes ‘democracy’, a rich political science literature on this point is unanimous in characterising Germany more positively than the UK. Although based only on a single case,a potentially important question is nonetheless raised as to whether sociotechnical regime theory might usefully give greater attention to the general importance of various aspects of democracy in constituting conditions for significant technological discontinuities and transformations. If so, the policy implications are significant. A number of important areas are identified for future research, including the roles of diverse understandings and specific aspects of democracy and the particular relevance of military nuclear commitments– whose under-discussion in civil nuclear policy literatures raises its own questions of democratic accountability...|$|R

30|$|The {{fluctuating}} and stochastic {{nature of}} wind power imposes new challenges to supply adequacy in electric power systems [5, 6]. Load fluctuation or generation failure also causes a supply adequacy problem in conventional power systems.

With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net load of the system exhibits two new features: increasing rate and range of variation; and increasing uncertainty of rate and range of variation.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of nuclear weapons}} {{is one of the}} most serious and challenging security issues of today. In September 2009 reports of a newly discovered nuclear facility, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, in the desert near the city of Qom again raised the question if Iran is in compliance with the obligations under its Safeguards Agreement. The Safeguards Agreement was concluded with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in accordance with the Non Proliferation Treaty in 1974. According to the IAEA Iran is bound by the modified rules of the Safeguards Agreement, called the “Revised Code 3. 1 ”, and therefore should have declared the Fordow facility at the time of the decision to construct the facility. Iran, on the other hand, claims to be in full compliance with its Safeguard Agreement, considering, as the Iranian government argues, that Iran is not bound by the changes made to these particular rules in 1992. The paper seeks to provide a basis for understanding the problematic from an international legal perspective, using international treaty law as tool of analysis. For the interpretation of Iran’s rights and obligations in its relationship to the IAEA the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) is applied on the Iran’s Safeguards Agreement. It is concluded that Iran’s argumentation lacks credibility and that the Fordow facility consequently should have been declared in accordance with the position of the IAEA. Furthermore, the report discusses the overall legitimacy of the non-proliferation regime in general and the (questionable) application of the non-proliferation rules in relation to Iran in particular.

Increased utilisation of biomass for energy purposes incombined heat and power (CHP) plants can help the country meetits <b>nuclear</b> phase-out <b>commitment.</b> The present low-CO 2 emissioncharacteristics of the Swedish electricity production system(governed by hydropower and nuclear power) can be retained onlyby expansion of biofuels in the CHP sector. Domestic Swedishbiomass resources are vast and renewable, but not infinite. They should be utilised as efficiently as possible in order tomeet the conditions for sustainability in the future. Application of efficient power generation cycles at low cost isessential for meeting this challenge. This applies also tomunicipal solid waste (MSW) incineration with energyextraction, which is to be preferred to landfilling. Modern gas turbines and internal combustion engines firedwith natural gas have comparatively low installation costs,good efficiency characteristics and show reliable performancein power applications. Environmental and source-of-supplyfactors place natural gas at a disadvantage as compared tobiofuels. However, from a rational perspective, the use ofnatural gas (being the least polluting fossil fuel) togetherwith biofuels contributes to a diverse and more secure resourcemix. The question then arises if both these fuels can beutilised more efficiently if they are employed at the samelocation, in one combined cycle unit. The work presented herein concentrates on the hybriddual-fuel combined cycle concept in cold-condensing and CHPmode, with a biofuel-fired bottoming steam cycle and naturalgas fired topping gas turbine or engine. Higher electricalefficiency attributable to both fuels is sought, while keepingthe impact on environment at a low level and incorporating onlyproven technology with standard components. The study attemptsto perform a generalized and systematic evaluation of thethermodynamic advantages of various hybrid configurations withthe help of computer simulations, comparing the efficiencyresults to clearly defined reference values. Results show that the electrical efficiency of hybridconfigurations rises with up to 3 - 5 %-points in cold-condensingmode (up to 3 %-points in CHP mode), compared to the sum of twosingle-fuel reference units at the relevant scales, dependingon type of arrangement and type of bottoming fuel. Electricalefficiency of utilisation of the bottoming fuel (biomass orMSW) within the overall hybrid configuration can increase withup to 8 - 10 %-points, if all benefits from the thermalintegration are assigned to the bottoming cycle and effects ofscale on the reference electrical efficiency are accounted for. All fully-fired (windbox) configurations show advantages of upto 4 %-points in total efficiency in CHP mode with districtheating output, when flue gas condensation is applied. Theadvantages of parallel-powered configurations in terms of totalefficiency in CHP mode are only marginal. Emissions offossil-based CO 2 can be reduced with 20 to 40 kg CO 2 /MWhel incold-condensing mode and with 5 - 8 kg CO 2 per MWh total outputin CHP mode at the optimum performance points.

In Task 1 reference materials and standard sources for segregation of materials and for free release measurements needed to be produced and characterised. From a standard solution a mother dilution was made to obtain a solution with an activity concentration of around 100 Bq per 20 μL. The solution was dispensed in the cavity of 1120 metallic source holders making use of a precision pattern dispenser. After evaporation of the liquid, the cavity of the CMI source holders was mechanically closed. Before and during the source preparation, check sources in the shape of aluminium pills were produced in order to monitor the stability of the activity concentration of the mother solution. The activity of all the sources was determined by gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements using a NaI-well detector. Some outliers were identified and 1100 sources with certified activity content were selected and made available for further use in Work Package 2 of the project. On the basis of the activity calculations it can be stated that sources were successfully prepared according to the specifications and will be used as calibration standards for the calibration of a free release measurement facility to measure radioactive waste. They can also be used as calibration standard for the calibration of waste segregation facilities. One of the deliverables in the task was to develop a reference material for the calibration of a free release facility and testing facility for segregation of waste. The sources are in the form of 1100 steel and 1100 plastic balls with point sources of 152 Eu and 60 Co inside. The task of RN was to produce and standardise the 1100 60 Co point sources in a form of metal holders containing around 100 Bq of 60 Co each. These metallic source holders can be inserted in metallic or plastic balls in order to simulate contaminated waste. The sources were successfully produced using an precision pattern dispenser, and standardised by measuring them in the 20. 3 X 20. 3 cm NaI-well detector.
