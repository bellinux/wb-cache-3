40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} that pain affects {{the goodness of}} breastfeeding. Materials and Methods: Seventy-nine patients were interviewed regarding satisfaction in breastfeeding, tiredness, uterine pain, nipple and other pain, and analgesic use at day three and at first, second, third, and fourth week after birth.

Milk formula supplements, bottle use, pacifier use, and <b>nipple</b> <b>shields</b> use were considered as variables suggesting unsuccessful breastfeeding.

At first week after delivery, the presence of pain differing from nipple and uterine pain, was more likely associated with milk formula supplementing, bottle use, pacifier use, less satisfaction in breastfeeding, and more tiredness.

40|$|Background and Aim: Evidence-based {{knowledge}} of how to guide the mothers of preterm infants in breastfeeding establishment is contradictive or sparse. The aim was to investigate the associations between pre-specified clinical practices for facilitating breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge as well as adequate duration thereof. Methods: A prospective survey based on questionnaires was conducted with a Danish national cohort, comprised of 1, 221 mothers and their 1, 488 preterm infants with a gestational age of 24 – 36 weeks. Adjusted for covariates, the pre-specified clinical practices were analysed by multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: At discharge 68 % of the preterm infants were exclusively breastfed and 17 % partially. Test-weighing the infant, and minimizing the use of a pacifier, showed a protective effect to exclusive breastfeeding at discharge (OR 0. 6 (95 % CI 0. 4 – 0. 8) and 0. 4 (95 % CI 0. 3 – 0. 6), respectively).

The different situations faced by preterm and sick infants and their mothers, compared to healthy infants and their mothers, necessitate a specific breastfeeding policy for neonatal intensive care and require that health care professionals have knowledge and skills in lactation and breastfeeding support, including provision of antenatal information, that are specific to neonatal care. Facilitation of early, continuous, and prolonged skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo mother care), early initiation of breastfeeding, and mothers' access to breastfeeding support during the infants' whole hospital stay are important.

Efforts {{should be made to}} minimize parent-infant separation and facilitate parents' unrestricted presence with their infants.

50|$|Individuals with {{inverted}} nipples {{may find}} that their nipples protract (come out) temporarily or permanently during pregnancy, or {{as a result of}} breastfeeding. Most women with inverted nipples who give birth are able to breastfeed without complication, but inexperienced mothers may experience higher than average pain and soreness when initially attempting to breastfeed. When a mother uses proper breastfeeding technique, the infant latches onto the areola, not the nipple, so women with inverted nipples are actually able to breastfeed without any problem. An infant that latches on well may be able to slush out an inverted nipple. The use of a breast pump or other suction device immediately before a feeding may help to draw out inverted nipples. A hospital grade electric pump may be used for this purpose. Some women also find that using a <b>nipple</b> <b>shield</b> can help facilitate breastfeeding. Frequent stimulation such as sexual intercourse and foreplay (such as nipple sucking) also helps the nipple protract.|$|E

The use of nipple shields is a controversial topic in the field of lactation.
