Remaining effects are partially explained by variations in employment density, with an elasticity of about 3. 8 percent and by Marshall-Arrow-Romer externalities, where doubling the share of a (2 -digit <b>NACE)</b> <b>industry</b> results in a 2. 4 percent higher productivity.

With the sectoral data we assess the contribution of intangibles to productivity growth based on growth accounting and econometric estimation of production functions. The growth accounting contribution of intangibles to labor productivity growth is generally highest in manufacturing and finance. The estimated output elasticity of intangibles lies between 0. 1 and 0. 2, considerably below values found in previous research using aggregate data. ...|$|R

30|$|As {{concerns}} Italy, that is {{the country}} of interest of the present paper, {{in the last decade}} the logistics industry has been increasingly interested by inward FDI, which are concentrated in the supply of integrated and intermodal services or other higher value added services than the pure goods and passengers transport. In this paper we use a wide definition of logistics industry as the ensemble of the firms offering all the services useful for the movements of goods along the supply chain and passengers from an origin to a final destination. More precisely, it comprises both Logistics Services Providers (LSP), offering single services, on a stand-alone basis (transportation, warehousing, handling, etc.) and Third-Party Logistics (3 PLs) or Fourth Party Logistics (4 PLs) Providers or Integrated Logistics Providers, supplying different services in a integrated way. To do so, we refer to all the codes included in 2002 <b>NACE</b> <b>industry</b> “I” “Transport, storage and communication”, with the exception of 64.11 (national post activities) and 64.2 (telecommunications) 1.|$|R
30|$|Table 4 in the Appendix {{presents}} the unconditional mean hourly wage by country and by <b>NACE</b> <b>industry.</b> We observe significant variation among the 27 countries. The lowest average hourly wages {{are found in}} Bulgaria (€ 1.58) and Romania (€ 1.95) and the highest in Norway (€ 26.79) and Iceland (€ 25.26). This incredibly large range, unadjusted though it is for local cost of living, taxes, and other local peculiarities and amenities, points to the immense incentives for migration that already exist and will intensify as flows are liberalised further. In the public sector, the hourly wages in Bulgaria and Romania are € 1.81 and € 2.68 respectively, while in Norway and Iceland they are € 24.63 and € 27.89. From Table 4 in the Appendix one can also infer the unconditional wage levels in and implied wage differentials between the bolded public (NACE L) and components {{of the private sector}} in the 27 countries. Conditional public-private wage differentials are examined in the next section.|$|R
40|$|It is {{frequently}} argued that policymakers should target high-tech firms, i. e., firms with high R&D intensity, because such firms are considered more innovative and therefore potential fast-growers. This argument {{relies on the}} assumption that the association among high-tech status, innovativeness and growth is actually positive. We examine this assumption by studying the industry distribution of high-growth firms (HGFs) across all 4 -digit <b>NACE</b> <b>industries,</b> using data covering all limited liability firms in Sweden during the period 1997 – 2008. The results of fractional logit regressions indicate that industries with high R&D intensity, ceteris paribus, can be expected to have a lower share of HGFs than can industries with lower R&D intensity. The findings cast doubt on the wisdom of targeting R&D industries or subsidizing R&D to promote firm growth. In contrast, we find that HGFs are overrepresented in knowledge-intensive service industries, i. e., service industries with a high share of human capital.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} industry {{determinants of}} {{the shape of}} Swedish firm size distributions at the 3 -digit (<b>NACE)</b> <b>industry</b> level between 1999 - 2004 for surviving firms. Recent theoretical studies have begun to develop {{a better understanding of}} the causal mechanisms behind the shape of firm size distributions. At the same time there is a growing need for more systematic empirical research. This paper therefore presents a two-stage empirical model, in which the shape parameters of the size distribution are estimated in a rst stage, with rm size measured as number of employees. In a second stage regression analysis, anumber of hypotheses regarding economic variables that may determine the distributional shape are tested. The result from the first step are largely consistent with previous statistical ndings conrming a power law. The main nding, however, is that increases in industry capital and nancial constraint exert a considerable inuence on the size distribution, shaping it over time towards thinner tails, and hence fewer large firms.

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of import {{competition}} from low-wage countries (LWCs) on inflationary pressure in Europe? This paper examines whether labor- intensive exports from emerging Europe, Asia, and other global regions have a uniform impact on producer prices in Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In a panel covering 110 (4 -digit) <b>NACE</b> <b>industries</b> from 1995 to 2008, instrumental variable estimations predict that LWC im- port competition is associated with strong price effects. More specifically, when LWC exporters capture 1 % of European market share, producer prices decrease by about 3 %. In contrast, no effect is present for import competition from low-wage countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Decomposing the mechanisms that underlie the LWC price effect on European industry, we show that import competition has a pronounced effect on average productivity with only a muted effect on wages or margins. Owing to the exit of firms and the increase in productivity, LWC import competition is shown to have substantially reduced employment in the European manufacturing sector. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we compute price/quality gap {{indicators}} to measure vertical intra-iundustry trade (VIIT) in EU markets at 3 -digit <b>NACE</b> <b>industry</b> level. These indicators are {{then used to}} test some hypotheses relative to the determinants {{of the quality of}} trade of Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). Two underlying models of VIIT are tested: a neo-H-O model (Falvey, 1981; Falvey-Kierzkowski, 1987), based on factor endowment, and an “economic geography ” model, based on market size and economic integration (Greenaway-Torstensson, 1997). The explanatory variables (proxies for human capital, physical capital, market size and market integration) affect the dependent variable (unit-value differences) with relevant and significant coefficients. The negative sign for the variable human capital, interacted with the dummy for CEECs, suggests the existence of comparative disadvantages in the high-skill sectors for these countries. Moreover, the lower market size of CEECs could strengthen their disadvantage in high quality segments of production. However, the geographic proximity to the core of Europe and the integration process, which are strongly correlated with high quality trade, could make faster the process of catching up...|$|R
