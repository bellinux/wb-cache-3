40|$|The {{members of}} the Phyllostomidae, the <b>New-World</b> <b>leaf-nosed</b> family of <b>bats,</b> show a {{remarkable}} evolutionary diversification of dietary strategies including insectivory, as the ancestral trait, followed by appearance of carnivory and plant-based diets such as nectarivory and frugivory. Here we explore the microbiome composition of different feeding specialists: insectivore Macrotus waterhousii, sanguivore Desmodus rotundus, nectarivores Leptonycteris yerbabuenae and Glossophaga soricina, and frugivores Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus jamaicensis. The V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene from three intestinal regions of three individuals per species was amplified and community composition and structure was analyzed with α and β diversity metrics. Bats with plant-based diets had low diversity microbiomes, whereas the sanguivore D. rotundus and insectivore M. waterhousii had the most diverse microbiomes. There {{were no significant differences}} in microbiome composition between different intestine regions within each individual. Plant-based feeders showed less specificity in their microbiome compositions, whereas animal-based specialists, although more diverse overall, showed a more clustered arrangement of their intestinal bacterial components. The main characteristics defining microbiome composition in phyllostomids were species and feeding strategy. This study shows how differences in feeding strategies contributed to the development of different intestinal microbiomes in Phyllostomidae...|$|R

40|$|The Diadem <b>Leaf-nosed</b> <b>Bat</b> Hipposideros diadema (E. Geoffroy, 1813) is {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time from the Andaman Islands, India. A solitary female specimen was collected on October 13, 2015 from a limestone cave on Baratang Island. Cranial measurements and other morphological characters indicate that the specimen differs from the endemic subspecies, the Nicobar Diadem <b>Leaf-nosed</b> <b>Bat</b> Hipposideros diadema nicobarensis (Dobson, 1871), but compares favourably with the South-east Asian subspecies, Mason’s Diadem <b>Leaf-nosed</b> <b>Bat</b> Hipposideros diadema masoni (Dobson, 1872), in description, craniodental characters, and echolocation calls. This is the first record of Hipposideros diadema (E. Geoffroy, 1813) from Andaman Islands, and the subspecies Mason’s Diadem <b>Leaf-nosed</b> <b>Bat</b> Hipposideros diadema masoni (Dobson, 1872) from India...|$|R
