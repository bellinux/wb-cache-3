5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered all}} the Muslim armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya. This maneuver gave a decisive blow to Heraclius' plan, as he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where the Muslim light cavalry could be effectively used against the heavy and less mobile Byzantine cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the Vietnam War {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because {{of opposition to}} United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> assist in making anti-war films.|$|E

Montecuccoli gave no direct support {{as he was}} {{severely}} outnumbered by the Ottomans. The Ottomans, meanwhile, completed the conquest of Transylvania [...] and built up their forces in Ottoman Hungary. Leopold I, <b>not</b> <b>wishing</b> <b>to</b> face the Turks alone, summoned the Imperial Diet in January 1663.|$|R
5|$|In August 2012, Guillermo del Toro {{revealed}} he {{had been}} interested in directing the film, as the Japanese arc was his favorite Wolverine story.

5|$|Roosevelt did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{lead the}} U.S. into the war; his 1937 Quarantine Speech denouncing {{aggression}} by Italy and Japan had met mixed responses. Welles felt freer in this regard, looking towards postwar border {{issues and the}} establishment of a U.S.-led international body that could intervene in such disputes. Roosevelt saw Welles's stronger public statements as experiments that would test the public mood in regard to U.S. foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Ross and Emily's {{marriage}} was originally planned to last, but Helen Baxendale did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> remain in America while pregnant. The writers could not script a convincing story for why Emily {{would not be}} seen, despite being married to Ross, so Baxendale was written {{out in the next}} season, making only three cameo appearances after the season premiere.|$|E
5|$|Some {{patients}} – {{particularly those}} who are terminally ill – may <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be involved in making pain management decisions, and may delegate such choices to their treatment providers. The patient's participation {{in his or her}} treatment is a right, not an obligation, and although reduced involvement may result in less-than-optimal pain management, such choices should be respected.|$|E

5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be cast the other way about, but Richardson did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, {{but he did not}} receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Third Reich, Hess was {{nominated}} to serve again as a judge in Düsseldorf but declined, as he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> work alongside former colleagues who {{had been part of the}} Nazi judicial system. He started a new career in the railways in 1946, and from 1949–55 served as President of the German Federal Railways Authority in Frankfurt am Main. He was awarded a Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and was given a plaque of honour by the city of Frankfurt in 1970. He died there on 14 September 1983.|$|E

5|$|Although Jewish, Levi's {{family did}} not {{practise}} their religion, {{and were not}} part of the Jewish community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E
5|$|Although Marshall had {{recommended}} that MacArthur appoint as many Australian and Dutch officers to senior positions as possible, {{most of his}} staff {{was made up of}} US Army officers who had served under him in the Philippines. The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, had been on the staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical shortage of staff officers, which he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> exacerbate. Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as some American naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the Nobel Prize in Literature {{has been}} awarded to 113 individuals. When he {{received}} the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award {{under pressure from the}} government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> accept the Nobel Prize in Literature, as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past. However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.|$|E
