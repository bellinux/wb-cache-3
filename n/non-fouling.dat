40|$|To better {{understand}} the impacts of biofouling on the biological processes of the basibiont, the effects of epibiotic barnacles on the relative growth and reproductive indices of Stramonita haemastoma (Linnaeus, 1767) were assessed. A total of 1035 specimens were collected monthly for one year from Bizerta Channel (northern Tunisia). Endobiotic species comprised the lithophagous bivalves Lithophaga aristata and Rocellaria dubia of different sizes, communicating with the outside through tiny perforations. Intra-shell tunnels and galleries also sheltered annelids and sipunculids. Epibiotic species comprised algae and highly diversified invertebrates represented by crustaceans, polychaetes, molluscs, echinoderms, ascidians, sponges, bryozoans and sipunculids, with barnacles being the most common group. Comparison of growth features between <b>non-fouled</b> and fouled S. haemastoma revealed higher growth in <b>non-fouled</b> specimens. Differences in reproductive condition indices were detected in few months, being mostly higher in <b>non-fouled</b> snails, but showed no asynchrony in the spawning period for either fouled or <b>non-fouled</b> gastropods hosts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Batillaria zonalis is {{a common}} snail on Hong Kong sandy shores, occupying the low-mid shore. Shells of B. zonalis (basibiont) are often fouled with the rock oyster Saccostrea cucullata and the {{barnacle}} Balanus reticulatus (epibiont). This epibiotic interaction has {{a negative impact on}} the fitness of B. zonalis in terms of impairing fecundity, mobility and metabolism of fouled individuals. During the reproductive season, fouled snails had lower Gonadosomatic Index and fewer egg-bearing individuals than <b>non-fouled</b> snails. Fouled snails crawled in a more tortuous pathway and with lower speed when compared with <b>non-fouled</b> snails. Reduction in oxygen consumption and metabolic rate in fouled snails further suggested the restriction in mobility of B. zonalis by the epibionts. Glycogen content in the foot muscle tissues and hepatopancreas of fouled and <b>non-fouled</b> snails was, however, similar, revealing epibiosis does not influence the energy storage of B. zonalis. Mortality of fouled and <b>non-fouled</b> snails was similar under laboratory conditions, suggesting epibiosis does not influence the survivorship of B. zonalis in Hong Kong. Impairment in the fitness of fouled B. zonalis indicates that epibiosis can influence the population dynamics of B. zonalis in Hong Kong...|$|R

This progressive increase was simulated by a mathematical calculation based on an Ulva thallus diffuse reflectance weighted by a transmittance power series. Experimental and simulated reflectance differences that were particularly high in the NIR most likely resulted from residual water and layering structure unevenness in the experimental progression.

50|$|The {{anti-microbial}} {{properties of}} metal surfaces are of high interest to water sanitation. The metals produce an oligodynamic effect due to oxide formation and subsequent ion formation, making them biocidically active. This prevents contaminants from {{adhering to the}} surface. Coliform bacteria and E.coli content on metal surfaces {{have been shown to}} substantially decrease with time, indicating the ability of these surfaces to prevent biofouling and thus promote sanitation. Of these metal surfaces, copper and zinc {{have been found to be}} most effective.Polyurethane, polyethylene glycol, and other polymers have been shown to reduce external bacterial adhesion, which elicits applications of anti-microbial substances to the polymer and coatings industry. Sustainable alternatives like topographically modified cellulose are also of high interest due to recyclability and low cost. Surfaces that are superhydrophobic are desirable for <b>non-fouling</b> behavior because an affinity for water correlates to an affinity for contaminants. Superhydrophobic xerogels made from silica colloids have been shown to reduce bacterial adhesion, specifically S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The <b>non-fouling</b> applications of these polymers and superhydrophobic coatings is of substantial importance to the field of medical devices.|$|E
50|$|Fouling {{also known}} as mis-setting is when an illegal hand is made and as a result, the hand is forfeited. The back hand must be {{stronger}} {{than or equal to}} the middle and the front, the middle must be stronger or equal to the front, otherwise, the hand is not legal and is considered fouled. In this case the player who fouled loses six points (one point per line plus three point scoop bonus) per <b>non-fouling</b> player and each <b>non-fouling</b> player gains six points. Players who fouled can lose additional units if players with legal hands achieved royalties. Opponents with legal hands gains six points plus any royalties in their hands, but not the royalties in fouled hands. When a hand is fouled the fouling players loses all royalties in their hands as well. If more than one player foul, then the players who foul tie other players who foul and no points are gained or lost between players with fouled hands. Unlike standard Chinese poker, players do not receive all thirteen cards at once. Therefore, fouling plays a large factor, and strategies are devised to avoid it.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{recent changes}} in the distribution and abundance of a fouling organism affected the strength of interactions between a commercially important foundation species and a common predator. Increases in the abundance of boring sponges that bioerode the calcified shells of oysters and other shelled organisms {{have been attributed to}} increased salinization of estuarine ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that fouling by boring sponges will change the interaction strength between oysters and a common predator (stone crabs). We generated five oyster density treatments crossed with two sponge treatments (sponge and no sponge). We contrasted the interaction strength between stone crabs and fouled and <b>non-fouled</b> oysters by comparing the parameters of fitted functional response curves based on Rogers random predation model. We found that fouled oysters suffered higher predation from stone crabs, and that the increased predation risk stemmed from a reduction in the handling time needed to consume the fouled oysters. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the effects of abiotic changes on both the composition of ecological communities, and on the strengths of direct and indirect interactions among species. Global climate change is altering local ecosystems in complex ways, and the success of restoration, management, and mitigation strategies for important species requires a better appreciation for how these effects cascade through ecosystems...|$|R

Also discussed are the influence of HTC heating methods and temperature on HBW processing conversion into solid fuel char, i. e. yield and post-HTC management, i. e. dewaterability rates, particle size distribution and the carbon and energy properties of solid fuel char.

This includes an indication about the potential risk of a sewage system overflow, the expected volume of inflow at treatment plants and thus about the sys-tem´s suitability for the future. Numerical, hydrological compartment models for 19 cities in Sweden were set-up. The used parameters were obtained from previous studies by the Swedish Environ-mental Protection Agency. In these models present and future climate data were ap-plied. For future scenarios three different climate change projections were used which contain bias corrected climate data timeseries for each study area. The climate change scenarios were supposed to represent an "optimistic", "average" and "pessimistic" outlook. By assessing the outputs of the climate models, it was concluded that signifi-cant differences can occur, depending on exact geographical location and chosen cli-mate models. A sensitivity analysis was conducted of how geology, climate and status of the pipe system have an impact on the extent of additional water flows.

40|$|Introduction: Mycobacterial {{species are}} unusual causes {{of skin and}} soft tissue infections and can be {{difficult}} to diagnose in the absence of consideration as they often require specific culture media and longer incubation times. We report a Mycobacterium fortuitum subcutaneous abscess in a diabetic related to medication injection that was initially diagnosed without specialized media or prolonged incubation times. Case Report: A 48 year old diabetic female developed a progressive subcutaneous swelling in the tissues of the right lower abdominal wall where she had been injecting liraglutide. Because of continued enlargement 2 ̆ 2 to almost egg size 2 ̆ 2 with pain, she was empirically treated with cephalexin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole without effect. Subsequently, a formal I 2 ̆ 6 D was performed producing <b>non-foul</b> smelling purulence. The Gram stain showed many WBCs without any organisms seen and the culture revealed a Gram positive rod subsequently identified as M. fortuitum by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. She was referred to out-patient Infectious Diseases clinic. when seen, neither before or after drainage had she complained of any fever, chills sweats, unintentional weight loss or other constitutional symptoms. On examination, there was a 2 mm opening without drainage at the inferior-lateral aspect of the otherwise healed I 2 ̆ 6 D incision. The patient was prescribed oral SXT and clarithromycin to be continued for 6 months. On therapy, the incision completely healed and two months following the end of the therapy, she was totally asymptomatic. Conclusion: M. fortuitum is one of the species of mycobacteria that grows rapidly upon culture and can be found during the time that a routine bacterial culture is incubated growing on standard culture media. These organisms are more often identified when the clinician suspects a more unusual etiology of infection because of poor response to standard antimicrobial therapy. In this case, the microbiology laboratory was able to isolate the pathogen without requiring specialized media leading to more rapid and curative therapy...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} effect of game-related match events on the {{variation}} in injury incidence in top-level male football. Specifically, the primary aims were to investigate: (1) a possible relationship between injury incidence and changes in the (goal) score, playing position and recovery time, (2) differences between foul play injuries and <b>non-foul</b> play injuries with regard to the match circumstances in which they occur, (3) the relationship between the number of fouls and injuries per match, as well as (4) a possible relationship between injury incidence and goals, injuries, as well as red and yellow cards. In addition, a secondary aim was to use video analysis of contact injuries to describe match circumstances in which contact injuries occur and to investigate possible independent predictors of contact injuries. The material consisted of team physicians’ post-match injury reports on 441 injuries (from men’s FIFA World Cups in 2002, 2006 and 2010), FIFA’s official match statistics from all matches and full video recordings of all matches. Data on the type and location, the time and the circumstances and consequences of injury were collected prospectively. From the match statistics, the time (minute) and number of goals, as well as red and yellow cards, were obtained, in order to calculate and compare the injury incidences during different match periods. Moreover, the total number of fouls per match was obtained in order to evaluate the association between the number of injuries and fouls. The full video recordings were reviewed and all identified contact injuries and contact injury risk incidents were analysed according to variables describing the match circumstances at the moment of injury. These studies showed that the variation in injury incidence during a match was related to both changes in the score (p= 0. 026) and teams’ drawing/losing/winning status (p= 0. 008), with players in winning teams running the highest risk of injury. There were also statistically significant differences in injury incidence between playing positions (p< 0. 001), with forwards having the highest injury incidence. A significant association between an increasing number of recovery days between matches and an increasing injury incidence was also found (p= 0. 043). Other findings were that the injury incidence increased within the five minutes following a goal, injury, or a red or yellow card (p< 0. 001) and that there was a correlation between the number of injuries and fouls in a match (p< 0. 001). The thesis also highlights some concerns relating to the widely applied video analysis methods. In conclusion, these studies show that the injury incidence during a match in international football tournaments is affected to some degree by match events that are an essential part of football. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that match statistics can be used succesfully in combination with injury report data in epidemiological research on football injuries...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogels, {{which are}} {{polymeric}} cross-linked networks that swell in aqueous environments, are versatile materials that can contain {{a variety of}} chemical functionalities, mechanical properties, and topographical features. Microgels are the stable colloidal form of hydrogel materials that {{range in size from}} approximately 100 nm to a few microns in diameter. While they also can exhibit similar properties to those of macrogels, microgels can be used as building blocks in a bottom-up approach to assemble films of higher complexity. In this dissertation, work is focused on understanding the assembly and behavior of microgel thin films as <b>non-fouling</b> surfaces, centrifugally deposited materials, self-healing coatings, and degradable constructs. <b>Non-fouling</b> films were assembled using PEG cross-linked microgels to reduce non-specific protein adsorption and mitigate cellular adhesion. These constructs were assembled in a polyelectrolyte multi-layered fashion, of alternating anionic microgels and cationic linear polymer, to effectively block the substrate from the biological environment and consequently exhibited control over cellular adhesion with the surface. The utility and application of these <b>non-fouling</b> microgel coatings on functional implants was also explored. Centrifugal deposition was used to rapidly generate <b>non-fouling</b> microgel multi-layered interfaces on planar surfaces, and upon closer inspection of the microgel monolayers, {{it was found that the}} centrifugally deposited films contained closer-packed microgel assemblies with microgels of smaller footprint size, compared to microgels that are passively adsorbed to the surface. Microgels that are centrifugally deposited may adopt a higher energy chain conformation than passively adsorbed microgels, and this higher energy chain conformation may translate into the multi-layered materials. Nonetheless, the centrifugally deposited <b>non-fouling</b> microgel multi-layered films were found to effectively block macrophage adhesion. Films were also assembled in a polyelectrolyte fashion on soft substrates, and were observed to become significantly damaged under mechanical manipulation (poking, bending, or stretching), but then self-heal upon addition of water. By altering the building blocks of the polyelectrolyte multi-layered films, such as the molecular weight of the polycation between microgel layers or by using anionic rigid spheres as the particle in the assembly, changes in the observed film damage suggest that particle-linear polymer interpenetration and polyvalency likely play an important role in the strength and integrity of the microgel thin films. Fluorescently-labeled microgels were also used to interrogate how the films reorganize in the lateral direction, and these early studies suggest that the microgel multi-layered films reorganize when damaged and also possibly when they are undamaged and simply incubated in an aqueous environment. Additional studies were also conducted on microgels synthesized with a hydrolyzable cross-linker, and by supporting these degradable constructs on substrates, detailed single-particle morphological changes during erosion could be interrogated in complex media such as serum. This work, as a collection, demonstrates the ability to obtain information about microgel thin film assemblies and their behavior using microscopy techniques such as ambient and in liquid atomic force microscopy, brightfield optical microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. The observations made here illustrate how microgels can be used to fabrication thin films that can be utilized in biological applications (<b>non-fouling,</b> self-healing, and erodable constructs), and how different deposition methods (centrifugal deposition and polyelectrolyte multi-layers) can dictate their behavior.

The practical application of these surface-based technologies has been hampered by protein fouling from biological media, in particular blood plasma, where {{the vast majority of}} relevant analytes are present. The work of the thesis was centred in three main foci:  Design and preparation of antifouling and <b>non-fouling</b> surfaces  Evaluation and conceptualisation of their resistance to fouling from blood plasma and serum as well as other biological fluids  Preparation of sensitive layers for detection in complex biological media Three approaches were used to prepare protein resistance surfaces, i) ω-functional self-assembled monolayers (SAM), ii) end-tethered polymers and iii) polymer brushes prepared by surface initiated controlled radical polymerisation. Investigation of proteins in the blood plasma deposits on PEG- based surfaces revealed that some fouling is unavoidable in PEG-based surface modifications. A novel type of <b>non-fouling</b> polymer brushes based on poly[N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] challenged the accepted ideas for the design of protein resistant surfaces. For the first time a [...] ...|$|E
