500|$|Burhop {{returned}} to Australia in 1936, taking up {{a position as}} a lecturer at the University of Melbourne, where Laby was eager {{to build up the}} Physics Department by adding expertise in the latest developments in nuclear physics. He married his fiancée, Winifred Ida Stevens, on 23 December 1936 in a Salvation Army ceremony. They had a daughter and two sons. He completed his Cambridge doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree under Laby's supervision in 1938. It was in three parts: [...] "The ionization and reorganization of an atom in an inner shell, with special reference to the Dirac theory of the electron"; [...] "Some problems in atomic disintegration"; and [...] "Note on the migration of atoms on a surface". Burhop established the first research program in the field in an Australian university, employing scientific equipment that he brought back from Britain. The centrepiece of the research effort was a 300 keV accelerator that produced a homogeneous <b>neutron</b> <b>beam,</b> which he commissioned in August 1939. He gave lectures on modern physics to the undergraduates, and on quantum mechanics to the postgraduates.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, Havens entered Columbia University, {{where he}} studied physics, taking classes on {{mechanics}} with George B. Pegram, atomic physics with Isidor Isaac Rabi and electromagnetism with Shirley L. Quimby. He was awarded his Master of Arts degree in 1941. He then began working on his doctorate {{under the supervision of}} John R. Dunning. Fellow graduate students in physics at the time included James Rainwater, Herbert L. Anderson and George Weil. He worked with Rainwater on the construction of a neutron spectrometer. His thesis, on [...] "Slow neutron cross sections of indium, gold, silver, antimony, lithium and mercury as measured with a <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> spectrometer", was classified.|$|E
2500|$|The NRU {{opened in}} 1957. On November 3, 1957 the NRU (National Research Universal Reactor) first went critical. This was a natural-uranium fuelled, heavy-water moderated and cooled {{research}} reactor (converted to high-enriched-uranium fuel in the 1960s, {{and finally to}} low-enriched-uranium fuel in the 1990s). [...] The NRU is a world-renowned research facility, producing about 60% of the world's supply of molybdenum-99, the principle isotope used for nuclear medical diagnosis. Canada also pioneered use of cobalt-60 for medical diagnosis in 1951 and currently the NRU reactor produces the medical-use cobalt-60, while selected CANDU reactors produce industrial-use cobalt-60, comprising 85% of the world's supply. NRU was primarily a Canadian design, and a significant improvement on NRX. [...] Other than radioisotope production, the NRU provides irradiation services for nuclear materials and fuels testing, as well as producing neutron beams for the National Research Council's Canadian <b>Neutron</b> <b>Beam</b> Laboratory.|$|E

500|$|Without an {{electric}} charge, <b>neutron</b> <b>beams</b> cannot {{be controlled by}} the conventional electromagnetic methods employed for particle accelerators. The magnetic moment of the neutron allows some control of neutrons using magnetic fields, however, including the formation of polarized <b>neutron</b> <b>beams.</b> [...] One technique employs the fact that cold neutrons will reflect from some magnetic materials at great efficiency when scattered at small grazing angles. [...] The reflection preferentially selects particular spin states, thus polarizing the neutrons.
