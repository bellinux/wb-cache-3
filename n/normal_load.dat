25|$|Air Ministry {{specification}} B.7/40 {{called for}} a medium bomber to replace the Blenheim. The specification stipulated a speed of at least 300mph at 5,000ft, a <b>normal</b> <b>load</b> of 1,000lb of bombs and a centre turret armed {{with at least two}} 0.5 inch (12.7mm) machine guns. Only one manufacturer (Armstrong Whitworth) tendered a full design but it did not meet with approval. So when Bristol brought their Type 162 ("tentatively named Beaumont"), which was fortunately well matched to B.7/40, to the Air Staff, this led to a request to complete a mockup in 1940 and then a confirmed contract for three prototypes in February 1941. The Beaumont was based on the rear fuselage and tail of a Beaufighter, with a new centre and front fuselage. The armament was a mid-upper turret with four machine guns, four more machine guns firing forward and two firing to the rear.|$|E
25|$|Six Re.2000 Cat.s {{were still}} {{available}} {{at the time of the}} Armistice and four were in service aboard the battleships Italia (Littorio before the fall of Mussolini), Roma and Vittorio Veneto (the <b>normal</b> <b>load</b> was only one, the battleship had up to three aircraft, but smaller than the Re.2000). The two left at La Spezia were demolished after September 1943 (they served with 1a Squadriglia). During the Romas sinking (9 September 1943) only one was launched, as they were a single mission aircraft (forced to reach a land airfield); therefore, Do 217s attacked facing only anti-aircraft guns. The fate of the four Re.2000s was as follows: the one on Roma was lost with the battleship; the one of Italia was damaged and jettisoned from the ship, after the Fritz-X impact. One Re.2000 was launched from Vittorio Veneto to catch the intruders, but failed and finally crashed while landing near Ajaccio airfield. The last one survived and it is still extant, being the only Re.2000 remaining in Italy (another is in Sweden). This is the MM.8287.|$|E
25|$|Around the 8th century BC, ramming {{began to}} be {{employed}} as war galleys were equipped with heavy bronze rams. Records of the Persian Wars in the early 5th century BC by the Ancient historian Herodotus (c. 484-25 BC) show that by this time ramming tactics had evolved among the Greeks. The formations adapted for ramming warfare could either be in columns in line ahead, one ship following the next, or in a line abreast, with the ships side by side, depending on the tactical situation and the surrounding geography. The primary methods for attack was either {{to break through the}} enemy formation or to outflank it. Ramming itself was done by smashing into the rear or side of an enemy ship, punching a hole in the planking. This did not actually sink an ancient galley unless it was heavily laden with cargo and stores. With a <b>normal</b> <b>load,</b> it was buoyant enough to float even with a breached hull. Breaking the enemy's oars was another way of rendering ships immobile, rendering them easier targets. If ramming was not possible or successful, the on-board complement of soldiers would attempt to board and capture the enemy vessel by securing it with grappling irons, accompanied by missile fire with arrows or javelins. Trying to set the enemy ship on fire by hurling incendiary missiles or by pouring the content of fire pots attached to long handles is thought to have been used, especially since smoke below decks would easily disable rowers. Rhodes was the first naval power to employ this weapon, sometime in the 3rd century, and used it to fight off head-on attacks or to frighten enemies into exposing their sides for a ramming attack.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{technique}} was developed using conventional {{finite element analysis}} to determine stress intensity factors, K 1 and K 2, for interface cracks under mixed-mode loading. This technique involves the calculation of crack tip stresses using non-singular finite elements. These stresses are then combined and used in a linear regression procedure to calculate K 1 and K 2. The {{technique was}} demonstrated by calculating three different bimaterial combinations. For the <b>normal</b> <b>loading</b> case, the K's were within 2. 6 percent of an exact solution.

40|$|International audienceThe shear {{resistance}} of glass beads with wetting liquidincorporated (polyethylene glycol of molecular weight of 400 g/mol) is experimentally and theoretically investigated {{in a large}} range of both liquid content (from 0. 007 % to 20 % in volume) and <b>normal</b> <b>loading,</b> in a steady-state flowing situation. It is observed that the behaviour is not purely frictional (shear stress proportional to the normal stress) except for the lowest liquid content (up to 0. 1 %) {{for which it is}} observed that the friction coefficient of wet granular material is slightly higher than the dry material. At high <b>normal</b> <b>loading,</b> an apparent cohesion is observed and the behaviour may be interpreted as frictional, with the same friction coefficient plus an additional normal stress due to the capillary forces between the beads. At low <b>normal</b> <b>loading,</b> the apparent cohesion is less and may be qualitatively explained by the diminution of broken capillary contacts during shearing when the porosity of the granular bed increases. This result is corroborated by a theoretical approach estimating the capillary forces in play. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
