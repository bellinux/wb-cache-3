5|$|With the {{construction}} of modern MD151, MD20 was split into several disjoint segments of <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Road: one from near Fort Howard to MD151 in Edgemere, another along the northbound side of MD151 from Edgemere to <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Village, a third on the southbound side of MD151 from <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Village to the MD150MD151 interchange, and a fourth between MD151 and US40 in Baltimore. The Baltimore City segment {{was removed from the}} state highway system in 1956. The portion of MD20 from near Fort Howard to MD718 in Edgemere was transferred to county maintenance in 1987. The remaining portions of MD20 and MD718 were removed from the state highway system around 1999.|$|E
5|$|Cape Moreton Light, also {{listed as}} <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Range Rear Light, is an heritage-listed active {{lighthouse}} located on Cape Moreton, a rocky headland {{located at the}} north eastern tip of Moreton Island, a large sand island {{on the eastern side}} of Moreton Bay, on the coast of South East Queensland, Australia. It marks the northern entrance to Moreton Bay and Brisbane and also serves as the rear light for the <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Range. With its two distinctive red bands, it also serves as a daymark. It is the oldest lighthouse in Queensland, and the only one to be built by the New South Wales Government before the separation of Queensland, which took place in 1859. It is also the only lighthouse in Queensland to be built of stone.|$|E

5|$|MD151 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with 7th Street within the former Bethlehem Steel complex, {{which is now}} owned by Severstal. Sparrows Point Boulevard continues south to a gate south of F Street. MD151 heads northeast as a four-lane divided highway. The state highway leaves the steel complex by crossing over the Patapsco & Back Rivers Railroad and Wharf Road, also identified as MD151B, with which MD151 has a modified trumpet interchange. At Sparrows Point Road, MD151's name changes to <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Boulevard and the highway curves north to bypass Edgemere. The state highway intersects MD158 (Bethlehem Boulevard); to the east MD158 provides access to <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Road, which heads south through Edgemere toward <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> State Park and Fort Howard. Just north of MD158, MD151 has a partial interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway), which includes a ramp from MD151 to northbound I-695 and a loop ramp from southbound I-695 to MD151. The movements {{to and from the}} Francis Scott Key Bridge to the south are made via MD158 to the west.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1814, three {{companies}} of the Colonial Marines joined with three remaining companies of Royal Marines {{to form the}} 3rd Battalion, Royal and Colonial Marines. Later that month, all {{three companies}} fought at the Battle of <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> in Maryland. A fourth company was created in December 1814, and further recruitment was begun along the Georgia coast {{during the first quarter}} of 1815. The number of enlistments allowed two more companies to be raised, with sergeants taken from companies recruited in the Chesapeake.|$|E

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in <b>North</b> <b>Point.</b> Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

5|$|At {{the northeastern}} terminus, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend {{southeast}} along the Back River Neck peninsula and turn south {{to cross the}} river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast Freeway (designated MD 702) by 1975. However, the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned {{to be part of}} it. The first was the Windlass Freeway (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco Freeway, a short connector from the Windlass Freeway southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Only the segment of the Windlass Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 (<b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The <b>north</b> <b>point</b> of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E
5|$|MD151 {{enters the}} city of Baltimore just west of its {{intersection}} with Rolling Mill Road and Kane Street. The state highway passes under I-95, a Norfolk Southern Railway railyard, and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. At <b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Road, MD151's name changes to Erdman Avenue and the highway veers west to pass under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The state highway veers northwest at its crossing of I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) just before the highway's cloverleaf interchange with US40 (Pulaski Highway), which also includes a ramp from southbound MD151 to southbound I-895. Connections between eastbound US40 and northbound MD151 are made via Mapleton Avenue just east of I-895. MD151 continues northwest concurrent with US40Truck as a six-lane boulevard between the Armistead Gardens neighborhood {{to the east and}} industrial facilities on the west. The state highway passes by Archbishop Curley High School and through the Belair-Edison neighborhood before reaching its northern terminus at US1 (Belair Road), onto which US40Truck turns west. Erdman Avenue continues northwest as a two-lane street along the eastern edge of Clifton Park to MD147 (Harford Road).|$|E
5|$|Running {{south along}} the Windlass Freeway, {{parallel}} to the Northeast Corridor, I-695, now narrowed to four lanes, turns west before making a sharp turn to the south, crossing over the railroad line twice. The road becomes the Patapsco Freeway and continues south to an interchange with MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) and MD 157 (Merritt Boulevard) near the Eastpoint Mall. A short distance later, I-695 comes to an interchange with MD 151 (<b>North</b> <b>Point</b> Boulevard). From here, the route continues southeast along the Back River into residential and industrial Dundalk, interchanging with Cove Road. The route turns south, with the median briefly widening to include trees, before coming to another interchange with MD 151. Past MD 151, the Baltimore Beltway continues southwest through industrial areas, with maintenance switching to the Maryland Transportation Authority at the crossing of a CSX rail line. It comes to an interchange with MD 157 (Peninsula Expressway) and MD 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard) before heading west. The route runs past the Sparrows Point Industrial Complex before crossing over Bear Creek and interchanging with unsigned MD 695A (Broening Highway) south of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance.|$|E
