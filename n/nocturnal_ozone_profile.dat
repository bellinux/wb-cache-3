40|$|We {{present a}} method to derive the site {{atmospheric}} state best estimate (SASBE) of the <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> combining brightness temperature spectra around the 142 GHz absorption line of ozone measured by the microwave radiometer SOMORA and <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> measured by the radiosonde (RS). The SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> is obtained using the radiosonde <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> as a priori information in an optimal estimation retrieval of the SOMORA radiometer. The resulting <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> ranges from ground up to 65 km altitude and makes optimal use of the available information at each altitude. The high vertical resolution of the radiosonde profile can be conserved and {{the uncertainty of the}} SASBE is well defined at each altitude. A SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> dataset has been generated for Payerne, Switzerland, with a temporal resolution of 3 profiles a week for the time period ranging from 2011 to 2013. The relative difference of the SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> to the AURA/MLS <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> lies between − 3 to 6 % over the vertical range of 20 – 65 km. Above 20 km, the agreement between the SASBE and AURA/MLS <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> is better than the agreement between the operational SOMORA ozone data set and AURA/MLS. Below 20 km the SASBE ozone data are identical to the radiosonde measurements. The same method has been applied to ECWMF-ERA interim <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> and SOMORA data to generate a SASBE dataset with a time resolution of 4 profiles per day. These SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> agree between − 4 and + 8 % with AURA/MLS.

40|$|Climatological <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> {{data are}} widely used as a-priori {{information}} for total ozone using DOAS type retrievals {{as well as for}} <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval using optimal estimation, for data assimilation or evaluation of 3 -D chemistry-transport models {{and a lot of other}} applications in atmospheric sciences and remote sensing. For most applications it is important that the climatology represents not only long term mean values but also the links between ozone and dynamic input parameters. These dynamic input parameters should be easily accessible from auxiliary datasets or easily measureable, and obviously should have a high correlation with <b>ozone.</b> For <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> these parameters are mainly total ozone column and temperature profile data. This was the outcome of a user consultation carried out in the framework of developing a new, dynamic <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology. The new <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology is based on the Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) widely used for <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval from UV and IR satellite sounder data. NNORSY allows implicit modelling of any non-linear correspondence between input parameters (predictors) and <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> target vector. This paper presents the approach, setup and validation of a new family of <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatologies with static as well as dynamic input parameters (total <b>ozone</b> and temperature <b>profile).</b> The neural network training relies on <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> measurement data of well known quality provided by ground based (ozonesondes) and satellite based (SAGE II, HALOE, and POAM-III) measurements over the years 1995 – 2007.

The geophysical validation spans from pole to pole using independent ozonesonde, lidar and satellite data (ACE-FTS, AURA-MLS) for individual and time series comparisons as well as for analysing the vertical and meridian structure of different modes of the NNORSY <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology.

In this study, characteristics of tropospheric ozone over the South African Highveld are investigated using the ozonesonde data collected at Irene weather station (25. 9 °S, 28. 2 °E, and 1523 m asl) for the period 1990 to 1993 and 1999 to 2003. It was found that synoptic systems have an effect on the vertical distribution of tropospheric ozone. Ozone stratification appeared during anticyclonic conditions as displayed by a continental high <b>ozone</b> <b>profile.</b> During the ridging high, low ozone concentrations are observed with a strong ozone gradient between 10 and 12 km.

Umkehr <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> (quarter of Umkehr layer) from 1978 to 2011 are investigated at two locations: Boulder (USA) and Arosa (Switzerland). The study consists of two statistical stages. First we approximate <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> employing an appropriate basis. To capture primary modes of ozone variations without losing essential information, a functional principal component analysis is performed. It penalizes roughness of the function and smooths excessive variations {{in the shape of the}} <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> As a result, data-driven basis functions (empirical basis functions) are obtained. The coefficients (principal component scores) corresponding to the empirical basis functions represent dominant temporal evolution in the shape of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> We use those time series coefficients in the second statistical step to reveal the important sources of the patterns and variations in the profiles. We estimate the effects of covariates – month, year (trend), quasi-biennial oscillation, the solar cycle, the Arctic oscillation, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycle and the Eliassen–Palm flux – on the principal component scores of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> using additive mixed effects models. The effects are represented as smooth functions and the smooth functions are estimated by penalized regression splines. We also impose a heteroscedastic error structure that reflects the observed seasonality in the errors. The more complex error structure enables us to provide more accurate estimates of influences and trends, together with enhanced uncertainty quantification. Also, we are able to capture fine variations in the time evolution of the profiles, such as the semi-annual oscillation. We conclude by showing the trends by altitude over Boulder and Arosa, as well as for total column ozone.

Selection of an <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology which is used as a priori information has small effects on the retrievals at all altitudes. However, the usage of climatological a priori covariance matrix has a significant effect. Based on these sensitivity tests, we made several modifications to the OMO 3 PR algorithm: the a priori ozone climatology was replaced with a new climatology (TpO 3), the a priori covariance matrix was calculated from the climatological ozone variance values, and the surface albedo was assumed to be linearly dependent on wavelength in the UV 2 channel. We found that the a priori covariance matrix basically defines the vertical distribution of degrees of freedom for a retrieval. Moreover, all the studied versions of the OMO 3 PR algorithm were equally effective in reducing uncertainty in the retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profile.</b> This implies that the posterior error values depend mostly on the assumed a priori errors. Our case study over Europe showed that the new version produced over 10 % smaller ozone abundances which reduced the systematic overestimation of ozone in the OMO 3 PR algorithm and improved correspondence with IASI retrievals.

We also evaluate {{the effects of}} OMI row anomaly (RA) on the retrieval by dividing the data set into {{before and after the}} occurrence of serious RA, i. e., pre-RA (2004 – 2008) and post-RA (2009 – 2014). During the pre-RA period, OMI <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> agree very well with MLS data. After applying OMI averaging kernels to MLS data, the global mean biases (MBs) are within 3...|$|R
40|$|Morning and {{afternoon}} mesospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> (50 - 90 km) {{measured by the}} Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) satellite are analyzed with one-dimensional photochemical models. The observed ozone abundances are 40 percent and 100 percent greater than the model ozone abundances at 50 and 80 km, respectively. Diurnal model calculations are compared with SME observations of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> at about 0400 and 1400 LT for high northern summer latitudes. Analysis of the ratios of these early morning and midafternoon <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> provides the additional constraint that larger odd-oxygen production rates are required if lower odd-hydrogen activity is invoked to increase model O 3 abundances. The increase in odd-oxygen production must be solar zenith angle independent in the mesosphere, ruling out {{significant changes in the}} Schumann-Runge band O 2 opacities from Allen and Frederrick (1982) ...|$|R

New <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> retrieved from measurement of MIPAS in RR-mode (IPF v 5. 00) were analyzed and they show good agreement with lidar data, especially some high vertical structures in the data are well represented. GOMOS <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> (IPF v 5. 00), measured {{in the second half of}} 2006 and operationally processed by ESA, are in very good agreement with lidar data, which is in line with previous results [1].

40|$|Data {{from the}} Nimbus- 4, Nimbus- 7 Solar Backscatter Ultra Violet (SBUV) and {{seven of the}} NOAA series of SBUV/ 2 {{instruments}} spanning 41 years are being reprocessed using V 8. 6 algorithm. The data {{are scheduled to be}} released by the end of August 2011. An important focus of the new algorithm is to estimate various sources of errors in the SBUV <b>profiles</b> and total <b>ozone</b> retrievals. We discuss here the smoothing errors that describe the components of the profile variability that the SBUV observing system can not measure. The SBUV(/ 2) instruments have a vertical resolution of 5 km in the middle stratosphere, decreasing to 8 to 10 km below the ozone peak and above 0. 5 hPa. To estimate the smoothing effect of the SBUV algorithm, the actual statistics of the fine vertical structure of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> must be known. The covariance matrix of the ensemble of measured <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> with the high vertical resolution would be a formal representation of the actual ozone variability. We merged the MLS (version 3) and sonde <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> to calculate the covariance matrix, which in general case, for single profile retrieval, might be a function of the latitude and month. Using the averaging kernels of the SBUV(/ 2) measurements and calculated total covariance matrix one can estimate the smoothing errors for the SBUV <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> A method to estimate the smoothing effect of the SBUV algorithm is described and the covariance matrixes and averaging kernels are provided along with the SBUV(/ 2) <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> The magnitude of the smoothing error varies with altitude, latitude, season and solar zenith angle. The analysis of the smoothing errors, based on the SBUV(/ 2) monthly zonal mean time series, shows that the largest smoothing errors were detected in the troposphere and might be as large as 15 - 20 % and rapidly decrease with the altitude. In the stratosphere above 40 hPa the smoothing errors are less than 5 % and between 10 and 1 hPa the smoothing errors are on the order of 1 %. We validate our estimated smoothing errors by comparing the SBUV <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> with other <b>ozone</b> <b>profiling</b> sensors...|$|R
