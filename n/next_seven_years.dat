Theodore was defeated and captured at the Battle of Klokotnitsa, and spent the <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> in captivity. In the meantime, he was succeeded by his brother Manuel. Manuel quickly lost Thrace, most of Macedonia, and Albania to the Bulgarian Tsar John II Asen.

5|$|Bellevue's {{history of}} skyscrapers {{began with the}} {{completion}} of the Paccar Tower in 1970; this structure is regarded as the city's first high-rise. High-rise building construction remained slow until 1982, when the city's first skyscraper building boom took shape. Eight of the city's 24 tallest buildings were completed within the <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> including City Center Bellevue, which was the tallest building in Bellevue for almost two decades. The skyscraper construction boom ended in 1989, and subsequently only one high-rise which ranked among the city's tallest structures was completed in the 1990s. Beginning in 2000, Bellevue entered into a second, much larger building boom that continued to 2010. More than half of Bellevue's twenty tallest buildings were completed after 2000; nine projects were completed in 2008 alone, including Bellevue Towers. Overall, Bellevue's skyline is ranked third in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, after Seattle and Portland.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> 1870–1877, {{only two}} {{works of the}} painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873, one of them being the {{beautiful}} Love among the Ruins, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed {{it to be an}} oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a number of large pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first Briar Rose series, Laus Veneris, the Golden Stairs, the Pygmalion series, and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years. These years also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works in the coming decades.|$|E

5|$|Smith became Deputy Prime Minister {{following}} the Rhodesian Front's December 1962 election victory, and {{stepped up to}} the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964. With the UK government refusing to grant independence while Rhodesia did not devise a set timetable for the introduction of majority rule, talks with the UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson repeatedly broke down, leading Smith and his Cabinet to declare independence on 11 November 1965. His government endured in the face of United Nations economic sanctions with the assistance of South Africa and, until 1974, Portugal. Talks with the UK in 1966, 1968 and 1971 came to nothing. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 and led the RF to three more decisive election victories over the <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years.</b> After the Bush War began in earnest in 1972, he negotiated with the non-militant nationalist leader Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the rival guerrilla movements headed by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} developed {{following the}} Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, {{in which the}} Russian Navy agreed {{to withdraw from the}} Adriatic. For the <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> the Royal Navy sought to disrupt French and Italian military and commercial sea traffic, as well as the movement of troops and supplies to the Illyrian Provinces. Command of the Adriatic partially rested on control of the Ionian Islands, which lie outside the Straits of Otranto but could be used to blockade the passage if properly garrisoned. To this end, the French heavily fortified the island of Corfu, but were unable to consistently maintain an effective naval squadron to dispute British operations in the Adriatic. Exploiting French weakness at sea, British cruisers were able to defeat successive French squadrons sent to reinforce the region and exerted total dominance in the Adriatic and Ionian seas.|$|E
