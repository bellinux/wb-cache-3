In 1984 they presented a table of 23 earthquakes from 19 January 1983 to 19 September 1983, of which they claimed to have successfully predicted 18 earthquakes. Other lists followed, such as their 1991 claim of predicting six out of seven earthquakes with [...] ≥ 5.5 {{in the period of}} 1 April 1987 through 10 August 1989, or five out of seven earthquakes with [...] ≥ 5.3 in the overlapping period of 15 May 1988 to 10 August 1989, In 1996 they published a [...] "Summary of all Predictions issued from January 1st, 1987 to June 15, 1995", amounting to 94 predictions.

These differ from the MS magnitudes reported by the USGS. and within geographical bounds including most of Greece they come up with a list of 14 earthquakes they should have predicted. Here they claim ten successes, for a success rate of 70%, but also a false alarm rate of 89%.|$|E
