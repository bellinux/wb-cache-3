40|$|With the {{increased}} number of childcare centres in Thailand, the role of <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> has become pivotal to promoting optimal child development. The importance of learning though play is generally not recognised as {{an important factor in}} promoting child growth by <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> in Thailand. This aim {{of this study was to}} enhance the knowledge and attitudes of Thai <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> towards play and the play environment by using a multimedia teaching package (MMTP). Based on a pragmatic paradigm using mixed methods approach, this study was broken down into two phases: 1) the design of the MMTP based on a content analysis of UK and Thai curricula for training Thai <b>nursery</b> <b>workers,</b> and 2) evaluating the effectiveness of the MMTP by comparing knowledge and attitudes among three sample groups of Thai <b>nursery</b> <b>workers.</b> Three sample groups consisted of a total of 226 Thai nursery workers: 1) those who received the MMTP training, 2) those who received no training and 3) those who only received official government training. Data collection was conducted over three periods: before training, immediately after training and four weeks after training. <b>Nursery</b> <b>workers</b> from the first group, who had received the MMTP training, were found to have a significant improvement in knowledge and attitudes towards the importance of play and the play environment immediately after training. The improvements increased even further after four weeks. On the other hand, there were no comparable changes in the other two groups (those who did not have any training or had only official government training). Five weeks after training, semi-structured interviews were carried out with eight participants from the first sample group. These provided insights into lessons learned from three main areas: 1) participating in the MMTP training, 2) applying the MMTP to work at childcare centres and 3) barriers that occurred as a result of using the MMTP. The findings indicated that the MMTP had a positive effect on the knowledge and attitudes of Thai <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> towards the importance of play and the play environment as a means to promote child development. It was concluded that using the MMTP training package to train all <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> in Thailand may improve knowledge and attitudes towards play and the play environment and would have the potential to enhance child development in the future...|$|R

Results: The clinical features were characteristic of unilateral acute idiopathic maculopathy. High-resolution optical coherence tomography demonstrated highly reflective subretinal material at the macula of one eye with disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction.

40|$|What {{does the}} term 'professional ' {{mean to the}} {{workforce}} in early years care and education? The need to ask such a question has been exacerbated by recent government policy development in children's services in England {{with the introduction of}} the status of Early Years Professional in 2006 (Osgood, 2006; Moss, 2006). This milestone provides an opportunity to reflect on the historical development of the workforce to influence the sector as it is today.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} {{the ways in which}} <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> are {{constructed}} through government discourse in England. This is done by offering a deconstruction of key policy texts. The discursive construction of ‘the nursery worker’ within government discourses has shifted over time but currently occupies a highly politicised position. It is argued that following a decade of unprecedented policy attention and reform, the cultivation and continued promotion of a discursive ‘crisis in childcare’, has laid the ground for Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) to be refashioned in particular ways. Policy claims to a perpetual ‘crisis in childcare’ are dismantled and explored in order to better understand how <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> have become fabricated through texts as more or less professional at particular political moments and to what effect. Attention is drawn to the recent introduction of ‘Early Years Professional Status’ and claims to evidence‐based policy formation are problematised.

The tasks and roles of practitioners also relate to children’s play and other activities, relationships with families, drawing children to the centre, communication between workers and children, telling nursery tales and poems, etc. <b>Nursery</b> <b>workers,</b> as well as kindergarten pedagogues believe that the most possible time should be left for playing. Nevertheless, there is some difference in approach that reflects the characteristics of the two age groups. While <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> give priority to teaching the children how to do everyday tasks and become self-reliant and autonomous, kindergarten pedagogues also emphasize passing on cultural values and preparation for school. Careworker to child ratios are 1 : 6 in groups of 12 in nurseries, and 1 : 11 in groups of 22 in kindergartens (see Table 1). The ratio is better for groups with special needs children.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{describe}} the nationwide occurrence of work related musculoskeletal injuries among all home care service workers in Sweden, {{and to identify}} relative risks and risk factors of the injuries. METHODS [...] The study was based on work related injuries reported to the Swedish occupational injury information system in 1990 - 1. The work related musculoskeletal injuries were divided into overexertion accidents and musculoskeletal diseases. The incidence of the injuries in female home care service workers was compared with those in <b>nursery</b> school <b>workers</b> and all other employed women in Sweden. RESULTS [...] In home care service workers, the annual incidence of injury from overexertion accidents and musculoskeletal diseases were 19. 2 and 15. 1 per 1000 workers, respectively, which was higher than those in <b>nursery</b> school <b>workers</b> and all employed women in Sweden. For five injury locations including the back, all the age standardised relative risks (SRR) of overexertion accidents exceeded 4. 0, {{and most of those}} for musculoskeletal diseases were 1. 5 or more in home care service workers compared with all other employed women in Sweden. Total duration of sick leave due to overexertion accidents was 7. 7 times, and musculoskeletal diseases 3. 5 times, longer than in <b>nursery</b> school <b>workers.</b> National loss due to sick leave resulting from only musculoskeletal injuries in home care service workers was about 8. 2 % of the total work related sick leave in all employed women in Sweden, although the number of home care service workers represented only some 5 % of this population. Lifting other people was most frequently reported as the main risk cause of overexertion accidents in both kinds of workers. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results support the hypothesis that home care service workers have higher annual injury incidence of musculoskeletal injuries than <b>nursery</b> school <b>workers</b> due to physically stressful tasks that are far less common in <b>nursery</b> school <b>workers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{agricultural}} industry {{has some of}} the highest incidence rates and numbers of occupational injuries and illnesses in the United States.

Yet, few occupational risk assessment studies have considered the reproductive health of female farmworkers.

We argue that although hard, draining work; <b>nursery</b> <b>workers</b> can also experience profound emotional connections with the children in their care. We then extend our analysis to argue that various kinds of boundary-work is undertaken in nursery space to both validate strong feelings (including love) between care workers and children, and maintain conceptual coherence over the emotional entitlements of parents and care workers in the context of emotional bonds between carers and children which blur sharp divisions between ‘kin’ and ‘non-kin’. Finally we mobilize these findings to challenge dominant theoretical conceptualisations of commoditised care as incapable of providing nourishing emotional bonds; as well as portrayals of day nurseries as a priori ‘non-nurturing’ spaces which circulate widely in the UK popular press...|$|R
