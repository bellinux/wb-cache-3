50|$|The Armée de l'Air {{also ordered}} a two-seat Mirage IIIB {{operational}} trainer, which first flew in October 1959. The fuselage was stretched about a meter (3 ft 3.5 in) and both cannon were removed {{to accommodate the}} second seat. The IIIB had no radar, and provision for the SEPR rocket was deleted, although it could carry external stores. The AdA ordered 63 Mirage IIIBs (including the prototype), including five Mirage IIIB-1 trials aircraft, ten Mirage IIIB-2(RV) inflight refueling trainers with dummy <b>nose</b> <b>probes,</b> used for training Mirage IVA bomber pilots, and 20 Mirage IIIBEs, with the engine and some other features of the multi-role Mirage IIIE. One Mirage IIIB was fitted with a {{fly-by-wire flight control system}} in the mid-1970s and redesignated Mirage IIIB-SV (Stabilité Variable), it was used as a testbed for the system in the later Mirage 2000.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the feasibility of establishing if a 'shaped' sonic boom signature, experimentally shown in wind tunnel models out to about 10 body lengths, will persist out to representative flight conditions of 200 to 300 body lengths. The study focuses {{on the use of}} a relatively large supersonic remotely-piloted and recoverable vehicle. Other simulation methods that may accomplish the objective are also addressed and include the use of nonrecoverable target drones, missiles, full-scale drones, very large wind tunnels, ballistic facilities, whirling-arm techniques, rocket sled tracks, and airplane <b>nose</b> <b>probes.</b> In addition, this report will also present a background on the origin of the feasibility study including a brief review of the equivalent body concept, a listing of the basic sonic boom signature characteristics and requirements, identification of candidate vehicles in terms of desirable features/availability, and vehicle characteristics including geometries, area distributions, and resulting sonic boom signatures. A program is developed that includes wind tunnel sonic boom and force models and tests for both a basic and modified vehicles and full-scale flight tests...|$|R
50|$|The use of add-on spaced armor skirts on armored {{vehicles}} {{may have the}} opposite effect and actually increase the penetration of some shaped charge warheads. Due to constraints in {{the length of the}} projectile/missile, the built-in stand-off on many warheads is less than the optimum distance. In such cases, the skirting effectively increases the distance between the armor and the target, and the warhead detonates closer to its optimum standoff. Skirting {{should not be confused with}} cage armor which is used to damage the fusing system of RPG-7 projectiles. The armor works by deforming the inner and outer ogives and shorting the firing circuit between the rocket's piezoelectric <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> and rear fuse assembly. Cage armor can also cause the projectile to pitch up or down on impact, lengthening the penetration path for the shaped charge's penetration stream. If the <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> strikes one of the cage armor slats, the warhead will function as normal.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{third and}} final tanker rendezvous, Ritchie's <b>nose</b> <b>probe,</b> which had been damaged in the {{refuelling}} with the Lincoln, was unable to transfer fuel from the final tanker, a USAF KB-29 offshore from Labrador, forcing him to eject over Labrador when {{he ran out of}} fuel. Ritchie was safely picked up shortly afterwards. Schilling's refuelling went as-intended and he landed at an airbase at Limestone, Maine, after a flight of ten hours and eight minutes. For this flight, Schilling received the Harmon Trophy.|$|E

5000|$|If the HEAT warhead is detonated {{too near}} a target's surface, {{there is not}} enough time for the {{particle}} stream to fully develop.

5000|$|After {{a landing}} {{accident}} {{in which the}} retractable landing gear failed to extend, the P.111 was modified during its repairs to improve the flight characteristics, and was re-designated the P.111A. Four [...] "petal" [...] airbrakes {{were added to the}} fuselage to lower landing speeds and the undercarriage doors were changed to reduce the trim change. A long <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> carrying a pitot head was added. The most immediately obvious change was the new bright yellow overall paint scheme, the P.111 having been unpainted or silver coloured. The P.111A soon gained the nickname of the [...] "Yellow Peril".|$|E
50|$|SA-2D; Fan Song-E {{radar and}} V-750SM missiles. The V-750SM {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} A/B/C versions in having new antennas and a longer barometric <b>nose</b> <b>probe.</b> Several other differences {{were associated with the}} sustainer motor casing. The missile is 10.8 m long and has the same body diameters and warhead as the SA-2C, but the weight is increased to 2,450 kg. The effective maximum range is 43 km, the minimum range is 6 km, and the intercept altitude envelope is between 250 and 25000 m. Improved aircraft counter measures {{led to the development of}} the Fan Song-E with its better antennas which could cut through heavy jamming.|$|E
50|$|After {{arriving}} to {{the vicinity of}} the ISS, Progress M-13M began a flyaround maneuver to get lined up with the docking port. It then executed a roll maneuver to properly orient its forward <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> with the Pirs Docking Compartment. A momentary station keeping hold with about 620 ft between the two spacecraft allowed Russian flight controllers at the Moscow Mission Control to check the systems before issuing the approval to begin the 11-minute final approach to the ISS. The automated docking system of the Progress M-13M operated flawlessly and the linkup of Progress M-13M to the Space Station's Pirs docking port occurred just before an orbital sunset while the two spacecraft were orbiting 247 mi above northern China.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had never}} seen my step-cousin, Augusta Ashley, but I knew, from Aunt Lucy's remarks {{concerning}} her, pretty much what sort of person she was--just the precise kind I disliked immeasurably.

40|$|Rocket {{payloads}} {{designed to}} measure small scale electron density irregularities and ion properties in the middle atmosphere were flown {{with each of the}} three main salvos of the MAC/Epsilon campaign conducted at the Andoya Rocket Range, Norway, during October to November 1987. Fixed bias, hemispheric <b>nose</b> tip <b>probes</b> measured small scale electron density irregularities, indicative of neutral air turbulence, during the rocket's ascent; and subsequently, parachute-borne Gerdien condensers measured the region's polar electrical conductivity, ion mobility and density. One rocket was launched during daylight (October 15, 1052 : 20 UT), and the other two launches occurred at night (October 21, 2134 UT: November 12, 0021 : 40 UT) under moderately disturbed conditions which enhanced the detection and measurement of turbulence structures. A preliminary analysis of the real time data displays indicates the presence of small scale electron density irregularities in the altitude range of 60 to 90 km. Ongoing data reduction will determine turbulence parameters and also the region's electrical properties below 90 km...|$|R
5000|$|In the UK it is a {{standard}} practice to replace the BSA moderators with Weihrauch or Logun silencers to reduce the rifle's report. Separate after market fitments for regulators and bigger cylinders are available.

50|$|In 1960, the RAF issued Specification 239 for a {{strategic}} transport, {{which resulted in}} an order being placed by the Air Ministry with Vickers in September 1961 for five VC10s. The order was increased by an additional six in August 1962, with a further three aircraft cancelled by BOAC added in July 1964. The military version (Type 1106) {{was a combination of}} the Standard combi airframe with the more powerful engines and fin fuel tank of the Super VC10. It also had a detachable in-flight refuelling <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> and an auxiliary power unit in the tailcone. Another difference from the civil specification was that all the passenger seats faced backwards for safety reasons.|$|E
50|$|The missile uses a tandem-charge HEAT warhead {{in order}} to defeat {{explosive}} reactive armour fitted to many armored vehicles today; a much small diameter warhead {{at the front of}} the missile body and a larger main warhead at the rear. Locating the main warhead at the rear of the missile body provides the correct stand off needed for the optimum effectiveness of the Eryx warhead without the need of a complex collapsible <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> (e.g. the TOW) which is standard on most antitank missiles today. This simple solution keeps the missile's cost extremely low when compared to other antitank missiles but also for a compact missile design that can be produced in mass quantities.|$|E
50|$|HEAT shells are {{a type of}} shaped charge used {{to defeat}} {{armoured}} vehicles. They are extremely efficient at defeating plain steel armour but less so against later composite and reactive armour. The effectiveness of the shell is independent of its velocity, and hence the range: it is as effective at 1000 metres as at 100 metres. The speed can even be zero in the case where a soldier simply places a magnetic mine onto a tank's armor plate. A HEAT charge is most effective when detonated at a certain, optimal, distance {{in front of the}} target and HEAT shells are usually distinguished by a long, thin <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> sticking {{out in front of the}} rest of the shell and detonating it at the correct distance, e.g., PIAT bomb. HEAT shells are less effective if spun (i.e., fired from a rifled gun).|$|E
40|$|Totally {{integrated}} design facilitates electrical cleanliness and light weight, which are necessary in subsonic parachute-borne payloads for electrodynamics investigations. 'Blunt' probes measure ion conductivity, as do Gerdien condensers. Recent finite-element computer analyses combining flow and electrodynamics have resolved problems in determining ion densities and mobilities from Gerdien data. Three-axis electric fields are measured with deployable boom-mounted electrodes from dc through VLF. Splitting the cylindrical payload with an insulator and measuring the current between halves {{has provided a}} vertical Maxwell current detector mechanically rigid enough to measure, at ELF, energy related to coupling. A <b>nose</b> tip 'Smith' <b>probe</b> turbulence measurement is usually performed on ascent. Other instrumentation, such as photo-ionization sources and X-ray detectors, can also be included. These electrodynamic measurement payloads are about one meter in length and have a mass of about 9 kg. They can be launched with an Orion-class or smaller vehicle...|$|R
50|$|The eastern barred {{bandicoot}} weighs {{less than}} 2 kg {{and has a}} short tail and three to four whitish bars across the rump. The Eastern barred bandicoot has two separated populations, one on the mainland of Australia {{and one on the}} island of Tasmania. The Tasmanian form is somewhat larger than the mainland form as the average adult mass is 750 g in Victoria and 1,000 g in Tasmania. It lives for just two to three years and is not gregarious. Males occupy large home ranges compared to females and only consort with females for mating. This species is nocturnal. It emerges from its nest at dusk to forage for a variety of invertebrates including crickets, beetles and earthworms. During the day it rests in a grass-lined nest. When foraging, it uses its long <b>nose</b> to <b>probe</b> deep into the soil and then digs eagerly when it locates food. Females have 8 nipples and can produce a maximum of 5 young in one litter with an average of 2 to 3 young. Gestation lasts just 12 days—this is one of the shortest gestation periods of any mammal. Young are weaned at 55 days and emerged juveniles remain dependent upon the mother and forage with her until day 86. Given ideal conditions, females can have up to five litters per year although reproduction becomes depressed in summer and ceases altogether in times of drought.|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the local}} stream thrust (a vector quantity) from a {{measured}} pitot pressure (a scalar quantity) requires either {{knowledge of the}} flow direction or a probe shape that compensates for flow direction. This compensation ideally would make the measured pressure directly proportional to the component of momentum along the probe axis. The flow angle sensitivity required to resolve this component of momentum was previously determined theoretically. A proposed <b>probe</b> <b>nose</b> shape was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and was found to produce a flow angle sensitivity close to the required sensitivity. In the current work, the proposed nose shape was tested in a wind tunnel at Mach numbers 1. 67, 2. 45, and 3. 48 at angles of attack from 0 to 15 deg. The test {{results indicate that the}} flow angle sensitivity of the proposed nose shape agrees with the required sensitivity to within 1 percent up to a flow angle of 15 deg...|$|R
50|$|Work on {{upgrading}} the Su-24 {{was started in}} 1971, and included the addition of inflight refueling and expansion of attack capabilities with even more payload options. T-6M-8 prototype first flew on 29 June 1977, and the first production Su-24M flew on 20 June 1979. The aircraft was accepted into service in 1983. Su-24M has a 0.76 m (30 in) longer fuselage section forward of the cockpit, adding a retractable refueling probe, and a reshaped, shorter radome for the attack radar. It can be identified by the single <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> {{in place of the}} three-part probe of earlier aircraft. A new PNS-24M inertial navigation system and digital computer were also added. A Kaira-24 laser designator/TV-optical quantum system (similar to the American Pave Tack) was fitted in a bulge in the port side of the lower fuselage, as well as Tekon track and search system (in pod), for compatibility with guided weapons, including 500 and 1,500kg laser-guided bombs and TV-guided bombs, and laser/TV-guided missiles Kh-25 and Kh-29L/T, anti-radar missiles Kh-58 and Kh-14 (AS-12 'Kegler') and Kh-59 (AS-13 'Kingbolt')/Kh-59M TV-target seeker guided missiles. The new systems led to a reduction in internal fuel amounting to 85 l (22.4 US gal). Su-24M was manufactured in 1981-1993.|$|E
5000|$|After the Korean War {{ended and}} the B-29 and B-36 bombers were retired, the United States Air Force no longer had an {{aircraft}} that could drop the completely assembled M-121 and they were put in storage. Production of the T-10 ended in 1955. The B-36 was the last operational aircraft that could drop a fully assembled Tallboy type bomb in the conventional way. [...] During the Vietnam War, some M-121s, minus their rear streamlined shrouds and tail fin assemblies were shipped to Vietnam for Commando Vault missions where the warheads were incorporated into the BLU-82 weapons dropped by C-130s using radar control. The warheads were mounted on a platform and pulled by parachutes from the rear loading ramp of C-130s. After clearing the aircraft the large extraction chutes and pallets were cut away and small triangular chutes stabilized the large warhead until impact. A three-foot <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> detonated the bomb at the correct stand-off distance. One {{of the last of}} the World War II Tallboy designs was dropped during a Commando Vault mission to clear a landing zone for helicopters on a ridge during the 1969 Battle of Hamburger Hill in Vietnam. Dropping from 10000 ft, the bomb hit exactly where it was needed. The Commando Vault missions were more accurate in bomb delivery on target than the more modern B-52s.|$|E

The primary test objectives were to define the orbiter wheel well pressure loading {{and its effects on}} landing gear thermal insulation and to investigate the pressure environment experienced by both the horizontal flight <b>nose</b> <b>probe</b> and air vent door probes. Steady state and dynamic pressure values were recorded in the orbiter nose gear well, left main landing gear well, horizontal flight <b>nose</b> <b>probe,</b> and both left and right air vent door probe.

30|$|At initial ARDS {{diagnosis}} and after 24  h, pulse oximetry results were retrospectively collected, {{and the corresponding}} SpO 2 /FiO 2 was calculated. For this, we first collected ten successive nurse-validated SpO 2 and FiO 2 values over 10  min directly preceding, and at the time, an arterial blood sample was drawn for blood gas analysis. The median of these ten SpO 2 and FiO 2 values was {{used to calculate the}} SpO 2 /FiO 2 to alleviate potential artifactual SpO 2 values. In all patients, pulse oximetry was measured by conventional two-wavelength finger pulse oximeters. The local protocol dictated a change in finger position every 3 – 4  h to avoid decubitus lesions and to use alternative <b>probes,</b> such as <b>nose</b> and forehead <b>probes,</b> only in patients in whom no adequate signal could be obtained with a conventional pulse oximeter on a finger. In addition to this, PaO 2 and PaCO 2 levels, pH levels and body temperature were collected, and it was determined whether or not patients received treatment with vasopressors at both time points.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of supersonic wing tip vortices has been conducted at Mach 2. 49 using small-scale four-hole and five-hole conical probes, The study was performed 2. 25 chords downstream of a semispan rectangular wing at angles of attack of 5. 7 and 10. 4 deg. The main objective of the experiments {{was to determine the}} Mach number, flow angularity and total pressure distribution in the core region of supersonic wing tip vortices. A secondary aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of calibrating a conical probe using a computational solution to predict the flow characteristics. Results of the present investigation showed that the numerically generated calibration data can be used for pointed <b>nose</b> four-hole conical <b>probes</b> but were not sufficiently accurate for conventional five-hole <b>probes</b> due to <b>nose</b> bluntness effects. A combination of four-hole conical probe measurements with independent pitot pressure measurements indicated a significant Mach number and total pressure deficit in the core regions of supersonic wing tip vortices, combined with an asymmetric 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Burger-like 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 swirl distribution...|$|R
