40|$|In normal materials, the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> {{arise from}} {{nonlinearities}} in the polarisabilities of the constituent atoms or molecules. On {{the other hand}} the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> in liquid crystals arise from totally different processes. Also they occur at relatively low laser intensities. In a laser field a liquid crystal exhibits many novel and interesting <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects.</b> In addition we also find laser field induced effects that are peculiar to liquid crystals, like structural transformations, orientational transitions, modulated structures and phase transitions, to name a few.

50|$|Photonic {{logic is}} the use of photons (light) in logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). Switching is {{obtained}} using <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> when two or more signals are combined.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> {{provide a}} natural way of light {{manipulation}} and interaction, and form {{the foundation of}} applied photonics [...] from high-speed signal processing and telecommunication, to ultra-high bandwidth interconnects and information processing. However, relatively weak <b>nonlinear</b> response at <b>optical</b> frequencies calls for operation at high optical powers, or boosting efficiency of nonlinear parametric processes by enhancing local field intensity with high quality-factor resonators near cavity resonance, resulting in reduced operational bandwidth and increased loss due to multi-photon absorption. We present an alternative to this conventional approach, with strong <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> at low local intensities, based on period-doubling bifurcations near nonlinear cavity anti-resonance, {{and apply it to}} low-power optical comb generation in a silicon chip.

50|$|The photorefractive {{effect is}} a <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> seen in certain {{crystals}} and other materials that respond to light by altering their refractive index.The effect {{can be used to}} store temporary, erasable holograms and is useful for holographic data storage.It {{can also be used to}} create a phase-conjugate mirror or an optical spatial soliton.|$|E
50|$|Self-phase {{modulation}} (SPM) is a <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> of light-matter interaction.An ultrashort {{pulse of}} light, when travelling in a medium, will induce a varying refractive {{index of the}} medium due to the optical Kerr effect. This variation in refractive index will produce a phase shift in the pulse, leading to a change of the pulse's frequency spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|Second {{harmonic}} generation (also called frequency doubling or abbreviated SHG) is a nonlinear optical process, in which photons {{with the same}} frequency interacting with a nonlinear material are effectively [...] "combined" [...] to generate new photons with twice the energy, and therefore twice the frequency and half the wavelength of the initial photons. Second {{harmonic generation}}, as an even-order <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effect,</b> is only allowed in media without inversion symmetry. It is a special case of sum frequency generation and is the inverse of half-harmonic generation.|$|E

50|$|Other {{applications}} rely on {{the peak}} pulse power (rather than the energy in the pulse), especially {{in order to obtain}} <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects.</b> For a given pulse energy, this requires creating pulses of the shortest possible duration utilizing techniques such as Q-switching.|$|R
30|$|<b>Nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> {{properties}} of semiconductor quantum dots have attracted considerable interest {{due to their}} several potential applications [1 – 4]. In particular, second-order <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> properties, such as <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> rectification (OR) and second harmonic generation (SHG), have received special theoretical [5 – 8] and experimental [9, 10] attention due to their magnitudes being stronger than those of high-order ones, making them the first <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> experimentally observed.|$|R
50|$|The {{result of}} GVD, whether {{negative}} or positive, is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fiber, since if dispersion is too high, {{a group of}} pulses representing a bit-stream will spread in time and merge, rendering the bit-stream unintelligible. This limits the length of fiber that a signal can be sent down without regeneration. One possible answer to this problem is to send signals down the optical fibre at a wavelength where the GVD is zero (e.g., around 1.3-1.5 μm in silica fibres), so pulses at this wavelength suffer minimal spreading from dispersion. In practice, however, this approach causes more problems than it solves because zero GVD unacceptably amplifies other nonlinear effects (such as four wave mixing). Another possible option is to use soliton pulses in the regime of anomalous dispersion, a form of optical pulse which uses a <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> to self-maintain its shape. Solitons have the practical problem, however, that they require a certain power level to be maintained in the pulse for the nonlinear effect {{to be of the}} correct strength. Instead, the solution that is currently used in practice is to perform dispersion compensation, typically by matching the fiber with another fiber of opposite-sign dispersion so that the dispersion effects cancel; such compensation is ultimately limited by nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation, which interact with dispersion to make it very difficult to undo.|$|E
50|$|Second-harmonic imaging {{microscopy}} (SHIM) {{is based}} on a <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> known as second-harmonic generation (SHG). SHIM has been established as a viable microscope imaging contrast mechanism for visualization of cell and tissue structure and function. A second-harmonic microscope obtains contrasts from variations in a specimen’s ability to generate second-harmonic light from the incident light while a conventional optical microscope obtains its contrast by detecting variations in optical density, path length, or refractive index of the specimen. SHG requires intense laser light passing through a material with a noncentrosymmetric molecular structure. Second-harmonic light emerging from an SHG material is exactly half the wavelength (frequency doubled) of the light entering the material. While two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) is also a two photon process, TPEF loses some energy during the relaxation of the excited state, while SHG is energy conserving. Typically, an inorganic crystal is used to produce SHG light such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3), potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP = KTiOPO4), and lithium triborate (LBO = LiB3O5). Though SHG requires a material to have specific molecular orientation in order for the incident light to be frequency doubled, some biological materials can be highly polarizable, and assemble into fairly ordered, large noncentrosymmetric structures. Biological materials such as collagen, microtubules, and muscle myosin can produce SHG signals. The SHG pattern is mainly determined by the phase matching condition. A common setup for an SHG imaging system will have a laser scanning microscope with a titanium sapphire mode-locked laser as the excitation source. The SHG signal is propagated in the forward direction. However, some experiments have shown that objects on the order of about a tenth of the wavelength of the SHG produced signal will produce nearly equal forward and backward signals.|$|E

40|$|All-optical signal {{processing}} based on <b>nonlinear</b> <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> {{allows for the}} realization of important functions in telecommunications including wavelength conversion, optical multiplexing/demultiplexing, Fourier transformation, and regeneration, amongst others, on ultrafast time scales to support high data rate transmission. In integrated photonic subsystems, the majority of all-optical {{signal processing}} systems demonstrated to date typically process only a single channel at a time or perform a single processing function, which imposes a serious limitation on the functionality of integrated solutions.
