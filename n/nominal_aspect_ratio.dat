Recent experiments on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) have begun to quantify and optimize the ohmic current drive eciency in a MA-class ST device. Sustainable ramp-rates in excess of 5 MA/sec during the current rise phase have been achieved on NSTX, while faster ramps generate signicant MHD activity.
