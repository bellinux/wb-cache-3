40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{expenditure}} on education as determinant on economic growth. The study {{examine the relationship between}} education and economic growth in total number of states as a whole, <b>Non</b> special <b>category</b> states, special category states and North eastern states separately. We have considered Net State Domestic Product at Factor cost on constant prices (NSDP) and Per-capita Net State Domestic Product at Factor cost (PerNSDP) on constant price as proxy for economic growth. Using the panel least square with fixed and random effect NSDP and Per NSDP has regressed separately on Expenditure on education and Expenditure on education as a percentage of aggregate expenditure. The result of the study shows that expenditure on education is positively influencing the growth of the economy. But Expenditure on education as a percentage of aggregate expenditure is negatively influencing the economic growth in case of total states as a whole and <b>Non</b> special <b>category</b> states.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a notion of}} {{generalized}} 2 -vector space is introduced which includes Kapranov and Voevodsky 2 -vector spaces. Various kinds of generalized 2 -vector spaces are considered and examples are given. The existence of non free generalized 2 -vector spaces and of generalized 2 -vector spaces which are non Karoubian (hence, <b>non</b> abelian) <b>categories</b> is discussed, and it is shown how any generalized 2 -vector space can be identified with a full subcategory of an (abelian) functor category with values in the category VECT_K of (possibly infinite dimensional) vector spaces. The corresponding general linear 2 -groups GL(Vect_K[C]) are considered. Specifically, it is shown that GL(Vect_K[C]) always contains as a (non full) sub- 2 -group the 2 -group Equiv_Cat(C) (hence, for finite categories C, they contain Weyl sub- 2 -groups analogous to usual Weyl subgroups of the general linear groups), and GL(Vect_K[C]) is explicitly computed (up to equivalence) in a special case of generalized 2 -vector spaces which include those of Kapranov and Voevodsky. Finally, other important drawbacks {{of the notion of}} generalized 2 -vector space, besides {{the fact that it is}} in general a <b>non</b> Karoubian <b>category,</b> are also mentioned at the end of the paper.

40|$|Excerpt] Rates {{of tuition}} {{increases}} in {{both private and}} public higher education that continually exceed inflation, coupled {{with the fact that the}} United States no longer leads the world in terms of the fraction of our young adults who have college degrees, have focused attention on why costs keep increasing in higher education and what categories of higher education expenditures have been growing the most rapidly. In a series of publications, the Delta Cost Project has shown that during the last two decades median instructional spending per full-time equivalent (FTE) student in both public and private 4 -year colleges and universities in the United States grew at a slower rate than median expenditures per FTE student in many other categories of expenditures (research, public service, academic support, student services, and scholarships and fellowships). 1 Similarly, the Center for College Affordability and Productivity reports that during the same time period, managerial and support/service staff at colleges and universities grew relative to faculty. Do such changes reflect increased inefficiency and waste or do some <b>non</b> instructional <b>categories</b> of employees and expenditures contribute directly to the educational mission of American colleges and universities? In this paper, we use institutional level panel data and an educational production function approach to estimate whether various <b>non</b> instructional <b>categories</b> of expenditures directly influenc...|$|R

In their construction the quantum parameter q is a root of unity of order 2 r where r> 1 is odd or congruent to 2 modulo 4. In this paper we consider the remaining cases where r is congruent to zero modulo 4 and produce invariants of 3 -manifolds with colored links, equipped with generalized spin structure. For a given 3 -manifold M, the relevant generalized spin structures are (non canonically) parametrized by H 1 (M;C/ 2 Z) ...|$|R
