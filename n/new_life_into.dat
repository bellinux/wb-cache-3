5|$|Since the 1970s {{there have}} been various {{initiatives}} to attempt to regenerate Coatbridge. Urban Aid grants, European Union grants and, more recently, Social Inclusion Partnership's have attempted to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> Coatbridge. Despite these efforts the town's population has continued to fall {{and in recent years}} the town has been dubbed the 'most dismal in Scotland'.|$|E
5|$|City {{leaders are}} working to bring <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> this area, by renovating and {{building}} new homes and attracting businesses. The completion of Interstate 664 restored the area to access and through traffic which had been largely rerouted with {{the completion of the}} Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1958 and discontinuance of the Newport News-Norfolk ferry service at that time. The larger capacity Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel and the rebuilt James River Bridge each restored some accessibility and through traffic to the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Infrastructure {{had been}} the object of growing public {{investment}} since 1920; but, where Argentina's educational and health network had grown into the most extensive ones in Latin America, the road network and public transport had changed little since the 1940s. Although it managed to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> important highway projects, the Frondizi administration accomplished less than it had set out to.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 16th century, a group of rhetoricians (see Medieval Dutch literature) in Brabant and Flanders {{attempted}} to put <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> the stereotyped forms of the preceding age by introducing in original composition the new-found branches of Latin and Greek poetry. The leader of these men was Johan Baptista Houwaert, who was led by an unbounded love of classical and mythological fancy.|$|E

50|$|Club life {{almost died}} {{out in the}} time when Bockau found itself in East Germany. It only revived in the 1990s after the {{political}} changes wrought by Reunification.

25|$|The Suprême Conseil des Isles d'Amérique (founded in 1802 by Grasse-Tilly and revived around 1810 by Delahogue) breathed <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> the Supreme Council for the 33rd Degree in France, {{and they}} merged {{into a single}} organization: the Supreme Council of France. This grew into an {{independent}} and sovereign Masonic power. It created symbolic lodges (those composed {{of the first three}} degrees, which otherwise would be federated around a Grand Lodge or a Grand Orient).|$|E
25|$|The {{new style}} of sermons {{and the way}} people practiced their faith breathed <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> {{religion}} in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious matters and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
50|$|The Haugean {{movement}}, or Haugeanism (haugianere), was a pietistic state church {{reform movement}} intended to bring <b>new</b> <b>life</b> and vitality <b>into</b> the Church of Norway {{which had been}} often characterized by formalism and lethargy.|$|R
50|$|It {{was hoped}} that the railway would bring <b>new</b> <b>life</b> back <b>into</b> the community, however gold mining was already {{becoming}} largely unprofitable and {{the last of the}} major mines closed in 1914. With the disappearance of the main industry in town, the bulk of the population soon left. The Shire of Walhalla was incorporated into the neighboring Shire of Narracan in 1918.|$|R
50|$|By 1990 Dan Hunter {{would see}} <b>new</b> <b>life</b> coming <b>into</b> The Crownsmen with wife Debbie, Brian Beathard on lead vocals & Zack delaRosa singing baritone.

25|$|Many of Wan Chai's older {{buildings}} {{now face}} {{a serious problem}} of urban decay. To tackle the problem, the government has launched a series of urban renewal projects to bring <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> the area. Many local residents have relocation worries such as whether the Urban Renewal Authority can compensate enough {{to put them in}} a new space of equal size. Other concerns involve the loss of building character that make up part of that Hong Kong cultural identity.|$|E
25|$|His 2006 debut disc, VOICES (Collegium Records COL CD 130), {{recorded}} by the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge, was released to critical acclaim, heralding O’Regan {{as one of the}} most original and eloquent of young British composers (The Observer, London), breathing <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> the idiom (The Daily Telegraph, London). International Record Review declared the recording a committed, persuasive and highly accomplished performance of an exceptional composing voice of our time, while BBC Music Magazine gave the disc a double five-star rating.|$|E
25|$|Mike Bateson {{took over}} as Torquay {{chairman}} in May 1990, taking over from Lew Pope. The beginning of the 1990–91 season saw Torquay off to a wonderful start – they were unbeaten for 14 games and were clear leaders in November but they faded dramatically, Bateson sacked Smith in April and appointed former United captain and then youth coach John Impey as manager. Impey proceeded to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> the team, guiding them to 7th place and the play-offs for a second time.|$|E
50|$|By late March, Nixon's stock {{speeches to}} civic groups were {{becoming}} worn.

25|$|Shiva, having cooled down by this time, {{agreed to}} Parvati’s conditions.

25|$|Awesome Comics {{continued}} many of {{the popular}} Extreme series', as well as launching new titles, including The Coven and Lionheart by Loeb and artist Ian Churchill. Perhaps Liefeld's best move, and the one for which Awesome's output is best known, was the decision to hire acclaimed comics writer Alan Moore to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> several of Extreme/Awesome's comics and characters. Although Moore's first output for Liefeld came when Extreme was still publishing under the Image banner, {{the majority of his}} work was done under Awesome, with several issues (of Supreme) also being published by Maximum in-between the two imprints.|$|E

5000|$|However, the proactionary {{principle}} {{argues that}} [...] "sufficient study" [...] may {{in some cases}} be impractical. For instance, in releasing a <b>new</b> <b>life</b> form <b>into</b> the biosphere [...] - [...] whether genetically modified plant, animal, or bacteria [...] - [...] {{one would have to}} simulate the biosphere to achieve [...] "acceptable levels of predictability". While the innovator of the <b>new</b> <b>life</b> form might point out that such a simulation would be a heavy burden, the other life forms in the biosphere could suffer irreparable harm {{in the case of an}} untested release.

25|$|In 2000 {{a strong}} economy, falling unemployment, {{and the impact}} of the Internet {{appeared}} to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> the “Swedish model” of a welfare society, one that had seemed dead and buried during the deep recession of the early 1990s: growth reached 4%, and unemployment fell to the lowest level in years. The Social Democrats, however, failed to capitalize on the economic boom. Opinion polls showed the party struggling to return to its post-election 36% approval level. Instead, the smaller Left Party, a Social Democrat ally, picked up support with its program of increased public spending and opposition to Swedish membership in the European single currency.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{was inaugurated}} as the seventh President of Ireland on 3 December 1990. She proved a remarkably popular {{president}}, earning the praise of Brian Lenihan himself who, {{before his death}} five years later, {{said that she was}} a better president than he ever could have been. She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians and breathed <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> the role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect, and political experience. She reached out to the Irish diaspora (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of Anglo-Irish relations, when she was the first serving Irish president to visit the United Kingdom and meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably the Prince of Wales, to her official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1955, {{a new wave}} of composers appeared, {{inspired}} by Bartók and breathing <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> Hungarian music. Composers from this era included András Mihály, Endre Szervánszky, Pál Kadosa, Ferenc Farkas and György Ránki. These composers both brought back old techniques of Hungarian music, as well as adapting imported avant-garde and modernist elements of Western classical music. György Ligeti and György Kurtág are often mentioned in the same sentence. They were born near each other in Transylvania and studied in Budapest in the 1940s. Both were influenced by Stockhausen. Kurtág's modernism borrowed many influences from the past. By contrast Ligeti invented a new language with chromatic tone clusters and elements of parody. Both were multi-lingual and became exiles. This is reflected in the texts for their works. The foundation of the New Music Studio in 1970 helped further modernize Hungarian classical music though promoting composers that felt audience education was as important a consideration as artistic merit in composition and performance; these Studio's well-known composers include László Vidovszky, László Sáry and Zoltán Jeney. Miklós Rózsa, who studied in Germany and eventually settled in the United States, achieved international recognition for his Hollywood film scores as well as his concert music.|$|E

The buildings are Grade I listed. In 1999 some parts of Queen Mary and King William, and the whole of Queen Anne and the Dreadnought Building were leased for 150 years by the University of Greenwich. In 2000 Trinity College of Music leased the major part of King Charles. This created a unique new educational and cultural mix.|$|R
