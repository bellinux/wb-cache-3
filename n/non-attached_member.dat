5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty <b>non-attached</b> <b>members</b> known as non-inscrits.

No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As {{a result of being}} broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence {{have more in common with}} parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|R
