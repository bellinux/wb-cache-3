5000|$|The first {{interchangeable}} barrel revolvers produced {{were the}} Dan Wesson Models W8, W9, W11, and W12, all medium-frame size frame revolvers chambered in [...]38 Special or [...]357 Magnum. The W8 and W11 had either a fixed rear sight, or a rear sight adjustable only for windage, while the W9 and W12 featured a rear sight fully adjustable for both windage and elevation. The barrels and shrouds for both models were interchangeable {{and used a}} large externally mounted nut on the muzzle end to secure the barrel and shroud. The shrouds on these early models had an elongated flange (known to collectors as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] shrouds) which mated with {{the front of the}} revolver's frame. Initial barrel/shroud options were 2 1/2-inch, 4-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inches. A custom barrel <b>nut</b> <b>wrench</b> and feeler gauge were supplied with each pistol, and barrel changes could be accomplished in two minutes or less.|$|E
50|$|Also {{important}} is knowing {{the condition of}} the spare tire, jack and lug wrench upon purchase of a used car. This, among other things, is one very important item many used car buyers overlook when inspecting a potential purchase. If the vehicle is missing any of the items that go with a spare tire, it's possible to purchase them again from the manufacturer's dealership. It's also possible to buy the tools used, or from a junkyard, though if one chooses this route it is of utmost importance that {{the condition of the}} items be inspected thoroughly before storing them in your car. It's also possible to purchase a jack and a universal lug <b>nut</b> <b>wrench</b> (usually shaped like a + sign) from an auto parts store or the automotive section of a department store, though these items will likely not fit in the vehicles designated spare tire tool storage location and will likely require that the items remain loose in the cargo area. It is worth bearing in mind that, in an attempt to decrease theft, numerous cars on the road today (especially those with alloy wheels) may use one or more security caps or nuts on a wheel. These can only be removed with a specific tool which should be present in the car's tool kit. Without this tool {{it will be difficult to}} remove a wheel.|$|E
40|$|There the {{scientific}} problem about the automation of assembly of articles {{with the group}} threaded joints has been solved {{on the basis of}} theoretical opening of essence of computer-aided process, of operating conditions. The new method of passive adaptation, the high-effective means of automation, which are new in the main, have been offered. The high-effective means of automatic assembly of threaded joints have been provided, the control over their joining by the use of aids of passive adaptation has been optimized. The modes of assembling process, the method of passive adaptation of parts ot be joined over the threaded surface have been developed; the new construction of multispindle <b>nut</b> <b>wrench</b> with the normalized axial force, the number of assembling devices of threaded joints have been created. The assembling devices, the automatic machines and the automatic sets are in use at the enterprises of Vladimir, Kovrov, Yartsevo; the mutispindle <b>nut</b> <b>wrench</b> is used at the Vladimir Tractor Works and at the Kovrov Experimental Works. The efficiencies are the rise of labour productivity 2 - 5 times, the release of workers, the exclusion of manual labourAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
5000|$|The chuck may be {{held against}} the taper with a {{threaded}} retainer ring (large thin <b>nut),</b> typically <b>wrenched</b> with a spanner wrench of the pin or hook variety. The peak of popularity for building {{this type of}} spindle nose was the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} <b>wrenching</b> <b>nut,</b> (also {{known as}} an Allenut or Allen nut), is a cylindrical nut that is internally threaded {{on one side and}} has an Allen socket on the other side; the outside of the nut is smooth or has knurling on it.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{approach}} of the car, both of its occupants exited. The officer observed chrome lug nuts in an open glove compartment located between the vehicle's front bucket seats, {{as well as two}} lug wrenches on the floorboard of the back seat. These items were in plain view, illuminated by the lights of the service station. Because the respondent and his companion fit the description of those suspected of stealing motor vehicle parts, the officer immediately arrested both of them. He then seized the lug <b>nuts</b> and <b>wrenches</b> from their automobile.|$|R
40|$|Special tool enables {{one worker}} to do two-worker job. <b>Wrench</b> holds two <b>nuts</b> in place while third nut, coaxial with others, turned.

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of nuts exists, from {{household}} hardware versions to specialized industry-specific designs that are engineered to meet various technical standards. Fasteners used in automotive, engineering, and industrial applications usually need to be tightened to a specific torque setting, using a torque <b>wrench.</b> <b>Nuts</b> are graded with strength ratings compatible with their respective bolts; for example, an ISO property class 10 nut {{will be able to}} support the bolt proof strength load of an ISO property class 10.9 bolt without stripping. Likewise, an SAE class 5 nut can support the proof load of an SAE class 5 bolt, and so on.|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, two Guinness {{records were}} set using Lego products: A castle made from 400,000 Lego bricks, and {{measuring}} 4.45 meters by 5.22 meters, {{was built on}} Swedish television, and a 545 meters long Lego railway line with three locomotives was constructed. Duplo was augmented {{with the addition of}} the Toolo line featuring a screwdriver, <b>wrench,</b> <b>nuts</b> and bolts; the Paradisa line, targeted towards girls, brought a variety of new pastel colors into the Lego system and focused around horses and a beach theme. In 1993 a Duplo train and a parrot-shaped [...] "brickvac" [...] that could scoop Lego pieces up off the floor were released.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, locking nuts (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the <b>nut</b> and the <b>wrench</b> to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of nuts. Only one locking nut per wheel is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a left-hand self-cutting thread to grip the locking nut, although more advanced designs have a spinning outer ring to frustrate such techniques.|$|R

50|$|The {{pipe wrench}} (US), Stillson wrench or Stillsons (UK) is an {{adjustable}} wrench/spanner used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to lock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. They are not intended for use on hardened steel hex nuts or other fittings because they would ruin the head; however, if a hex nut is soft enough that it becomes rounded beyond use with standard wrenches, a pipe wrench is sometimes used to break the bolt or <b>nut</b> free. Pipe <b>wrenches</b> are usually sold in the following sizes (by length of handle): 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 36, and 48 inches, although smaller and larger sizes are available as well. They are usually made of cast steel. Today, aluminium is also used to construct the body of the wrench, while the teeth and jaw remain steel. Teeth, and jaw kits (which also contain adjustment rings and springs) can be bought to repair broken wrenches, as this is cheaper than buying a new wrench.|$|R
