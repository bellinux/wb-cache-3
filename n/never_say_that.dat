And yet, the use of nuclear power was camouflaged as 'peaceful' and continued to progress. You never know when there's going to be a natural disaster. You can <b>never</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there will never be a nuclear accident.|$|E
500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books <b>never</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a very scary thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} Cupid and Psyche is {{depicted}} {{in a wide range}} of visual media. Psyche is often represented with butterfly wings, and the butterfly is her frequent attribute and a symbol of the soul, though the literary Cupid and Psyche <b>never</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> she has or acquires wings. In antiquity, an iconographical tradition existed independently of Apuleius's tale and influenced later depictions.|$|R

2500|$|About 7,000 French Jews {{moved to}} Israel in 2014. [...] This was 1% {{of the entire}} French Jewish {{population}} and a record number since World War II. Conversations within the European Jewish community indicate that antisemitic attacks in France are {{the impetus for the}} high emigration figures. Valls expressed his concern about the trend: [...] "If 100,000 French people of Spanish origin were to leave, I would <b>never</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> France is not France anymore. [...] But if 100,000 Jews leave, France will no longer be France. [...] The French Republic will be judged a failure." [...] The trend of increased emigration continued into 2015 due to a rise in assaults and intimidation by Muslim extremists.|$|E
2500|$|He meets up with Miles, who angrily says [...] "it's {{been years}} man, years I {{been trying to}} get the {{straight}} word on Blackmore. And what the fuck is up with you my man? First I hear this, I couldn't believe, I said no way, not my man Torque. That cracker bleeding out in the basement, he told me what's what and he got no reason to lie. My brain ready to pop. It's too whack, nobody'd make this up. Nobody would <b>never</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you..." [...] However, Torque blacks out, and when he awakens, Miles is dead. Blackmore then contacts Torque, telling him to come to the drowning pool beneath the prison's factory. As Torque heads there, he is attacked by Foundation soldiers backed up by a helicopter piloted by Jordan, who was lying about her men betraying her. Torque defeats the soldiers and kills Jordan.|$|E

2500|$|The Miranda {{character}} receives {{negative comments}} to her videos from viewers who are {{fooled by the}} character and {{believe that they are}} watching a serious video by a bad entertainer. Ballinger told Backstage: [...] "It's sort of like an Andy Kaufman thing. You wouldn't believe the hate mail. ... You would <b>never</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> stuff to someone's face, but you can type anything online." [...] TheaterJones commented that [...] "perhaps because the Internet is some crazy postmodern distortion of reality, people ... felt it was their duty to point out how woefully untalented [...] was, in the most horrific ways. ... Her hate mail, which she reads some of on stage, is an art form all its own." [...] Ballinger noted: [...] "The whole reason Miranda went viral is because people were making fun of how stupid it was. If I didn't get hate mail, I wouldn't have a job." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement". Her young fans find the character empowering because they see, perhaps selectively, [...] "a conservatively attired girl who does what she likes, gets lots of attention and has bottomless self-esteem." [...] Miranda also teaches that [...] "Popular girls don’t have to be stylish. ... Fear no one. ... It's [...] to be cranky." [...] An article at The Conversation observed that some YouTubers [...] "use humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ... Miranda Sings... puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [...] being conventionally pretty." [...] Fans of the character who are studying the performing arts say that Miranda is [...] "a role model and a 'strong woman in comedy'" [...] that inspires confidence in their performance and social skills.|$|E
