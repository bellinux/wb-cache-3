Previous studies show that <b>NOTCH</b> 3 protein forms multimers. Here, we investigate protein interactions between <b>NOTCH</b> 3 and other vascular <b>Notch</b> isoforms and characterize the effects of elevated <b>NOTCH</b> 3 on smooth muscle gene regulation. We demonstrate that <b>NOTCH</b> 3 forms heterodimers with <b>NOTCH</b> 1, <b>NOTCH</b> 3, and <b>NOTCH</b> 4. R 90 C and C 49 Y mutant <b>NOTCH</b> 3 form complexes which are more resistant to detergents than wild type <b>NOTCH</b> 3 complexes. Using quantitative <b>NOTCH</b> 3 -luciferase clearance assays, we found significant inhibition of mutant <b>NOTCH</b> 3 clearance.

40|$|<b>Notch</b> signal {{transduction}} is evolutionarily conserved with essential functions identified in numerous species from C. elegans to H. Sapiens. <b>Notch</b> is critical during embryonic development, in the adult, and in cancer. In mammals {{there are four}} <b>Notch</b> receptors; much of our understanding of <b>Notch</b> signalling comes {{from the study of}} <b>NOTCH</b> 1. During embryogenesis, <b>Notch</b> 1 is widely expressed and is required in numerous processes including blood vessel formation and remodelling (angiogenesis). The view of <b>Notch</b> {{signal transduction}}, achieved primarily through studying <b>NOTCH</b> 1, is that <b>Notch</b> receptors undergo processing and are transported to the cell surface as a heterodimer. Ligand binding triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages leading to the release of the <b>Notch</b> intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription. In contrast to <b>NOTCH</b> 1, little is known about <b>NOTCH</b> 4; <b>Notch</b> 4 is expressed in endothelial cells of the circulatory system, trans-activation by ligand is difficult to detect, and a phenotype in mice, reported to be null for <b>Notch</b> 4 (<b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele), has not been identified. Here, further analysis of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 has revealed many features that are in contrast to <b>NOTCH</b> 1 : (i) unprocessed <b>NOTCH</b> 4 was present on the cell surface, (ii) ligand did not trans-activate <b>NOTCH</b> 4 signalling, (iii) <b>NOTCH</b> 4 inhibited <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signal transduction in a dose dependent manner, (iv) <b>NOTCH</b> 4 induced the differentiation of myoblasts, and (v) subcellular localisation of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 was different to <b>NOTCH</b> 1, and coexpression resulted in <b>NOTCH</b> 1 adopting the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 pattern of localisation. In addition, postnatal retinal angiogenesis was examined in mice carrying the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele. A delay in the expansion of the retinal vasculature was equally observed in both <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 +/- and <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 -/- mice. This suggested that <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 was not a null allele. Fittingly, the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele produced transcripts that encode for much of the extracellular domain of <b>NOTCH</b> 4. The expression pattern of this transcript was equivalent to <b>Notch</b> 4 in mouse embryos. Like full length <b>NOTCH</b> 4, expression of a cDNA based on this transcript also inhibited <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signal transduction. These studies reveal {{for the first time a}} function for <b>NOTCH</b> 4 that is, as an inhibitor of <b>NOTCH</b> 1. Accordingly it is postulated that <b>Notch</b> 4 will have a crucial function in angiogenesis, since <b>Notch</b> 1 is required for angiogenesis and <b>Notch</b> 4 is expressed in endothelial cells of the circulatory system...|$|R

Here we examine development in embryos expressing various combinations of <b>Notch</b> 1 mutant alleles. Mice homozygous for the hypomorphic <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f allele, which removes the single O -fucose glycan in epidermal growth factor-like repeat 12 (EGF 12) of the <b>Notch</b> 1 ligand binding domain (lbd), exhibit reduced growth after weaning and defective T cell development. Mice homozygous for the inactive <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd allele express <b>Notch</b> 1 missing an ~ 20 kDa internal segment including the canonical <b>Notch</b> 1 ligand binding domain, and die at embryonic day ~E 9. 5. The embryonic and vascular phenotypes of compound heterozygous <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd embryos were compared with <b>Notch</b> 1 +/ 12 f, <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / 12 f, and <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos. Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from these embryos were also examined in <b>Notch</b> signaling assays. While <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling was stronger in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compound heterozygotes compared to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos and ES cells, <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling was even stronger in embryos carrying <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f and a null <b>Notch</b> 1 allele. Results Mouse embryos expressing the hypomorphic <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f allele, {{in combination with the}} inactive <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd allele which lacks the <b>Notch</b> 1 ligand binding domain, died at ~E 11. 5 - 12. 5. <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd ES cells signaled less well than <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / 12 f ES cells but more strongly than <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd ES cells. However, vascular defects in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac were severe and similar to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd yolk sac. By contrast, vascular disorganization was milder in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compared to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos. The expression of <b>Notch</b> 1 target genes was low in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac and embryo head, whereas Vegf and Vegfr 2 transcripts were increased. The severity of the compound heterozygous <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac phenotype suggested that the allelic products may functionally interact. By contrast, compound heterozygotes with <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f in combination with a <b>Notch</b> 1 null allele (<b>Notch</b> 1 tm 1 Con) were capable of surviving to birth. Conclusions <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compound heterozygous embryos is more defective than in compound heterozygotes expressing a hypomorphic <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f allele and a <b>Notch</b> 1 null allele. The data suggest that the gene products <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd and <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f interact to reduce the activity of <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f. </p...|$|R

40|$|Pericytes {{regulate}} vessel {{stability and}} pericyte dysfunction contributes to retinopathies, stroke, and cancer. Here we define <b>Notch</b> {{as a key}} regulator of pericyte function during angiogenesis. In <b>Notch</b> 1 (+/-); <b>Notch</b> 3 (-/-) mice, combined deficiency of <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 3 altered pericyte interaction with the endothelium and reduced pericyte coverage of the retinal vasculature. <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 3 were shown to cooperate to promote proper vascular basement membrane formation and contribute to endothelial cell quiescence.

40|$|AbstractNotch 4 is a {{divergent}} {{member of}} the <b>Notch</b> family of receptors that is primarily expressed in the vasculature. Its expression implies an important role for <b>Notch</b> 4 in the vasculature; however, mice homozygous for the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 knockout allele are viable. Since {{little is known about}} the role of <b>Notch</b> 4 in the vasculature and how it functions, we further investigated <b>Notch</b> 4 in mice and in cultured cells. We found that the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele is not null as it expresses a truncated transcript encoding most of the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 extracellular domain. In cultured cells, <b>NOTCH</b> 4 did not signal in response to ligand. Moreover, <b>NOTCH</b> 4 inhibited signalling from the <b>NOTCH</b> 1 receptor. This is the first report of cis-inhibition of signalling by another <b>Notch</b> receptor. The <b>NOTCH</b> 4 extracellular domain also inhibits <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signalling when expressed in cis, raising the possibility that reported <b>Notch</b> 4 phenotypes may not be due to loss of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 function. To better address the role of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 in vivo, we generated a <b>Notch</b> 4 null mouse in which the entire coding region was deleted. <b>Notch</b> 4 null mice exhibited slightly delayed vessel growth in the retina, consistent with our novel finding that <b>NOTCH</b> 4 protein is expressed in the newly formed vasculature.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Notch</b> {{signaling}} {{is highly}} conserved in the metazoa and {{is critical for}} many cell fate decisions. <b>Notch</b> activation occurs following ligand binding to <b>Notch</b> extracellular domain. In vitro binding assays have identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats 11 and 12 as the ligand binding domain of Drosophila <b>Notch.</b> Here we show that an internal deletion in mouse <b>Notch</b> 1 of EGF repeats 8 – 12, including the putative ligand binding domain (lbd), is an inactivating mutation in vivo. We also show that maternal and zygotic <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd mutant embryos develop through gastrulation to mid-gestation. Results <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos died at mid-gestation with a phenotype indistinguishable from <b>Notch</b> 1 null mutants. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd was expressed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to wild type <b>Notch</b> 1, but Delta 1 binding was reduced to {{the same level as}} in <b>Notch</b> 1 null cells. In an ES cell co-culture assay, <b>Notch</b> signaling induced by Jagged 1 or Delta 1 was reduced to a similar level in <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd and <b>Notch</b> 1 null cells. However, the <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd allele was expressed similarly to wild type <b>Notch</b> 1 in <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd ES cells and embryos at E 8. 75, indicating that <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling is not essential for the <b>Notch</b> 1 gene to be expressed. In addition, maternal and zygotic <b>Notch</b> 1 mutant blastocysts developed through gastrulation. Conclusion Mouse <b>Notch</b> 1 lacking the ligand binding domain is expressed at the cell surface but does not signal in response to the canonical <b>Notch</b> ligands Delta 1 and Jagged 1. Homozygous <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd mutant embryos die at ~E 10 similar to <b>Notch</b> 1 null embryos.

To assess {{the role of}} the <b>Notch</b> 4 gene, we generated <b>Notch</b> 4 -deficient mice by gene targeting. Embryos homozygous for this mutation developed normally, and homozygous mutant adults were viable and fertile. However, the <b>Notch</b> 4 mutation displayed genetic interactions with a targeted mutation of the related <b>Notch</b> 1 gene. Embryos homozygous for mutations of both the <b>Notch</b> 4 and <b>Notch</b> 1 genes often displayed a more severe phenotype than <b>Notch</b> 1 homozygous mutant embryos. Both <b>Notch</b> 1 mutant and <b>Notch</b> 1 /Notch 4 double mutant embryos displayed severe defects in angiogenic vascular remodeling. Analysis of the expression patterns of genes encoding ligands for <b>Notch</b> family receptors indicated that only the Dll 4 gene is expressed in a pattern consistent with that expected for a gene encoding a ligand for the <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 4 receptors in the early embryonic vasculature. These results reveal an essential role for the <b>Notch</b> signaling pathway in regulating embryonic vascular morphogenesis and remodeling, and indicate that whereas the <b>Notch</b> 4 gene is not essential during embryonic development, the <b>Notch</b> 4 and <b>Notch</b> 1 genes have partially overlapping roles during embryogenesis in mice...|$|R
40|$|<b>Notch</b> {{signaling}} {{has been}} implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle differentiation, but the precise role of <b>Notch</b> receptors is ill defined. Although <b>Notch</b> 3 receptor expression is high in smooth muscle, <b>Notch</b> 3 mutant mice are viable and display only mild defects in vascular patterning and smooth muscle differentiation. <b>Notch</b> 2 is also expressed in smooth muscle and <b>Notch</b> 2 mutant mice show cardiovascular abnormalities indicative of smooth muscle defects. Together, these findings infer that <b>Notch</b> 2 and <b>Notch</b> 3 act together to govern vascular development and smooth muscle differentiation. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the phenotype of mice with a combined deficiency in <b>Notch</b> 2 and <b>Notch</b> 3. Our results show that when <b>Notch</b> 2 and <b>Notch</b> 3 genes are simultaneously disrupted, mice die in utero at mid-gestation due to severe vascular abnormalities. Assembly of the vascular network occurs normally as assessed by Pecam 1 expression, however smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessels are grossly deficient leading to vascular collapse.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Notch</b> {{signaling}} pathway regulates intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis, including stem cell maintenance, progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 2 receptors {{are expressed in}} the epithelium, but individual contributions to these functions are unclear. We used genetic deletion to define receptor roles on stem cell function, cell proliferation/differentiation, and repair after injury. Loss of <b>Notch</b> 1 induced a transient secretory cell hyperplasia that spontaneously resolved over time. In contrast, deletion of <b>Notch</b> 2 had no secretory cell effect. Compound deletions of <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 2 resulted in a more severe secretory cell hyperplasia than deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1 alone. Furthermore, only double deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 2 decreased cell proliferation, suggesting a low threshold for maintenance of proliferation compared to differentiation. Stem cells were affected by deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1, with reduced expression of Olfm 4 and fewer LGR 5 + stem cells. Deletion of <b>Notch</b> 2 had no apparent affect on stem cell homeostasis. However, we observed impaired crypt regeneration after radiation in both <b>Notch</b> 1 - and <b>Notch</b> 2 -deleted intestine, suggesting that higher <b>Notch</b> activity is required post-injury.

40|$|EBNA 2 is {{essential}} for immortalization of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus. EBNA 2 is tethered to responsive promoters through a cellular factor, CBF 1.

However, <b>Notch</b> 2 is the predominant form expressed in spleen. The degree to which these <b>Notch</b> homologs are functionally convergent is not known. We present evidence that <b>Notch</b> 2 also signals through CBF 1. As {{is the case for}} <b>Notch</b> 1, <b>Notch</b> 2 interacted with the minimal repression domain of CBF 1 and was targeted to CBF 1 through the intracellular, subtransmembrane domain. Additional characterization suggested that the interaction domain of <b>Notch</b> may be bipartite. The intracellular domain of <b>Notch</b> 2 (<b>Notch</b> 2 IC) located to the nucleus. This activated form of <b>Notch</b> 2 transactivated expression of a target gene containing upstream CBF 1 binding sites. The use of CBF 1 mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the transcriptional repression domain revealed that activation of gene expression by <b>Notch</b> 2 is also based on masking of CBF 1 -mediated repression. Targeting of <b>Notch</b> 1 and targeting of <b>Notch</b> 2 were found to be identical and distinguishable from targeting by EBNA 2.

RESULTS Primarily resected patients with <b>NOTCH</b> 1 -negative tumors demonstrated worse survival. High <b>NOTCH</b> 1 expression was associated with early-stage tumors and with significantly increased survival in this subgroup. Higher <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was associated with early-stage and intestinal-type tumors and with better survival in the subgroup of intestinal-type tumors. In pretherapeutic biopsies, higher <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was more frequent in non-responding patients, but these differences were statistically not significant. CONCLUSION Our findings suggested that, in particular, <b>NOTCH</b> 1 expression indicated good prognosis in GC. The close relationship of high <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression with early tumor stages may indicate a tumor-suppressive role of <b>NOTCH</b> signaling in GC. The role of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 in neoadjuvantly treated GC is limited...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>NOTCH</b> {{activation}} plays oncogenic {{roles in}} acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). However, whether <b>NOTCH</b> is oncogenic or tumor-suppressive in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is still controversial. Herein, {{the roles of}} <b>NOTCH</b> in AML are reviewed. AML cells express <b>NOTCH</b> and <b>NOTCH</b> ligands; however, cell-autonomous activation is not observed. Activating <b>NOTCH</b> 1 mutations are rare in AML, unlike in T-ALL. <b>NOTCH</b> ligand stimulation generally suppresses the in vitro growth of AML cells but promotes transient growth of some samples. Conversely, knockdown of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 {{does not affect the}} growth of AML cells, whereas it suppresses the growth of T-ALL cells. These findings suggest that <b>NOTCH</b> is dispensable or suppressive for AML cell growth. However, the effects of <b>NOTCH</b> differ depending on cell conditions, and various stemness-relate...|$|R
5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by <b>notching</b> the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing a}} one-year NHL {{contract}} with Boston in August 2005, {{he appeared in}} his first NHL training camp in September 2005. Making the Bruins' roster for the 2005–06 season, he made his NHL debut on October 5, 2005 in a game versus the Montreal Canadiens. A month later, he notched his first NHL point, an assist, {{in a game against}} the Buffalo Sabres on November 19. In December 2005, Alberts received a brief 10-day assignment to Providence, <b>notching</b> an assist over 6 games during that span. Returning to the Boston lineup, he scored his first NHL goal late in the campaign during a game against the Buffalo Sabres on March 12, 2006. Playing in 73 games, Alberts scored a goal and six assists. During his rookie season, Bruins head coach Mike Sullivan experimented with playing Alberts at the forward position for roughly a month.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{recorded}} two assists {{during his}} October 30 debut with the Rangers AHL team, {{now called the}} Hartford Wolf Pack. However, he suffered a high ankle sprain after going into the boards during a November 2 game at Springfield. He missed the next 14 games as a result, not returning until December 20, but was given enough minutes upon his return that he was quickly {{able to get back}} into shape. Fast scored his first goal of the season on December 26, <b>notching</b> the game winner on the power play against Bridgeport Sound Tigers goalie Anders Nilsson. The game was part of a four-game point streak (two goals, two assists) that stretched from December 21 to December 29. Fast also set a team record on January 24 for fastest goal to start a period, scoring in the first seven seconds of the game against Springfield, beating Hartford's previous record by two seconds.|$|E
40|$|The test to {{investigate}} the elastic-plastic strain behavior ahead of <b>notch</b> in plate specimen with <b>notches</b> made of steel by using strain gages under tensile monotonic load is conducted. Two kind of specimens made of SS 400 material are used. One kind of specimen is specimens with three kind of <b>notch</b> root radius and constant <b>notch</b> depth. Another kind of specimen is those with three kind of <b>notch</b> depth and constant <b>notch</b> root radius. From test result, we show the relation between strain and distance from <b>notch</b> root. Next we show the relation between strain ratio and nondimensional distance from <b>notch</b> root.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					<b>Notch</b> 4 is {{a member}} of the <b>Notch</b> family of receptors that is {{primarily}} expressed in the vascular endothelial cells. Genetic deletion of <b>Notch</b> 4 does not result in an overt phenotype in mice, thus the function of <b>Notch</b> 4 remains poorly understood. 				 				 					 						Methods 					We examined the requirement for <b>Notch</b> 4 in the development of breast cancer vasculature. Orthotopic transplantation of mouse mammary tumor cells wild type for <b>Notch</b> 4 into <b>Notch</b> 4 deficient hosts enabled us to delineate the contribution of host <b>Notch</b> 4 independent of its function in the tumor cell compartment. 				 				 					 						Results 					Here, we show that <b>Notch</b> 4 expression is required for tumor onset and early tumor perfusion in a mouse model of breast cancer. We found that <b>Notch</b> 4 expression is upregulated in mouse and human mammary tumor vasculature. Moreover, host <b>Notch</b> 4 deficiency delayed the onset of MMTV-PyMT tumors, wild type for <b>Notch</b> 4, after transplantation. Vessel perfusion was decreased in tumors established in <b>Notch</b> 4 -deficient hosts. Unlike in inhibition of <b>Notch</b> 1 or Dll 4, vessel density and branching in tumors developed in <b>Notch</b> 4 -deficient mice were unchanged. However, final tumor size was similar between tumors grown in wild type and <b>Notch</b> 4 null hosts. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					Our results suggest a novel role for <b>Notch</b> 4 in the establishment of tumor colonies and vessel perfusion of transplanted mammary tumors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{involvement}} of the <b>Notch</b> pathway in several areas of vascular biology is now clearly established, its role in vascular inflammation at the endothelial level remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines drive a specific regulation of the <b>Notch</b> pathway in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). In arterial ECs, TNFα strongly modulates the pattern of <b>Notch</b> expression by decreasing <b>Notch</b> 4 expression while increasing <b>Notch</b> 2 expression. Changes in <b>Notch</b> expression were associated with a reduction in hes 1 and hey 2 expression and in CBF 1 reporter gene activity, suggesting that TNFα regulates both <b>Notch</b> expression and activity. <b>Notch</b> 2 and <b>Notch</b> 4 regulations occurred independently and were found to be mostly mediated by the NFκB signaling pathways and PI 3 -kinase signaling pathways, respectively. Functionally, TNF-mediated <b>Notch</b> regulation promotes caspase-dependent EC apoptosis. Finally, our findings confirmed that dysregulated <b>Notch</b> signaling also occurs upon inflammation and correlates with caspase activation and apoptosis. In conclusion, inflammatory cytokines elicit a switch in <b>Notch</b> expression characterized by <b>Notch</b> 2 predominance over <b>Notch</b> 4 leading to a reduced <b>Notch</b> activity and promoting apoptosis. Thus, here we provide evidence for a role of soluble mediators of inflammation (i. e. cytokines) in the regulation of <b>Notch</b> signaling and for the implication of a dysregulated <b>Notch</b> pathway to endothelial and vascular dysfunction...|$|R
