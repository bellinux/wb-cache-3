5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds <b>new</b> <b>light</b> on the sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the party}} that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her, but is unable to hurt her feelings. She is {{becoming}} infatuated with him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda that she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's request. Elphaba herself arrives, wearing the hat Galinda gave her, a witch's hat. The other students laugh and stare while Elphaba awkwardly dances on her own. Galinda feels terrible, and goes to dance with Elphaba. Soon everyone joins them, and the two girls {{look at each other}} in a <b>new</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{period between}} 1852 and the {{beginning}} of the 20th century saw great activity on the Great Lakes by the United States Lighthouse Board. Between 1852 and 1860 26 <b>new</b> <b>lights</b> were built. Even as the United States Civil War and its aftermath slowed construction, a dozen <b>new</b> <b>lights</b> were still lit in that decade. In the 1870s, 43 <b>new</b> <b>lights</b> were built on the Lakes. The 1880s saw more than one hundred lights constructed.|$|R

5|$|Following the Battle of Monmouth, the British {{retreated to}} New York City. On August 14, Scott was given command of a <b>new</b> <b>light</b> {{infantry}} corps organized by Washington. He {{also served as}} Washington's chief of intelligence, conducting constant scouting missions from the Americans' new base at White Plains, New York. While Scott's men engaged in a few skirmishes with British scouting parties, neither Washington's army nor the British force at New York City conducted any major operations before Scott was furloughed in November 1778.|$|E
5|$|Jellicoe {{announced}} that at present loss rates, Britain would be effectively starved into submission by November 1917. After {{a meeting at}} Scapa Flow later in July between Sims, Jellicoe, and Admiral David Beatty (commander of the Grand Fleet), the Admiralty requested that the U.S. Navy send four dreadnoughts and six destroyers to join the Grand Fleet. The Admiralty intended that {{the arrival of the}} American dreadnoughts would allow it to decommission five ships of the pre-dreadnought , freeing up four thousand officers and ratings to serve on <b>new</b> <b>light</b> cruisers, destroyers, and submarines then under construction.|$|E
5|$|Light that {{travels through}} {{transparent}} matter does so {{at a lower}} speed than c, {{the speed of light}} in a vacuum. For example, photons engage in so many collisions on the way from the core of the sun that radiant energy can take about a million years to reach the surface; however, once in open space, a photon takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing {{can be explained by the}} light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating <b>new</b> <b>light,</b> and that <b>new</b> <b>light</b> interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce quasi-particles known as polariton (other quasi-particles are phonons and excitons); this polariton has a nonzero effective mass, which means that it cannot travel at c. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering.|$|E

5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any <b>new</b> <b>light</b> sources.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a <b>new</b> <b>Light</b> Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E

50|$|The {{eighteenth century}} saw {{significant}} tensions within the Synod of Ulster, which was {{divided between the}} Old <b>Lights</b> and the <b>New</b> <b>Lights.</b> The Old Lights were conservative Calvinists who believed that ministers and ordinands should subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith. The <b>New</b> <b>Lights</b> were more liberal and were unhappy with the Westminster Confession and did not require ministers to subscribe to it. The <b>New</b> <b>lights</b> dominated the Synod of Ulster during the eighteenth century, allowing the more conservative Scottish Presbyterian dissenters, Seceders and Covenanters to establish a strong presence in Ulster.|$|R

5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying for the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The <b>new</b> <b>light</b> rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, line 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E
5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone <b>new</b> <b>light</b> on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. The story was criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, the story was worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The <b>new</b> <b>light</b> rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August.

5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without government subsidies {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s. As a result, the study forecasts that annual sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040, representing 35% of <b>new</b> <b>light</b> duty vehicle sales. In another scenario the study considers that if new carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery electric cars and fuel cell cars will remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid electric cars is projected to grow from 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E
