The specific method of multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy utilized monochromatic light and fluorescence to identify five specific intermediates due to changes in absorbance measurements. The steady-state turnover number, kcat, of ODC was calculated to be 0.5 s-1 at 4 °C.

Utilizing fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), the structural conformation of eflornithine following its interaction with ODC was determined to be S-((2-(1-pyrroline-methyl) cysteine, a cyclic imine adduct.

The merged equations for the mechanochemical and the heating reactions below 400 degrees C can be denoted as 3 LiBH(4) + 2 NaNH(2) -> Li 3 BN 2 + 2 NaBH(4) + 4 H(2). The maximum dehydrogenation capacity in closed system below 400 degrees C is 5. 1 wt. % H- 2, which agrees well with the theoretical capacity (5. 5 wt. % H- 2) of the merged equation and thus demonstrates the suggested pathway. The subsequent step consists of the decompositions of NaBH 4 and Li 3 Na(NH 2) (4) within the temperature range of 400 degrees C- 600 degrees C. The apparent activation energies of the two steps are 114. 8 and 123. 5 kJ/mol, respectively. They are all lower than that of our previously obtained bulk LiBH 4.

The results indicated that an ionic bonding between M ⁿ⁺ cations and [BH₄]⁻ anions exists in M (BH₄) n, and the charge transfer from M ⁿ⁺ cations to [BH₄]⁻ anions is a key feature for the stability of M (BH₄) n. A good correlation between the heat of formation Δ H boro of M (BH₄) n and the Pauling electronegativity of the cation ϰ P can be found, which {{is represented by the}} linear relation, Δ H boro = 248. 7 ϰ P – 390. 8 in the unit of kJ/mol BH₄. In order to confirm the predicted correlation experimentally, the hydrogen desorption reactions were studied for M (BH₄) n (M =Li, Na, K, Mg, Zn, Sc, Zr, and Hf), where the samples of the later five borohydrides were mechanochemically synthesized. The thermal desorption analyses indicate that LiBH₄, <b>NaBH₄,</b> <b>and</b> KBH₄ desorb hydrogen to hydride phases. Mg(BH₄) ₂, Sc(BH₄) ₃, and Zr(BH₄) ₄ show multistep desorption reactions through the intermediate phases of hydrides and/or borides. On the other hand, Zn(BH₄) ₂ desorbs hydrogen and borane to elemental Zn due to instabilities of Zn hydride and boride. A correlation between the desorption temperature T d and the Pauling electronegativity ϰ P is observed experimentally and so ϰ P is an indicator to approximately estimate the stability of M (BH₄) n. The enthalpy change for the desorption reaction, Δ H des, is estimated using the predicted Δ H boro and the reported data for decomposed product, Δ H hyd/boride. The estimated Δ H des show a good correlation with the observed T d, indicating that the predicted stability of borohydride is experimentally supported.
