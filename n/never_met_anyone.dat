Before he married Ingaret, he had become engaged to Fleur Kohler-Baker, {{the daughter of a}} prominent farmer and businessman, who was 17 years old; they had met on a ship and had had an intense but brief affair of love letters; she was shocked when he broke off the relationship. He went on a honeymoon with Ingaret to Switzerland, where his new wife introduced him to Carl Jung. Jung was to have probably a greater influence upon him than anybody else, and he later said that he had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> of Jung's stature. He continued to work on a travel book about his Nyasaland adventures called Venture to the Interior, which became an immediate best-seller in the US and Europe on its publication in 1952.|$|E

They had been hired by executive producer Michael Piller following separate unsolicited manuscripts submitted during the [...] of , and had remained {{on the staff of the}} franchise since. In Echevarria's first draft of the story, there was no lesbian element as Dax's former lover was male. The Trill taboo against reuniting relationships from past hosts was suggested by Piller early on in the creation of Deep Space Nine, in order for the society to prevent an [...] "aristocracy of the joined", where joined hosts <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> that they did not already know.|$|E

Discussing public reaction to her character, Jacobs stated that real nurses enjoyed her [...] "man-eating antics", and were envious that Donna got away with wearing so much make-up. She commented, [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> who has been sensitive about Donna throwing herself at men. The women I meet seem to appreciate her tactics." [...] In the aftermath of the Donna/Mickie storyline, the BBC banned its actresses from appearing in raunchy photo-shoots, after Jacobs and Adams were photographed in intimate poses while dressed in nurses uniforms for various [...] "lads' mags".|$|E

500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> like Forrest Gump {{in a movie}} before, {{and for that matter}} I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to {{describe}} him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film [...] "reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America." ...|$|E

Mels then tells Fred {{that most of the}} other members of their former gang moved on with their lives, with Bob eventually arrested and sent off to Siberia for buying illegal records from a smuggler, Dryn getting into the army, etc. They share a bottle of Jack Daniel's, after which Fred promptly reveals to Mels that there are no [...] "stilyagi" [...] in the United States, and that he has <b>never</b> <b>met</b> there <b>anyone</b> living the same lifestyle, as such flamboyant behavior and such disrespect for the laws would have had them locked up in a mental asylum in mere minutes.

60|$|So {{that it was}} a {{cultivated}} as well as an attentive {{eye that}} studied the movements of Lady Harman and an experienced ear that weighed the words and cadences of her entirely inadequate and extremely expressive share in their conversation. He had enjoyed the social advantages of a popular and presentable man of letters, and he had met a variety of ladies; but he had <b>never</b> yet <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> at all like Lady Harman. She was pretty and quite young and fresh; he doubted if she was as much as four-and-twenty; she was as simple-mannered as though she was ever so much younger than that, and dignified as though she was ever so much older; and she had a sort of lustre of wealth about her----. One met it sometimes in young richly married Jewesses, but though she was very dark she wasn't at all of that type; he was inclined to think she must be Welsh. This manifest spending of great lots of money on the richest, finest and fluffiest things was the only aspect of her that sustained the parvenu idea; and it wasn't in any way carried out by her manners, which were as modest and silent and inaggressive as the very best can be. Personally he liked opulence, he responded to countless-guinea furs....|$|R
60|$|Walter Morel seemed {{melted away}} before her. She {{was to the}} miner that thing of mystery and fascination, a lady. When she spoke to him, {{it was with a}} {{southern}} pronunciation and a purity of English which thrilled him to hear. She watched him. He danced well, as if it were natural and joyous in him to dance. His grandfather was a French refugee who had married an English barmaid--if it had been a marriage. Gertrude Coppard watched the young miner as he danced, a certain subtle exultation like glamour in his movement, and his face the flower of his body, ruddy, with tumbled black hair, and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above. She thought him rather wonderful, <b>never</b> having <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> like him. Her father was to her the type of all men. And George Coppard, proud in his bearing, handsome, and rather bitter; who preferred theology in reading, and who drew near in sympathy only to one man, the Apostle Paul; who was harsh in government, and in familiarity ironic; who ignored all sensuous pleasure:--he was very different from the miner. Gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing; she had not the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment, and had never learned even a Roger de Coverley. She was puritan, like her father, high-minded, and really stern. Therefore the dusky, golden softness of this man's sensuous flame of life, that flowed off his flesh like the flame from a candle, not baffled and gripped into incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was, seemed to her something wonderful, beyond her.|$|R

2500|$|Foucault is {{sometimes}} criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social constructionism, which some see as {{an affront to}} the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating [...] "He struck me as completely amoral, I’d <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something." ...|$|E
2500|$|Newman met actress Joanne Woodward in 1953. Shortly after filming The Long, Hot Summer in 1957, he {{divorced}} Witte. He married Woodward {{early in}} 1958. The Newmans {{moved away from}} Hollywood in the early 1960s, buying a home and starting a family in Westport, Connecticut. They {{were one of the}} very first Hollywood movie star couples to choose to raise their families outside of California. [...] They remained married for 50 years, until his death in 2008. They had three daughters: Elinor [...] "Nell" [...] Teresa (b. 1959), Melissa [...] "Lissy" [...] Stewart (b. 1961), and Claire [...] "Clea" [...] Olivia (b. 1965). Newman was well known for his devotion to his wife and family. When once asked about his reputation for fidelity, he famously quipped, [...] "Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?" [...] He also said that he <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>anyone</b> who had as much to lose as he did. In his profile on 60 minutes he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go.
