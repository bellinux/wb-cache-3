40|$|The {{distinction}} between current and <b>non-current</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> {{used in the}} presentation of financial statements has been challenged for well {{over the past two}} decades. Despite this, the distiction is still used today and appears to still have relevance. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate and determine the most appropriate method of classification of deferred tax between current and non-current in the context of the objective of financial statements. This is important as information that meets the objective of financial statements is useful to users of financial statements, and might influence their economic decisions. Furthermore, the most appropriate method of classification will have a direct impact on working capital ratios as well as other ratios in financial reporting analyses. A literature review of technical issues together with insights collected from accounting lecturers and technical partners and/or directors by way of a descriptive survey have shown that the destinction of deferred tax assets and liabilities between current and <b>non-current</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> meets the objective of financial statements. This is in terms of both the current IASB Framework as well as the proposed revised Conceptual Framework. Standard setters in the accounting arena should therefore consider the value such a distinction would add to users of financial statements. This distinction will have the biggest impact on preparers of financial statements, as information of sufficient detail would have to be readily available to enable them to provide users with more relevant information.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{financial}} reporting is a dissemination of information related to a financial position, performance and cash flows of a business entity. Tor this process to be effective, all obstacies between the entity (originator of the information) and the user of financial statements [recipient of the information) shall be removed to the greatest extent possible. Within this task, information technologies (computers, networks and dedicated software) might be employed, however, their overall efficiency {{is strongly dependent on}} the compatibility of the systems of both sides of information (originator and the recipient). Thus, even in the environment of harmonized accounting, there are certain real issues (e. g. balance sheet might be prepared under the IFRS both in the form respecting the distinction of current and <b>non-current</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> or it might tske the degree of liquidity of balance-sheet items into account in the same time). Thus, Extensible Business Related Language is a powerful instrument, because it is capable (based on relation between its general taxonomies) to tackle with these issues...|$|R
40|$|The Italian {{accounting}} standard-setter (OIC) {{issued a}} proposal {{in order to}} acknowledge the European accounting Directives 51 / 2003 and 65 / 2001. According to this proposal, the national accounting rules in the Civil Code will deeply change in the near future, reducing the gap with IFRS. This work analyses the structure {{and content of the}} statement of financial position proposed by OIC’s document. It aims to discuss the OIC’s decision to go on adopting a fixed scheme (while IFRS only provide some guidelines for its structure); the meaning of the single items in the statement of financial position; the compliance with the minimum requirements for the content of IAS 1. The article highlights that the new statement of financial position proposed by OIC is more useful to meet the information needs of external users than the present one, because of the distinction between current and <b>non-current</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> and the use of a predetermined structure. Furthermore, after having analysed in detail the content of the various items, it is possible to assert the substantial compliance with the minimum content of IAS 1. Taking into account this compliance, it would be advisable that CONSOB (National Commission for Companies and Stock Exchange) requires the listed companies to adopt the statement of financial position according to OIC’s proposal, {{in order to reduce the}} differences in the presentation of financial statements among listed companies and between these and the companies applying the Civil Code...|$|R

50|$|The {{data from}} 2014 and 2013 {{regarding}} the company's financial performance {{indicates that it}} is earning a much lower profit in 2014 (AMD 289,369,000) than in 2013 (AMD 626,922,000), primarily because of increase in administrative expenses and production costs. In addition, {{the total amount of}} assets has decreased by AMD 453,747,000 primarily {{as a result of an}} increase in accounts receivables and decrease in current investments. These patterns were accompanied by a decrease in equity amounting to AMD 109,172,000, the decrease in <b>non-current</b> <b>liabilities</b> equal to AMD 351,335,00, and increase in current liabilities equal to AMD 6,761,00. There is not enough information about the company's costs and revenues, because it is a privately owned one. However, it is apparent that company earned low profits in 2014 than in 2013.|$|E

The broad objective of the paper is to study the financial performance of the concern {{for the period of}} six years. The study is based on secondary sources of data. The secondary data has been collected from annual report of RGVN (NE) MFL. The sample size of the study is six years. The period of six years from 2010 - 11 to 2015 - 16 is known as reference period of the study. The study makes use of statistical tools such as annual growth rate (AGR) and compound annual growth rate (CAGR), Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test. The CAGR of income from operation of the concern during the study period is more as compared to other income. The hypothesis test proves that there is no significant difference between growth rate between income from operation and other income of RGVN (NE). The compound growth rate of financial expenses is higher than other expenses. The hypothesis test examines that there is no significant difference in growth rate of classification of total expenditure of RGVN (NE). The compound growth of non-current assets is less than current assets. The hypothesis test examines that there is no significant difference between growth rate between non-current assets and current assets of RGVN (NE). The CAGR of current liabilities is higher than <b>non-current</b> <b>liabilities.</b> The hypothesis test proves that there is no significant difference between growth rate of <b>non-current</b> <b>liabilities</b> and current liabilities of concer...|$|E

For Europe, which is commonly considered as the greenest of the three major markets, similar research is lacking. This paper seeks to fill this gap by empirically investigating business and financial characteristics, stakeholder pressures and public policies to distinguish companies that have implemented the European Eco-Management and Audit System (EMAS) from a unique firm-level dataset of European publicly quoted companies. We find that the EMAS participation decision is positively influenced by the solvency ratio, the share of <b>non-current</b> <b>liabilities,</b> the average labour cost and the absolute company size as well as the relative size of a company compared to its sector average. The profit margin exerts a negative influence. We further find that companies whose headquarters is located in a country that actively encourages EMAS have a higher probability of participation. Finally, this paper suggests that rather than attracting other kinds of companies, a favourable institutional context succeeds in convincing more of the same kind of companies to participate.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{environmental}} liabilities, this study aimed to analyze the impact of CPC 25 in recognition and disclosure of environmental provisions and contingent their reflections in the debt of the companies studied. Therefore, we investigated the behavior of balances related to environmental provisions and debt indicators in the period 2006 - 2014, 90 % of high environmental impact companies listed on the BM & FBovespa, comparatively {{before and after the}} adoption of this pronouncement technician. It was found evidence of increased companies disclosed this information, with greater representation in <b>non-current</b> <b>liabilities,</b> although, in general, these are unrepresentative items of the equity of the entity. However, the quantitative increase in the recognition of environmental liabilities when analyzed from the perspective of debt indicators, no significant statistical difference. The results counter the expected increase in debt ratios due to the presence of regulating environmental liabilities. In addition, it is clear that despite the regulations, uncertainty and complexity in the measurement of contingent liabilities, coupled with the discretion of the manager as the judgment of the environmental contingent liability as probable or possible (which determines its accounting or not) can also contribute to understand the results of this study...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{research}} {{on the characteristics of}} environmentally responsive companies has focussed almost exclusively on US and Japanese firms. For Europe, which is commonly considered as the greenest of the three major developed economic markets, similar research is lacking. This paper seeks to fill this gap by empirically investigating the business and financial characteristics, stakeholder pressure and public policies distinguishing companies that have implemented the European Eco-Management and Audit System (EMAS) and those that have not using a unique firm-level dataset of European publicly quoted companies. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First of all, the decision to implement EMAS has not been widely analysed. Secondly, we focus on European firms which allows us to assess if and to what extent European firms behave like their US or Japanese counterparts. We find that the EMAS participation decision is positively influenced by the solvency ratio, the share of <b>non-current</b> <b>liabilities</b> and the average labour cost. Also, two measures of company size are positively associated with EMAS participation: both the absolute company size as well as the relative size of a company compared to its sector average. The profit margin on the other hand exerts a negative influence according to our results. We further show that public policy can heavily influence the EMAS participation decision: companies whose headquarters is located in a member state that actively encourages EMAS have a higher probability of participation.
