40|$|Abstract: Individualized <b>notification</b> {{service is}} a hotspot of {{research}} on Service-oriented digital library, {{and one of the}} key problems of the realization of digital library. Based on the investigation and analysis of the research of <b>notification</b> service, We have concluded four modules of <b>notification</b> service in the service-oriented digital library: the basic <b>notification</b> service module, the <b>notification</b> service module with event channel, the <b>notification</b> service module with event agent and the <b>notification</b> service module with multi-agent. According to the reality of current practices in service, we have researched the architectures, main technique points and methods of these four <b>notification</b> service modules under the framework of web service and information grid.

40|$|We study a {{voluntary}} pre-merger <b>notification</b> game under asymmetric information and characterize perfect Bayesian equilibria. It is {{shown that the}} equilibrium outcomes {{are similar to those}} when <b>notification</b> is compulsory. However, thanks to the signaling opportunity that arises when <b>notification</b> is voluntary, voluntary <b>notification</b> leads to lower enforcement costs for the regulator and lower <b>notification</b> costs for the merging parties. Some of the theoretical predictions are supported by exploratory empirical tests using merger data from Australia where pre-merger <b>notification</b> is voluntary. Overall, our results suggest that voluntary merger <b>notification</b> may achieve objectives similar to those achieved by compulsory systems at lower costs to the parties {{as well as to the}} regulator.

In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides <b>notifications</b> for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of <b>notifications.</b> Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

5|$|Although the Annapolis Convention {{saw only}} about a dozen delegates attend, {{representing}} only five states, it called for a meeting {{to be held in}} Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three <b>notifications</b> of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).|$|E
