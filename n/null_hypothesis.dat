5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson statistic for testing the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{the only}} {{hypothesis}} {{that needs to}} be specified in this test and which embodies the counter-claim {{is referred to as the}} <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (that is, the hypothesis to be nullified). A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is assumed to be true. The rejection of the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> However, unless there is a single alternative to the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> the rejection of <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> does not tell us which of the alternatives might be the correct one.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{approach is to}} test a <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> against an alternative hypothesis. A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The probability of type I error is therefore {{the probability that the}} estimator belongs to the critical region given that <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> when the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is false.|$|E

25|$|Fallacy of the {{transposed}} conditional, aka prosecutor's fallacy: criticisms arise {{because the}} hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis)</b> to be favored, since {{what is being}} evaluated is probability of the observed result given the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> and not probability of the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian inference, although it requires establishing a prior probability.|$|E
25|$|In {{statistic}}s, when a p-value {{is used as}} a {{test statistic}} for a simple <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> and the distribution of the test statistic is continuous, then the p-value is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 if the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is true.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how {{likely it is that}} we would observe 10 counts per minute if the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> were true. If the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that the suitcase is compatible with the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E
30|$|The main <b>hypotheses</b> are the <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> {{that states}} {{there is no}} {{difference}} between using or not the GO 2 S process.

40|$|A popular {{framework}} for false discovery control is the random effects {{model in which}} the <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> {{are assumed to be}} independent. This paper generalizes the random effects model to a conditional dependence model which allows dependence between <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> The dependence can be useful to characterize the spatial structure of the <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> Asymptotic properties of false discovery proportions and numbers of rejected hypotheses are explored and a large-sample distributional theory is obtained. 1.

The power of the proposed estimator to detect the full proportion of false <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> is discussed and compared to other estimators.

25|$|A typeII error {{occurs when}} failing to detect an effect (adding {{fluoride}} to toothpaste protects against cavities) that is present.

25|$|The p-value {{is used in}} {{the context}} of <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> testing in order to {{quantify}} the idea of statistical significance of evidence. <b>Null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> testing is a reductio ad absurdum argument adapted to statistics.

30|$|Many {{adaptive}} {{hypothesis testing}} procedures rely on {{estimates of the}} proportion of true <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> in the initial pool using plugins, a single step, in multiple steps, or asymptotically [4]. Plug-in procedures use {{an estimate of the}} proportion of true <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> [15]. Thresholding-based multiple testing procedures, reject hypotheses with p-values less than a threshold [15]. Storey and Tibshirani [22] have proposed a strategy that assigns each hypothesis an individual measure of significance in terms of expected FDR called q-value. Most q-value based strategies rely on some estimate of the proportion of true <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> that {{assert the}} {{equality}} of effect {{of two or more}} alternative treatments, for example, a drug and a placebo, are used to reduce scientific claims based on statistical noise.

5000|$|BH-{{procedure}} is a step-up procedure {{iterating over}} [...] <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> tested and , their ordered p-values in an increasing order.

25|$|If the {{probability}} of obtaining a result as extreme as the one obtained, supposing that the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> were true, is lower than a pre-specified cut-off probability (for example, 5%), then the result {{is said to be}} statistically significant and the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} example, if a <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{is assumed to}} follow the {{standard}} normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is not normal, {{depending on the type}} of test performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E

25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used. First, {{one wants to}} know if the estimated regression equation is any better than simply predicting that all values of the response variable equal its sample mean (if not, it is said to have no explanatory power). The <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has explanatory power, is accepted. Otherwise, the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of no explanatory power is accepted.|$|E
25|$|The typeI {{error rate}} or {{significance}} level is {{the probability of}} rejecting the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> given that it is true. It is denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha) and is also called the alpha level. Often, the significance level is set to 0.05 (5%), implying that it is acceptable to have a 5% probability of incorrectly rejecting the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Second, {{for each}} {{explanatory}} variable of interest, {{one wants to}} know whether its estimated coefficient differs significantly from zero—that is, whether this particular explanatory variable in fact has explanatory power in predicting the response variable. Here the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that the true coefficient is zero. This hypothesis is tested by computing the coefficient's t-statistic, as {{the ratio of the}} coefficient estimate to its standard error. If the t-statistic is larger than a predetermined value, the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected and the variable is found to have explanatory power, with its coefficient significantly different from zero. Otherwise, the <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of a zero value of the true coefficient is accepted.|$|E
