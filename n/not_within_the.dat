5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were <b>not</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of private {{buildings on the}} boulevards and surrounding areas took place later.

The high prices of the land (expected to finance part of the construction costs) and the high rents were <b>not</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> means of the lower classes. Life in apartments was no longer desirable for residents of Brussels, who preferred to live in single family homes. The buildings constructed by private citizens had difficulty finding buyers.|$|E
5|$|The three athletes {{that were}} {{selected}} {{to compete in the}} London Games were Maoulida Darouèche in the men's 400 metres hurdles and Feta Ahamada in the women's 100 metres. Swimmer Ayouba Ali Sihame qualified for the Games via a universality place awarded by FINA for the women's 100 metre freestyle as her best time of one minute and 21.54 seconds was <b>not</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> standard entry time. Ahamada was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony and Darouèche held it for the closing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Although NFL rules {{generally}} require {{wide receivers}} to wear jersey {{numbers in the}} 10-19 and 80-89 range, players who later change positions are allowed to keep their previous number, {{as long as it}} is <b>not</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> 50-79 range for eligible receiver purposes. Hester was allowed to keep number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two wide receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Ayouba Ali Sihame was the {{youngest}} competitor to be selected by Comoros at the London Games, aged 17. She qualified after receiving a universality place by FINA as her best time of one minute and 21.54 seconds was <b>not</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> standard entry time. Sihame was drawn in the first heat of the women's 100 metre freestyle, which was held on 1 August, finishing third (and last) in her heat {{with a time of}} one minute and 14.40 seconds. She finished behind the heat winner Mareme Faye from Senegal (one minute and 6.42 seconds) and second-placed swimmer Shreya Dhital of Nepal (one minute and 10.80 seconds). Sihame finished 48 (and last) of all swimmers who competed, and did not advance to the later stages of the women's 100 metre freestyle.|$|E
5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is <b>not</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
5|$|The seven athletes {{that were}} {{selected}} {{to compete in the}} London Games were Gerald Phiri in the men's 100 metres, Prince Mumba in the men's 800 metres and Chauzje Choosha in the women's 100 metres. Choosha qualified via a wildcard and replaced long-distance runner Tonny Wamulwa who withdrew before the opening of the Games because of injuries sustained in a road traffic accident on 9 July. Swimmers Zane Jordan and Jade Ashleigh Howard qualified for the Games via a universality place awarded by FINA as their best times of 59.33 and one minute and 1.24 seconds were <b>not</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> standard entry time. Judo Boas Munyonga qualified for the men's 81 kg event after being awarded an additional place in the additional places category for the African continent by the International Judo Federation. Boxer Gilbert Choombe qualified for the men's light welterweight following the conclusion of the AIBA African Olympic Qualifying Event.|$|E
