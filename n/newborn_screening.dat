5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have <b>newborn</b> <b>screening</b> programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used <b>newborn</b> <b>screening</b> test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To observe and describe the reality of national <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> programs in Brazil, and to evaluate {{if they can be}} referred to as having quality indicators. METHODS: Integrative literature review in databases such as MEDLINE, LILACS, SciELO, and Google. RESULTS: 22 articles were analyzed in relation to <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> coverage, the place and period <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> was performed, initial results, referral to diagnostic procedures, loss to follow-up, and occurrence of hearing loss. CONCLUSION: Transient otoacoustic emissions were the most often used screening methodology. Coverage varied widely, and only a few maternity wards achieved 95 % of the cases screened. Referral to diagnostic procedures was under 4 %, but lack of adherence can be considered a barrier to successful follow-up. The occurrence of hearing loss ranged from 0 % to 1. 09 %.

40|$|Background: <b>Newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> is {{currently}} replacing the health visitor distraction test (HVDT) conducted at eight months.

Objective: To compare the impact on maternal anxiety and satisfaction of recall following <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> and the HVDT. Methods: Four groups participated: 27 mothers of babies receiving a satisfactory result and 21 mothers of babies recalled after the HVDT 26 mothers of babies receiving a satisfactory result and 16 mothers of babies recalled after <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening.</b> Questionnaires assessing maternal anxiety, worry and certainty about the babies' hearing, satisfaction with and attitudes towards the screening test were sent to mothers three weeks and six months following screening. Results: Comparison of the effects of receipt of different results showed no significant differences in maternal anxiety, worry and certainty between the two tests. Those mothers whose babies had a <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> test were significantly more satisfied, regardless of the result received.

25|$|Newborn screening: <b>Newborn</b> <b>screening</b> is used {{just after}} birth to {{identify}} genetic disorders {{that can be}} treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth {{and sent to the}} lab for analysis. In the United States, <b>newborn</b> <b>screening</b> procedure varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in kids and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. <b>Newborn</b> <b>screening</b> can detect the presence of PKU, allowing kids to get put on a special diet right away to avoid the effects of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH detectable in childhood is about 1 in 15,000 births. The severe salt-wasting form {{accounts for the}} majority of these cases, which is high enough that many states and countries routinely include it in mandated <b>newborn</b> <b>screening</b> tests. The {{incidence of}} simple virilizing CAH is about 1 in 60,000 children.|$|E
25|$|Information {{gained from}} further {{research}} {{in the role of}} GJB2 variants in hearing loss may lead to consisted <b>newborn</b> <b>screening</b> for them.

Knowing genetic information may also help in the treatment of other diseases if a patient is already at risk.|$|E
40|$|<b>Newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> {{programs}} have been implemented in many countries because {{it was thought that}} the earlier permanent childhood hearing impairment is detected, the less developmentally disadvantaged children would become. To date, however, no strong evidence exists for universal introduction of <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening.</b> To study the effect of <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> vs distraction hearing screening, conducted at 9 months of age, on development, spoken communication, and quality of life. Between 2002 and 2006, all 65 regions in The Netherlands replaced distraction hearing <b>screening</b> with <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening.</b> Consequently, the type of hearing screening offered was based on availability at the place and date of birth and was independent of developmental prognoses of individual children. All children born in The Netherlands between 2003 and 2005 were included. At the age of 3 to 5 years, all children with permanent childhood hearing impairment were identified. Evaluation ended December 2009. Performance (education and spoken and signed communication), development (general and language), and quality of life. During the study period, 335, 560 children were born in a <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> region and 234, 826 children in a distraction hearing screening region. At follow-up, 263 children in <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> regions (0. 78 per 1000 children) and 171 children in distraction hearing screening regions (0. 73 per 1000 children) had been diagnosed with permanent childhood hearing impairment. Three hundred one children (69. 4 %) participated in analysis of general performance measures. There was no difference between groups in the primary mode of communication or type of education. Analysis of extensive developmental outcomes included 80 children born in <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> regions and 70 in distraction hearing screening regions. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that overall, children in <b>newborn</b> hearing <b>screening</b> regions had higher developmental outcome scores compared with children in distraction hearing screening regions (Wilks λ = 0. 79; F(12) = 2. 705; P =. 003).
