50|$|Useful for its {{strength}} as a supporting member, {{and its ability}} to form a relatively tight seal when lapped, shiplap is usually used as a type of siding for buildings that do not require extensive maintenance and must withstand cold and aggressive climates. Rough-sawn shiplap is attached vertically in post and beam construction, usually with 6d-8d common <b>nails,</b> while <b>milled</b> versions, providing a tighter seal, are more commonly placed horizontally, more suited to two-by-four frame construction.|$|R
50|$|Reclaimed lumber {{sometimes}} has {{pieces of}} metal embedded in it, such as broken off <b>nails,</b> so <b>milling</b> the material can often ruin planer knives, saw blades, and moulder knives. Nail-compatible saw blades are advisable for the same reason, {{as well as for}} safety. The alternative is to remove all metal from the reclaimed lumber, which is a costly and tedious process commonly achieved by scanning each piece of wood with a metal detector and then manually pulling out all nails, bolts, bullets, screws, buckshot, and other miscellaneous metal hardware. This process can make the cost of reclaimed lumber higher than new lumber.|$|R
50|$|Benner Township {{was settled}} in 1793 with the {{establishment}} of an iron furnace. It is named for General Phillip Benner who built the furnace along Spring Creek near the settlement of Rock. Benner built a <b>nail</b> <b>mill</b> and slitting mill in the area as well.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the mills}} on the Stour were {{formerly}} concerned {{in the iron}} industry. Whittington, near Kinver, had a forge and then a slitting mill, and finally a <b>nail</b> <b>mill.</b> Mills were converted from one use to another, as demand fluctuated: fulling mills of the 16th century, often became forges or slitting mills in the 17th. The 17th century iron industry along the Stour and its tributaries is connected {{with the name of}} Dud Dudley (an illegitimate son of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley) who carried out early experiments, using coal products to substitute for charcoal in iron production and wrote a book, Metallum Martis. The Dudley family had works at Cradley. The Foley family were much more important in the later 17th century and the Knight family in the 18th. Iron production continued well into the 19th century (occasionally, even later), but the valley was overshadowed by the coke-based industry on the Black Country plateau.|$|E
50|$|The Duluth Works {{primary purpose}} was to build steel for the {{expanding}} Midwest prairies and far west plains. When first constructed, it was originally intended to build rails for the expanding railroads, {{but by the time}} the mill was completed in 1915, the railroads had already reached their peak of construction and it was felt that those needs could best be handled from the Chicago area. So after completing its rail mill, it was converted into billet finishing facilities. In 1922, after going over what products would best serve the plant's existence, U.S. Steel decided to expand its Morgan Park operation and built a new wire, rod, <b>Nail</b> <b>mill,</b> and fence post fabrication facility. These products, it was felt, best suited Duluth's capabilities for integrated steel production. Yet, even after the expansion of these facilities, the Duluth Works only consumed 20% of its own steel production for its finished products. The rest of its semi-finished steel was shipped to other facilities for finishing. Even more disheartening, its proposed 12 state market area and areas of Canada were sparsely populated and able to be supplied with products from other mills. Despite these early predictions, Minnesota Steel remained at work producing steel products right up to its very end. Some of its products were only produced within the U.S. Steel Corporation at the Duluth Works facility. These included steel wool, certain nails, fence and fence post and a new product introduced in 1954, welded wire fabric, primarily for use with concrete to produce more sturdy road construction. Some of this material was used to produce missile silos for the U.S. Air Forces' Strategic Air Command throughout the Midwest.|$|E
50|$|It was {{chartered}} on October 27, 1779, to Ebenezer Allen and 76 associates, {{and first}} settled the same year. The township originally included West Haven, which was {{set off on}} October 20, 1792. The post office at Fair Haven was established in 1797. In 1783, Colonel Matthew Lyon moved to Fair Haven and began building mills at the falls on the Castleton River. His enterprises included a gristmill, sawmill and papermill, {{in addition to a}} forge, as well as a newspaper, the Fair Haven Gazette. This began Fair Haven's legacy as a small, prosperous mill town, which by 1859 included a marble <b>mill,</b> rolling <b>mill,</b> <b>nail</b> factory, papermill producing wall paper, three sawmills, a wagon shop, a machine shop, two blacksmith shops, and two shoe shops.|$|R
40|$|The Agawam River {{is in the}} Buzzards Bay Watershed. The Buzzards Bay Watershed {{includes}} lakes, rivers, streams, {{wetlands and}} ground water which drain into Buzzards Bay. The Agawam River begins at Halfway Pond in Plymouth and flows downstream into the Wareham River estuary into Buzzards Bay. The Agawam River is a notable contributor of freshwater and nutrients to the Wareham River estuary. The Agawam River is notable also, because it receives discharges from the Wareham Water Pollution Control Facility. Land use surrounding the Agawam River includes less residential land than parts of the Wareham River, although there are several cottage establishments at ponds of the Agawam River. New housing developments are currently being built that may impact the Agawam River. Currently, there are many cranberry bogs and roads that follow the same path as the Agawam River. There are schools, businesses, and the Water Pollution Control Facility. Historically, the river welcomed along its banks, grist <b>mills,</b> <b>nail</b> <b>mills,</b> cotton and fulling mills, farmland, some settlements and many people who fished its abundant waters. Our study included two sites; upstream-the off Glen Charlie site, and downstream-the Minot Avenue site. In developing our study question, we wondered if the changes in seasons affected water quality {{and if there was}} an impact on the herring running upstream to Halfway Pond in the spring to spawn. We thought about leaves falling from the trees in the fall, road salt from the winter, melting ice in the spring, and fertilizer run-off. We wondered if we would find detrimental impacts from the river to the aquatic, animal and bird habitats at the river. We also discussed several contributing considerations in our study, such as; our study sites were upstream of the Water Pollution Control Facility, the effects of the tide, and brackish water. We intended to study Nitrogen, Phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, river velocity and macroinvertebrates. Inability, at the time, to test salt water resulted in Nitrogen as being below detection level. We found higher levels of Phosphorus in the Minot Avenue site and in the Glen Charlie site in the Fall, but more in the Minot Avenue. Our early Spring samples had lower levels of Phosphorus than our late Spring samples. Our discussion about these findings is that we believe Phosphorus levels were higher in the Fall because of the flooding of cranberry bogs that is done in the Fall after harvesting. The higher Phosphorus findings in the late Spring could be possible fertilizer run-off. In studying river velocity, we were able to calculate discharge per day and Phosphorus load. The following is discharge per day, which is not in our Presentation: Minot Ave. November: 2, 812, 320 cf/ 24 hours March: 2, 416, 608 cf/ 24 hours Off Glen Charlie November: 971, 136 cf/ 24 hours March: 1, 219, 795 cf/ 24 hours It is possible that flow was more abundant at Off Glen Charlie in March because the water fall upstream was opened; in November, it was closed. Our goal is to continue testing the river and do Nitrogen and coliform sampling. Our River coloring book and brochure will be in the Bourne and Wareham Libraries this summer...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Parker Mills was {{constructed}} by shipwrights as a cotton mill. During the War of 1812, it was partially burned by the British.

50|$|The Third (Baker's) Falls were, by far, {{the most}} industrious of the four. The first {{buildings}} — a grist mill, a carding mill and a <b>nail</b> <b>mill</b> — {{went up in}} 1805 between Bridge Street and East Elm Street {{on the east side}} of the river. A fulling mill followed in 1830. The Yarmouth Paper Company, which produced paper pulp, was built in 1864. The main access road to it was an extended version of today's Mill Street, off Main Street. Ten years later, S.D. Warren & Company bought it and renamed it the Forest Paper Company. Beginning with a single wooden building, the facility expanded to ten buildings covering as many acres, including a span over the river to Factory Island. Two bridges to it were also constructed. In 1909, it was the largest soda fiber mill in the world, employing 275 people. The mill used 15,000 cords of poplar each year, which meant mounds of logs were constantly in view beside Mill Street. Six railroad spurs extended from the tracks running behind Main Street to the Forest Paper Company, traversing today's Royal River Park. Rail cars delivered logs, coal, soda and chlorine to the mill and carried pulp away. The mill closed in 1923, when import restrictions on pulp were lifted and Swedish pulp became a cheaper option. The mill burned in 1931, leaving charred remains on the site until the development of the Royal River Park in the early 1980s. In 1971, the Marine Corps Reserve tore down the old factory, before a Navy demolition team used fourteen cases of dynamite to raze the remains. Most of the remaining debris was crushed and used as fill for the park but several remnants of the building are still visible today.|$|E
50|$|Tremont Nail Factory District is a {{historic}} district at 21 Elm Street in Wareham, Massachusetts. It makes up the area occupied by the former Tremont Nail Company.

5000|$|The Joppa Iron Works {{were on the}} Great Gunpowder {{not quite}} a mile from its embouchure and near Divers Island.

40|$|According to {{the present}} Drug Report of Germany, it is apparent, that the {{addiction}} to illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals {{is a major problem}} in western society. Drug abuse was not only result in consequences for the person themselves; there could also be other people affected. Their own children or traffic participants are at risk of drug users. Furthermore, pain killers that are commonly used and easily available over the counter add to an increased risk of side effects. Hair analysis has become a routine technique for the retrospective detection of contact to illicit drugs in driving ability examination or for example {{in the context of a}} custody case. Hair analysis has been proven to be particularly suitable for these tasks due to the long time window of drug detection for up to 6 month. The detection of prior drug intake could also be helpful for therapeutic drug monitoring. Hair samples are often analyzed as part of a postmortem investigation, as their analysis could reveal further information to blood analysis about potential drug addiction. The aim of this research project was to use hair analysis in different fields of application. The first study investigated the correlation between chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and gastrointestinal lesions by analyzing blood and hair samples from postmortem cases. In addition, hair analysis was used for the retrospective detection of illicit drugs in hair samples from parents/caregivers and children. Furthermore, markers of coca chewing are desired for the discrimination between chewing of coca leaves and abuse of cocaine. The two natural coca alkaloids hygrine and cuscohygrine were tested and it could be shown, that they might be suitable markers for this task. By analyzing material of different steps of cocaine production, it was investigated in which steps the two alkaloids are separated from cocaine. A further research project was done to verify the usefulness of nails as an alternative technique to hair analysis. This alternative technique may be used for toxicological investigations in cases where no hair is available. Method validation was performed according to the guidelines of the German Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry (GTFCh) for the detection of NSAID by the use of LC-quadrupole time of flight-MS (LC-QTOF-MS). Corpses with gastrointestinal lesions were selected for the case group (n = 132) and those without any lesions were placed into the control group (n = 136). Blood samples from all cases were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. No significant discrimination between case and control group could be achieved by the blood analysis. In contrast, the hair analysis showed a significant difference between the case and the control group. Out of the case group 76 % were tested positive for one or more NSAIDs while only 38 % of the hair samples from the control group included one or more NSAIDs. Results from blood analysis indicated that most of the deceased with gastrointestinal lesions, which were discovered by autopsy, did not consume NSAIDs near to the time of death. In contrast, hair analysis showed the influence of long-term use of NSAIDs on gastrointestinal lesions in hair samples from postmortem cases. Proton pump inhibitors were rarely detected in hair samples. Rare incorporation into hair may be the reason for this. For the discrimination between traditional chewing of coca leaves and illegal cocaine use two potential markers were established. The aim of this study was to clarify in which steps of the illegal cocaine production hygrine and cuscohygrine are lost. Analyses of the coca leaves, different extraction steps and cocapaste were done by LC-triple quadrupole-MS (LC-QQQ-MS). It could be shown, that hygrine and cuscohygrine are lost in the first steps of the illegal cocaine production due to poor extraction with kerosene. In addition to this, the concentration changes of cocaine, cinnamolycocaine, tropacocaine and ecgonine methylester were also estimated by analyzing the different extraction steps of the cocaine production. Based on these results, hygrine and cuscohygrine fulfill the conditions as markers for coca chewing. Between 2011 and 2014 hair samples from parents/caregivers and children were collected for the detection of the use or ambulatory with illicit drugs. In summary, 388 hair samples from children and 594 hair samples from parents/caregivers were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Hair samples from children were only tested in case of positive hair samples from the parents/caregivers. The hair samples were for cocaine, methadone, opiates, amphetamines, ecstasy, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. Cannabinoids were analyzed by GC-MS and all the other drugs by LC-MS/MS. To clarify the cooperation from the parents/caregivers, a follow-up hair tests were done after 6 or 12 month. This study could estimate, that the hair samples of the children often showed a similar or the same drug profile as their parents. Hair analysis of children is a sensitive indicator of the handling of drugs in their environment and to estimate the best interests of the child. Between 2011 - 2014 hair samples from children (n = 296) were tested positive for different illicit drugs, e. g. methadone, heroin, cocaine and delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The hair testing of the children revealed no drugs in 80 hair samples. Finally, hair analysis was proven to be a very efficient working instrument for the estimation of the best interests of the child. The usefulness of nails as an alternative technique to hair was tested in two further projects. In the first study, 70 hair and nail samples from postmortem cases were analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS. In the second study hair and nail segments from corpses were analyzed by LC-QQQ-MS after method validation according to the GTFCh guidelines. The extraction of hair and nail samples was done for 2 x 18 hours. Deceased with a promising case history, e. g. known drug addiction were selected for this work. The samples were measured in auto MS/MS mode for the qualitative screening by LC-QTOF-MS after the extraction steps. In summary, 89 substances were detected by the general unknown screening. Most frequently detected substances were metoprolol, acetaminophen and metoclopramide in hair and nail samples in the first study. In the second study, nail and hair samples from 7 corpses were segmented and the concentration of drugs were determined by LC-QQQ-MS. Based on the results of this work, concentrations of drugs are not comparable in hair and nail segments. Due to this, concentration ratios of selected analytes and their metabolites were calculated. Similar concentration ratios for MDA/MDMA, EDDP/methadone and bisnortilidine/nortilidine were estimated. Similar concentration ratios may indicate equal incorporation ways into hair and <b>nail</b> matrix. By <b>milling</b> hair and <b>nail</b> samples, concentration loss could be explained. In addition, analyte losses could be observed due to sample preparation. Routinely, hair samples are only cut into small pieces before extraction. Case 5 showed increased concentration of 6 -MAM in milled hair sample in contrast to the hair sample, which further research is needed concerning nail sample preparation. Nail analysis was confirmed as a useful retrospective technique for the detection of previous drug intake. The analyses of nail and hair samples showed strong correlation to the case history and the drug incorporation in hair and nail samples seem to be comparable. The qualitative results from the general unknown screening showed only slight differences between hair and nail analysis. Based on the findings from the second study, main mechanisms of drug incorporation into nails may be via blood during the formation of the nail plate by the germinal matrix, via sweat and by external contamination. In conclusion, the results of this research work could show the usefulness of hair analysis for different fields of application. Furthermore, nails could be proven to incorporate substances similar to hair and therefore be used as an alternative technique in the retrospective detection of drug intake in cases where no hair is available...|$|R
