40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{describe}} {{cases of}} peripheral neuropathy associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection without mixed cryoglobulinaemia.  METHODS—Four cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection with persistent negativity of mixed cryoglobulinaemia were found.  RESULTS—All patients had small increases of transaminase levels {{and a positive}} viraemia. Liver biopsy showed chronic active hepatitis {{in all but one}} case (Knodell 4 - 9, Metavir A 0 F 0 -A 3 F 3). <b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsy</b> showed axonal neuropathy associated with lymphoid infiltrates around small vessels in two cases. Rheumatoid factor was always negative and C 4 complement level was always normal. In three patients, neuropathy improved with interferon α, interferon α + ursodesoxycholic acid, or steroids + plasma exchange.  CONCLUSION—Peripheral neuropathy may be associated with hepatitis C virus infection without mixed cryoglobulinaemia. ...|$|E
40|$|Waldenström’s disease (WD) is {{frequently}} {{associated with a}} predominantly sensory neuropathy with a progressive course due to the monoclonal IgM activity against Myelin Associated Glycoprotein (MAG). However, neurolymphomatosis or chronic demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (CDIP) may occur in some patients with WD. Case report We report a case of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia in an adult male presenting with cranial nerve palsy and rapidly progressive asymmetric polyneuropathy. Intravenous IgM treatment that provided transient amelioration {{was followed by a}} relapse involving tetraparesis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, medullar magnetic resonance imaging, and electrophysiological studies led to equivocal findings suggesting the presence of either neurolymphomatosis or CIDP. Finally, sural nerve biopsy results supported the diagnosis of CIDP, which then received appropriate treatment. Conclusion In patients with WD, the possible occurrence of CIDP should be investigated with a <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsy</b> when other investigations are equivocal since the disease calls for a specific treatment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsies</b> were {{obtained}} in 10 patients with traumatic spinal cord lesions {{at various levels}} and in one patient with cerebral lesions due to a long-lasting coma. In all cases, there was a rapid onset of atrophy of both fiber types, with numerous transmissional type III and intermediate fibers. Only the two patients with cervical lesions had an increased terminal innervation ratio suggesting denervation. Our observations {{do not support the}} hypothesis of a transneuronal degeneration. These changes cannot be related to disuse only as the atrophy does not preferentially involve type II fibers. The underlying neural mechanism of spasticity in muscle of patients with cortico-spinal lesions could explain the change of the histochemical pattern of the muscle fibers.

40|$|The functional, or true {{terminal}} innervation ratio (TIR) {{was estimated}} on 13 <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsies</b> taken from 5 palmaris longus and 7 tibialis anterior muscles in 7 male and 6 female healthy young volunteers. Axonal ramification {{resulting in the}} innervation of more than 1 muscle fibre by 1 subterminal axon occurs in 10. 6 % {{of the total number}} of axons studied. Most of the branching axons (94 %) innervate 2 muscle fibres. Only 5. 1 of them supply 3 muscle fibres by trifurcation. Innervation of 4 muscle fibres by 1 ramified subterminal axon is extremely rare and was observed in 0. 9 % of branching fibres, i. e. in 0. 1 % of all axons studied. There is no significant difference between the TIR of palmaris longus and that of tibialis anterior, nor between the values obtained in males and females. A mean TIR of 1. 12 was obtained (range 1. 05 - 1. 20). Statistical analysis indicates that values higher than 1. 25 are outside the normal range of distribution. © 1973.

40|$|<b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsies</b> {{were taken}} from palmaris longus in 5 healthy young male volunteers. Measurements were made of muscle fibre {{cross-sectional}} area, of synaptic area and of the terminal innervation ratio. Marked differences in mean cross-sectional area of the muscle fibres, extending from 2832 to 4854 μ 2 were observed {{which could not be}} correlated with either the height and weight of the subject, or with their customary physical activity. Mean values for synaptic area extended from 177. 4 to 224. 9 μ 2, and there was a proportionality between this figure and the mean cross-sectional area of the muscle fibres. Statistical analysis of the frequency distribution curve for muscle fibre cross-sectional area and synaptic area established that they correspond to a normal or a logarithmic-normal distribution. There is no indication of a heterogeneity of muscle fibres and of end-plate populations, as far as their dimensions are concerned. Collateral branching occurs in 7. 3 - 18. 4 % of the motor axons and more than one bifurcation along these fibres is exceptional. The pooled terminal innervation ratio of 1. 12 1 is very near to the value previously considered to be normal. © 1970. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{cases of}} two {{patients}} with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia associated with periarteritis nodosa-like, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody negative, systemic vasculitis, are reported.    A 61  year old man was admitted with fever, diffuse myalgia, and abdominal pain. Blood and bone marrow examination showed chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Vasculitis of the gall bladder was responsible for acalculous cholecystitis. A massive spontaneous bilateral perirenal haemorrhage occurred. A 73  year old woman with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia had been followed up for one year when unexplained fever occurred. Two months after the onset of fever, sudden abdominal pain was ascribed to spontaneous bilateral renal haematoma related to bilateral renal arterial aneurysms. <b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsy</b> showed non-necrotising periarteriolar inflammation.    To our knowledge, systemic vasculitis has never been reported in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. In our two cases a non-random association is suggested because (a) chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia is a rare myelodysplastic syndrome, (b) spontaneous bilateral perirenal haematoma is not a usual feature of periarteritis nodosa. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMutations in GFPT 1 (glutamine-fructose- 6 -phosphate {{transaminase}} 1), {{a gene encoding}} {{an enzyme}} involved in glycosylation of ubiquitous proteins, cause a limb-girdle congenital myasthenic syndrome (LG-CMS) with tubular aggregates (TAs) characterized predominantly by affection of the proximal skeletal muscles and presence of highly organized and remodeled sarcoplasmic tubules in patients’ muscle biopsies. We report here the first long-term clinical follow-up of 11 French individuals suffering from LG-CMS with TAs due to GFPT 1 mutations, of which nine are new. Our retrospective clinical evaluation stresses an evolution toward a myopathic weakness that occurs concomitantly to ineffectiveness of usual CMS treatments. Analysis of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsies</b> from three unrelated individuals demonstrates that the maintenance of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is dramatically impaired with loss of post-synaptic junctional folds and evidence of denervation–reinnervation processes affecting the three main NMJ components. Moreover, molecular analyses of the human muscle biopsies confirm glycosylation defects of proteins with reduced O-glycosylation and show reduced sialylation of transmembrane proteins in extra-junctional area. Altogether, these results {{pave the way for}} understanding the etiology of this rare neuromuscular disorder that may be considered as a “tubular aggregates myopathy with synaptopathy”...|$|R

40|$|Localized {{scleroderma}} {{is characterized}} by idiopathic fibrosis of the skin and adjacent structures, and muscle involvement occurs predominantly in deep morphea. We report a patient with linear scleroderma who presented with slowly progressive atrophy, muscle weakness, and loss of function of her right arm, mimicking a <b>neuromuscular</b> disorder. Muscle <b>biopsy</b> eventually revealed zones of myositis, compatible with morphea profunda. Morphea profunda may thus present as a neuromuscular mimic, even in case of nonprogressive skin sclerosis. Myositis in morphea profunda is generally limited to one region, whereas inflammatory myopathies generally cause diffuse proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. Furthermore, skin changes in morphea profunda differ from those seen in dermatomyositis, and histological features of muscle biopsy can further distinguish between morphea profunda and inflammatory myopathies. Muscle biopsy in morphea profunda implies the risk of sampling error, whereas results of electromyography and muscle imaging might better represent the extent of muscle inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{summarize}} the clinical features and neuropathological characteristics {{in patients with}} vasculitic peripheral neuropathy (VPN). Methods Clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsy</b> characteristics of 11 patients with VPN were retrospectively analyzed. The lesion of nerve, muscle and skin was observed under optical and electron microscope. Immunohistochemical analyses were carried out to detect neurofilament (NF), myelin basic protein (MBP), peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP 22) and S- 100 protein (S- 100) and further observing the neuropathy of neuraxon, myelin sheath and Schwann cells, and to detect human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), CD 68, CD 3 and CD 20 to observe inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the deposition of IgA, IgM, IgG and addiment C 3 on vascular wall. The staining of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), NADH-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) and modified Gomori trichrome (MGT) were used to judge the myopathy. Results 1) Angiopathies were mainly manifested by small vessels of epineurium and perineurium, and infiltrated inflammatory cells were mainly CD 3 + T cells. Three patients had active vasculitis, and 8 patients had non-active vasculitis. Among these 8 patients, 4 patients mainly presented fibrous obliteration of blood vessel, with slight inflammatroy cell infiltration, and the other 4 patients mainly showed perivascular inflammation. 2) Neuropathy: 6 patients had axon degeneration, and 5 patients had axon degeneration associated with demyelination. All of them demonstrated a reduction in myelinated fibers, mainly large diameter myelinated fibers, even on end-stage. 3) Muscle biopsy showed neurogenic atrophy. 4) Clinicopathologic diagnosis: among these 11 patients, 8 patients were diagnosed as systemic vasculitic peripheral neuropathy (SVPN), among whom 5 patients were diagnosed as primary systemic vasculitis [including 1 patient as Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), 2 patients as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associated vasculitis and 2 patients as immuno-mediated interstitial lung disease (ILD) ], and 3 patients were diagnosed as secondary systemic vasculitis. The other 3 patients were diagnosed as nonsystemic vasculitic periphral neuropathy(NSVPN). Conclusions The pathological features of VPN showed that the axonal degeneration was more serious than the myelin lesions because axons were more vulnerable to ischemia than Schwann cells, perineurial cells and fibroblasts. The pathology of VPN are diverse, which {{are associated with the}} disease progression and treatment, and therefore the hemo-immunologic parameters, nerve and muscle biopsy should be checked when the VPN is suspected.   doi:  10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2014. 06. 011 </p...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCION: Myofibrillar Myopathies (MFM) are a {{group of}} rare neuromuscular {{disorders}} with heterogeneous genetic and clinical findings. The inheritance is mainly autosomal dominant or sporadic. Hallmarks in histopathology are myofibrillar disorganization and accumulation of myofibrillar degradation-products. The {{aim of this study}} is the clinical, histopathological and genetic characterization of {{a group of}} MFM cases. METHODS AND CASES: These cases were selected by searching our clinico-pathological database. We studied the histopathological features of the myofibrillar myopathy cases or families in our <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>biopsy</b> archive (Institute of Neuropathology, RWTH University Hospital Aachen). General light microscopic techniques as well as immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used as morphological approaches. Next, we performed in these MFM patients a thorough characterization of the clinical and paraclinical phenotype: serum-CK, EMG, ENG, cardio-pulmonic findings and molecular-genetic screening (DES, MYOT, FLNC, ZASP, BAG 3, CRYAB, FHL 1). In 7 cases we performed Laser-Microdissection (LCM) and proteomic-analysis. RESULTS: We isolated 50 patients out of 15. 500 cases (0. 3 %) with clinical and histopathological findings conformable with MFM. We studied the histopathological and clinical characteristics in our group and compared them to those referred in the literature. Finally we could confirm these hallmarks in our group. MFM is also in our group a rare disorder, most mutations were found in the DES, MYOT und FLNC gen. In 36 cases we performed genetic screening; in 11 cases a mutation was found (5 DES, 3 FLNC and 3 MYOT). One case showed a polymorphism in the ZASP-gen; in 14 cases all known mutations could be excluded, in 10 cases final genetic results were still ongoing. 8 of 35 cases showed a positive family-history for neuromuscular disorders, we have ascertained detailed pedigrees in 4 families. It was possible to perform LCM and proteomic-analysis in 7 cases; we found different protein-ratios and increased appearing of different proteins within the aggregates. DISCUSSION: In all of our cases we could proof the hallmarks of MFM which were referred in the literature. That supports the presumption of a consistent histopathological definition of MFM, even if there are heterogeneous clinical und genetic findings. Subform-characteristic changes are: in Desmin-mutations increased granulofilamentous accumulations; in Myotilin- and ZASP-Mutations show more severe z-disc-changes. BAG 3 -Mutations are associated with changes in the nucleus. Mutations in the FilaminC-Gen lead to more severe myofibrillar changes than the other MFM-forms. In the LMD and Proteomics-Analysis we could proof, that the isolated aggregates are consist of a deviating protein-pattern, and that special proteins are increased within the aggregates. The wide range of clinical phenotypes was also present in our group. Patients with Desminopathy showed the highest rate of critical cardiac complications, patients with Filaminopathy are often suffering from pulmonic complications. Patients with Myotilinopathy showed a very heterogeneous mix of symptoms...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Department of Pathology at Straub Clinic & Hospital {{began using}} enzyme histochemical {{techniques}} to examine muscle biopsies in 1976 and has processed {{most of the}} muscle biopsies performed in Hawaii for the past 25 years. A Muscle Biopsy Registry of biopsy findings was established in 1992 and information concerning 1, 230 biopsies during the period December 1976 to June, 2000 entered into the Registry's data base. The goal was to document data derived from biopsy-based diagnoses of neuromuscular diseases since none currently exists. METHODS: Muscle biopsies received in a fresh state in the Straub Pathology Department were processed utilizing a modern approach incorporating routine histological and enzyme histochemical staining techniques of frozen sections. One pathologist [LJL] documented findings and established diagnoses for all cases. Patient information, demographics and diagnoses were recorded utilizing a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. RESULTS: Data sorts conducted from the Registry's data base of 1, 230 biopsies produced graphs and tables illustrating demographic statistics regarding diagnoses and findings in 1, 044 different patients {{some of whom had}} multiple <b>biopsies.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Hawaii's <b>Neuromuscular</b> Disease <b>Biopsy</b> Registry constitutes a compilation of a quarter-century of muscle biopsy-based diagnoses utilizing enzyme histochemical diagnostic techniques in pediatric and adult age groups, including specific diagnoses encountered in different ethnic groups. This information constitutes a benchmark for future epidemiologic studies, and a basis for comparison with data derived from clinical diagnoses and data derived from Death Certificates...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{order to}} study the {{morphology}} and size of muscle fibers, cross sections of biceps brachii samples from autopsies, up to 9 hours after death, and biopsies of 72 subjects were compared. The subjects aged 13 to 84 years in both sexes. METHODS: The samples obtained from autopsies (n= 47) were from subjects with sudden death, or who died after acute disease without evidence of <b>neuromuscular</b> involvement. The <b>biopsies</b> (n= 25) were from patients with symptoms suggestive of inflammatory or metabolic myopathy, not confirmed morphologically. The lesser diameter of muscle fibers was measured using the ATPase reaction. RESULTS: Morphological analysis showed that aging changes were present from the sixth decade in autopsies, and consisted of atrophy and/or type-grouping. The statistical models adjusted for females in both autopsies and biopsies were linear straight with no variation in fiber size with increasing age. The models adjusted for males in both groups were quadratic, indicating that age influenced the size of different type fibers. In males type 2 were larger than type 1 fibers, and than fibers in females.

40|$|In human {{subjects}} sustained static contractions of the quadriceps femoris in one leg were {{performed with the}} same absolute and the same relative intensity before and after partial neuromuscular blockade with either decamethonium or tubocurarine which reduced strength to about 50 % of the control value. During the contractions performed with the same absolute force, {{the magnitude of the}} cardiovascular responses (heart rate and blood pressure) was greater during neuromuscular blockade than during control contractions. During the contractions involving the same relative force the magnitude of the cardiovascular responses was almost the same with and without neuromuscular blockade. These findings were independent of the drug used. The metabolic part of the exercise pressor reflex was assessed by the application of an arterial cuff 1 / 2 min before cessation of exercise and for the following 3 min of rest. Although heart rate and blood pressure decreased after cessation of exercise, application of the tourniquet resulted in higher post-exercise values and this effect was seen both with and without <b>neuromuscular</b> blockade. Muscle <b>biopsies</b> from the subjects' m. vastus lateralis were analysed for fast- and slow-twitch fibre composition showing 27 - 66 % slow-twitch fibres. No correlation was found between cardiovascular responses to static exercise, with or without neuromuscular blockade, and fibre type predominance. The results suggest that the involvement of fast- or slow-twitch muscle fibres does not play a dominant role in the cardiovascular responses to static exercise in man. Both central command and reflex neural mechanisms are of importance, and it appears that these two control mechanisms are redundant and that neural occlusion may be operative. However, when partial neuromuscular blockade induces a disproportion between an increase in central command and a constant or decreasing muscle tension and metabolism, the larger signal arising from central command determines the magnitude of the cardiovascular responses...|$|R

OBJETIVOS: Para estudar a morfologia e o tamanho das fibras musculares, foram comparadas cortes transversos do bíceps braquial autopsiados, até 9 horas após o óbito, com biopsias musculares, em 72 indivíduos de ambos os sexos e idades entre 13 e 84 anos. MÉTODO: As amostras das autópsias (n= 47) foram obtidas de indivíduos que morreram subitamente, ou após uma doença aguda sem evidência de comprometimento neuromuscular. As biópsias (n= 25) foram obtidas de pacientes com sintomas sugestivos de miopatias inflamatória ou metabólica, não confirmadas morfologicamente. O diâmetro menor das fibras foi obtido usando a reação de ATPase. RESULTADOS: A análise morfológica mostrou que as mudanças induzidas pelo envelhecimento estiveram presentes a partir da sexta década para autópsias e consistiu de atrofia e grupamento de tipo. O modelo estatístico ajustado para mulheres, para autópsias e biópsias, foi linear e não indicou variação do tamanho das fibras com o aumento da idade. O modelo ajustado para homens, para ambos os casos, foi quadrático, indicando que a idade influenciou o tamanho dos diferentes tipos de fibras. Para homens, as fibras tipo 2 apresentaram-se maiores que as de tipo 1, e maiores que as das mulheres. CONCLUSÃO: Os valores encontrados podem ser úteis como controles, auxiliando na interpretação de modificações no tamanho das fibras para amostras provindas de biópsia e autópsia...|$|R
