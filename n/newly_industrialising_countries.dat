5000|$|Starting in 1974 the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) in the North American market {{ensured that}} trade in {{textiles}} and garments remained the most regulated in the world. Among other things the MFA set quotas on garments exports from the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries</b> of Asia, but had exceptions, {{most notably the}} state of Bangladesh. Entrepreneurs from quota-restricted countries like South Korea began [...] "quota hopping" [...] seeking quota-free countries that could become quota-free manufacturing sites. The export-oriented readymade garment industry emerged at this time. Daewoo of South Korea was an early entrant in Bangladesh, when it established a joint venture on 27 December 1977 with Desh Garments Ltd. making it the first export oriented ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh. After only one year in which 130 Desh supervisors and managers received free training from Daewoo in production and marketing at Daewoo's state-of-the-art ready-made garment plant in Korea, 115 of the 130 left Desh Garments Ltd. and set up separate private garment export firms or began working for other newly formed export-oriented RMG companies with new garment factories in Bangladesh for much higher salaries than Desh Garments Ltd offered.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{is a key}} {{theme for}} future world development. Worldwide energy demand is {{mounting}} rapidly, particularly in the developing and <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries,</b> which seek {{to catch up with}} the level of economic development attained by industrialised countries. The great challenge now is to meet this energy demand in a sustainable manner. However, sustainable development will be inconceivable without a deep-seated reconfiguration of worldwide energy systems. One goal in this context must be to protect natural life-support systems and, in particular, to prevent dangerous anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system. If the present path continues and rising energy demand is met mainly from fossil sources, this would trigger intolerable global climate change with high consequential costs, and would thus also jeopardize economic development. A second necessary goal is to eradicate energy poverty in developing countries in order that these countries can make use of development opportunities. It is essential that 2.4 billion people gain access to modern forms of energy so that they can shake off the yoke of energy poverty. To attain these two goals, energy systems need to be turned towards sustainability. To that end, efficiency must be improved at all levels of the energy system, and fossil energy sources must be substituted by renewable ones. The potential of renewable energies, above all solar energy, is almost unlimited and can be harnessed sustainably. Energy system transformation towards sustainability is thus the first step into the solar age. However, without rapid and resolute international policy support, the expansion of renewable energy sources will not be able to develop the necessary dynamics in time. The International Conference for Renewable Energies (renewables 2004) held in Bonn 2004 is a milestone for this process.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the ‘importance’ and ‘awareness’ {{of a set}} {{of established}} ‘external communication’ determinants of technological innovation {{in the context of a}} <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>country.</b> The researcher interviewed 105 Greek manufacturing companies, measuring their innovation rate as well as 23 potential ‘external communication’ determinants. Using correlation and regression analyses, the initial group of 23 factors was reduced to a subset of 10 ‘major importance’ determinants of innovation. The results supported two hypotheses related with <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries,</b> namely: 1. searching for product-specific information is more important for innovation than scanning more general market and technological information; and 2. the co-operation with partnering organisations is more important for innovation than the co-operation with assisting organisations. The ‘objective’ results were then compared with the ‘perceptions’ of the managers on the important factors determining innovation (also measured during the interviews). Overall, the perceptual analysis confirmed the significance of the subset of statistically important variables. Therefore, the hypothesis that in <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries</b> the managers are generally unaware of the important determinants of innovation was rejected. Generally, the study provided supporting evidence to the ‘contingency’ school of thought, suggesting that there are no universally applicable recipes for successful innovation management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} on university-industry relations (UIR) and knowledge transfer {{in the regional}} innovation system of Bangkok and broaches the issue of adapting well-established concepts {{for the analysis of}} innovation processes in <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries.</b> The potential for UIR is restricted due to 1) a weak and fragmented innovation system, 2) low technological and absorptive capacities in the industrial sector, and 3) slowly improving research capabilities in the scientific sector.

40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} the trajectories of {{selected}} <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries</b> in terms of structural change. Using an exploratory method of data analysis, the comparative closeness of the economies is studied over time. The results show that industrialisation is a necessary, albeit insufficient, ingredient for catch-up. The successful growth performances of Asian countries {{are associated with a}} successful industrialisation process accompanied by high export and investment shares. Latin American country performances are less successful, despite initially high industrial shares. Comparing trajcetories with southern European experiences reveals cases of premature deindustrialisation and tertiarisation processes. Copyright The Author 2011.

40|$|The {{efficient}} use of resources is a main driver for sustainability. Against the background of a rapid growth in demand for resources in the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries</b> and a moderate, but constant growth in demand for resources in the industrial nations the industrial society is facing the challenge to find new concepts for the responsible use of the limited resources. This affects mineral commodities as well as energy sources. To meet this challenge, {{there is a need}} for new resource-efficient technologies as well as new organisational models, especially in production systems which require a wide variety of different resources, such as the electronics industry. This article proposes corporate resource management systems as an organisational framework to improve both the energy and the material efficiency of producing companies on a permanent basis...|$|E

30|$|For certain, the SEZs {{have created}} a niche for {{themselves}} {{by virtue of being}} vehicles for economic transformation and sustainability stresses in Asia (Chaudhuri and Yabuuchi 2010, Wang 2013). Interestingly, some of the SEZs are being developed based on passion for sustainability and expressed support for principles of green growth (Sheng and Tang 2013). Prior to this, it was widely held that SEZs in Asia endanger some of the rare and unique ecosystems and cultural landscapes (Liu et al. 2007; He et al. 2011). Therefore, this problem would need a combination of theoretical explanations, computer-aided spatial measurements and simulations to explain the extent of such critical threats to sustainability. In this case, the time-space telescoping theory posits that the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>countries</b> experience faster and sooner industrialisation process, intensified pollution and noticeable concern to sustainability at the same time (Marcotullio 2003, 2008).|$|E
