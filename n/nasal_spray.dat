5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nasal</b> <b>sprays</b> {{are used}} as local {{treatments}} for conditions such as nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis. In some situations, the nasal delivery route is preferred because it provides an agreeable alternative to injection or pills. Substances can be assimilated extremely quickly and directly through the nose. [...] Many pharmaceutical drugs exist as <b>nasal</b> <b>sprays</b> for systemic administration (e.g. treatments for pain, migraine, osteoporosis and nausea). Other applications include hormone replacement therapy, treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. <b>Nasal</b> <b>sprays</b> {{are seen as a}} more efficient way of transporting drugs with potential use in crossing the blood-brain barrier.|$|R

25|$|Azelastine is {{safe and}} well tolerated in both adults and {{children}} with allergic rhinitis. Bitter taste, headache, nasal burning and somnolence are the most frequently reported adverse events. US prescribing recommendations warn against the concurrent use of alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants, but to date {{there have been no}} studies to assess the effects of azelastine <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> on the CNS in humans. More recent studies have shown similar degrees of somnolence (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The problem of bitter taste may be reduced by correct application of the <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation.|$|E

25|$|A {{simple method}} {{requiring}} no specialized equipment is to snort water from cupped hands, but this clears {{little more than}} the nostrils. The application of commercially available saline <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> is another simple alternative, but it is relatively inefficient for washing away debris, although it may suffice for simple rehydration of mucous and tissues.|$|E
25|$|Nasal administration: Oxytocin is a peptide that is {{effectively}} {{distributed to the}} brain when administered intranasally via a <b>nasal</b> <b>spray,</b> after which it reliably crosses the blood–brain barrier and exhibits psychoactive effects in humans. No serious adverse effects with short-term application of oxytocin with 18~40nbsp&IU (36-80nbsp&mcg) have been recorded.

5000|$|Nasal decongestants target {{discomfort}} directly. These come as <b>nasal</b> <b>sprays</b> like naphazoline (Privine), oxymetazoline (Afrin, Dristan, Duramist), as inhalers, or phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, Sinex, Rhinall) or as oral pills (Bronkaid, Sudafed, Neo-Synephrine, Sinex, Rhinall). Oral decongestants may be {{used for}} up to a week without consulting a doctor, with the exception of Bronkaid and Sudafed, which can be taken as long as needed, but <b>nasal</b> <b>sprays</b> can also cause [...] "rebound" [...] (Rhinitis medicamentosa) and worsen the congestion if taken {{for more than a few}} days.

In some countries, it is also indicated for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in adults and children ≥ 12 years old. Azelastine eyes drops are indicated for the local treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a <b>nasal</b> <b>spray,</b> or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a patient should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as {{this can lead to}} sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to renal pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).|$|E
25|$|Intranasal {{progesterone}} as a <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> {{has been}} found to be effective in achieving therapeutic levels, and was not associated with nasal irritation, but was associated with an unpleasant taste of the spray. Rectal, intramuscular, and intravenous routes may be inconvenient, especially for long-term treatment. Plasma levels of progesterone are similar after vaginal and rectal administration in spite of the different routes of administration, and rectal administration is an alternative to vaginal progesterone in conditions of vaginal infection, cystitis, recent childbirth, or when barrier contraception methods are used. Intramuscular injection of progesterone may achieve much higher levels of progesterone than normal luteal phase concentrations and levels achieved with other routes.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, <b>nasal</b> <b>spray,</b> and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.|$|E
2500|$|Natural or Mini-IVF, {{but without}} the use of hCG to trigger ovulation, instead the GnRH agonist Synarel (nafarelin acetate) in a diluted form is taken as a <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> to trigger ovulation. [...] Human {{chorionic}} gonadotropin (hCG) has a long half life and may stimulate (luteinize) small follicles prematurely and cause them to become cysts. [...] Whereas nafarelin acetate in a <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> induces a short lived LH surge that is high enough to induce ovulation in large follicles, but too short lived to adversely affect small follicles. [...] This increases the likelihood of the small follicles and oocytes therein developing normally for upcoming cycles and also allows the woman to cycle without taking a break and consequently increases the probability of conception in poor ovarian reserve women and advanced reproductive aged women.|$|E

[...] This treatment {{in the form of}} a <b>nasal</b> <b>spray</b> should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact.

[...] Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection, by which every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.|$|E
50|$|Nasal {{administration}} is a {{route of administration}} in which drugs are insufflated through the nose.
