The enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which {{plays an important}} role for dopamine metabolism, is abundantly expressed in the kidney. To test whether the natriuretic effects of dopamine {{may be related to the}} rate of dopamine metabolism, rats were treated with <b>nitecapone,</b> a peripheral inhibitor of COMT. <b>Nitecapone,</b> given by gavage, induced a highly significant (5. 6 -fold) increase in sodium excretion, which was associated with an inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in both the proximal convoluted and proximal straight tubules (PCT and PST, respectively). These effects were completely abolished if the rats were also treated with a specific dopamine 1 antagonist, SCH 23390. Furthermore, the natriuretic effect of <b>nitecapone</b> was also observed in rats on a high salt diet. The kidney-specific pro-drug to dopamine, glu-dopa, induced a significant, but less pronounced increase in urinary sodium excretion, associated with a dopamine-dependent inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the PCT but not in the PST. <b>Nitecapone</b> and glu-dopa had an additive natriuretic effect. It is concluded that COMT {{plays an important role}} in determining the natriuretic effects of the renal dopamine system...|$|E
40|$|D 1 -like {{dopamine}} receptor activation and natriuresis by nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors. BackgroundIn recent years, several nitrocatechol derivatives (tolcapone, entacapone, and <b>nitecapone)</b> {{have been}} developed and found to be highly selective and potent inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). More recently, natriuretic properties were described for two of these compounds (entacapone and <b>nitecapone),</b> although this was not accompanied by enhanced urinary excretion of dopamine. We hypothesized that nitrocatechol derivatives stimulate D 1 -like dopamine receptors. MethodsAdult male Wistar rats were treated with a nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor (entacapone, tolcapone, or <b>nitecapone,</b> 30 mg/kg, orally), and the urinary excretion of dopamine and sodium was quantitated. The interaction of nitrocatechol derivatives with D 1 -like receptors was evaluated by their ability to displace [3 H]-Sch 23390 binding from membranes of rat renal cortex and cAMP production in opossum kidney (OK) cells. ResultsUrinary excretion of sodium (μmol/h) was markedly increased by all three nitrocatechol derivatives: vehicle, 55. 0 ± 5. 6; entacapone, 98. 4 ± 9. 3; tolcapone, 97. 5 ± 9. 3; and <b>nitecapone,</b> 120. 5 ± 12. 6. Pretreatment with the selective D 1 antagonist Sch 23390 (60 μg/kg) completely prevented their natriuretic effects. <b>Nitecapone</b> and tolcapone were equipotent (IC 50 s of 48 and 42 μmol/L) and more potent than entacapone and dopamine (IC 50 s of 107 and 279 μmol/L) in displacing [3 H]-Sch 23390 binding. In OK cells, all three nitrocatechol derivatives significantly increased cAMP accumulation and reduced Na+/H+ exchange and Na+,K+-ATPase activities, this being prevented by a blockade of D 1 -like receptors. ConclusionStimulation of D 1 -like dopamine receptors and inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange and Na+,K+-ATPase activities by nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors may contribute to natriuresis produced by these compounds...|$|E

QO IA (3 -(3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxy- 5 -nitrobenzylidene) - 2, 4 -pentanedione), QO IIR ([2 -(3, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -nitrophenyl) vinyl]phenyl ketone), <b>nitecapone</b> and Ro- 41 - 0960 (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) were given to reserpinized rats 1 [*]h before the administration of L-DOPA/carbidopa (LD/CD, 50 [*]:[*] 50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.). Locomotor activity was assessed 1 [*]h later. All the COMT inhibitors (COMTI), with the exception of QO IA, markedly potentiated LD/CD reversal of reserpine-induced akinesia. Similar results were obtained when the COMTI were coadministered with LD/CD. The effect of compound QO IIR was dose-dependent (7. 5 – 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.). The COMTI (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) potentiated LD/CD reversal of both catalepsy and hypothermia of reserpinized mice. QO IIR, <b>nitecapone</b> and Ro- 41 - 0960 (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) reduced striatal 3 -methyl-DOPA (3 -OMD) levels and increased dopamine (DA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels. Compound QO IA was devoid of any effect on striatal amine levels. In contrast to the other inhibitors, Ro- 41 - 0961 reduced HVA levels as well. The effect of QO IIR on striatal amine levels was dose-dependent (7. 5 – 60 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.)

40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} {{is today}} {{the most common}} cause of end stage renal failure. The risk for developing overt diabetic nephropathy is considerably reduced by antihypertensive treatment, and adequate control of blood glucose. However, there is a need for additional and even more efficient tools to prevent this complication of diabetes. The purpose of this thesis has therefore been 1. To gain more information on the mechanisms behind one of the factors believed to contribute to the development of hypertension, namely sodium retention and 2. To examine the effects of 2 drugs that may restore some of the metabolic perturbations caused by hyperglycemia, namely the increased formation of sorbitol from glucose via aldose reductase and the development of oxidative stress. The studies have been performed in rats with streptozotocin induced diabetes. Various pararneters of renal function, known to be altered in diabetes, were determined 2 to 12 weeks after the induction of diabetes. It was found that 1. Hyperglycernia is the primary cause of sodium retention in diabetes, since it causes increased reabsorption of Na via the Na/glucose cotransporter in the proximal tubule This effect was also found to contribute to diabetic hyperfiltration. In rats with a genetic predisposition for sodium retention and salt sensitive hypertension, the rate of developing diabetic nephropathy was considerably increased. 2. Aldose reductase inhibitors did not, in the doses applied in my studies, have any effect on the renal functional disturbances in the diabetic rats. In contrast, <b>nitecapone,</b> a very potent antioxidant, completely abolished the early functional disturbances and attenuated the development of glomerulosclerosis. Administration of <b>nitecapone</b> also intestinal hypomotility, which is likely a manifestation of diabetes-induced disturbances of the autonomous nervous system. - Prostaglandins have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In a clinical study we found no effect of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition on renal function and albumin excretion rate in young diabetic women. In conclusion, this study has indicated both sodium retention and oxidative stress will significantly contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy, and more attempts should therefore be made to alleviate these metabolic disturbances. Interestingly, both sodium retention and oxidative stress appear to be the consequences of hyperglycemia...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{damage to}} proteins, implicated amongst {{other in the}} {{etiology}} and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), results {{in the loss of}} specific biological protein function. A simple, sensitive, and cost-effective fluorimetric test to assess the antioxidant capacity of new chemical entities to protect proteins from loss of activity caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was developed using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as model protein. Protein oxidation was induced by 2, 2 '-azobis(2 -methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and the decrease in catalytic activity of ALP to hydrolyze 4 -methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4 -MUP) to fluorescent 4 -methylumbelliferone (4 -MU) was monitored as a marker of protein degradation. According to their capacity to protect ALP from peroxyl radical-induced activity loss, ten reference antioxidants were divided into three classes, namely efficient (pIC(50) > 5 for quercetin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, mangiferin, and resveratrol), intermediate (4 < pIC(50) < or = 5 for melatonin, trolox, and ascorbic acid), and poor antioxidants (pIC(50) < 4 for glutathione and D-mannitol). Multifunctional drugs, having the ability to interact with several disease-related targets are of interest in PD. Therefore, the capacity of three catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, entacapone, <b>nitecapone,</b> and tolcapone to protect ALP from oxidative damage was also investigated and found to be very similar to the most potent reference antioxidants...|$|E
40|$|Graphical {{methods to}} analyze tracer time-course data allow {{reliable}} quantitation {{of the rate}} of incorporation of tracer from plasma into a "trapped" kinetic component, even when {{the details of the}} kinetic model are unknown. Applications of the method over long time periods often expose the slow reversibility of the trapping process. In the extended graphical method, both trapping rate and a presumed first-order loss rate constant are estimated simultaneously from the time-course data. METHODS: We applied the extended graphical method to 6 -fluoro-L-dopa (6 -FD), simultaneously estimating the rate of uptake (Ki) and the rate constant for loss from the trapped component (K(loss)) in a single fitting procedure. We applied this approach to study the effects of two catechol-O-methyl-transferase inhibitors on the kinetics of 6 -FD in cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS: Inhibition of peripheral O-methylation with either inhibitor, confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of labeled compounds in arterial plasma, had no significant effect on Ki, in agreement with previously reported studies. In contrast, tolcapone, a catechol-O-methyl-transferase inhibitor, having central effects in addition to peripheral effects at the dosage used, decreased K(loss) by 40 % from control values (p < 0. 002), whereas <b>nitecapone,</b> which has no known central activity, had no significant effect. CONCLUSION: This method provides insight into the neurochemical basis for the kinetic behavior of 6 -FD in both health and disease and may be used to define the action of centrally active drugs that influence the metabolism of dopamine...|$|E
40|$|Role of {{oxidative}} stress in advanced glycation end product-induced mesangial cell activation. BackgroundLevels of advanced glycation end products (AGE) are elevated in individuals with advancing age, renal failure, and diabetes, and accumulation of these molecules {{may contribute to}} disease progression. The mechanism by which AGE proteins alter glomerular mesangial cell function, however, is not completely understood. The present study assessed the involvement of {{oxidative stress}} in AGE-dependent mesangial cell signaling events. MethodsPrimary cultures of rat renal mesangial cells were exposed to in vitro AGE-BSA and H 2 O 2. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and protein kinase C (PKC) isoform activation were studied using confocal microscopy and Western blotting. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{was used to measure}} transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) levels. The involvement of oxidative stress was assessed by supplementing or compromising cellular antioxidant capacity. ResultsNF-κB was dose-dependently activated by AGE. PKC activation was not involved in this response, but analysis of PKC-β 1 activation showed a stimulatory effect of AGE proteins on this isoform. Transcription of TGF-β 1 was stimulated by AGE and was prevented by PKC inhibition. Challenge with H 2 O 2 had similar downstream effects on mesangial cell signaling. Antioxidants, vitamin E and <b>nitecapone,</b> prevented AGE-dependent NF-κB activation and normalized PKC activity and associated TGF-β 1 transcription. Depletion of the intracellular antioxidant, glutathione, effectively lowered the AGE concentration needed for mesangial cell activation of NF-κB and PKC-β 1. Treatment with a suboptimal AGE dose, under glutathione-depleted conditions, revealed a synergistic effect on both parameters. ConclusionThe results support a central role for oxidative stress in AGE-dependent mesangial cell signaling and emphasize the importance of ROS in determining cell responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|In the periphery, {{physiological}} dopamine increases renal blood flow, decreases renal {{resistance and}} acts on the kidney tubule to enhance natriuresis and diuresis. The loss of dopamine function may be involoved in the deterioration in kidney function associated with ageing {{and may have}} a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and diabetes. Intravenous dopamine is used as a positive inotrope in the treatment of acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock and as a diuretic in renal failure. The clinical uses of dopamine are limited, as it must be given intravenously, and also has widespread effects. The levels of peripheral dopamine can be increased by the administration of L-dopa to increase synthesis, prodrugs to release dopamine (docarpamine, glu-dopa) or by inhibiting the breakdown of dopamine (<b>nitecapone).</b> Preliminary clinical trials suggest that docarpamine may be useful in patients with low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery and in refractory cirrhotic ascites. Ibopamine is an agonist at dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors, which may retard the progression of chronic renal failure. Gludopa is selective for the kidney thus avoiding widespread side effects. The early clinical studies with ibopamine as a diuretic in heart failure were favourable but the subsequent large mortality study showed that ibopamine increased mortality. Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine D 1 receptor agonist. Intravenous fenoldopam may be useful in the treatment of hypertension associated with coronary artery bypass surgery or in hypertensive emergencies. Although our understanding of physiological and pathological roles of peripheral dopamine has been increasing rapidly in recent times, we still need more information to allow the design of clinically useful drugs that modify these roles. One priority is an orally-active selective dopamine D 1 receptor agonist...|$|E
40|$|The signal {{transduction}} {{processes by which}} an individual cell is able to recognize and respond to its external environment are critical to determining its survival {{as well as that}} of the entire organism. In the current study we have investigated the intracellular signalling cascades activated downstream of two separate stimuli: the diabetic milieu and the cardiac glycoside, ouabain. The development and progression of diabetic nephropathy is dependent on the maintenance of adequate glucose homeostasis. Based on studies using diabetic rats, we found that increased oxidative stress was implicated in the cellular activation of the PKC/TGF-b 1 pathway and consequent kidney dysfunction. Diabetic rats fed a diet containing the antioxidant, <b>nitecapone,</b> were protected from the development of diabetic nephropathy. Using a renal mesangial cell model of diabetes, we present evidence that AGE, a class of molecules typically present in the diabetic milieu, initiate a cascade of signalling events including activation of PKC, TGF-b 1, and NF-kB. Increased oxidative stress was involved in the regulation of these signalling molecules by AGE since antioxidants were able to normalize their activation. The endogenous ligand of Na,K-ATPase, ouabain, is a newly recognized steroid hormone, the effect of which on {{signal transduction}} is largely unknown. Using renal epithelial cells, we show that ouabain induces slow oscillations in cytosolic calcium. The generation of this unique response was facilitated by a number of calcium transport proteins that regulated both intra- and extra-cellular calcium compartments. Initiation of the calcium response and release from intracellular stores was dependent on a novel molecular interaction between the NH 2 -terminus of Na,K-ATPase and IP 3 R. The physical interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP 3 R and the induction of calcium oscillations was fundamental to the ability of ouabain to activate NF-kB. Regulation of gene expression following short term ouabain exposure was investigated by DNA microarray analysis. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase was the main factor establishing the observed gene changes. In conclusion, this thesis presents new insight into the signal transduction cascades activated by the diabetic milieu and by ouabain. Oxidative stress has a role in the stimulation of key signalling molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of the diabetic condition. Binding to Na,K-ATPase by its ligand, ouabain, reveals a signal transducing function of the pump and the generation of calcium oscillations via protein-protein interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP 3 R...|$|E
