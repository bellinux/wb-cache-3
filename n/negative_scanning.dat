40|$|Pt hollow nanospheres with a {{particle}} diameter of 110 nm and a shell thickness of about 5 nm were synthesized in bulk using selenium colloids with {{a particle}} diameter of 100 nm as a template. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HR-TEM), {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrocopy (EDX), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine their morphologies and structures. The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt hollow nanospheres modifying glassy carbon electrode toward methanol oxidation was measured by using methanol as the probe molecule. We show that the multiporous Pt hollow nanospheres composited of atomic clusters have a uniform particle size, good dispersity, a stable structure, a big surface area and good mass transfer performance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that when the current density of methanol oxidation was 0. 10 mA. cm(- 2) and upon positive scanning the methanol oxidation potential of the Pt hollow nanospheres was around 110 and 64 mV negative than that of the Pt solid nanoparticles and Pt black, respectively. Upon <b>negative</b> <b>scanning</b> the former species was about 51 and 13 mV negative than that of the latter two species, respectively. After 800 segments cyclic voltammetry scanning, upon positive scanning the peak current density of methanol oxidation on the Pt hollow nanospheres was found to be 13 and 15 times as high as that of the Pt solid nanoparticles and Pt black, respectively. Upon <b>negative</b> <b>scanning</b> the former species was about 19 and 38 times as high as that of the two latter species. Our experimental results show that the Pt hollow nanospheres have good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward methanol oxidation.

40|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} of {{acute myocardial infarction}} early in the process is often difficult. An imaging agent that localized quickly and specifically in areas of acute necrosis could provide this critical diagnostic information. To determine whether imaging with 99 mTc-labeled o-glucaric acid (GLA) could provide this information, we imaged a group of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute infarction. Methods: Twenty-eight patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms highly suggestive of acute infarction were injected with 99 mTc-GLAand imaged about 3 h later. Results: The sensitivity of lesion detection was remarkably time dependent. Fourteen patients with acute infarction injected within 9 h of onset of chest pain had positive scans, even {{in the presence of}} persistent occlusion. The remaining 14 patients had <b>negative</b> <b>scans.</b> Nine patients with <b>negative</b> <b>scans</b> had acute infarction but were injected more than 9 h after onset of chest pain. The final diagnosis in the remaining 5 patients was unstable angina (3 injected 9 h after onset of chest pain). Six patients were reinjected with 99 mTc-GLA 4 - 6 wk after their initial study to determine whether persistent positive scans occurred with this agent.

40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze the {{influence}} of process parameters on the morphology of highly porous platinum electrodes, fabricated by co-deposition of platinum-copper alloy and subsequent selective dissolution of the less noble copper during multiple cyclic voltammetry scans. Thereto the Cu 2 + concentration in the deposition electrolyte, the <b>negative</b> <b>scan</b> limit, and the scan rate were varied. Corresponding electrodes were characterized by their surface texture (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry), specific surface area, and elemental compositions (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy). Under conditions enforcing precursor depletion a sphere-dominated structure is observed, whereas oppositional configurations lead to smoother, mud-crack pattern like structures. Electrodes of high specific surface area are obtained particularly when high copper ion concentrations (100 mmol l− 1 CuSO 4, roughness factor 3740 ± 270), high <b>negative</b> <b>scan</b> limits (− 0. 800 V vs. SCE, roughness factor 3790 ± 370) and low scan speeds (1 mV s− 1, roughness factor 3930 ± 370) compared to standard parameters (20 mmol l− 1 CuSO 4, − 0. 600 V vs. SCE <b>negative</b> <b>scan</b> limit, 1 mV s− 1, roughness factor 3040 ± 300) were applied during fabrication.

40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between optic nerve head (ONH) and finger blood flow in subjects with and without a primary vascular dysregulation (PVD). Methods. ONH blood flow and finger blood flow was measured in 15 subjects with PVD and in 24 subjects without PVD. PVD was defined as being present if it was detected in patient history as well as by nailfold capillaromicroscopy. PVD was defined as being absent if the patient history for PVD was negative and the results of nailfold capillaromicroscopy were <b>negative.</b> <b>Scanning</b> laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used to measure ONH and finger blood flow. Finger temperature was measured in all subjects using a contact sensor. Results. ONH blood flow is significantly related to finger blood flow in subjects with PVD (p> 0. 01), but not in subjects without a PVD. Subjects with PVD had a significantly lower finger skin temperature in comparison to those without PVD (p> 0. 01) CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates a relationship between ONH and finger blood flow in subjects with PVD.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to prepare NS-chitosan microparticles for the delivery of 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) to the colon. Microparticles can spread out over a large area of colon allowing a more effective local efficacy of 5 -ASA. N-Succinyl-chitosan was chosen as carrier system because of its excellent pharmaceutical properties in colon drug targeting such as poor solubility in acid environment, biocompatibility, mucoadhesive properties, and low toxicity. It was prepared by introducing succinic group into chitosan N-terminals of the glucosamine units. 5 -ASA loaded NS-chitosan microparticles were prepared using spray-drying. As a control, a matrix obtained by freeze-drying technique was also prepared and tested. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction studies show the 5 -ASA/NS-chitosan electrostatic interactions in both the systems.

After treatment, Ga- 67 scan is considered as a useful technique for monitoring response in these patients. Material and Methods: Between December 1998 and January 2004, 63 patients histopathologically diagnosed with Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma (DLCL) were studied. Patients were evaluated before and after treatment with a whole body Ga- 67 scan {{in addition to other}} imaging techniques. International Prognostic Index (IPI), and clinical variables were determined according to criteria reported by the International non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Prognostic factors Project. Results: Among the patients with positive computed tomography (CT) scan, the 5 -year relapse-free and overall survival rates were 70 % and 78 % for those with <b>negative</b> <b>scans</b> compared with 23 % and 35 % for gallium-positive patients, respectively (p< 0. 004, p< 0. 008).

A prospective study was undertaken to try to maximise the cost effectiveness of computed tomography {{of the brain}} in the preoperative evaluation of {{non-small cell lung cancer}}. METHODS: All patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were free of neurological symptoms and were thought to be free of metastases from the results of routine investigations were subjected to computed tomography of the brain in the 12 - 24 hours immediately before surgery. RESULTS: Of 158 such patients, five showed positive evidence of metastases, confirmed on craniotomy and excision biopsy; one of these patients was found to have a non-metastatic tumour (false positive). Five patients with a <b>negative</b> <b>scan</b> who underwent lung resection returned within 12 months with neurological defects and positive findings on further computed tomography (false negative). The predominant cell type in patients with positive and false <b>negative</b> <b>scans</b> was adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma (7 / 10); the majority had nodal state N 2.

Design: Retrospective analysis of all patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated in one centre between 1990 and 2000. Results: A total of 153 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic scanning following ablative therapy were identified. This diagnostic scan was positive in 20 patients (13 %) and faintly positive in 16 patients (11 %). The majority (117 patients) had <b>negative</b> <b>scans.</b> Of the 20 patients with positive scans, four received no further treatment, nine showed no abnormal uptake following a second ablative 131 I dose and seven had uptake in the thyroid bed (six) or in neck nodes (one) after repeat ablation.

40|$|The {{past two}} decades have {{demonstrated}} sonographer work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WRMSD) rates between 80. 0 to 90. 4 %. A surprising revelation made by sonographers was that educators were not perceived as the primary providers of ergonomics instruction. For these reasons, a mixed methods study was performed, involving a causal-comparative component with a longitudinal perspective, a quasi-experimental element, and limited observations and interviews. The study followed four years of sonography graduates through the early career scan period, comparing transmissional, transactional, and transformational learning results. The study’s goal {{was to determine whether}} transformative ergonomics learning in a collaborative and reflective environment could demonstrate {{a significant difference in the}} reduction of <b>negative</b> <b>scan</b> habits associated with reported musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), compared to transmissional and transactional learning. Testing revealed that a typical early career sonographer was unaware of the high percentage of musculoskeletal injuries (MSIs) in the field, nor readily perceived personal risks despite possessing knowledge of other injured sonographers. Nevertheless, nearly three-fourths of the study’s subjects described work-related MSD complaints before the five year career period, with shoulders, neck, wrist, and back areas being most common among both general and cardiac sonographers. Determining early scan risk behaviors that coincide with early pain reports and working toward preventative corrective actions may, in fact, reduce the likelihood of such future WRMSD complaints. Photoplethysmography (PPG) recordings during challenging maneuvers demonstrated additional benefit toward the reduction of <b>negative</b> <b>scan</b> behaviors; while transformational learning demonstrated significant benefit in both reducing <b>negative</b> <b>scan</b> behaviors and increasing positive behaviors. Transformational learners expressed more empowerment toward reducing personal risk susceptibility through collaborative recognition and corrective action planning measures. Transformational learners also cited positive attitudinal impact in peer collaboration, while demonstrating a noticeable change in MSI personal risk ratings at the conclusion of learning. The study also revealed that, despite ergonomics learning, early career sonographers did not respond as readily to corrective feedback until personally experiencing an MSI. However, transformational learners demonstrated much greater responsiveness to corrective feedback than did the other learning classifications. This higher transformational level of learning provided evidence toward reduction of WRMSDs among sonographers through responsiveness of corrective action planning...|$|R

The patients (6 men and 5 women, age 28 - 68, mean 45 years) {{were affected by}} a variety of tumors which supposedly express somatostatin receptors: 2 meningotheliomatous meningiomas post-surgery; 2 glucagonomas with liver metastases observed on CT; 2 patients with suspicion of insulinoma; 2 carcinoids, one after surgery; 1 ectopic-ACTH Cushing's syndrome; 1 intracranial germinoma, post-surgery, in whom the study was requested to evaluate a doubtful finding of pulmonary metastatic lesion on CT; and 1 acromegaly showing, on MRI, and empty sella turcica occupied by and extraflexion of the lower portion of the chiasmatic cisterna without signs of adenoma and the sphenoidal sinus occupied by tissue wit inflammmatory characteristics. Somatostatin-receptor whole body scintigraphy was performed 4 and 24 hours after intravenous injection of 110 MBq 111 In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan 111); spot images were acquired when judged necessary. In one case of glucagonoma, a tomographic scan (SPECT) was also performed to better evaluate the spatial relationship between the primitive pancreatic tumor and surrounding tissues. Focal accumulation of 111 In-pentetreotide was scintigraphically detected in 5 of the 11 cases. Intense uptake of the radiopharmaceutical was observed in the meningiomas, in the glucagonomas with liver metastases, {{and in the case of}} acromegaly, corresponding to a GH-secreting adenoma.

25|$|CT is {{only able}} to detect 76% of hollow viscous {{injuries}} and patients who have <b>negative</b> <b>scans</b> must often be observed and rechecked if they deteriorate. However, CT has been demonstrated to be useful in screening patients with certain forms of abdominal trauma {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary laparotomies, which can significantly increase the cost and length of hospitalizations. A meta-analysis of CT use in penetrating abdominal traumas demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy >= 95%, with a PPV of 85% and an NPV of 98%. This suggests that CT is excellent for avoiding unnecessary laparotomies but must be augmented by other clinical criteria to determine the need for surgical exploration (23.37 positive likelihood ratio, 0.05 negative likelihood ratio).|$|R
