Such electronic states were originally predicted and discovered in condensed matter physics, but they find their counterparts in other fields of physics, including the physics of classical waves and electromagnetics. Here, we present the first experimental realization of a topological insulator for electromagnetic waves based on engineered bianisotropic metamaterials.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of operating a non-simultaneous, bidirectional, unrepeatered communications link over long lengths of optical fibre at a data rate of 1 Mb/s is discussed. The link {{is intended for}} communicating between a stationary local terminal and a mobile remote terminal. A design study of the link {{has shown that the}} optical fibre is the most critical system component and that precise characterisation of the fibre is essential. A 1 Mb/s optical fibre data link has been constructed to test the validity of the design study, and has been successfully operated over a distance of 5 km with an error-rate of < 10 ^- 9. The optical receiver utilizes a silicon PIN photodiode feeding a low-noise preamplifier while the transmitter incorporates either a high-radiance LED or a cw semiconductor injection laser, generating half-width return-to-zero optical pulses at wavelengths of 0. 9 µm and 0. 85 µm respectively. Recently a distance of 10. 5 km has been achieved with a 25 dB signal/noise ratio for the LED source. An analogue system incorporating a PIN detector and LED source has also been demonstrated. The signal/noise ratio is 21 dB over 7 km of low-loss fibre. A new method has been invented, the <b>near-field</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>technique,</b> for providing a simple and rapid method for obtaining reproducible and detailed index-profile measurements. The index profile is determined by observation of the light intensity variation across the output face of a short length of fibre illuminated by an incoherent source. The profile obtained in this way may be suitable for many applications; however for accurate determinations it is necessary {{to take into account the}} presence of tunneling leaky modes which contribute additional power to the inferred refractive-index profile and cause a length-dependent error. A normalised correction factor is developed which may be applied to the measured intensity profile once the fibre length, core diameter and numerical aperture are known. The technique has been extensively investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, and the resolution appears to be good when scanning typical multimode fibres. It has allowed for the first time, observation of imperfections in the index profile right down to individual cvd layers. A novel technique is also reported for the determination of the profile dispersion parameter P, by direct measurement on the fibre itself. The method is based on the fact that measurement of the wavelength dependence of the numerical aperture yields the difference in dispersion between the core and cladding glasses from which P may be calculated. Very little sample preparation is required and accurate experimental data has been obtained over the wavelength range 0. 35 to 1. 9 µm for germanosilicate, phosphosilicate and borosilicate glasses, whilst the range 0. 35 to 1. 2 µm has been covered for fluoro-silicate glass. For germanosilicate glass, P is found to be independent of both dopant concentration and thermal history. The results show that the exploitation of the longer-wavelength region will require either the design of fibres specifically for 1. 3 µm operation, or the development of fibres which exhibit a low pulse dispersion over an extended spectral range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Integrated {{circuits}} (ICs) {{are often}} {{a significant source of}} radiated energy from electronic systems. Well designed ICs maintain good control of the currents that they generate. However, poorly designed ICs can drive high-frequency noise currents onto nominally low-frequency input and output pins. These currents can excite unintentional radiating structures on the printed circuit board resulting in radiated emissions that are difficult or expensive to control. This paper discusses the use of magnetic <b>near-field</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>techniques</b> to measure the current distribution in IC packages.

Direct contributions to the scattered field are computed directly in the far-field using conventional fast techniques, so that no evanescent waves {{are present in the}} scanning plane.

40|$|Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell {{has been}} a popular test {{facility}} for evaluating integrated circuit (IC) - radiated emission. Since it is single-port test device, GTEM measurement cannot distinguish electric field component from magnetic field component. Rather, both fields are captured as a global quantity. It is therefore speculated that radiated emission measured using GTEM cell is less precise comparing with <b>near-field</b> probe <b>scanning</b> <b>technique.</b> Nonetheless, GTEM cell is cost-effective in providing sufficiently good ambient shielding to conduct field measurement at broad frequency range. Meanwhile, GTEM measurement typically is associated with semi-anechoic chamber (SAC) measurement. This study attempted to improve the correlation between GTEM and SAC through a correction factor. A specific circuitry pattern was constructed to replicate the wide-ranging IC interconnections and used for evaluation in GTEM cell and SAC. The horizontal and vertical electric fields based on GTEM measurement were preprocessed by MATLAB code to obtain the correction factor. Subsequently, the correction factor was employed to fine-tune any deviation arose from correlating the IC-radiated electric fields of GTEM cell to SAC. The results demonstrated a strong correlation coefficient upon regulation of GTEM fields with a correction factor, thereby offering a high-accuracy GTEM cell measurement strategy...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, a hybrid {{numerical}} method is presented for {{the solution of}} very large and complex radiation and scattering electromagnetic problems, which combines the Finite Element Boundary Integral (FEBI) technique and the Multilevel Fast Multipole Method (MLFMM) with the Uniform Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (UTD). The presented hybrid approach {{is referred to as}} FEBI-MLFMM-UTD method and it combines {{for the first time a}} local method, a global fast Integral Equation (IE) method, and ray optical asymptotic techniques. The hybridization with UTD is performed in both the Boundary Integral Method (BIM) part, where the Green’s function and the incident field are appropriately modified for Combined Field Integral Equation (CFIE), as well as within the matrix-vector multiplications in the various levels of the MLFMM part by approximating ray optical terms of the Green’s function with far-field expressions suitable for MLFMM interactions. This results in modification of the translation procedure using a far-field approximation of the translation operator for ray optical contributions. In each case, the Green’s function and the incident field are modified according to superposition of all received field contributions. Dielectric regions of FEBI objects are handled efficiently through conventional combination of BIM with the Finite Element Method (FEM), which does not affect the hybridization with UTD. Further, postprocessing near-field computations in the proposed hybrid method are accelerated using MLFMM combining near-field and far-field MLFMM translations for optimum performance. Near-field translations are performed from source groups including currents to receiving groups including nearby observation points, whereas far-field translations are performed for each far-away observation point at the coarsest level on which far-field condition is still satisfied. The optimum level for far-field translations is found for each observation point in the initialization step in a worst-case sense using its shortest distance to the MLFMM domain of the currents. In both domains ray optical contributions due to the presence of UTD objects are taken into account according to hybridization of MLFMM with UTD. In addition, far-field scattering computations are performed by applying Near-Field to Far-Field Transformations (NFFFTs) in the postprocessing stage based on planar <b>near-field</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>techniques.</b> Particularly, the scattered ray optical electric field is first computed in a scanning plane in the near-field region of the involved objects using the postprocessing MLFMM and it is then transformed into far-field regions using plane wave expansions. Direct field contributions are evaluated directly in the far-field of the involved objects using conventional fast techniques and the total far-fields are found by superposition. In the UTD part, double diffracted ray optical fields at arbitrarily oriented straight metallic edges are included using scalar diffraction coefficients of standard UTD. Using the hybrid FEBI-MLFMM-UTD method large scale problems including arbitrarily shaped and electrically large objects can be handled very efficiently saving a large amount in computation and memory requirements, which is demonstrated very clearly with numerical examples...|$|R

We provide {{an introduction to the}} development of microwave microscopy and its contributions to material metrology. In particular, we focus on its application to the study of photovoltaics. We then expand beyond these studies to the fabrication of nanowire-based probes for microwave microscopy. These probes provide avenues for advancing an array of <b>scanning</b> probe <b>techniques,</b> including continued measurements on photovoltaics with improved resolution. To begin, we present a <b>near-field</b> <b>scanning</b> microwave microscope that has been configured for imaging photovoltaic samples. Our system incorporates a Pt-Ir tip inserted into an open-ended coaxial cable allowing the microwave reflection S 11 signal to be measured across a sample. A phase-tuning circuit increased impedance-measurement sensitivity by allowing for tuning of the S 11 minimum down to - 78 dBm. A bias-T and preamplifier enabled simultaneous, non-contact measurement of the DC tip-sample current and a tuning fork feedback system provided simultaneous topographic data. Light-free tuning fork feedback provided characterization of photovoltaic samples both in the dark and under illumination. In addition to single-point measurements on Si and GaAs samples, microwave measurements were obtained on a Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) sample. The S 11 and DC features were found to spatially broaden around grain boundaries with the sample under illumination. The broadening is attributed to optically-generated charge that becomes trapped and changes the local depletion of the grain boundaries. Next, we report on the fabrication of a GaN nanowire probe for <b>near-field</b> <b>scanning</b> microwave microscopy. A single nanowire was Pt-bonded to a commercial Si cantilever prior to either an evaporated Ti/Al or an ALD W coating, providing a microwave signal pathway. Testing over a calibration sample shows the probe to have capacitance resolution down to ~ 0. 03 fF with improved sensitivity and reduced uncertainty compared with a commercial microwave probe. Imaging of MoS 2 sheets found the probe to be immune to surface contamination, owing to its flexible, high-aspect ratio morphology.
