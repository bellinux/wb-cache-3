According to audio engineer Tomlinson Holman, problems are created due to the multiplicity of the controls. Each and every console has their own dynamic range and it is important to utilize this correctly to avoid excessive noise or distortions. Attacking this problem - of the correct setting for the variety of controls - can be accomplished relatively quickly. Holman refers to the scale of the control as a clue for the solution of this problem. With 0 dB being the <b>nominal</b> <b>setting</b> of the controls, many have a [...] "gain in hand," [...] which goes above 0 dB. This means that one can turn it up from the <b>nominal</b> <b>setting</b> to have something that sounds clear.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} microgrid-based solution to future distribution systems with high penetration of {{distributed energy resources}} (DERs). A clustered system architecture is envisioned, in which microgrids are formulated as key building blocks of a smart distribution system. Accordingly, the control and operation can be simpli?ed signi?cantly with the system con?gured as an interconnected of coupling operated microgrids. By leveraging the highly controllable power electronics (PE) interfaces - voltage source inverters (VSIs), and advanced measurement technology - synchrophasor, we propose a novel interface control strategy, through which desirable power sharing behavior among coupled microgrids can be achieved. Angle droop method is adopted for real power sharing instead of the widely used frequency droop control, which {{eliminates the need for}} secondary level frequency control. For reactive power sharing, voltage droop control implemented with integrator is adopted, which pro-vides e?ective support for voltage dynamics and interaction among interconnected microgrids. Better transient performance can be achieved with the proposed interface control strategy compared with conventional power systems interfaced through synchronous generators (SGs). For the proposed system con?guration and interface control strategy, small signal and transient stability problems are investigated. Several criteria are derived, based on which the system stability can be evaluated with computationally e?cient algorithms and dynamic security assessed and managed in a timely manner. With future distribution grids con?gured as microgrid interconnections, a three level hierarchical control framework is proposed. At the primary level the model reference control (MRC) is performed for interface parameter online tuning, through which each VSI-interface is controlled to track a designed reference model. At the secondary level, a droop gain management scheme is proposed to adjust the angle and voltage droop gains based on system stability assessment results.
