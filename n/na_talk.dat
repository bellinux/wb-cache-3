The detector has been installed and commissioned in 1995 and 1996. First physics data were recorded during 42 days in fall 1997 yielding more events than the previous experiment <b>NA</b> 31. The <b>talk</b> presents the apparatus performance, data quality, {{the current status of}} the physics analysis and ongoing activities. The experiment has performed another data run from May to September 1998, which has given a substantial increase in statistics. (11 refs) ...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, there {{circulated}} rumors {{throughout the}} rap industry that <b>Nas</b> was in <b>talks</b> with Irv Gotti to sign to Murder Inc. Although the rumors proved false, {{they did not}} help strengthen ties between Nas and 50 Cent. Initially, the two had been relatively close associates, with Nas featuring in two tracks on 50 Cent's 2002 album Guess Who's Back?. However, time led to the two becoming estranged. 50 Cent cites Nas's erratic behavior {{as a reason for}} his distrust. 50 notes that while Nas has in the past stood for peace, he was also the same person on June 27, 2002, that although unprovoked, verbally attacked several rappers including Cam'ron, Nelly, N.O.R.E. and New York Hot97 radio disc jockey Angie Martinez. Nas later apologized to those he had attacked, reverting to his previous peaceful beliefs.|$|R
2500|$|From 1977 to 1981, Jon [...] "Bowzer" [...] Bauman hosted {{other musicians}} on his {{television}} show Sha <b>Na</b> <b>Na.</b> He <b>talked</b> with Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Charlie Thomas of the Drifters, discovering {{in the process}} {{that they were being}} victimized by [...] "knock-off" [...] groups of performers using the name of a famous group without having a member of that group. Ben E. King said he, Thomas and Bill Pinkney were losing out on potential gigs and income because there were [...] "so many fake Drifters performing". Herb Reed of the Platters told Bauman that his group had experienced [...] "about 30" [...] court cases fighting against fake groups. Researching the laws, Bauman found that the original musicians had scant legal protection against their group name being used by promoters or other performers, so he determined to amend the existing laws to increase protection for the original musicians. He allied with the Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) to bring famous musicians together to help promote these new laws. VGHF President Bob Crosby said of the fake groups [...] "It's a form of identity theft to the artists... Most importantly it is misleading the public for them to think they are seeing the artist who made the hits when they are not." [...] Mary Wilson of the Supremes joined the effort, appearing with Bauman before the US Congress in March 1999. She said [...] "We want these fake groups to say they are tribute groups or get their own name." ...|$|R

40|$|Trata-se de um estudo de abordagem quantitativa, descritivo, prospectivo, que teve como objetivos comparar o volume de dieta enteral prescrito com o administrado aos pacientes internados em Unidades de Terapia Intensiva (UTI); comparar as necessidades calóricas diárias (NCD) dos pacientes com as necessidades calóricas prescritas (NCP) e as administradas (NCA); identificar os motivos e os fatores associados a não administração do volume da dieta enteral prescrita aos pacientes. O estudo foi realizado no período de 21 de agosto a 21 de novembro de 2005, em duas UTIs gerais de um {{hospital}} privado do Município de São Paulo. A coleta dos dados foi feita diariamente por meio de informações contidas no prontuário e na folha de controle da Unidade. Para a análise dos dados, utilizou-se a estatística descritiva para caracterizar a amostra de pacientes, a dieta enteral e os motivos da não administração do volume prescrito. A comparação das médias do volume prescrito com o administrado, assim como das médias das NCD com as NCP e as NCA foram feitas com o teste t-Student para amostras pareadas. Para as comparações, segundo faixas de volumes e calorias foi utilizado o índice Kappa. Valores de p< 0, 05 foram considerados estatisticamente significantes. O método de regressão logística aplicado para verificar os fatores associados à não administração da dieta enteral foi o Stepwise forward que incorporou ao modelo as variáveis que apresentaram significância estatística (p< 0, 05) ou tendência à significância estatística (0, 05 <p< 0. 10). A amostra foi constituída por 61 pacientes, sendo realizados 636 acompanhamentos diários da administração da dieta enteral. Do total de pacientes, observou-se que, em algum momento do acompanhamento, 72, 1 % não receberam o volume prescrito. O tempo decorrido entre a internação na UTI e o início da TNE foi, em média, de 2, 5 dias. Das avaliações feitas (n= 636), a maioria das dietas (57, 6 %) eram especializadas e foram administradas por meio de sondas enterais posicionadas no estômago (56, 9 %). Dos 604 acompanhamentos em que houve prescrição médica de dieta, em 30, 2 % houve pausa na administração (duração média de 6, 1 horas), durante o período programado para a infusão da dieta e em 23, 6 % a administração foi contínua em razão do uso de bomba de insulina. Constatou-se que, em média, o volume de dieta administrado, 1118, 8 ± 400, 4 ml, foi menor do que o prescrito, 1257, 2 ± 306, 9 ml (p= 0, 000). A análise comparativa das NCD com as NCP e NCA mostrou evidência estatística (p= 0, 000) que permite afirmar que tanto as NCP como as NCA, foram, em média, menores do que as NCD dos pacientes. NCA (1164, 8 ± 508, 2) foram menores do que as NCD (1797, 1 ± 292, 7 calorias) requeridas pelos pacientes. 59, 0 % dos pacientes conseguiram atingir pelo menos 80, 0 % das NCD, em média com 4, 8 dias de TNE. A comparação dos valores classificados por faixas mostrou moderada concordância entre os volumes prescritos e administrados (Kappa= 0, 614) e baixa concordância entre as NCD e NCP (Kappa= 0, 191) e NCD e NCA (Kappa= 0, 100). De um total de 308 motivos que levaram a não administração do volume prescrito (1, 06 motivos por acompanhamento) o cálculo errado da velocidade de infusão pela equipe de enfermagem foi predominante (20, 8 %), seguido pela realização de exames diagnósticos ou terapêuticos e procedimentos cirúrgicos (14, 9 %). Do total de motivos, 70, 6 % eram evitáveis. Os fatores associados a não administração do volume de dieta enteral prescrito foram a idade (diminuição de 7 % do risco a cada ano acrescentado à idade), a velocidade de infusão (diminuição de 4 % do risco a cada ponto de aumento da velocidade) e necessidade calórica diária (aumento de 0, 4 % da chance a cada unidade calórica requerida pelo paciente). Os resultados apontam para a necessidade de um maior número de estudos que investiguem os eventos adversos relacionados à administração da dieta enteral com vistas a assegurar o atendimento das reais necessidades nutricionais dos pacientes graves internados <b>na</b> UTI. It <b>talks</b> about a {{study of}} prospective, descriptive and quantitative approach, which has as objectives to compare the volume of enteral diet which was prescribed with the one administrated to the interned patients in the Unit of Intensive Care (UIC); to compare the daily caloric necessities (DCN) of the patients with the prescribed caloric necessities (PCN) and the administrated ones (ACN); to identify the reasons and the factors associated {{to the absence of}} the administration of the volume of prescribed enteral diet to the patients. The study took place between 21 st of August and 21 st of November, 2005 in two general units of intensive care of a private hospital in the city of São Paulo. The data assessment was done on a daily basis through information which was in the prontuary and the papers of control on the Intensive Care. For the data analyses a descriptive statistics was used to distinguish the patients, the enteral diet and the reasons of the absence of administration of the prescribed volume. The comparison of the average of the 2 volumes (prescribed and administrated), as well as the average among the DCN with the PCN and ACN was done with the t-Student test to matched samples. To the comparisons concerning volumes and calories the rate Kappa was used. Values of p< 0, 05 were considered statistically meaningful. The method of logistic regression applied to check the factors associated with the absence of administration of enteral diet was the Stepwise forward which attached to the model the variables that present statistics significance (p< 0, 05) or likeliness to statistics significance (0, 05 <p< 0, 10). The sample was of 61 patients with 636 daily attendances of the administration of enteral diet. From the total of the patients, it was observed that in a certain moment of the attendance, 72, 1 % did not receive the prescribed volume. The time between the internment in the UIC {{and the beginning of the}} enteral nutritional therapy (ENT) was, on average of 2, 5 days. From the evaluations which were done (n= 636) the majority of the diets (57, 6 %) were specialized and were administrated through enteral catheter placed in the stomach (56, 9 %). From the 604 attendances which had diet medical prescription, in 30, 2 % there was a pause in the administration (length of 6, 1 hours), in the programmed period for the infusion of the diet and in 23, 6 % the administration was the continuous due to the use of insulin bomb. It was seen that, on average, the volume of the diet which was administrated, 111, 8 +/- 4000, 4 ml, was smaller that the prescribed, 1, 257, 2 +/- 306, 9 ml (p= 0, 000). The comparative analyses of the DCN with the PCN and CAN showed statistics evidence (p= 0, 000) which shows that not only the PCN but also the CAN were, on average, smaller that the DCN of the patients. The ACN (1164, 8 +/- 508, 2) were smaller that the DCN (1797, 1 +/- 292, 7 calories) required by the patients. 59, 0 % of the patients could reach at least 80, 0 % of the DCN, on average with the 4, 8 days of ENT. The comparison of the values classified by strips showed a moderate concordance between the prescribed and administrated volumes (Kappa= 0, 614) and low concordance between the DCN and PCN (Kappa= 0, 191) and DCN and ACN (Kappa= 0, 100). From a number of 308 reasons of the absence of the administration of the prescribed volume (1, 06 reasons by attendance) the wrong calculation of the speed from the infusion by the nursing team was predominant (20, 8 %) followed by diagnostic or therapeutic exams and surgical procedures (14, 9 %). From all reasons, 70, 6 % were avoidable. The factors associated to the absence of administration of the volume of prescribed enteral diet were the age (decrease of 7 % of risk to each year added to the age), the speed of infusion (decrease of 4 % of risk to each point of speed increase) and the daily caloric necessity (increase of 0, 4 % of chance to each required caloric unit by the patient). The results lead to a necessity of more numerous studies that look into adverse events related to the administration of enteral diet to guarantee the real nutritional necessities of serious patients interned in the UIC...|$|R
