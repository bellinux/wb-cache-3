[...] They accused him of [...] "talking to the others about Jihad." [...] But it was worth it, Kurnaz said, because [...] "We were connected to the world again!

60|$|The <b>news</b> {{which they}} <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> {{at the village}} where they had crossed, {{of the state of}} affairs among the tribes of the north, was not encouraging.

60|$|Opening {{then the}} wicket {{of the main}} gate, the keepers {{suffered}} Butler to depart, who hastened to carry his horror and fear beyond the walls of Edinburgh. His first purpose was instantly to take the road homeward; but other fears and cares, connected with the <b>news</b> he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> in that remarkable day, induced him to linger in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh until daybreak. More than one group of persons passed {{him as he was}} whiling away the hours of darkness that yet remained, whom, from the stifled tones of their discourse, the unwonted hour when they travelled, and the hasty pace at which they walked, he conjectured to have been engaged in the late fatal transaction.|$|R
60|$|Five minutes later, the {{squadron}} again started {{on their way}} south. Ryan, after silently cursing his bad luck at having arrived at the spot just as this body of cavalry were crossing, wondered what evil fortune had sent them there, at that precise moment. He was not long in arriving at a conclusion. The convoy of the French wounded had arrived at Zamora, late in the evening; and the commandant, thinking it likely that the enemy, who had hitherto blocked the roads, might have concentrated for {{the attack on the}} column, had decided upon sending off a squadron of cavalry to carry the important <b>news</b> he <b>had</b> <b>learned,</b> from the wounded, of the defeat of the column, five thousand strong, coming to his relief from Valladolid.|$|R

The first broadcast from their new base took place on 2 July 2005. Along with the move, <b>news</b> reporters <b>had</b> to <b>learn</b> a range of new skills, such as editing their own reports. The new practices contrasted with early reporting, which had an average crew of five. The new equipment required only a camera operator, who could also operate sound equipment, and a reporter.

Then the idea struck me that it would be as well to ask if they had been seen on the quays, and I sent off a fresh batch of men to make inquiries. A quarter of an hour ago one of them came back with the <b>news</b> that he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> from a sailor that he had noticed a dark colored foreigner, whom he took to be a Lascar sailor, talking to a boatman, and that they had rowed off together to a barge anchored a short way out; he did not notice anything more about him.|$|R
60|$|Several of {{the wounded}} died on their way down, among them Sir Herbert Stewart, who had survived his wound a much longer time than the {{surgeons}} had at first believed possible. One piece of <b>news</b> that they <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> the day before they left the neighbourhood of Metemmeh had some slight effect in cheering Rupert, a native of that town having reported that a white prisoner had been brought in {{on the day after}} the battle near the town; he had been captured by some men of the Jahrin tribe and not by the regular troops of the Mahdi; three or four days later there had been a quarrel, the Mahdi's people wanting to take the prisoner and send him up to Khartoum; his captors had objected, claiming him as their private property; but as they were only a small party he would doubtless have been taken from them by force had they not, during the night, stolen out of the town with him, taken a boat, crossed the river, and made off.|$|R

50|$|Act II brings on {{the third}} group of characters, Lady Ample and her {{servants}} Engine and Ginet. The Lady is a young heiress who has been under the guardianship of Sir Tyrant Thrift — a guardianship that is scheduled to end the next day. Sir Tyrant has gone to find a husband for Lady Ample, to further his control over her; but the Lady has plans of her own. As his name indicates, Sir Tyrant is a skinflint who has allowed his ward and her servants meager upkeep; Lady Ample has surmounted this by allowing herself to be courted by rich men, and using their expensive presents of gems and other fine things to improve her standard of living. The Lady's cousin Lucy bursts in with distressing <b>news.</b> Lucy's aunt <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> of the money she gave to young Pallatine; assuming (incorrectly) that Lucy has surrendered her virginity to her lover, the aunt has tossed the girl out of her house. Ample is also offended at Lucy's conduct — but {{over the fact that}} Lucy has given money to a man, instead of the other way around.|$|R

This report, {{which is part of}} a Nordic research project on the rise of the business press, describes how the field of business <b>news</b> production <b>has</b> evolved in Denmark. Based on a large quantitative analysis of news content in two Danish dailies, "Berlingske Tidende" and "Børsen", the report first shows how a market for business <b>news</b> <b>has</b> developed, and then shows how the volume of business <b>news</b> <b>has</b> expanded and the content features and formats of business <b>news</b> <b>have</b> changed with the development of the field. The analysis suggests that with the expansion of business news a dual process of professionalization and popularization of business journalism has occurred...|$|R
40|$|The <b>news</b> <b>has</b> changed greatly {{during the}} past two decades. In {{response}} to the intensely competitive media environment created by cable news and entertainment, <b>news</b> outlets <b>have</b> softened their coverage. Their <b>news</b> <b>has</b> also become increasingly critical in tone. Soft news and critical journalism have not stopped the decline in news audiences. Cable television and, more recently, the Internet have cut deeply into the readership of newspapers and news magazines and into the viewing audiences for network and local newscasts. This attrition might have been even greater if the <b>news</b> <b>had</b> not been recast into a softer and more critical form. One thing is certain: <b>news</b> consumption <b>has</b> fallen dramatically {{during the past}} decade. ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was from}} this {{fascinating}} path--the scene {{to me of}} so much delicious musing, when life was young and promised to be happy, that I {{have been unable to}} pass it over without an episodical description--it was, I say, from this romantic path that Butler saw the morning arise the day after the murder of Porteous. It was possible for him with ease to have found a much shorter road to the house to which he was directing his course, and, in fact, that which he chose was extremely circuitous. But to compose his own spirits, as well as to while away the time, until a proper hour for visiting the family without surprise or disturbance, he was induced to extend his circuit by the foot of the rocks, and to linger upon his way until the morning should be considerably advanced. While, now standing with his arms across, and waiting the slow progress of the sun above the horizon, now sitting upon one of the numerous fragments which storms had detached from the rocks above him, he is meditating, alternately upon the horrible catastrophe which he had witnessed, and upon the melancholy, and to him most interesting, <b>news</b> which he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> at Saddletree's, we will give the reader to understand who Butler was, and how his fate was connected with that of Effie Deans, the unfortunate handmaiden of the careful Mrs. Saddletree.|$|R

60|$|This, then, {{as well as}} {{the waters}} which join us to the world, has done {{something}} to tinge us with romance. For when so many have their loved ones over the seas, walking amid hillmen's bullets, or swamp malaria, where death is sudden and distance great, then mind communes with mind, and strange stories arise of dream, presentiment or vision, where the mother sees her dying son, and is past the first bitterness of her grief ere the message comes which should <b>have</b> broken the <b>news.</b> The <b>learned</b> <b>have</b> of late looked into the matter and have even labelled it with a name; but what can we know more of it save that a poor stricken soul, when hard-pressed and driven, can shoot across the earth some ten-thousand-mile-distant picture of its trouble to the mind which is most akin to it. Far be it from me to say that there lies no such power within us, for of all things which the brain will grasp the last will be itself; but yet it is well to be very cautious over such matters, for once at least I have known that which was within the laws of nature seem to be far upon the further side of them.|$|R
