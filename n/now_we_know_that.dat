In an article for the National Geographic published in 2000, Benchley writes [...] "considering the knowledge accumulated about sharks in the last 25 years, I couldn't possibly write Jaws today... not in good conscience anyway. Back then, it was generally accepted that great whites were anthropophagus (they ate people) by choice. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> almost every attack on a human is an accident: The shark mistakes the human for its normal prey." [...] Upon his death in 2006, Benchley's widow Wendy declared the author [...] "kept telling people the book was fiction", and comparing Jaws to The Godfather, [...] "he took no more responsibility for the fear of sharks than Mario Puzo took responsibility for the Mafia." ...|$|E
500|$|Heading {{the cast}} of Doppelgänger is Roy Thinnes {{in the role of}} Colonel Glenn Ross of NASA. Anderson, who {{perceived}} a likeness to fellow American actor Paul Newman, cast Thinnes as the male lead after viewing his performance in the television series The Invaders (1967–68). In the Andersons' draft script, Ross's first name is Stewart, and he {{is said to have been}} the first man to walk on Mars. In a 2008 interview, Thinnes said, [...] "I thought [...] was an interesting premise, although <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there isn't another planet on the other side of the Sun, through our space exploration and telescopic abilities. But at that time it was conceivable, and it could have been scary." [...] To conform to the script's characterisation of Ross, and to the detriment of his respiratory health, Thinnes ended up smoking many packets' worth of cigarettes in the course of the production. Reporting on Thinnes' intention to demand a non-smoking clause in his next film contract, in September 1969 Australian newspaper The Age stated, [...] "He smokes about two packets a day, but the perpetual lighting up of new cigarettes for continuity purposes was too much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boyle {{also had}} a monogenist {{perspective}} about race origin. He was a pioneer studying races, and he believed that all human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, {{came from the same}} source: Adam and Eve. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured albinos, so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Boyle also extended the theories of Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton about colour and light via optical projection (in physics) into discourses of polygenesis, speculating that maybe these differences were due to [...] "seminal impressions". Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for complexion at his time, {{due to the fact that}} <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> skin colour is disposed by genes, which are actually contained in the semen. Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for [...] "European Eyes", beauty was not measured so much in colour of skin, but in [...] "stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face". Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as [...] "disturbing" [...] or [...] "amusing".|$|E
2500|$|The first Raf gene, v-Raf {{was found}} in 1983. It was {{isolated}} from the murine retrovirus bearing the number 3611. It was soon demonstrated to be capable to transform rodent fibroblasts to cancerous cell lines, so this gene was given the name Virus-induced Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (V-RAF). A year later, another transforming gene {{was found in}} the avian retrovirus MH2, named v-Mil - {{that turned out to be}} highly similar to v-Raf. Researchers were able to demonstrate that these genes encode enzymes that have serine-threonine kinase activity. Normal cellular homologs of v-Raf and v-Mil were soon found in both the mouse and chicken genome (hence the name c-Raf for the normal cellular Raf gene), and it became clear that these too had a role in regulating growth and cell division. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> c-Raf is a principal component of the first described mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: ERK1/2 signaling. It acts as a MAP3 kinase, initiating the entire kinase cascade. Subsequent experiments showed that the normal, cellular Raf genes can also mutate to become oncogenes, by [...] "overdriving" [...] MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity. In fact, vertebrate genomes contain multiple Raf genes. Several years later after the discovery of c-Raf, two further related kinases were described: A-Raf and [...] B-Raf. The latter became the focus of research in recent years, since a large portion of human tumors carry oncogenic 'driver' mutations in the B-Raf gene. These mutations induce an uncontrolled, high activity of Raf enzymes. Thus diagnostic and therapeutic interest in Raf kinases reached a new peak in the recent years.|$|E
