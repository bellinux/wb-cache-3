40|$|Artificial reefs are {{commonly}} used as a management tool, in part to provide ecosystem services, including opportunities for recreational fishing and diving. Quantifying the use of artificial reefs by recreational boaters is essential for determining their value as ecosystem services. In this study, four artificial-natural reef pairs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (off western Florida) were investigated for boat visitation rates using autonomous acoustic recorders. Digital SpectroGram (DSG) recorders were used to collect sound files from April 2013 to March 2015. An automatic detection algorithm was used to identify boat noise in individual files using the harmonic peaks generated by boat engines, and by comparing the sound amplitude of each file with surrounding files. In all four pairs, visitation rates were significantly higher at the artificial reef than the natural reef. This increase in boat visitation was likely due to actual or perceived increased quality of fishing and diving at the artificial reefs, or to {{lack of knowledge of}} the presence or locations of the <b>natural</b> <b>reefs.</b> <b>Inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> (25 m depth).

40|$|While {{increasing}} atmospheric {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) concentration alters global water chemistry (Ocean Acidification; OA), {{the degree of}} changes vary on local and regional spatial scales. <b>Inshore</b> fringing coral <b>reefs</b> of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are subjected {{to a variety of}} local pressures, and some sites may already be marginal habitats for corals. The spatial and temporal variation in directly measured parameters: Total Alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and derived parameters: partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2); pH and aragonite saturation state (Var) were measured at 14 <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> over a two year period in the GBR region. Total Alkalinity varied between 2069 and 2364 mmol kg 21 and DIC concentrations ranged from 1846 to 2099 mmol kg 21. This resulted in pCO 2 concentrations from 340 to 554 matm, with higher values during the wet seasons and pCO 2 on <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> distinctly above atmospheric values. However, due to temperature effects, Var was not further reduced in the wet season.

We conducted visual surveys {{of fish and}} benthic communities on nine reefs (3 – 24 km from shore) in the Thuwal area of the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea.

40|$|Trajectories {{of decline}} have been {{described}} in coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region, with long-term losses of abundance, diversity and habitat structure. Since European settlement of the Queensland coastline in the mid- 18 th century, widespread changes in land use have occurred within Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments (e. g. extensive land clearing, agriculture and grazing). Despite direct and indirect evidence indicating decline of <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs,</b> it has proven difficult to ascertain links between land use changes, terrestrial discharge, water quality {{and the decline of}} coral reefs at regional scales, and the contributions of anthropogenic influences to the disturbance regimes of <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> remains highly controversial. This thesis uses palaeoecological reconstruction of coral assemblages and high-precision U-Series dating to examine changes in community structure of <b>inshore</b> coral <b>reefs</b> in the Palm Islands region across decadal and centennial scales. Comparisons of modern and historical coral assemblages provide evidence of a collapse of Acropora coral communities at Pelorus Reef in the early 20 th Century. Fossil assemblages in an adjacent site at Pelorus provide further evidence of an extrinsic shift from historical Acropora assemblages to more sediment-tolerant corals in modern assemblages, a change without precedence in 800 years of record. Sediment cores (2 - 5 m length) were extracted from Pandora and Havannah reefs to determine long-term rates of reef growth throughout the late Holocene. Computer Axial Tomography (CAT) scans of cores revealed a framework dominated by coral fragments, and U-Series dating of corals revealed rapid and continuous reef growth at both reefs throughout the last 1000 yrs. Comparisons of reef accretion (m ka- 1) from cores with published accretion rates from early-mid Holocene <b>inshore</b> GBR <b>reefs</b> show that reef slope environments are now accreting at rates equal to and exceeding those of the last 8000 years. This result contradicts assumptions that <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> are undergoing or have undergone natural trajectories of geomorphic decline. A bayesian approach to determine stability of coral communities from the Pandora and Havannah cores indicates that those coral communities have existed in stable states for upwards of 400 yrs, punctuated by periods of instability. Contrary to some paradigms of biodiversity, the high diversity communities were unstable on centennial scales, 4 yet the low diversity assemblages did not necessarily confer stability to these assemblages. Growth rates of <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> were independent of diversity or community structure. From a management perspective, these results provide a longer-term (decades to centuries) understanding of coral community dynamics on <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> of the GBR that provides a basis for detecting and understanding changes following European settlement, and a baseline for the management and potential restoration of coral communities at local and regional scales...|$|R

Knowledge of the spatial extents of trophic interactions is important for understanding food webs, and for making spatial management practices more efficient. We demonstrate trophic linkages between detached (drift) fragments of the kelp Ecklonia radiata and the purple sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma among discrete rocky reefs separated by kilometres. Sea urchins were abundant at one <b>inshore</b> <b>reef,</b> where the biomass of drift was usually high. There, sea urchins trapped detached kelp at high rates, although local kelp abundance was low. Most detached kelp present on the reef was retained by sea urchins. Detached seagrass, which was abundant on the reef, was not retained by sea urchins in large quantities. Experiments with tethered pieces of kelp showed that sea urchins only consumed detached fragments, and did not consume attached kelps. Comparisons of the morphology of detached fragments of kelp collected from the <b>inshore</b> <b>reef</b> to attached kelps from reefs further offshore showed that a large proportion (30 – 95 %, varying among dates) of the fragments originated at distant reefs (≥ 2 km away). At the <b>inshore</b> <b>reef,</b> the sea urchin H. erythrogramma is subsidised by detached kelps, and detached kelp fragments have been transported across landscapes.

After 6 months, settlement tile communities from <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> were dominated by high biomass algal turfs (Wlamentous algae and cyanobacteria) whereas tiles located on oVshore reefs were characterised by a mixed low biomass community of calcareous crustose algae, Xeshy crustose algae and bare tile.

40|$|Although mass coral {{bleaching}} events are generally triggered by high seawater temperatures, experiments {{have demonstrated that}} corals and reef-dwelling foraminifers bleach more readily when exposed to high energy, short wavelength solar radiation (blue, violet and ultraviolet [UVR]: Lambda 280 - 490 nm). In seawater, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), also called gelbstoff, preferentially absorbs these shorter wavelengths, which consequently bleach and degrade the CDOM. Alteration of watersheds and destruction of coastal wetlands have reduced natural sources of CDOM to reefal waters. I tested the null hypothesis that CDOM does not differ between reefs that differ in coral health, and that water transparency to UVR is not a factor in reef health. I measured absorption of UVR and UV irradiance at various reefs in the Florida Keys that differ in distance from shore and degree of anthropogenic development of the adjacent shoreline. My results show that intact shoreline - associated <b>reefs</b> and <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> tend {{to be exposed to}} lower intensities of UVR, and lower degrees of photic stress, than developed shoreline - associated reefs and offshore reefs. Absorption due to CDOM (ag 320) was higher, and photic stress, as revealed by increased production of UV-absorbing compounds, Mycosporine - like Amino Acids (MAAs), was lower at the surface compared to the bottom. The following results support my conclusion: ag 320 and UV attenuation coefficients (Kd 2 ̆ 7 s) were higher at intact compared to developed shoreline - associated <b>reefs,</b> and at <b>inshore</b> compared to offshore reefs. Spectral slope, S, was higher at offshore compared to <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs,</b> indicating a higher degree of photobleaching of CDOM.

Solar energy reaching the benthos at two <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> of the same depth (6 m) was approximately an order of magnitude higher at the reef near developed shoreline compared to the reef near intact shoreline, and may be due to greater degree of diffuseness of the underwater light field combined with lower ag at the developed shoreline-associated reef...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} reports {{the results of}} the first {{quantitative}} survey of lesions on coral and crustose coralline algae (CCA) on reefs in the lagoon of New Caledonia. Surveys on <b>inshore</b> and offshore <b>reefs</b> were conducted at 13 sites in 2010, with 12 sites resurveyed in 2013. Thirty coral diseases affecting 15 coral genera were found, with low overall disease prevalence (, 1 %). This study extends the known distribution of growth anomalies to the coral genera Platygyra and Hydnophora, endolithic hypermycosis to Platygyra, Leptoria and Goniastrea and extends the geographic range of three CCA diseases. We found the first trematode infection in Porites outside of Hawaii. Disease prevalence differed among coral genera, with Porites having more lesions, and Acropora andMontipora fewer lesions, than expected on the basis of field abundance. <b>Inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> had a lower coral-colony density, species diversity and reduced CCA cover than did the offshore reefs. Disease prevalence was significantly higher on <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> in 2013 than in 2010, but did not change on offshore reefs.

40|$|The <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have {{undergone}} significant declines in water quality following European settlement (approx. 1870 AD). However, direct evidence of impacts on coral assemblages {{is limited by}} a lack of historical baselines prior to the onset of modern monitoring programmes in the early 1980 s. Through palaeoecological reconstructions, we report a previously undocumented historical collapse of Acropora assemblages at Pelorus Island (central GBR). High-precision U-series dating of dead Acropora fragments indicates that this collapse occurred between 1920 and 1955, with fewdates obtained after 1980. Prior to this event, our results indicate remarkable long-term stability in coral community structure over centennial scales. We suggest that chronic increases in sediment flux and nutrient loading following European settlement acted as the ultimate cause for the lack of recovery of Acropora assemblages following a series of acute disturbance events (SST anomalies, cyclones and flood events). Evidence for major degradation in reef condition owing to human impacts prior to modern ecological surveys indicates that current monitoring of <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs</b> on the GBR may be predicated on a significantly shifted baseline...|$|R

40|$|Interactions between water motion, primary productivity, and {{herbivory}} are complex. Rates of grazing by fish on tropical {{coral reefs}} and by sea urchins on temperate rocky reefs are usually high, {{but can be}} low in areas of extreme water motion. Some herbivores can switch between mobile (grazing) and sedentary (drift-feeding) behaviours, and this can be influenced by water motion. We compared the relative consumption of the kelp Ecklonia radiata at rocky reefs in western Australia with different wave exposures (inshore versus offshore). No herbivory was recorded offshore, suggesting that wave exposure might inhibit herbivory. We also compared grazing by fish and sea urchins, and grazing versus drift-feeding pathways. Grazing by fish and sea urchins was low, except at one <b>inshore</b> <b>reef</b> where grazing by fish was intense. In contrast, drift-feeding by sea urchins was recorded at all <b>inshore</b> <b>reefs,</b> suggesting {{that this is a}} ubiquitous behaviour in the region. We measured productivity of E. radiata to determine if spatial patterns in rates of herbivory matched those of productivity. Productivity of E. radiata was higher on offshore reefs at one location. The observed difference in consumption between <b>inshore</b> and offshore <b>reefs</b> at both locations suggests that consumption is not limited by productivity, but by exposure. Further, the high productivity offshore combined with low rates of herbivory suggest that offshore reefs might be a source of kelp that subsidises other habitats...|$|R

40|$|Tropical storms (cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons) are {{the most}} severe form of {{mechanical}} disturbance of coral reefs. In 2005, severe tropical cyclone Ingrid crossed the far northern Great Barrier Reef, a region {{that had not been}} affected by a major disturbance for several decades, and where benthic data had been collected before the cyclone crossed. This storm provided a unique opportunity to improve understanding of the extent and type of damage inflicted on inshore and offshore coral reefs along a gradient of wind speeds. Modeled maximum wind speeds ranged from 46 m s- 1 (equivalent to category 4) near the path to 22 m s- 1 (category 1) ∼ 70 km to either side of the path.
