5|$|The Nisshōki flag is {{designated}} as the <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> in the Law Regarding the <b>National</b> <b>Flag</b> and National Anthem, which was promulgated and became effective on August 13, 1999. Although no earlier legislation had specified a <b>national</b> <b>flag,</b> the sun-disc flag had already become the de facto <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> of Japan. Two proclamations issued in 1870 by the Daijō-kan, the governmental body of the early Meiji period, each had a provision for a design of the <b>national</b> <b>flag.</b> A sun-disc flag was adopted as the <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> for merchant ships under Proclamation No. 57 of Meiji 3 (issued on February 27, 1870), and as the <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> used by the Navy under Proclamation No. 651 of Meiji 3 (issued on October 27, 1870). Use of the Hi no maru was severely restricted {{during the early years}} of the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II; these restrictions were later relaxed.|$|E

5|$|The Law on the <b>National</b> <b>Flag</b> {{mentions}} five possible sizes {{that could}} be made for the national flag: According to Article 4 of the Law On the <b>National</b> <b>Flag,</b> people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government are directed to authorize companies to make any copy of the <b>national</b> <b>flag.</b> Besides five official sizes for flying on flagpoles, there are another four smaller sizes for other purpose, such as decoration on cars or display in the meeting room.|$|E
50|$|All <b>national</b> <b>flags</b> are rectangular, {{except for}} the flag of Nepal. The ratios of height to width vary among <b>national</b> <b>flags,</b> but none is taller than it is wide, again {{except for the}} flag of Nepal. The flags of Switzerland and the Vatican City are the only <b>national</b> <b>flags</b> which are exact squares.|$|R
50|$|Nordic flag designs {{very similar}} to Denmark's, Sweden's, and Norway's <b>national</b> <b>flags</b> were {{proposed}} as Germany's <b>national</b> <b>flags</b> in both 1919 and 1948, after World War I and World War II, respectively. Today, the Nordic cross is a feature in some city and district flags or coats of arms.|$|R

5|$|The {{day of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Flag</b> of Armenia {{is marked}} on 15 June every year. The day is chosen {{for the reason that}} the Armenian law on the <b>National</b> <b>Flag</b> of Armenia was passed on 15 June 2006. The day of the Armenian tricolour was celebrated {{for the first time on}} 15 June 2010 in Yerevan.|$|E
5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived {{the flag of}} Japan as the <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> even before {{the passage of the}} Law Regarding the <b>National</b> <b>Flag</b> and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E
5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the <b>national</b> <b>flag,</b> although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the <b>national</b> <b>flag.</b> The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} mourning {{style is}} {{to wrap the}} spherical finial with black cloth and place a black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style {{dates back to the}} death of Emperor Meiji on July 30, 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> should be raised in mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the <b>national</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1854, {{during the}} Tokugawa shogunate, Japanese ships {{were ordered to}} hoist the Hinomaru to {{distinguish}} themselves from foreign ships. Before then, different types of Hinomaru flags were used on vessels that were trading with the U.S. and Russia. The Hinomaru was decreed the merchant flag of Japan in 1870 and was the legal <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> from 1870 to 1885, making it the first <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> Japan adopted.|$|E

The <b>national</b> <b>flag</b> is not used by coast guard ships and military warships; both classes of ships have their own specific ensigns.|$|E
