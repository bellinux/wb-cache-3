Here we describe a possible instance affecting a Citril Finch Serinus citrinella nest in the Spanish Pre-Pyrenees. The nest was found on 18 May 2002, when building activity was detected. On 1 June, the female was observed with five eggs hatching, apparently normally. Two weeks later, on 14 June we tried to detect signs of parental behaviour, but did not manage to make contact with the birds at the nest site. During a <b>nest</b> <b>control</b> on 18 June we found it to contain only one egg, and to have been totally invaded by mountain ants Formica rufa. No dead chicks or broken eggs were found...|$|E
40|$|The citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McGregor), is a {{relatively}} new pest to South African citriculture, the first recorded injury to citrus trees was from Rustenberg, Transvaal in 1950 (Smith 1953). In the U. S. A. the biology of this mite has been studied by Quayle (1938), Prendergast (1938), English and Turnipseed (1941), DeBach (1947), DeBach et al. (1950), Ebeling (1959) and Jeppson et al. (1957, 1961). However, in South Africa little information is available concerning the ecolopy of the citrus red mite. The majority of the literature pertaining to P. citri in Republic, (Smith (1953), Mentz (1954), Stofberg (1959), Schwartz (1965) and Brodrick (1965) is of a descriptive nature, and mainly concerned with the chemical control of the mite. The only biological investigation on the development of P. citri, and the effect of insecticides and insect predators on its biology, under South African conditions, was made by van Rooyen (1966) at Zebediela, Transvaal. In the control of citrus pests, such as the citrus red mite, that need for a better understanding of their ecology has been well emphasised by DeBach (1951) and Griffiths (1951). DeBach (1951) in particular, stressed the danger of the continued reliance on insecticidal treatment as the only method of <b>nest</b> <b>control,</b> and has pointed out that persistent chemical applications may only serve to intensify the pest problem. He has suggested that a closer study of the environment of the pest species could provide a solution to the problems now encountered as a result of insecticidal control measures.

40|$|ABSTRACT Male gladiator frogs of Hypsiboas Wagler, 1830 build nests on {{available}} substrate surrounding {{ponds and}} streams where female spawn eggs during the breeding period. Although gladiator frogs seem to show plasticity {{in the way}} they construct their nests, there is no study reporting if these species present preferences about microhabitat conditions for nest-building (mainly under subtropical climate). Predation pressure and environmental conditions have been considered major processes shaping the great diversity of reproductive strategies performed by amphibians, but microhabitat conditions should explain where to build a nest as well as how nest looks. This study aimed to test nest site selection for nest-building by Hypsiboas faber(Wied-Neuwied, 1821), determining which factors are related to nest site selection and nest features. The survey was conducted at margins of two permanent ponds in Southern Brazil. Habitat factors were evaluated in 18 plots with nest and 18 plots in the surrounding without <b>nest</b> (<b>control),</b> describing vegetation structure and heterogeneity, and substrate characteristics. Water temperature was measured inside the nest and in its adjacency. Nest features assessed were area, depth and temperature. Habitat characteristics differed between plots with and without nest. Microhabitat selected for nest-building was characterized by great vegetation cover and height, as well as shallower water and lower cover of organic matter in suspension than in plots without nest. Differences between temperature inside nest and in its adjacency were not observed. No relationship between nest features and habitat descriptors was evidenced. Results revealed that Hypsiboas faber does not build nests anywhere. Males seem to prefer more protected habitats, probably avoiding predation, invasion of conspecific males and inclement weather. Lack of differences between temperature inside- and outside-nest suggest that nest do not improve this condition for eggs and tadpole development. Nest architecture was not related to habitat characteristics, which may be determined by other factors, as nest checking by females before amplexus. Nest site selection should increase offspring survival as well the breeding success of Hypsiboas faber...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for a rapidly growing double-crested cormorant population to negatively impact fish populations and public resources in North America has focused attention on the feeding ecology and management of this federally protected species. Questions persist regarding the nature of cormorant-fish interactions and the propensity for cormorants to impact fish at the population level. From 1998 to 2003, we conducted research and participated in a management program at Oneida Lake, New York, that incorporated <b>nest</b> <b>control</b> and fall hazing to reduce cormorant populations on the lake. We examined: 1) the behavioral response of cormorants to the management program, 2) cormorant prey selectivity, 3) the impact of varying cormorant predation pressures on walleye and yellow perch populations, and 4) daily cormorant activity patterns and underwater foraging habits at Oneida Lake compared to other colonies in New York. I used radio telemetry and weekly counts to reveal that fall hazing moved cormorants off of Oneida Lake, reducing the September population annually by approximately 95 % of the 1997 level. Most displaced cormorants relocated to nearby Onondaga Lake rather than leaving the region. Diets examined between 1994 and 2003 consisted of 27 different species, but walleye and yellow perch comprised 58 - 72 % by weight annually. I used the relativized electivity index (E*) to determine that cormorants selected age 1 - 3 walleye, and age 2 - 4 yellow perch, with peak selectivity for age- 2 walleye and age- 3 yellow perch. A comparison of the electivity values revealed that fish girth (max. circumference) is the main determinant of the maximum size of fish that cormorants consume. The cormorant control program resulted in a mean reduction in predation pressure on fish populations of approximately 47 % from the 1997 level in 1998 - 2005, which coincided {{with an increase in}} abundance of the adult populations of both walleye and yellow perch. Yellow perch survival increased from age- 1 to age- 3, and walleye survival increased from age- 1 to age- 4 during this time of predator reduction. Time-depth recorders deployed on cormorants from Oneida Lake, Lake Ontario, and Lake Champlain reveal differences in depth utilization but no disparity in the total time spent diving...|$|E

40|$|Virtual nesting is {{a popular}} {{capacity}} control strategy in network revenue management. (See Smith et al. [36].) In virtual nesting, products (itinerary-fare-class combinations) are mapped ("indexed") into {{a relatively small number}} of "virtual classes" on each resource (flight leg) of the network.

40|$|A novel {{configurable}} DC/DC converter architecture, to {{be integrated}} as hard macrocell in automotive embedded systems, is proposed in the paper. It aims at realizing an intelligent voltage regulator. With respect {{to the state of}} the art, the challenge is the integration into an automotive-qualified chip of several advanced features like dithering of switching frequency, <b>nested</b> <b>control</b> loops with both current and voltage feedback, asynchronous hysteretic control for low power mode, slope control of the power FET gate driver, and diagnostic block against out-of-range current or voltage or temperature conditions. Moreover, the converter macrocell can be connected to the in-vehicle digital network, exchanging with the main vehicle control unit status/diagnostic flags and commands. The proposed design can be configured to work both in step-up and step-down modes, to face a very wide operating input voltage range from 2. 5 to 60 V and absolute range from − 0. 3 to 70 V. The main target is regulating all voltages required in the emerging hybrid/electric vehicles where, besides the conventional 12 V DC bus, also a 48 V DC bus is present.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers a}} general concept of nonconservative measures of dynamic system performance via a consistent approach {{in terms of}} signal and system norms and suggests an appropriate iterative procedure for reduction of conservatism {{in the design of}} active structural control systems. This reduction is accomplished by introducing two modified variants of the H 2 -norm leading to less conservative system performance criteria than the conventional H 2 -norm-based performance indices. These modifications make both the stochastic and the deterministic control design specifications less conservative and, at the same time, retain all the benefits of the standard H 2 -norm. In view of model uncertainties, the standard H 2 -method alone (as, virtually, all existing control strategies) may lead to arbitrarily small stability margins. On the contrary, the modern H∞-control method can handle the robust stability problem but cannot guarantee an admissible nominal performance. In the context of robustly stable control design, the dissertation considers the general mixed H 2 /H∞-control problem that is stated as a reduction of the H 2 -norm of one transfer function under a constraint in terms of the H∞-norm of another transfer function. As a solution for this problem, the dissertation introduces a new H 2 /H∞ <b>nested</b> <b>control</b> synthesis which combines the advantages of the both standard control methods. An important practical application of the <b>nested</b> <b>control</b> synthesis to active structural control design, such as control for an optimal H 2 -norm-based performance with guaranteed robust stability, is considered. An iterative algorithm which incorporates a less conservative H 2 -norm-based performance measure into the nested synthesis is introduced. The H 2 /H∞ nested synthesis employs the idea of Youla parametrization of all H 2 -suboptimal controllers. The state-space formulae of a parametrized controller can be obtained in terms of the solutions of two modified Riccati equations. In the new formulation the explicit state-space formulae of the full parametrization are specially derived for the most general case when the traditionally accepted simplifying assumptions are relaxed...|$|R
