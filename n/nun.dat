50|$|This {{view has}} been {{challenged}} and severely criticized by several scholars for denying the cases of <b>nuns</b> implicated in sexual abuse and pedophilia. In 1986, a history scholar from Stanford University, recovered archival information about investigations from 1619 to 1623 involving <b>nuns</b> in Vellano, Italy, secretly exploiting illiterate <b>nuns</b> for several years. In 1998, a religious research national survey on revealed a very high number of <b>nuns</b> reporting childhood victimizations of sexual abuse by other <b>nuns.</b> It was further noted {{that the majority of}} nun-abuse victims are of the same sex. In 2002, Markham examined the sexual histories of <b>nuns</b> to find several cases of <b>nuns</b> sexually abusing children.|$|R

30|$|Earlier I asked another Kinnauri {{professor}} why <b>nuns</b> don’t {{sing about}} <b>nuns.</b> He answered {{that it was}} because there are no famous <b>nuns</b> in Kinnaur, which I took to mean that all Kinnauri <b>nuns</b> are ordinary. Then I asked a jomo why <b>nuns</b> don’t sing about Spello Jomo, who was the best known scholar-practitioner among the jomos in Kinnaur until her death in 1996. She answered, “Because she was an ordinary nun,” and added, “Laywomen would sing about us if we broke our vows” (see, for example, the Song of Sonam Dupke, endnote 11).|$|R

5|$|The Turin {{painting}} was acquired in 1866 {{from the mayor}} of a nearby town.

The documentation is sketchy, but suggests the <b>nun</b> possessed it early in the 19th century during the dissolution of convents in the area under Napoleon. That a <b>nun</b> owned the painting three centuries after Adornes purportedly bequeathed a van Eyck St Francis to his daughter in a convent, and that the Adornes family owned property in Alessandria, is suggestive, but no evidence exists to confirm a connection.|$|E

Consequently, three more <b>nuns,</b> headed by Tissara, arrived in Nanjing.

5|$|Matilda {{had been}} educated in a {{sequence}} of convents, however, and may well have taken the vows to formally become a <b>nun,</b> which formed an obstacle to the marriage progressing. She {{did not wish to}} be a <b>nun</b> and appealed to Anselm for permission to marry Henry, and the Archbishop established a council at Lambeth Palace to judge the issue. Despite some dissenting voices, the council concluded that although Matilda had lived in a convent, she had not actually become a <b>nun</b> and was therefore free to marry, a judgement that Anselm then affirmed, allowing the marriage to proceed. Matilda proved an effective queen for Henry, acting as a regent in England on occasion, addressing and presiding over councils, and extensively supporting the arts. The couple soon had two children, Matilda, born in 1102, and William Adelin, born in 1103; it is possible that they also had a second son, Richard, who died young. Following the birth of these children, Matilda preferred to remain based in Westminster while Henry travelled across England and Normandy, either for religious reasons or because she enjoyed being involved in the machinery of royal governance.|$|E
