500|$|Flynn {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of Disney's most attractive heroes. In 2012, Vanity Fair conducted a poll for which readers were asked to vote for the sexiest Disney hero of all-time. Pairing Flynn against Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid, Flynn beat his competition by less than one percent, garnering 50.35 percent of the total votes. E! ranked the character third in its article [...] "The Definitive Ranking of Disney Princes Based on Overall Dating Eligibility". Writing for Seventeen, YouTube personality Tyler Oakley ranked Flynn the sixth most [...] "dateable" [...] Disney prince. Oakley joked, [...] "I like a man who is unaplogetically himself", continuing, [...] "If you gotta go around with a fake name ... then you're simply <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> level." [...] BuzzFeed author Louis Peitzman ranked Flynn the fourth most attractive Disney prince, praising the character's hair and eyebrows in 2013. BuzzFeed also ranked Flynn second on the website's list of the [...] "Top Ten Hottest Male Cartoon Characters", calling him a [...] "bad boy with a heart of gold".|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

Royal Enfield surpassed Harley-Davidson in global sales in 2015, and received an acknowledgment from US President Barack Obama as {{the guest of honor}} at the 2015 Delhi Republic Day parade. [...] "I saw the Republic Day daredevils on Royal Enfield motorcycles," [...] Obama said, adding that [...] "the secret service doesn't let me ride motorcycles, especially <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head."

2500|$|There {{had been}} a debate in the party on the {{prospects}} of amalgamation with Fianna Fáil, then governing party of the Republic of Ireland, while the possibility of merger with the Irish Labour Party or even Fine Gael have been speculated about by others. Little came of this speculation and former party leader, Margaret Ritchie, rejected the idea. [...] Speaking at the 2010 Labour Party national conference in Galway she said that a merger would not happen while she was leader – [...] "Merger with Fianna Fáil? [...] <b>Not</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> watch." [...] Since his election as Fianna Fáil Leader in January 2011, Micheál Martin has also repeatedly dismissed {{the possibility of a}} merger or electoral alliance with the SDLP.|$|E
2500|$|Corbyn {{believes}} the royal ceremony for the State Opening of Parliament should be abolished, saying in 1998 that: [...] "It's absolutely ridiculous, this 18th-century performance, {{the horses and}} the knights and everybody else turning up for The Queen to read a speech she's never even read before, let alone written". Corbyn's personal preference is for Britain to become a republic, and is a republican, but said that given the Royal Family's popularity, [...] "it's not a battle that I am fighting". In 1991, Corbyn seconded the Commonwealth of Britain Bill brought forward by Tony Benn calling for {{the transformation of the}} United Kingdom ideally into a [...] "democratic, federal and secular Commonwealth of Britain", with an elected president, devolution, abolition of the House of Lords as it currently exists, and equality of representation by men and women in parliament. He said in a TV debate before the 2017 UK general election that abolishing the monarchy is [...] "not on anybody's agenda, it's certainly <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> agenda".|$|E

2500|$|Many {{hold that}} Ludwig {{was murdered by}} his enemies while {{attempting}} to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, [...] "Three years after the king's death I was made {{to swear an oath}} that I would never say certain things — not to my wife, <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war." [...] Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes which were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, in order to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. [...] "As the king stepped up to his boat and put one foot in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." [...] However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt.|$|E
2500|$|The sixth track, [...] "I", {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "moody-electro" [...] and a [...] "dark pop" [...] track. It opens with an Eastern-style introduction which merges into a [...] "romantic synth" [...] part, with Roberts singing [...] "I’m scared to wake up one day and find out that my bubble's burst" [...] and hoping that [...] "everyone loves" [...] her new direction, as well as mentioning her dislike for [...] "people that leave comments on the internet". The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics mean a lot to me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song." [...] The cover is preceded by the song [...] "Say It Out Loud", which has gathered comparisons to Katy Perry, and is a high-energy pop song featuring [...] "Crystal Castles-ish 8-bit bleeps here and there" [...] and a chorus with a [...] "big old fuzzy hollering rush". [...] "Gladiator", the ninth track, {{has been described}} as a Berlin-style dance track. The disco track hears Roberts perform [...] "girly" [...] vocals, with comparisons to Teena Marie and Heartbreak, whilst the following song [...] "Fish Out of Water" [...] garnerered comparisons to Metronomy. Track eleven, [...] "Take a Bite" [...] has been compared to singer Robyn; and features a rap from Roberts including [...] "Called me a rude ginger bitch, they're gonna eat all their words" [...] – referencing a 2003 feud with a member of pop group Busted. The final track [...] "Sticks + Stones" [...] describes a time when she would beg her driver to buy her vodka despite being underage, in relation to the subject matter Roberts explained [...] "How funny that I was too young for so many things, yet you thought I'd cope with being told I'm ugly, Over and over". Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own here." [...] Lyricism on the album, was based around rap, and rhyme with Roberts stating they were based on personal events, she said: ...|$|E
