5|$|A <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> {{along the}} north wall's outside surface {{indicates}} {{the presence of an}} ancient balcony. There are several rooms attached {{to the rear of the}} structure that lack direct access to the main building; these are believed to have been dedicated to community storage. Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito are the only two great houses in Chaco Canyon with corner doorways.|$|E
5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E

40|$|A compact {{multiband}} antenna with multiple <b>narrow</b> <b>slits</b> is studied. The reported antenna yields a multi-band {{response in the}} range of 5 – 8 GHz. But the effect of the multiple <b>narrow</b> <b>slits</b> on the lower order modes of the antenna is not mentioned. Hence, a parametric study of various slot dimensions is carried out and the effect of increasing slot length on the lower order modes is studied. Further, the equivalent dimensions of the same structure for operation at 900 MHz are calculated and the simulated and measured results for the same are presented...|$|R
5|$|In the mid-6th century, the {{introduction}} of Buddhism from Korea (Baekje) to Japan resulted in a revival of Japanese sculpture. Buddhist monks, artisans and scholars settled around the capital in Yamato Province (present day Nara Prefecture) and passed their techniques to native craftsmen. Consequently, early Japanese sculptures from the Asuka and Hakuhō periods show strong influences of continental art, which initially were characterized by almond-shaped eyes, upward-turned crescent-shaped lips and symmetrically arranged folds in the clothing. The workshop of the Japanese sculptor Tori Busshi, who was strongly influenced by the Northern Wei style, produced works which exemplify such characteristics. The Shakyamuni triad and the Guze Kannon at Hōryū-ji are prime examples. By the late 7th century, wood replaced bronze and copper. By the early Tang dynasty, greater realism was expressed by fuller forms, long <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> eyes, softer facial features, flowing garments and embellishments with ornaments such as bracelets and jewels. Two prominent examples of sculptures of this period are the Shō Kannon at Yakushi-ji and the Yumechigai Kannon at Hōryū-ji.|$|E
25|$|The VeSFET (vertical-slit field-effect transistor) is a {{square-shaped}} junctionless FET with a <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> {{connecting the}} source and drain at opposite corners. Two gates occupy the other corners, and control the current through the slit.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} path {{difference}} and constructive or destructive interference used above for the double-slit experiment applies {{as well to}} the display of a single slit of light intercepted on a screen. The main result of this interference is to spread out {{the light from the}} <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> into a broader image on the screen. This distribution of wave energy is called diffraction.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the <b>narrow</b> <b>slit.</b> Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|E
25|$|A {{rotating}} slotted nozzle {{inside the}} sieving chamber {{and a powerful}} industrial vacuum cleaner which {{is connected to the}} chamber. The vacuum cleaner generates a vacuum inside the sieving chamber and sucks in fresh air through the slotted nozzle. When passing the <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> of the nozzle the air stream is accelerated and blown against the sieve mesh, dispersing the particles. Above the mesh, the air jet is distributed over the complete sieve surface and is sucked in with low speed through the sieve mesh. Thus the finer particles are transported through the mesh openings into the vacuum cleaner.|$|E
25|$|Cavity-dwelling {{species have}} to contend with the danger of predators {{accessing}} their nest, catching them and their young inside and unable to get out. They have a variety of methods for decreasing the likelihood of this happening. Red-cockaded woodpeckers peel bark around the entrance, and drill wells above and below the hole; since they nest in live trees, the resulting flow of resin forms a barrier that prevents snakes from reaching the nests. Red-breasted nuthatches smear sap around the entrance holes to their nests, while white-breasted nuthatches rub foul-smelling insects around theirs. Eurasian nuthatches wall up part of their entrance holes with mud, decreasing the size and sometimes extending the tunnel part of the chamber. Most female hornbills seal themselves into their cavity nests, using a combination of mud (in some species brought by their mates), food remains and their own droppings to reduce the entrance hole to a <b>narrow</b> <b>slit.</b>|$|E

500|$|Mature {{specimens}} of J.lagostoma are typically [...] wide across the carapace on Ascension Island; individuals from [...] are somewhat smaller. In the family Gecarcinidae, species are normally separated by {{the form of}} the first pleopod (gonopod), which is used by males during mating, but there is no difference in the gonopod between J.lagostoma and J.planata. Instead, J.lagostoma differs from other species in the genus by {{the form of the}} third maxilliped; it has a fissure which is a <b>narrow</b> <b>slit,</b> but which gapes open in other species. The third maxilliped is also larger, covering the epistome and the antennules in J.lagostoma but not in other species.|$|E
500|$|Szczerbiec (...) is the {{coronation}} sword {{that was used}} in crowning ceremonies of most Polish monarchs from 1320 to 1764. It is currently on display in the treasure vault of the Royal Wawel Castle in Kraków as the only preserved piece of the medieval Polish Crown Jewels. The sword is characterized by a hilt decorated with magical formulas, Christian symbols and floral patterns, as well as a <b>narrow</b> <b>slit</b> in the blade which holds a small shield with the coat of arms of Poland. Its name, derived from the Polish word [...] meaning a gap, notch or chip, is sometimes rendered into English as [...] "the Notched Sword" [...] or [...] "the Jagged Sword", although its blade has straight and smooth edges.|$|E

The squared cornices on the frontlet of the presbytery was a common feature of the Romanesque church in the Alto Minho region. [...] The central window itself is decorated with columns and decorated capitals, surmounted by blocks supporting the simple arch.|$|E
