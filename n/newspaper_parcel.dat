40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of parceling constructions which are considered as a structural element of the <b>newspaper</b> text. Nowadays <b>parceling</b> marks syntax of the modern publicistic speech inasmuch as parceling promotes strengthening of effecting function of the text (the so-called “expressivization” of the text). Parceling occurs both {{on the level of}} simple sentence and on the level of compound sentence. On the level of simple sentence attributes and adverbial modifiers most often undergo parceling. Parceling takes place in compound sentences in the time of actualization of subordinate clause with the meaning of effect, cause, condition, concession. Syntactic organization of the modern newspaper text (connected with the use of parceling constructions) absolutely corresponds to the realization of the both constructive and style vector of media texts...|$|R
50|$|For a {{while after}} the war the railway station at Flordon {{continued}} {{to play an important}} part {{in the life of the}} village as a source of mail, <b>parcels,</b> <b>newspapers</b> and coal, while farmers used the railway to transport their sugar beet, corn and cattle. As motor transport became ever more affordable its door to door convenience killed off much of the rail traffic and Flordon Station was closed in 1961 as part of the Beeching cuts after a life of 112 years. William Moore tells us that the landlord of the Railway Tavern at this time was Mr Brookes, who supplemented his income by cutting hair; boys could usually persuade him to sell them half a pint of cider while waiting for their hair to be cut.|$|R
60|$|The tides {{were now}} {{in that state}} which sailors term the dead of the neap, {{and it was not}} {{expected}} that any part of the rock would be seen above water to-day; at any rate, it was obvious, from the experience of yesterday, that no work could be done upon it, and therefore the artificers were not required to land. The wind was at west, with light breezes, and fine clear weather; and as it was an object with the writer to know the actual state of the Bell Rock at neap-tides, he got one of the boats manned, and, being accompanied by the landing-master, went to it at a quarter-past twelve. The parts of the rock that appeared above water being very trifling, were covered by every wave, so that no landing was made. Upon trying the depth of water with a boat-hook, particularly on the sites of the lighthouse and beacon, on the former, at low water, the depth was found to be three feet, and on the central parts of the latter it was ascertained to be two feet eight inches. Having made these remarks, the boat returned to the ship at two p.m., and the weather being good, the artificers were found amusing themselves with fishing. The Smeaton came from Arbroath this afternoon, and made fast to her moorings, having brought letters and <b>newspapers,</b> with <b>parcels</b> of clean linen, etc., for the workmen, who were also made happy by the arrival of three of their comrades from the workyard ashore. From these men they not only received all the news of the workyard, but seemed themselves to enjoy great pleasure in communicating whatever they considered to be interesting with regard to the rock. Some also got letters from their friends at a distance, the postage of which for the men afloat was always free, so that they corresponded the more readily.|$|R
