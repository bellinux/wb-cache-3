5|$|In 1920, {{commemorative}} coins {{were not}} {{sold by the}} government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them {{to the public at}} a premium.

5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{is believed to have}} been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although <b>not</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E

5|$|In its Tropical Cyclone Report on Grace, the National Hurricane Center {{reported}} that the formation of Grace was poorly forecast.

Over the following three days, the system was <b>not</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHC's tropical weather outlooks until just prior to Grace's classification. The lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to the storm's unusual location and the sparsity of data for storms in the region.|$|E

5|$|John is <b>not</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sources {{during the}} reign of Constantine X, perhaps indicating, {{according}} to Konstantinos Varzos, that he was in imperial disfavour, despite Bryennios' assertion that both he and his brother remained much honoured by the new emperor. The late 12th-century typikon of the Monastery of Christ Philanthropos, founded by Alexios I's wife Irene Doukaina, is the only source to record that John Komnenos retired to a monastery, probably {{at the same time as}} his wife, Anna Dalassene.

Since {{the death of the}} last holder in 1885, the office of Prelate has remained vacant.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} athletes may {{have served as}} {{alternates}} for the various teams in the bobsleigh events, although there is disagreement among sources {{as to whether they}} should be considered medal winners. They are listed in the International Olympic Committee's medalist database as having won medals for teams on which they were alternates. However, while they do appear in the Official Report of the 1932 Olympic Games on pages which list members of the teams, their names are <b>not</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pages that list winners of the events.

Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is <b>not</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
