Referring to a state of the art on <b>networks</b> <b>engineering,</b> we first show that such a framework should provide a support for the management of networks' evolution in the future. Based on a structural study of networks of firms(NoF), in the paper we identify structural mechanisms and then configuration factors useful as a basis for <b>networks</b> <b>engineering.</b> Those configuration factors will be presented and linked to "state variables" and "contingency variables". Both kinds of variables are to be later exploited to develop an architecture and a methodology for engineering and integration of NoF...|$|R

40|$|Hop-by-hop {{flow control}} {{can be used}} to fairly share the {{bandwidth}} of a network among competing flows. No data is lost even in overload conditions; yet each flow gets access to the maximum throughput when the network is lightly loaded. However, some schemes for hop-by-hop flow control require too much memory; some of them are not resilient to errors. We propose a scheme for making hop-by-hop flow control resilient and show that it has advantages over schemes proposed by Kung. We also describe a novel method for sharing the available buffers among the flows on a link; our scheme allows us to potentially reduce the memory requirement (or increase the number of flows that can be supported) by an order of magnitude.
