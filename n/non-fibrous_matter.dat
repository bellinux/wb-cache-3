50|$|The jute fiber {{comes from}} the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The fibers are first {{extracted}} by retting. The retting process consists of bundling jute stems together and immersing them in slow running water. There {{are two types of}} retting: stem and ribbon. After the retting process, stripping begins; women and children usually do this job. In the stripping process, <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>matter</b> is scraped off, then the workers dig in and grab the fibers from within the jute stem.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{grinding}} and screening on the geometry and chemical characteristics of wheat straw is examined. These pre-treatments cause a differentiation in {{the geometry of}} the straw particles, in the fibrous/ <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>matter</b> ratio, {{as well as in}} the lignin and ash content of the product. After a mild acid prehydrolysis, the results remain almost unchanged...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate intake, nutrient apparent digestibility and ingestive behavior of sheep fed rations with cashew nut meal (CNM) at the levels of 0; 10; 20 and 30 % in the concentrate ration. It was used a double 4 × 4 Latin square experimental design. Intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter, crude protein, mineral <b>matter,</b> <b>non-fibrous</b> carbohydrates and total digestible nutrients were not influenced {{by the addition of}} CNM, however, intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber and total carbohydrates presented a quadratic behavior with the increase of content of lipids in the ration. Apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter, crude protein, NDF, acid detergent fiber and non-fibrous carbohydrates was not influenced by the addition of CNM in the rations; however digestibility of ether extract and total carbohydrates presented quadratic and linear behavior, respectively. It was not observed any significant differences in time spent with feeding and rumination, however, total chewing time was influenced, presenting increasing linear behavior with the levels of CNM. Concerning to intakes of dry matter and NDF per hour, feed efficiency and rumination were not affected by increase on lipid content in the rations. Ruminating chews time per rumen bolus, number of ruminated boli and the number of ruminating chews per day were not influenced by experimental rations. In sheep feeding management, it is suggested as a feeding alternative the use of up to 30 % of CNM in the concentrate ration if it is available...|$|R
40|$|Avaliaram-se os efeitos da utilização de fontes amiláceas e fibrosas de energia em suplementos múltiplos sobre o desempenho e as características nutricionais de novilhos mestiços em recria em pastagem de Brachiaria decumbens durante o período de transição seca/águas. A área {{experimental}} constituiu-se de 5 piquetes de 2, 0 ha, com disponibilidade média de matéria seca (MS) de 4. 309, 4 kg/ha. Utilizaram-se 24 novilhos mestiços (Holandês × Zebu), castrados, com aproximadamente 24 meses de idade e peso vivo inicial de 314, 46 kg. A cada animal destinou-se, casualmente, um dos cinco tratamentos: mistura mineral à vontade, grão de milheto ou grão de milho como fontes amiláceas de energia; polpa cítrica ou farelo de trigo como fontes fibrosas. Às fontes de energia foram adicionados mistura mineral, farelo de algodão e uréia para comporem suplementos com 30 % de PB, com base na matéria natural, fornecidos em 1, 5 kg/animal/dia. No grupo controle, não houve efeito da suplementação sobre o ganho médio diário. O ganho médio diário obtido com as fontes fibrosas foi 17, 43 % superior ao obtido com as fontes amiláceas. Os consumos de matéria seca e orgânica (kg/animal/dia e g/kg de peso vivo) pelos animais do grupo controle foram inferiores, assim como os consumos (kg/animal/dia) de PB, CNF, EE, FDNi e NDT. As digestibilidades aparentes totais de PB e CNF foram mais baixas nos animais que receberam somente mistura mineral. Animais do grupo controle apresentaram menores teores de nitrogênio uréico sérico e urinário. Suplementos com fontes fibrosas de alta digestibilidade em associação a uréia promovem ganhos de peso superiores àqueles formulados com fontes amiláceas e uréia. A suplementação múltipla no período de transição seca/águas, fornecida no nível de 0, 4 % do peso vivo, não afeta a digestibilidade da FDNcp, independentemente da fonte de energia. This {{study was}} conduced {{to evaluate the}} energy sources, rich in starch or fiber in multiples supplements on performance and nutritional characteristics of finishing crossbred steers in the dry/rainy transition season, grazing Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. The experimental area was divided into 5 paddocks with 2. 0 ha each, with dry matter availability of 4. 309, 4 kg/ha. Twenty-four castrated crossbred steers were used, initially 24 month old and 314. 46 kg. For each animal, {{one of the five}} treatments was randomly applied: mineral mixture ad libitum, pearl millet grain or corn grain, as starchy energy sources, citrus pulp or wheat bran, as fibrous energy sources. To the different energy sources, the following were added: mineral mixture, cotton seed meal and urea, so that they composed supplements with 30 % of crude protein based on the natural matter, supplied at the level of 1. 5 kg/animal/day. In relation to control group, significant effect of the supplementation on the diary gain was not verified. The average daily gain obtained with the fibrous sources was 17. 43 % higher than that obtained with the starchy sources. The dry matter (DM), organic <b>matter,</b> <b>non-fibrous</b> carbohydrates (NFC), crude protein (CP), ether extract, digestible DM, total digestible nutrients and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) indigestible intakes (kg/animal/day) was higher for supplemented animals in relation to the control group. CP and NFC total apparent digestibility were lower for animals that received only MM. Excretion of urea by urine, and the urea plasmatic level were lower for animals fed MM only. Multiple supplements with high digestible fiber sources in association with urea promoted better performance to the animals than that formulated with starchy sources and urea. The supplementation in the dry/rainy season, in 0. 4 % of the BW do not affect the NDF digestibility, regardless of the energy source...|$|R
