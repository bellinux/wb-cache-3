The results were: First, the nominal size for female adult formal dress suggested by the KS standard is suggested in 20 sections. The sections for underweight women are 7, (34 women who accounted for 14. 59 % out of 233 in total). The cover efficiency was 2. 08 % (which was very low). Second, tests showed that the average difference between the reference part body <b>size</b> of 7 <b>sections</b> for underweight women in the <b>normal</b> <b>size</b> <b>section</b> of bust cir. - hip cir. - height, and KS standard, waist cir. among reference sizes was rather small {{in the case of a}} nominal size for long height.
