40|$|Summary: This study {{aimed to}} {{document}} the detailed features of the nasal cavity in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) {{by the use of}} ten mature quails. The heads of the birds were sectioned slightly paramedially and transversally in rostro-caudal sequence. Then, sections were placed in 0. 1 % methylene blue for 15 min followed by 50 % and 70 % ethyl alcohol series, respectively. The nasal cavity was formed rostrally by the nostrils which were two narrow longitudinal openings located at {{the upper part of the}} base of the beak. They were Nares perviae, a kind of open nares type. The choana possessed two openings communicating the nasal cavity with the oral cavity. The rostral <b>nasal</b> <b>concha</b> was present lying opposite the nostrils, showing, in transverse sections, C-shaped appearance in form with 6. 23 ± 0. 1 mm long and 3. 85 ± 0. 2 mm wide dorso-ventrally at its base. The middle <b>nasal</b> <b>concha</b> situated obliquely between the rostral <b>nasal</b> <b>concha</b> and the caudal <b>nasal</b> <b>concha</b> was the largest of all, being 8. 32 ± 0. 21 mm long and 2. 54 ± 0. 12 mm wide dorso-ventrally. In cross section, it exhibited a scroll-like structure with one-half turning ventro-laterally. The caudal <b>nasal</b> <b>concha,</b> the smallest one, resembled a hemisphere of 3. 2 ± 0. 15 mm in diameter with its caudal border attaching to the olfactory region of the nasal cavity, and its cranial edge being free. The septal <b>nasal</b> <b>concha</b> was absent and the infraorbital sinus was highly developed in the Japanese quails examined...|$|R
5000|$|The {{lacrimal}} canaliculi, the lacrimal sac, and the nasolacrimal duct, {{by which}} the fluid is conveyed into the cavity of the nose, emptying anterioinferiorly to the inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae</b> from the nasolacrimal duct; ...|$|E
50|$|It {{is formed}} by {{indentations}} in the inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae,</b> maxilla and lacrimal bone. It drains to into {{the nasal cavity}} through the anterior portion of the inferior meatus which is between the inferior concha and {{the floor of the}} nasal cavity.|$|E
50|$|Owing to the {{thickness}} of the greater part of this membrane, the nasal cavities are much narrower, and the middle and inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>conchæ</b> appear larger and more prominent than in the skeleton; also the various apertures communicating with the meatuses are considerably narrowed.|$|E
50|$|The human palatine articulates {{with six}} bones: the sphenoid, ethmoid, maxilla, {{inferior}} <b>nasal</b> <b>concha,</b> vomer and opposite palatine.|$|R
5000|$|... {{seven of}} the face: the nasal, zygomatic, lacrimal, {{inferior}} <b>nasal</b> <b>concha,</b> palatine, vomer, and the adjacent fused maxilla.|$|R
50|$|The {{irregular}} bones are: the vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, zygomatic, maxilla, mandible, palatine, inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>concha,</b> and hyoid.|$|R
50|$|Behind the {{lacrimal}} {{process of}} the inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae</b> lies a broad, thin plate, the ethmoidal process, which ascends to join the uncinate {{process of the}} ethmoid; from its lower border a thin lamina, the maxillary process, curves downward and lateralward; it articulates with the maxilla and forms {{a part of the}} medial wall of the maxillary sinus.|$|E
50|$|The {{nasal mucous}} {{membrane}} lines the nasal cavities, and is intimately {{adherent to the}} periosteum or perichondrium of the <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae.</b> It is continuous with the skin through the nares, and with the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx through the choanae. From the nasal cavity its continuity with the conjunctiva may be traced, through the nasolacrimal and lacrimal ducts; and with the frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses, through the several openings in the meatuses. The mucous membrane is thickest, and most vascular, over the <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae.</b> It is also thick over the septum; {{but it is very}} thin in the meatuses {{on the floor of the}} nasal cavities, and in the various sinuses. It is one of the most commonly infected tissues in adults and children. Inflammation of this tissue may cause significant impairment of daily activities, with symptoms such as stuffy nose, headache, mouth breathing, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{nasal septum}} is {{composed}} of the quadrangular cartilage, the vomer bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones. Each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates (<b>nasal</b> <b>conchae),</b> which are small, thin, shell-form bones: (i) the superior concha, (ii) the middle concha, and (iii) the inferior concha, which are the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae</b> (turbinates) is the meatus space, with names that correspond to the turbinates, e.g. superior turbinate, superior meatus, et alii. The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated cribriform plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve (Cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the cribriform plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.|$|E
50|$|The {{lacrimal}} articulates {{with four}} bones: {{two of the}} cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, {{and two of the}} face, the maxilla and the inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>concha.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{inferior}} <b>nasal</b> <b>concha</b> is ossified from {{a single}} center, which appears about the fifth month of fetal life in the lateral wall of the cartilaginous nasal capsule.|$|R
5000|$|... the {{anterior}} is prolonged downward as the descending process, which articulates with the lacrimal {{process of the}} inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>concha,</b> and assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal duct.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nasal cavity}} is divided in two by a {{vertical}} fin called the nasal septum. On {{the sides of}} the nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae</b> (singular [...] "concha") or turbinates. These turbinates disrupt the airflow, directing air toward the olfactory epithelium {{on the surface of the}} turbinates and the septum. The vomeronasal organ is located at the back of the septum and has a role in pheromone detection.|$|E
50|$|The {{bones of}} the facial {{skeleton}} are the vomer, two <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae,</b> two nasal bones, two maxilla, the mandible, two palatine bones, two zygomatic bones, and two lacrimal bones. Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the hyoid bone or the three ossicles {{of the middle ear}} but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two.|$|E
50|$|The highest nasal concha or supreme nasal concha is a nasal concha (turbinate) {{that occurs}} in some cases. It is shaped like a seashell and found on the posterosuperior part of the lateral nasal wall. It lies on the medial surface of the {{labyrinth}} of ethmoid above the superior nasal concha. This makes the highest of four <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae,</b> and the highest of three on the ethmoid bone. It is often {{no more than a}} small, simple crest protruding from the nasal wall.|$|E
5000|$|The medial {{surface of}} the {{labyrinth}} of ethmoid consists of a thin lamella, which descends from the under {{surface of the}} cribriform plate, and ends below in a free, convoluted margin, the middle <b>nasal</b> <b>concha.</b>|$|R
50|$|From {{the lower}} {{border of the}} {{inferior}} <b>nasal</b> <b>concha,</b> a thin lamina, the maxillary process, curves downward and laterally; it articulates with the maxilla and forms {{a part of the}} medial wall of the maxillary sinus.|$|R
50|$|The back part of {{the medial}} surface of the {{labyrinth}} of ethmoid is subdivided by a narrow oblique fissure, the superior meatus of the nose, bounded above by a thin, curved plate, the superior <b>nasal</b> <b>concha.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The ethmoid bone is an {{anterior}} cranial bone {{located between}} the eyes. It {{contributes to the}} medial wall of the orbit, the nasal cavity, and the nasal septum. The ethmoid has three parts: cribriform plate, ethmoidal labyrinth, and perpendicular plate. The cribriform plate forms {{the roof of the}} nasal cavity,the ethmoidal labyrinth consists of a large mass {{on either side of the}} perpendicular plate, and the perpendicular plate forms the superior two-thirds of the nasal septum. Between the orbital plate and the <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae</b> are the ethmoidal sinuses or ethmoidal air cells, which are a variable number of small cavities in the lateral mass of the ethmoid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inferior}} nasal concha (inferior turbinated bone or inferior turbinal/turbinate) {{is one of}} the turbinates in the nose. It extends horizontally {{along the}} lateral wall of the nasal cavity and consists of a [...] of spongy bone, curled upon itself like a scroll. The inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae</b> are considered a pair of facial bones. They are also termed 'inferior nasal turbinates' because they function similar to that of a turbine: As the air passes through the turbinates, the air is churned against these mucosa-lined bones in order to receive warmth, moisture and cleansing. Superior to inferior nasal concha are the middle nasal concha and superior nasal concha which arise from the cranial portion of the skull. Hence, these two are considered {{as a part of the}} cranial bones.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "nasal cavity" [...] {{can refer}} {{to each of the}} two sides of the nose or to the two sides combined. The two nasal {{cavities}} condition the air to be received by the other areas of the respiratory tract. Owing to the large surface area provided by the <b>nasal</b> <b>conchae</b> (also known as turbinates), the air passing through the nasal cavity is warmed or cooled to within 1 degree of body temperature. In addition, the air is humidified, and dust and other particulate matter is removed by vibrissae, short, thick hairs, present in the vestibule. The entire mucosa of the nasal fossae is covered by a blanket of mucus, which lies superficial to the microscopic cilia and also filters inspired air. The cilia of the respiratory epithelium move the secreted mucus and particulate matter posteriorly towards the pharynx where it passes into the esophagus and is digested in the stomach. The nasal cavity also houses our sense of smell and contributes greatly to taste sensation through its posterior communication with the mouth via the choanae.|$|E
50|$|It is rough, {{and marked}} above by {{numerous}} grooves, directed nearly vertically downward from the cribriform plate; they lodge {{branches of the}} olfactory nerves, which are distributed to the mucous membrane covering the superior <b>nasal</b> <b>concha.</b>|$|R
50|$|Below the bulla ethmoidalis {{and hidden}} by the uncinate process of the ethmoid is {{the opening of the}} maxillary sinus (ostium maxillare); an {{accessory}} opening is frequently present above the posterior part of the inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>concha.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Eustachian tube {{extends from}} the {{anterior}} wall {{of the middle ear}} to the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, approximately {{at the level of the}} inferior <b>nasal</b> <b>concha.</b> It consists of a bony part and a cartilaginous part.|$|R
