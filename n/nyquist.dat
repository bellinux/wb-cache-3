5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry <b>Nyquist</b> whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Traditionally, {{the channel}} used for {{differential}} multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is constant dur-ing one frame and changes randomly from one frame to another. This channel behavior is too simple to be realistic. In this paper, we propose a new time selective channel model for differential space-time modulation (DSTM) schemes. A {{sufficient number of}} Rayleigh channel matrices are randomly generated, and the other channel matrices are sinc interpolated according to the <b>Nyquist’s</b> sampling theorem. The performance of DSTM schemes with two, four and eight transmit antennas are evaluated over this time selective channel model. Simulation results show slightly degraded but more realistic performance when this new channel model is used.

25|$|Exactly how, when, or why Harry <b>Nyquist</b> had {{his name}} {{attached}} to the sampling theorem remains obscure. The term <b>Nyquist</b> Sampling Theorem (capitalized thus) appeared as early as 1959 in a book from his former employer, Bell Labs, and appeared again in 1963, and not capitalized in 1965. It had been called the Shannon Sampling Theorem as early as 1954, but also just the sampling theorem by several other books in the early 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Fifty {{years after}} his 1927 invention, he {{published}} an article in IEEE Spectrum regarding the historical background of his invention. He published a classical paper on negative feedback amplifier in 1934, which has been re-printed in the Proceedings of IEEE two times in 1984 and 1999 Inside his 1934 classical paper [...] "Stabilized feed-back amplifiers", he mentioned Harry <b>Nyquist's</b> work on stability criterion because a negative feedback amplifier can be unstable and oscillate. Thus, {{with the help of}} <b>Nyquist's</b> theory, he managed to demonstrate a stable negative feedback amplifier which can be used in reality. Bernard Friedland wrote an introduction for the 1999 re-print in Proc. IEEE. James E. Brittain wrote about him in 1997.An obituary regarding Black was published by IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control in 1984.|$|R
40|$|The {{simulation}} of radio frequency (RF) circuits {{is one of}} the severest problems in Design Automation: the information signal or envelope is modulated by a carrier signal with a center frequency typically in the GHz range. Due to <b>Nyquist's</b> sampling theorem the time steps in conventional transient analysis are prohibitively small. A technique to overcome <b>Nyquist's</b> bottleneck is the multirate method which reformulates the ordinary circuit's differential algebraic equations (DAEs) as a system of partial DAEs (PDAEs). In this paper further improvements of the wavelet multirate circuit simulation technique are presented. In the new algorithm we use different grids for the approximation of the solution on different circuit parts, exploiting latency. In particular, for circuits comprising latent parts the grids can be much sparser, which results in the reduction of the overall problem size and leads to a faster simulation. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Nyquist's</b> {{formula is}} {{essentially}} the same as that derived by Planck in 1901 for electromagnetic radiation of a blackbody in one dimension—i.e., it is the one-dimensional version of Planck's law of blackbody radiation. In other words, a hot resistor will create electromagnetic waves on a transmission line just as a hot object will create electromagnetic waves in free space.|$|R
25|$|When the bandlimit is {{too high}} (or there is no bandlimit), the {{reconstruction}} exhibits imperfections known as aliasing. Modern statements of the theorem are sometimes careful to explicitly state that x(t) must contain no sinusoidal component at exactly frequency B, or that B must be strictly less than ½ the sample rate. The two thresholds, 2B and fs/2 are respectively called the <b>Nyquist</b> rate and <b>Nyquist</b> frequency. And respectively, they are attributes of x(t) and of the sampling equipment. The condition described by these inequalities is called the <b>Nyquist</b> criterion, or sometimes the Raabe condition. The theorem is also applicable to functions of other domains, such as space, {{in the case of}} a digitized image. The only change, in the case of other domains, is the units of measure applied to t, fs, and B.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentally, all {{electronic}} devices that provide power gain (e.g., vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors, MOS transistors) are nonlinear. Negative feedback trades gain for higher linearity (reducing distortion) and can provide other benefits. If not designed correctly, amplifiers with negative feedback can under some circumstances become unstable {{due to the}} feedback becoming positive, resulting in unwanted behavior such as oscillation. The <b>Nyquist</b> stability criterion developed by Harry <b>Nyquist</b> of Bell Laboratories is used to study the stability of feedback amplifiers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is well {{proved that}} the signals {{transmitted}} through a mutipath channel experience Rayleigh fading. The channel also varies due to the moving of user end or the scatters and Doppler shift effect is generated. Researchers have to consider these two effects in their studies of wireless communications. Some researchers use step channel model which is too idealized to simulate MIMO systems. Besides, sum-of-sinusoid based simulators are widely used among which Jakes' simulator is the most well-known. However this kind of simulator has to strive for the deficiencies in higher-order statistics due to the approximation of random variables by determinants. In this paper, we propose a time selective channel model used for laboratory simulations from a new sight which can avoid the above drawbacks. The channel is reconstructed by sinc function based on <b>Nyquist's</b> sampling theorem. The performance of DSTM scheme is evaluated in this new channel model.
