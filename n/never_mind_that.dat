He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place. You'll have to put me on a pedestal, like, <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> it's Beyoncé. I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not heard her say? That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E
500|$|On December 16, 1972, the Portuguese 6th {{company of}} Commandos in Mozambique killed the {{inhabitants}} of the village of Wiriyamu, in the district of Tete. Referred to as the 'Wiriyamu Massacre', the soldiers killed between 150 (according to the Red Cross) and 300 (according to a much later investigation by the Portuguese newspaper Expresso based in testimonies from soldiers) villagers accused of sheltering FRELIMO guerrillas. The action, [...] "Operation Marosca", was planned at the instigation of PIDE/DGS agents and guided by agent Chico Kachavi, who was later assassinated while an inquiry into the events was being carried out. The soldiers were told by this agent that [...] "the orders were to kill them all", <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> only civilians, women and children included, were found. All of the victims were civilians. The massacre was recounted in July 1973 by the British Catholic priest, Father Adrian Hastings, and two other Spanish missionary priests. Later counter-claims have been made in a report of Archbishop of Dar es Salaam Laurean Rugambwa that alleged that the killings were carried out by FRELIMO combatants, not Portuguese forces. In addition, others claimed that the alleged massacres by Portuguese military forces were fabricated to tar the reputation of the Portuguese state abroad. Portuguese journalist Felícia Cabrita reconstructed the Wiriyamu massacre in detail by interviewing both survivors and former members of the Portuguese Army Commandos unit that carried out the massacre. Cabrita's report was published in the Portuguese weekly newspaper Expresso and later in a book containing several of the journalist's articles.|$|E
500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] moves at a {{tempo of}} 123 {{beats per minute}} for 5:32, running {{slightly}} above the average song length of the album. It begins with a clean guitar intro similar to the main riff; an E minor chord on a guitar using the wah-wah pedal is then introduced, followed by heavy use of tom-tom drums. Distorted guitars then build up to the main riff, which starts 56 seconds into the song and utilizes variations of the E/B tritone. P. J. Howorth, in The Wah Wah Book, characterized the main riff as [...] "sinister". The song then follows a common structure, playing two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. On the chorus and pre-chorus, the song modulates one whole tone, up to F, and after the second chorus, Hammett plays a guitar solo with the main, pre-chorus, and chorus riffs in the background. Hammett makes use of the wah-wah pedal and {{a wide range of}} scales, including e minor pentatonic, B minor, F minor, E minor, and the E dorian mode. One of the final licks of the solo was inspired by the Heart song [...] "Magic Man" [...] as used in Ice-T's [...] "Personal". Just a few seconds before the solo ends, the breakdown starts, in which the clean drum intro starts, then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk's solo echo over it into the background, are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the [...] "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" [...] bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme [...] "Hush Little Baby" [...] where he is heard saying [...] "Hush little baby don't say a word, and <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> noise you heard. It's just the beasts under your bed, in your closet, in your head". After building again to a chorus, the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "nightmares and all that come with them", according to Chris True of Allmusic. The title is a reference to the sandman, a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep.|$|E

2500|$|Six generations later, William Russell, the 5th Earl (who {{would later}} become Duke of Bedford) was {{required}} by Charles I to pay £200 to 'Dissaforest' (sic) his woods at Thornhaugh. <b>Never</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> they had been excluded from Forest Law some 350 years before. The King needed money to fight the Civil War, {{and this was one}} of many ways the Treasury found to raise it. The Charter of 8 August 1639 sets out definitively that the woods are now purlieus, that is, land that was once part of a Royal Forest but has been legally disafforested. It names the various compartments (or sales) that make up the woods, and affirms that, [...] "for £200 of lawful money of England well and truly paid" [...] the 1,648 acres are [...] "altogether dissaforested".

2500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "It's a {{particular}} treat for its skewed, hilarious {{memories of a}} cutthroat boyhood". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn said of Schwartzman that [...] "he perfectly captures the poignancy of a character who understands his failings but hasn't yet the emotional resources to conquer them". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley praised Schwartzman's performance for winning [...] "sympathy {{and a great deal}} of affection for Max, <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he could grow into Sidney Blumenthal". Entertainment Weekly gave Rushmore an [...] "A" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "Anderson concentrates on beautifully disciplined filmmaking, employing 1960s British Invasion hits [...] [...] [...] to further define Max's adolescent dislocation". Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, wrote, [...] "To their credit, Anderson and Wilson share none of the class snobbery that subtly infuses much of Salinger's work ... But like Salinger they harbor a protective gallantry toward their characters that becomes the film's greatest strength and its greatest weakness".|$|E
2500|$|The anime {{has been}} praised for its quiet atmosphere, {{beautiful}} visuals, especially the backgrounds and character designs, and exceptional soundtrack. Anime News Network described {{the first season}} as [...] "a gorgeous future fantasy populated with loveable characters," [...] where [...] "each episode is a finely fashioned tone poem steeped in a love of the slow rhythms of everyday life and told with an elegant self-possession that places it light-years beyond the vulgar moralizing of most [...] "uplifting" [...] stories." [...] IGN contrasted Aria with Maria-sama ga Miteru as another series where not much happens, noting that [...] "Maria-sama ratchets up the tension level whenever possible, though, and <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> all the drama revolves around something completely inconsequential. Aria, on the other hand, is calm and relaxed. It freely admits that the plot is not the point." [...] Several reviewers cited the characters as key to {{the appeal of the}} series, though some criticized the characters as unrealistic; the voice acting of Erino Hazuki (Akari) and Junko Minagawa (Akira) were particularly praised. Several reviewers point out that the series does not fit all tastes, being a slow-paced drama with an optimistic outlook.|$|E
