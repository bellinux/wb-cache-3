50|$|Negative pledges {{often appear}} in {{security}} documents, where they operate to prohibit {{the person who}} is granting the security interest from creating any other security interests over the same property, which might compete with (or rank pari passu with) the security of the first secured creditor under the security document in which the <b>negative</b> <b>pledge</b> appears.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the legal}} regime of in rem security interests, in particular pledges and security assignments of rights, {{in the context}} of syndicated loan finance. The thesis draws mainly from the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code, and the Act No. 90 / 2012 Coll., on Commercial Companies and Cooperatives (the Corporations Act), and related legal acts, case law and jurisprudence. In the first chapter, the author describes the main elements of a facilities agreement and the typology of loans. The term syndicated loan is defined as a bank loan provided by two or more creditors, who are not joint and severe creditors among themselves, and which is usually secured by in rem security interests. The second chapter of the thesis introduces the area of securing debts and describes the security and reimbursement functions of security interests. In the third and fourth chapter, the author details the main attributes of in rem security interests. The thesis focuses on the secured party, the security provider and the secured debt whereas emphasis is given on the security agent, whose position can be structured using the institutes of joint and severe creditorship, administration of security, trust and parallel debt. The thesis deals with the ranking of security interests and <b>negative</b> <b>pledges.</b> The author states [...] ...|$|R

This <b>pledge</b> is usually abandoned when an opponent {{is perceived to be}} [...] "going negative," [...] with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.|$|R
2500|$|Through 2008, the United States {{repeatedly}} {{refused to}} rule out using nuclear weapons in an attack on Iran. The U.S. Nuclear Posture Review made public in 2002 specifically envisioned {{the use of nuclear}} weapons on a first strike basis, even against non-nuclear armed states. Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that, according to military officials, the Bush administration had plans for the use of nuclear weapons against [...] "underground Iranian nuclear facilities". When specifically questioned about the potential use of nuclear weapons against Iran, President Bush claimed that [...] "All options were on the table". According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist, Bush [...] "directly threatened Iran with a preemptive nuclear strike. It is hard to read his reply in any other way." [...] The Iranian authorities consistently replied that they were not seeking nuclear weapons as a deterrent to the United States, and instead emphasize the creation of a nuclear-arms free zone in the Middle East. The policy of using nuclear weapons on a first-strike basis against non-nuclear opponents is a violation of the US <b>Negative</b> Security Assurance <b>pledge</b> not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear members of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) such as Iran. Threats of the use of nuclear weapons against another country constitute a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 984 and the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons.|$|R
50|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>pledge</b> clauses {{are almost}} {{universal}} in modern unsecured commercial loan documents. The {{purpose is to}} ensure that a borrower, having taken out an unsecured loan, cannot subsequently take out another loan with a different lender, securing the subsequent loan on the specified assets. If the borrower could do this, the original lender would be disadvantaged because the subsequent lender would have first call on the assets in an event of default.|$|E
40|$|Public debt {{incurred}} by developing countries {{has become an}} ardently debated issue in international relations. The competing interests of creditors and debtors, combined with the increasing necessity of advancing welfare worldwide, {{make it difficult to}} establish a workable scheme that provides adequate assistance to needy countries. Foreign aid is evidently part of the solution to development problems. However, conditions imposed by international lenders bring about certain discontents. The World Bank's <b>negative</b> <b>pledge</b> clause forbids a public borrower from securing external debt that is preferential to that of the Bank. This covenant also includes several exceptions: short-term secured banking transactions and financing, through the transfer of state-owned assets, are allowed. Moreover, only in exceptional circumstances does the Bank waive the clause's application. Thus, in order to secure foreign debt, a borrowing government is usually forced to contract financing that falls within the covenant's exceptions. This Paper analyzes the World Bank's <b>negative</b> <b>pledge</b> clause and compares it to the provisions used in commercial lending. It also reviews the historical tendencies and current trends with respect to sovereign borrowing, and concludes that the World Bank's <b>negative</b> <b>pledge</b> clause should be amended, in order to bring it closer to commercial practice. It is argued that the amendments proposed in this thesis will enhance the Bank's dual function and role as both a creditor and a development institution...|$|E
40|$|Quasi-securities" {{by their}} name {{are meant to}} {{supplement}} "real" securities, which are regulated in the law, known to the third parties through the mandatory registration, and easily enforced {{in the event of}} bankruptcy. The study reveals that the application of these purely contractual legal constructions is often affected by the mandatory law, which regulates such neighboring areas as civil liability, criminal liability for fraud and misrepresentation, and bankruptcy procedure. The deficiencies in regulation of the traditional securities have also affected the use of the covenants, {{as is the case with}} the <b>negative</b> <b>pledge.</b> Its substitution by the assignment of rights seems to be problematic because this device is not properly regulated in the Czech law. This lack of regulation combined with the influence of the mandatory legal provisions created a unique legal environment where covenants have evolved and diversified in the form of international standards, which were then adapted to the specifics of the domestic legal environment. Another important element that works as a countervailing force to these developments is the approach of the Czech judiciary. The lack of judicial activism and traditional formalism of the Czech courts makes the enforcement of covenants uncertain. This formalism and lack of legal certainty in the enforcement of the contractual provisions which have no basis in the substantive law might deter their further development. The absence of any guidance from the part of the judiciary leaves businesses and their legal counsel on their own in developing the workable legal constructions that would not contradict to the mandatory legal norms...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The {{purposes}} of this study were first to determine if there were significant differences in living environment press, i. e., the pressure on an individual to behave in a certain way, between those fraternity chapters that had the highest freshman pledge retention rates and those that had the lowest. If significant differences were determined to exist, the second purpose was to investigate how those differences related to differences in the retention rates for freshman fraternity pledges. The data were obtained from the records of all freshman pledges in the Oregon State University fraternity system for a four-year period. From these data the high pledge retention and low pledge retention fraternities were determined. The sample for the remainder of this study was two of the three highest and two of the three lowest pledge retention fraternities. The highest and lowest pledge retention fraternities were eliminated. Analyses included: Pearson Correlation Coefficients to determine if there were significant correlations between retention of pledges in the fraternity system and six factors involving grades and the number of members and pledges living in the fraternities; two-way, fixed analyses of variance to determine if there were significant differences between the high retention fraternities (HRFs) and the low retention fraternities (LRFs) with respect to pledge high school grade point averages and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores; chi square contingencies to determine if there were significant differences between the HRFs and the LRFs with respect to 14 different characteristic, background, and satisfaction variables; and F-test analyses to determine if there were significant living environment differences between the HRFs and the LRFs on each of the subscales of the University Residence Environment Scale, Form R. The conclusions of the study were: 1. Neither high school nor college grades, SAT scores, nor individual characteristics, background, and satisfaction levels can be used to define differences in pledge retention between the HRF and LRF houses. 2. The differences within the living environment, and primarily the relationship dimension of that environment, of the two groups offer the best explanation of the pledge retention differences between the two groups. 3. The overt pressure exerted by the LRFs on their pledges to study and achieve academic success did not result in greater academic success than in HRFs, but did tend to limit the degree of social integration achieved by their pledges. 4. Social integration has a significant positive impact on pledge retention, while overt pressure toward academic integration has a probable <b>negative</b> impact on <b>pledge</b> retention. 5. Successful social integration, while having a positive impact on pledge retention, does not {{have a negative impact on}} academic performance. In fact, the impact on academic performance may be positive. 6. A crucial element in the Tinto (1987) model should be a relationship building block within the peer group interactin portion of the social system. Recommendations for further study were made...|$|R
40|$|Corporations frequently, {{make use}} of {{precommitment}} strategies. Examples include such widely used devices as <b>negative</b> <b>pledge</b> covenants and change of control clauses in bond indentures fair price shark repellents, no shop and other exclusivity provisions, in merger agreements, mandatory indemnification bylaws, and so on. This paper argues that poison pills also {{can be understood as}} a form of precommitment, by which the board of directors commits to a policy, intended either to negotiate a high acquisition price or to maintain the corporation's independence. In Quickturn Design Sys., Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp., the Delaware supreme court invalidated a no hand poison pill on grounds that a board of directors lacks authority to adopt such devices. In doing so, the court misinterpreted relevant Delaware law. It's unjustifiably called into question the validity of a host of corporate precominitment strategies. Finally, and perhaps most troublingly, it called into question the central tenet of Delaware corporate law; namely, the plenary authority of the board of directors. This article argues that the Delaware supreme court's decision was wrong both as a doctrinal and a policy matter. There simply is no firebreak between the sorts of board self disablement deemed invalid by Quickturn and the host of other precommitment strategies routinely used by corporate boards of directors. The Delaware supreme court's conclusion that the former are invalid for lack of statutory authority thus threatens to invalidate all of the latter. The article concludes by arguing that the Delaware supreme court should have analyzed the no hand pill under standard fiduciary d 4 ty principles rather than creating a new prophylactic ban on precommitment strategies...|$|E
40|$|It can be {{said that}} the pari passu clause mistakenly {{migrated}} from secured private lending to unsecured sovereign lending. Once rooted in unsecured sovereign lending instruments it faced certain provisions like the ones in Spain or the Philippines that can allow a creditor to create a preference positioning itself in a better position vis-a-vis other creditors, and become a 'must have' provision in this type of debt instruments. Then, pari passu clauses stayed in unsecured debt instruments due to the fear of the earmarking revenues or the risk of the sovereign preferring a group of creditors over another. These two fears were tackled by an expanded <b>negative</b> <b>pledge</b> clause and the Libra and Allied Bank cases. Therefore, if a proper due diligence was conducted {{there was no need to}} have a pari passu clause unless in exceptional circumstances alike the ones of Spain or the Philippines. Unfortunately, a misguided interpretation of the pari passu clause in the Elliot case opened the door to litigation on incorrect grounds (payment interpretation or broad interpretation of the pari passu clause). It was an 'aberration', but one that caused furore. The problem was that in Elliot there was no breach of the pari passu clause, just a wrong understanding of its meaning. In the case of Argentina the whole story could be different since it can be correctly interpreted as a breach of the pari passu clause in its ranking or narrow form. The importance of this article lies precisely in explaining the different interpretations of the pari passu clause in sovereign debt instruments in context to provide a clear understanding of the issue for the sake of the international capital markets...|$|E
