5|$|Clinton now faced a lesser-known {{candidate}} in Lazio. While a relative moderate among House Republicans, Lazio had frequently supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a largely despised figure among many <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers.</b> Lazio did {{bring to the}} table an ethnic suburban background familiar to many <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers,</b> and had a reputation as an energetic campaigner.|$|E
5|$|Averell had {{anticipated}} resistance at the river, and had Powell's Brigade ready. Major Seymour B. Conger of the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry led the attack {{across the river}} {{on the east side}} of the main road. On the west side of the road, the Lincoln Cavalry crossed the river unopposed. The <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> circled behind the 22nd Virginia, forcing the regiment to retreat from the riverbank.|$|E
5|$|The surname of his Dutch historian, Diedrich Knickerbocker, is {{generally}} associated with New York and <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers,</b> and {{can still be}} seen across the jerseys of New York's professional basketball team, albeit in its more familiar, abbreviated form, reading simply Knicks. In Bushwick, Brooklyn, a neighborhood of New York City, there are two parallel streets named Irving Avenue and Knickerbocker Avenue; the latter forms {{the core of the}} neighborhood's shopping district.|$|E
50|$|For 1953 the Saratoga {{was renamed}} <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> while the old <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> would be <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> DeLuxe. The Saratoga name would {{reappear}} for 1957.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Teaneck {{returned}} {{to being a}} quiet farm community. Fruits and vegetables grown locally were taken by wagon to markets in nearby Paterson and New York City. New growth and development were spurred in the mid-19th century by the establishment of railroads throughout the area. Wealthy <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> and others purchased large properties on which they built spacious mansions and manor houses. They traveled daily to work in New York City, thus becoming Teaneck's first suburban commuters.|$|E
5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
5|$|By July 1803, {{citizens}} of the western states, desiring more representation {{in the federal government}} and intent on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> for most important federal offices, were advocating Breckinridge's nomination as vice president in the 1804 presidential election. Thomas Jefferson was expected to be reelected, but most Democratic-Republicans had grown disenchanted with Vice President Aaron Burr; he would not be Jefferson's running mate. Breckinridge's service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{differentiated}} {{from the}} division's <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> sedan by its bucket leather seats (the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> had a bench seat) and standard {{features such as}} alloy wheels that were options on the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker.</b>|$|R
50|$|A less bulky {{look with}} the {{wheelbase}} reduced to 125.5 in, a one-piece curved windshield and rear fenders {{integrated into the}} body. Wire wheels were now an option. The Saratoga of 1952 became the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> for 1953 while the former <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> was now the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> DeLuxe. The convertible and Newport hardtop were available only in the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> DeLuxe while the base <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> offered a long wheelbase sedan and a Town & Country wagon. The convertible was <b>New</b> <b>Yorker's</b> costliest model on the 125.5 in chassis for 1953 at $3,980 - only 950 were built. Also new were pull-style exterior door handles.|$|R
5000|$|Park has {{had over}} 60 {{cartoons}} published in The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> Magazine, and wrote numerous short-short stories for them which ran on their website. Park was phased out of The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> in 1997 when Bob Mankoff became cartoon editor. Park is still represented by The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> {{on the rights}} and sales of his <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> cartoons in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Pinafore {{opened in}} New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) {{and ran for}} the rest of December. After a {{reasonably}} strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> had already seen local productions of Pinafore. This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, The Pirates of Penzance, which premiered with much success on 31 December. Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing Pinafore alongside Pirates.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU, {{which had}} been {{controlled}} by an elite of a few dozen <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers,</b> became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions. A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.|$|E
5|$|The ballet {{was first}} {{shown in the}} United States on 11 April 1930, when Massine's 1920 version was {{performed}} by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia under Leopold Stokowski, with Martha Graham dancing {{the role of the}} Chosen One. The production moved to New York, where Massine was relieved to find the audiences receptive, a sign, he thought, that <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> were finally beginning to take ballet seriously. The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the Modern Dance exponent Lester Horton, whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances.|$|E

50|$|In another {{confusing}} name swap, the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> {{name was}} now used for another new K-car line in 1983, the E-body <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> and Dodge 600. The M-body car was now called <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> Fifth Avenue to {{distinguish it from}} the E-bodies.|$|R
5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful in part due to British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E
5|$|The {{long march}} from Seminary Ridge had left {{some of the}} Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused {{momentarily}} at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers,</b> {{including}} many children, stood vigil outside {{the hospital in}} Ruth's final days. On August 16, 1948, at 8:01p.m., Ruth died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 53. His open casket was placed on display in the rotunda of Yankee Stadium, where it remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay him tribute. His funeral Mass took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral; a crowd estimated at 75,000 waited outside. Ruth was buried on a hillside in Section 25 at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. An epitaph by Cardinal Spellman appears on his headstone. His second wife, Claire Merritt Ruth, would be interred with him 28 years later in 1976.|$|E

5000|$|... 1990 saw the {{previous}} relationship between <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> and Fifth Avenue return, as the Fifth Avenue became {{a model of}} the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker.</b> There was some substantive difference, however, as the <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> Fifth Avenue used a slightly longer chassis than the standard car.|$|R

5|$|While the rioting mainly {{involved}} the working class, middle and upper-class <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> had split sentiments on {{the draft and}} use of federal power or martial law to enforce it. Many wealthy Democratic businessmen sought to have the draft declared unconstitutional. Tammany Democrats did not seek to have the draft declared unconstitutional but helped pay the commutation fees {{for those who were}} drafted. In December 1863, the Union League Club recruited over 2,000 black soldiers, outfitted and trained them, honoring and sending men off with a parade through the city to the Hudson River docks in March 1864. A crowd of 100,000 watched the procession, which was led by police and members of the Union League Club.|$|E
5|$|After {{their return}} to the U.S., the {{brothers}} and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two-day homecoming celebration. In July 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army, meeting the requirements of a two-seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour {{at an average of}} speed of 40 miles an hour (64km/h) and land undamaged. They sold the airplane to the Army's Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps for $30,000 (which included a $5,000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification). Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City's Hudson-Fulton celebrations, circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33-minute flight up and down the Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers.</b> These flights solidly established the fame of the Wright brothers in America.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being over}} 60 {{years old and}} having {{been out of the}} Army for 25 years, the crisis of the Union {{compelled}} Greene to seek to rejoin the service. He was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist, but he was a firm believer in restoring the Union. He was appointed colonel of the 60th New York Volunteer Infantry on January 18, 1862. The regiment of upstate <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> had been dissatisfied with their colonel and the company commanders had petitioned for his removal. Governor Edwin D. Morgan, although initially reluctant to appoint Greene because of his age, saw his 13 years of regular army experience as a solution to his political/military problem. During this period, Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts was also prepared to offer Greene a regiment, but Greene chose to serve New York. The officers of the 60th were dismayed when the elderly, gray-haired man reported for duty. They had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted, which would have raised many of them in rank themselves.|$|E

5|$|Stebbins {{was born}} in Lawrence, New York, the {{youngest}} of three children. His parents were George Ledyard Stebbins, a wealthy real estate financier who developed Seal Harbor, Maine and helped to establish Acadia National Park, and Edith Alden Candler Stebbins; both parents were native <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> and Episcopalians. Stebbins was known throughout his life as Ledyard, to distinguish himself from his father. The family encouraged their sons' interest in natural history during their periodic journeys to Seal Harbor. In 1914, Edith contracted tuberculosis and the Stebbins moved to Santa Barbara, California to improve her health. In California, Stebbins was enrolled at the Cate School in Carpinteria where he became influenced by Ralph Hoffmann, an American natural history instructor and amateur ornithologist and botanist. After graduating from high school, he embarked on a major in political studies at Harvard. By {{the third year of}} his undergraduate study, he had decided to major in botany.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's major {{industries}} {{of the era}} were the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Westward expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Philadelphia keep up with nearby New York City in domestic commerce, as both cities fought for dominance in transporting iron and coal resources from Pennsylvania. Philadelphia's other local railroad was the Reading Railroad, but {{after a series of}} bankruptcies, it was taken over by <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers.</b> The Panic of 1873, which occurred when the New York City branch of the Philadelphia bank Jay Cooke and Company failed, and another panic in the 1890s hampered Philadelphia's economic growth. While the depressions hurt the city, its diverse array of industries helped it weather difficult times. It had numerous iron and steel-related manufacturers, including Philadelphian-owned iron and steel works outside the city, most notably the Bethlehem Iron Company in the city by that name. The largest industry in Philadelphia was textiles. Philadelphia produced more textiles than any other U.S. city; in 1904 the textile industry employed more than 35 percent of the city's workers. The cigar, sugar, and oil industries also were strong in the city. During this time the major department stores: Wanamaker's, Gimbels, Strawbridge and Clothier, and Lit Brothers, were developed along Market Street.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly {{pushed for the}} {{creation}} of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. Mullaly noted that New York City had less parkland per capita than many major European cities, and that the 1853 construction of Central Park had raised property values around the park immediately after construction. His association sent out pamphlets to high-profile <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers,</b> advocating for a new park. However, controversies arose over the proposals for new parks in the Bronx, and so the city did not authorize a commission for the planned new parks. Since the city refused to make a park commission, the New York Park Association appealed to the New York State Legislature instead. On April 19, 1883, the state passed a law authorizing a seven-person commission headed by association member Luther Marsh, which would be responsible for scouting out sites for future parks in the 23rd and 24th wards of New York City (now the portion of the Bronx that is west of the Bronx River). Mullaly was named the secretary, In June 1883, the commission visited the park site, and by January 1884, Marsh had drafted a bill to the New York State Legislature regarding a proposed park system in the Bronx, comprising six parks connected by three parkways.|$|E
