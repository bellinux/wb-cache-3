[...] It was originally released in arcades as a sit-down machine. [...] An upright version was later released. [...] Over the next few years, the game would be ported to the Dreamcast, GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. The ratings board for South Korea revealed on June 1, 2010 that the game was rated for release on Xbox Live Arcade. On June 10, 2010, Sega [...] announced Crazy Taxi {{would be one of}} several Dreamcast titles to be released for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade, {{and that it would be}} available in Fall 2010. [...] These ports originally were to force a [...] aspect ratio, with widescreen monitors showing blue bars on either side of the screen. In October 2010 it was announced that Crazy Taxi would feature full widescreen support. The game is a port of the Dreamcast version, including both the original arcade and the Dreamcast-exclusive level. The PlayStation <b>Network</b> <b>port</b> was released November 16, 2010, while the Xbox Live Arcade version was released the following week.

40|$|Abstract—We {{are facing}} a growing user demand for {{ubiquitous}} Internet access. As a result, <b>network</b> <b>ports</b> and wireless LANs are becoming common in public spaces inside buildings such as lounges, conference rooms and lec-ture halls. This introduces the problem of protecting networks accessible through these public ports from unauthorized use. In this paper, we study the problem of access control through public <b>network</b> <b>ports.</b> We view this problem as a special case of the more general problem of access control for a service on a network. We present an access control model on which we base our solution. This model has three components: authentication, autho-rization, and access verification. We describe the design and implementa-tion {{of a system that}} allows secure network access through public <b>network</b> <b>ports</b> and wireless LANs. Our design requires no special hardware or cus-tom client software, resulting in minimal deployment cost and maintenance overhead.

50|$|A {{bypass switch}} has four <b>ports.</b> Two <b>network</b> <b>ports</b> create an in-line {{connection}} {{in the network}} link {{that is to be}} monitored. This connection is fully passive; if the bypass switch itself loses power, traffic continues to flow unimpeded through the link. Two monitor ports are used to connect the in-line monitoring appliance. During normal operation, the bypass switch passes all network traffic through the appliance as if it were directly in-line itself. But when the in-line appliance loses power, is disconnected, or otherwise fails, the bypass switch passes traffic directly between its <b>network</b> <b>ports,</b> bypassing the appliance, and ensuring that traffic continues to flow on the network link.|$|R
