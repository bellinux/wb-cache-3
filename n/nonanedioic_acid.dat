40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the natural products deriving from marine algae and cyanobacteria and has resulted in the discovery of eleven new secondary metabolites. The structure elucidations of these new molecules were performed using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Four new macrolides were isolated and characterized from the Madagascar marine cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. These ankaraholides are structurally similar to the potently cytotoxic swinholides and were found to have cytotoxicities ranging from 178 nM to 354 nM against human lung cancer (NCI-H 460) and mouse neuro- 2 a cell lines. Since swinholide-type compounds were previously localized to the heterotrophic bacteria of sponges, these findings raise intriguing questions about their true metabolic source. Geitlerinema sp. was found to be particularly rich in chemistry, and also produced the new linear lipopeptide mitsoamide with unusual structural features including an aminal moiety, a homolysine residue and a polyketide unit (3, 7 -dimethoxy- 5 -methyl- <b>nonanedioic</b> <b>acid)</b> (DMNA) ...|$|E
40|$|Sweat {{is one of}} {{the less}} {{employed}} biofluids for discovery of markers in spite of its increased application in medicine for detection of drugs or for diagnostic of cystic fibrosis. In this research, human sweat was used as clinical sample to develop a screening tool for lung cancer, which is the carcinogenic disease with the highest mortality rate owing to the advanced stage at which it is usually detected. In this context, a method based on the metabolite analysis of sweat to discriminate between patients with lung cancer versus smokers as control individuals is proposed. The capability of the metabolites identified in sweat to discriminate between both groups of individuals was studied and, among them, a trisaccharide phosphate presented the best independent performance in terms of the specificity/sensitivity pair (80 and 72. 7 %, respectively). Additionally, two panels of metabolites were configured using the PanelomiX tool as an attempt to reduce false negatives (at least 80 % specificity) and false positives (at least 80 % sensitivity). The first panel (80 % specificity and 69 % sensitivity) was composed by suberic acid, a tetrahexose, and a trihexose, while the second panel (69 % specificity and 80 % sensitivity) included <b>nonanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> a trihexose, and the monoglyceride MG(22 : 2). Thus, the combination of the five metabolites led to a single panel providing 80 % specificity and 79 % sensitivity, reducing the false positive and negative rates to almost 20 %. The method was validated by estimation of within-day and between-days variability of the quantitative analysis of the five metabolites...|$|E
40|$|A Pseudomonas sp. {{strain that}} {{is capable of}} {{utilizing}} dicarboxylic acids as a sole carbon source was isolated from activated sludge by using the enrichment culture technique. This organism accumulated polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with an unusual pattern of monomer units that depends on the carbon sources used. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) homopolyester was synthesized from glucose or small C(-even) alkanoic acids, such as butyric acid and hexanoic acid. Accumulation of PHB homopolyester was also observed in the cells grown on C(-odd) dicarboxylic acids, such as heptanedioic acid and <b>nonanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> as the sole carbon sources. In contrast, a copolyester consisting of 6 mol% 3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 HB) and 94 mol% 3 -hydroxyvalerate (3 HV) was produced with a PHA content of as much as 36 % of the cellular dry matter. This strain produced PHAs consisting both of the short-chain-length (SCL) and the medium- chain-length (MCL) 3 -hydroxyacid units when heptanoic acid to undecanoic acid were fed as the sole carbon sources. Most interestingly, polyester consisting of significant amount of relevant fractions, 3 HB, 3 HV, and 3 - hydroxyheptanoate (3 HHp), was accumulated from heptanoic acid. According to solvent fractionation experiments, the polymer produced from heptanoic acid was a blend of poly(3 HHp) and of a copolyester of 3 HB, 3 HV, and 3 HHp units. The hexane soluble fractions contained only 3 HHp units while the hexane- insoluble fractions contained 3 HB and 3 HV units {{with a small amount of}} 3 HHp unit. The copolyester was an elastomer with unusual mechanical properties. The maximum elongation ratio of the copolyester was 460 % with an ultimate strength of 10 MPa, which was very different from those of poly(3 HB-co- 3 HV) copolyesters having similar compositions produced from other microorganisms. ope...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of organic}} films on cloud condensation nuclei {{has the potential}} to affect climate and precipitation events. In this work we present a study of the oxidation of a monolayer of deuterated oleic acid (cis- 9 -octadecenoic acid) at the air–water interface by ozone to determine if oxidation removes the organic film or replaces it with a product film. A range of different aqueous sub-phases were studied. The surface excess of deuterated material was followed by neutron reflection whilst the surface pressure was followed using a Wilhelmy plate. The neutron reflection data reveal that approximately half the organic material remains at the air–water interface following the oxidation of oleic acid by ozone, thus cleavage of the double bond by ozone creates one surface active species and one species that partitions to the bulk (or gas) phase. The most probable products, produced with a yield of (87 ± 14) %, are nonanoic acid, which remains at the interface, and azelaic acid (<b>nonanedioic</b> <b>acid),</b> which dissolves into the bulk solution. We also report a surface bimolecular rate constant for the reaction between ozone and oleic acid of (7. 3 ± 0. 9) × 10 - 11 cm 2 molecule s- 1. The rate constant and product yield are not affected by the solution sub-phase. An uptake coefficient of ozone on the oleic acid monolayer of 4 × 10 - 6 is estimated from our results. A simple Köhler analysis demonstrates that the oxidation of oleic acid by ozone on an atmospheric aerosol will lower the critical supersaturation needed for cloud droplet formation. We calculate an atmospheric chemical lifetime of oleic acid of 1. 3 hours, significantly longer than laboratory studies on pure oleic acid particles suggest, but more consistent with field studies reporting oleic acid present in aged atmospheric aerosol...|$|E

Since swinholide-type compounds were previously localized to the heterotrophic bacteria of sponges, these findings raise intriguing questions about their true metabolic source. Geitlerinema sp. was found to be particularly rich in chemistry, and also produced the new linear lipopeptide mitsoamide with unusual structural features including an aminal moiety, a homolysine residue and a polyketide unit (3, 7 - dimethoxy- 5 -methyl- <b>nonanedioic</b> <b>acid)</b> (DMNA). A collection of the red marine alga Portieria hornemannii from the south of Madagascar (Tolagniaro, Fort Dauphin), led to the isolation of the previously reported halogenated monoterpene, halomon, and the discovery of three new related metabolites. These molecules were found to inhibit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT- 1). As a result of efforts to identify bioactive agents from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula, tanikolide dimer, a novel SIRT 2 inhibitor (IC 50 = 176 nM), and tanikolide seco-acid were isolated. The depside molecular structure of tanikolide dimer, which is likely a meso compound, was established by NMR, MS and chiral HPLC analyses. The structure of tanikolide dimer raises a number of intriguing configurational and biosynthetic questions for further study. The bioassay guided fractionation of a collection of the brown marine alga Dictyota sp. from Netherland Antilles Playa Fort, led to the identification of a novel HDAC inhibitor with a dolastane carbon skeleton. The novel molecule was also found to possess antimalarial activity. Other known HDAC inhibitors with interesting antimalarial activity have been reported previously, and based on this efficacy against malaria, HDAC appears to be a viable target for the development of antiparasitic agents...|$|E

Complex I has been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The complexes have each metal center bound to a chelating phenanthroline base and two bridging carboxylate ligands giving a square-planar MN 2 O 2 coordination geometry. The molecular structure of complex 1 shows two sterically constrained disulfide moieties of the dtdp ligands. The complexes show good binding propensity to calf thymus DNA {{in the major}} groove. The photoinduced DNA cleavage activity of the complexes has been studied using 365 nm UV light and 647. 1 nm and > 750 nm red light under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The phen complex 1, having dtdp ligand, cleaves supercoiled (SC) DNA to its nicked circular (NC) form. The dpq analogue 2 shows formation of a significant quantity of linear DNA resulting from double-strand breaks (dsb) in air. Mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of HO center dot and O- 1 (2) as the reactive species under an aerobic medium. The dsb of DNA is rationalized from the docking studies on 2, showing a close proximity of two photosensitizers, namely, the disulfide moiety of dtdp and the quinoxaline ring of dpq to the complementary strands of DNA. The copper(II) complexes of the dtdp ligand cleave SC DNA to its NC form upon exposure to UV or red light under an argon atmosphere. An enhancement of the DNA cleavage activity under argon has been observed upon increasing the concentration of the DMF solvent in the DMF-Tris buffer medium. Theoretical studies suggest the possibility of sulfide anion radical formation from a copper(II) -bound dtdp ligand in > 750 nm red light, which further cleaves the DNA. The copper(II) azelate complexes are inactive under similar reaction conditions. The azelate complex of the dpq ligand cleaves DNA in air following the 102 pathway. The zinc(II) complex of the dtdp ligand (5) does not show any photoinduced DNA cleavage activity in red ligh...|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{observation}} of Raman bands attributed to degraded organic binders in various of the micro samples (Fig.  3) and considering the hypothesis of a secco painting technique, we selected four samples (PCH 02, PCH 04, PCH 05, and PCH 08) of the mural painting and submitted them to extraction with ammonia, using a modification of the procedure reported in [8] and described in the Experimental section. After separation of the lipid fraction from the proteins, both fractions were derivatised and analyzed by GC–MS. Fatty acids obtained by saponification and further acidification were analyzed as their methyl esters (FAME) while sterols were derivatised as their trimethylsilyl derivatives (TMS). The chromatograms of the four samples showed a major presence of palmitic (C 16 : 0) and stearic (C 18 : 0) acids, together with minor amounts of myristic acid (C 14 : 0) in samples PCH 02 and PCH 05, and oleic acid (C 18 : 1) in samples PCH 04 and PCH 05. Samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 also showed azelaic (<b>nonanedioic)</b> <b>acid,</b> a degradation product of C- 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids in siccative oils such as linseed oil. The ratio between {{the areas of the}} FAME of palmitic and stearic acids (P/S) is a parameter that gives information on the lipid source based on the stability of both saturated fatty acids [59]. Samples PCH 02 and PCH 05 showed P/S ratios of 1.2 while PCH 04 and PCH 08 gave ratios of 0.9 and 1.4, respectively. These values are close to those reported previously for a naturally aged model sample of linseed oil applied on gypsum (1.6) compared to a model sample of whole egg on gypsum (2.8) [4]. Moreover, the ratio of the areas of azelaic and palmitic acids (A/P) is a parameter that helps in the determination of a siccative oil due to the presence of reactive linoleic and linolenic acids in comparison to egg, which is rich in oleic acid [59]. Samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 showed A/P values of 0.1 and 0.2 close to that of a model sample of linseed oil on gypsum (0.1) [4] while azelaic acid was absent in samples PCH 02 and PCH 04. Three of the samples (PCH 02, PCH 05, and PCH 08) showed the presence of cholesterol, which indicates the use of egg as a binder. The identification of a mixture of egg and a siccative oil in samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 points to a tempera grassa [16].|$|E
