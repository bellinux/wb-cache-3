500|$|By {{the end of}} 1902, {{the section}} from Crowle to Reedness Junction was finished, as was the line from Epworth to Haxey Junction. The {{railways}} {{became part of the}} Axholme Joint Railway in early 1903, and the northern sections, from Marshland Junction to Fockerby and Crowle, were opened for passengers and goods on 19 November 1903. Only Crowle swing bridge remained to be finished by March 1904, and the southern section opened for goods traffic on 14 November. The Board of Trade required several improvements to be made before it passed the line as suitable for passengers, and the formal opening took place on 2 January 1905. The work had involved excavating [...] of earth to form the cuttings between Epworth and Haxey, and another [...] had been used to construct the embankments by Crowle swing bridge. [...] of bricks and [...] of concrete had also been used. Since 17 February 1904, the official <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>undertaking</b> had been the Isle of Axholme Joint Railway (NE and L Joint).|$|R
50|$|The new {{railway system}} was closely {{connected}} with the Burry Port Harbour Company, with which it shared many directors, and the decision was taken to combine the two companies. This was done by a further Act of 30 April 1866 vesting the Burry Port Harbour in the K&BPR and changing the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the combined <b>undertaking</b> to the Burry Port and Gwendreath Valley Railway. The harbour company's share and loan capital of £85,000 was added {{to that of the}} K&BPR. The Company's Parliamentary legal advisors included the misspelling Gwendreath in the deposited documents and it was under that name that the Company was authorised. The Company seems not to have noticed the error for two years, but the opportunity to correct the matter was not taken in an Act obtained in 1868, nor in six later Acts.|$|R

40|$|My {{thesis is}} focused on the issues related to a sale <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> or part <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> {{pursuant}} to the Contract on the Sale <b>of</b> <b>Undertaking.</b> This contract type is governed by the provisions of S. 477 - 488 a of the Commercial Code. After the introduction contained in the first chapter, the second chapter deals with the legal definition <b>of</b> an <b>Undertaking</b> and its part. The concept <b>of</b> <b>Undertaking</b> described in the Czech Commercial Code is broadly constructed in order to cover many different components as a part <b>of</b> any <b>Undertaking.</b> The important distinction between the European law and the laws of the Czech Republic is that the Czech law understands the undertaking merely as a specific object of legal relations. The European law, however, recognized the Undertaking as a subject of legal relations. The third chapter identifies other contract types which could cause the same results as the sale of undertaking; among other the sales contract and specific innominated contract. The legal provisions of contract for sale <b>of</b> <b>Undertaking</b> describe the consequences of the sale and analyzed in the fourth chapter of the thesis. The most important legal issues of this contract type can be identified as (i) the transfer of rights and obligations, (ii) exclusion of certain components <b>of</b> the <b>Undertaking,</b> (iii) liability for [...] ...|$|R

The second chapter considers the rules of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> under the Acquired Rights Directive and in light of ECJ case law. It defines the terms legal transfer and merger, economic entity which retains its identity, employee, transferor and transferee. Further, it considers the transferred rights of employees and the corresponding duties of employers, encompassing the right for information and consultation, protection against dismissal {{on the grounds of the}} transfer and the right for the same work conditions after the transfer. It covers a special case <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> in the case of transferor's insolvency.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} how the ownership, location internalization and strategic advantages have influenced the location choices of FDIs by Finnish firms in ten Asian countries. Very few studies have been undertaken so far to empirically analyze the influential ownership, location and internalization variables together with the strategic motives in order analyze the FDI choices of the foreign investors. The research results indicate that large size of the parent firm, large international experience, large market size in the target country, low cultural distance and low wage rates increases the probability <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> market-seeking and efficiency-seeking FDIs. Secondly, it has been found that low levels of inflation, low levels of risks and high level of exchange rate fluctuations in the target country increase the probability <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> risk-reduction FDIs.
