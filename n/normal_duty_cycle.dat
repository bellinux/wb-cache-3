For example, in forest ecological monitoring sensornets, some sensor nodes for collecting growing information of trees such as tree diameter may work at very low <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> (e.t. 1 ∼ 10 %), some nodes for collecting environment information such as sunshine, temperature may work at <b>normal</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> (e.t. 20 ∼ 50 %), some nodes for monitoring disasters such as fire, soil erosion are required to work in high duty cycles(e.t. 50 ∼ 90 %) [36]. In experiments, we assigned each node a <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> randomly chosen within the specified range. In each experiment, additionally, we randomly chose 5 % nodes as the source nodes that produced a packet every 6 min. We did not consider more aggressive traffic load due to the inherently limited capacity of duty-cycled sensornet, in which the system lifetime is the overriding constraint. The maximum allowed retransmission count was set to 10. For a given scenario, we repeated the experiment of each scenario 100 times and reported the average results as to the evaluation metrics mentioned above.

In combination with two edge detectors and two <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> control buffers a low cost {{frequency doubler}} circuit is achieved {{as compared to}} Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) design. An input clock signal with an unpredictable <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> is inputted to a rising (or falling) edge detector. The edge detector converts the positive (or negative) transitions to a one shot pulse train whose frequency {{is the same as}} that of the input clock. However, the one shot pulse train has its <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> far less than 50 %. By a first 50 % <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> control buffer the output waveform of the resulted clock signal is symmetrical. The output of the first-stage <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> buffer is then edge detected by a rising and falling edge detector, so that the resulted one shot pulse train has twice the frequency of the incoming 50 % <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> signal. Finally, the second one shot signals are <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> adjusted in the second-stage <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> control buffer, to restore its 50 % <b>duty</b> <b>cycle.</b> Therefore, two times frequency multiplication is achieved with low cost as compared to Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) design.

30|$|The {{third is}} the {{adjusting}} of the node <b>duty</b> <b>cycle.</b> The <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> {{has an important}} influence in the network [24, 53]. The effect of <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> on delay is mainly reflected in the following aspects. Because the node adopts sleep/active mode to work and the node in the sleep state cannot send and receive data, therefore, when the data of the sender needs to be transmitted, if the receiver is in the sleep state, the sender needs to wait for its wake to be transmitted, thus increasing the delay. Therefore, to reduce the delay, we need to increase the <b>duty</b> <b>cycle.</b> But increasing the <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> will consume more energy of the nodes.
