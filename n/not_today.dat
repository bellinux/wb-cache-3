25|$|In {{comparison}} to other ant species like Anoplolepis gracilipes, which rapidly take over areas {{they have been}} contained in, red imported fire ants are fairly easy to control. The first proposals to controlling the ant occurred in 1957 when the United States Congress authorised an eradication program using federal and state funding. Research on the ant and its biology has been continuous after {{the establishment of an}} eradication program, and many chemicals were used to eliminate them. However, scientists discovered that these insecticides were killing native fauna, and the Environmental Protection Agency subsequently outlawed them. Some scientists even questioned whether the ants were pests or <b>not.</b> <b>Today,</b> {{it is unlikely that the}} red imported fire ant will be eradicated in areas such as the United States. Populations can be managed properly if an integrated approach is used. Some scientists have considered using the ants' natural enemies against it; this includes T. solenopsae and B. bassiana. Phorid flies have also been viewed as potential biological agents, as they can reduce foraging activity in red imported fire ants and affect population levels. However, they are unable to affect colony growth rate. In addition, parasitic ants, parasitic wasps, mites, other pathogens, nematodes, and fungi have been considered to be potential biological agents. Others suggest that populations can be maintained or reduced by manipulating several ecological factors.|$|E

2500|$|Our 21st-century {{understanding}} of the symbolic content of art comes {{from a group of}} scholars who gathered in Hamburg in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were Erwin Panofsky, Aby Warburg, and Fritz Saxl. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues {{to be used in the}} 21st century by art historians.

2500|$|Following {{partition}} {{some social}} and sporting bodies divided but others did <b>not.</b> <b>Today</b> in Ireland many sports, such as boxing, Gaelic football, hurling, cricket and rugby union, are organised on an all-island basis, {{with a single}} team representing Ireland in international competitions. Other sports, such as association football (soccer), have separate organising bodies in Northern Ireland (Irish Football Association) and the Republic of Ireland (Football Association of Ireland). At the Olympics, a person from Northern Ireland can choose to represent either the Republic of Ireland team (which competes as [...] "Ireland") or United Kingdom team (which competes as [...] "Great Britain"). Selection usually depends on whether his or her sport is organised on an all-Ireland, a Northern Ireland, or a UK basis. Sports organised on an all-Ireland basis are affiliated to the Republic of Ireland’s Olympic association, whereas those organised on a Northern Ireland or UK basis are generally affiliated to the UK’s Olympic association.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the term}} [...] "baptism" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>today</b> used to {{describe}} the Jewish rituals (in contrast to New Testament times, when the Greek word baptismos did indicate Jewish ablutions or rites of purification), the purification rites (or mikvah—ritual immersion) in Jewish law and tradition have some similarity to baptism, and the two have been linked. In the Hebrew Bible and other Jewish texts, immersion in water for ritual purification was established for restoration to a condition of [...] "ritual purity" [...] in specific circumstances. For example, Jews who (according to the Law of Moses) became ritually defiled by contact with a corpse had to use the mikvah before being allowed to participate in the Temple in Jerusalem. Immersion was not required for converts to Judaism as part of their conversion, although many mistakenly believe otherwise. Immersion in the mikvah represents a change in status in regards to purification, restoration, and qualification for full religious participation {{in the life of the}} community, ensuring that the cleansed person will not impose uncleanness on property or its owners.|$|E
2500|$|As {{its history}} indicates, the popular {{use of the}} word racism is {{relatively}} recent. The word came into widespread usage in the Western world in the 1930s, when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of Nazism, which saw [...] "race" [...] as a naturally given political unit. It is commonly agreed that racism existed before the coinage of the word, but there is not a wide agreement on a single definition of what racism is and what it is <b>not.</b> <b>Today,</b> some scholars of racism prefer to use the concept in the plural racisms in order to emphasize its many different forms that do not easily fall under a single definition and they also argue that different forms of racism have characterized different historical periods and geographical areas. Garner (2009: p.11) summarizes different existing definitions of racism and identifies three common elements contained in those definitions of racism. First, a historical, hierarchical power relationship between groups; second, a set of ideas (an ideology) about racial differences; and, third, discriminatory actions (practices).|$|E

2500|$|The experiential {{pattern in}} nominal groups opens with the {{identification}} of the head in terms of the [...] immediate context of the speech event—the here-and-now—what Halliday calls [...] "the speaker–now matrix". Take, for example, the first word of the nominal group exemplified above: [...] "those": [...] "those apples", as opposed to [...] "these apples", means [...] "you know the apples I mean—the ones over there, not close to me"; distance or proximity to the immediate speech event could also be in temporal terms (the ones we picked last week, <b>not</b> <b>today),</b> or in terms of the surrounding text (the apples mentioned in the previous paragraph in another context, not in the previous sentence in the same context as now) and the assumed background knowledge of the listener/speaker ("the apple" [...] as opposed to [...] "an apple" [...] means [...] "the one you know about"). The same function is true of other deictics, such as [...] "my", [...] "all", [...] "each", [...] "no", [...] "some", and [...] "either": they establish the relevance of the head—they [...] "fix" [...] it, as it were—in terms of the speech event.|$|E
2500|$|In Honest to God, John A. T. Robinson, then Bishop of Woolwich, criticizes Lewis's approach, {{questioning}} {{the idea that}} Jesus intended to claim divinity: [...] "It is, indeed, an open question whether Jesus claimed to be Son of God, let alone God". However, Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, thought that Robinson's theology was weak, {{and that he had}} only a vague understanding of many of the issues. John Hick, writing in 1993, argued that this [...] "once popular form of apologetic" [...] was ruled out by changes in New Testament studies, citing [...] "broad agreement" [...] that scholars do <b>not</b> <b>today</b> support the view that Jesus claimed to be God, quoting as examples Michael Ramsey (1980), C. F. D. Moule (1977), James Dunn (1980), Brian Hebblethwaite (1985) and David Brown (1985). [...] Larry Hurtado, who argues that the followers of Jesus within a very short period developed an exceedingly high level of devotional reverence to Jesus, at the same time rejects the view that Jesus made a claim to messiahship or divinity to his disciples during his life as [...] "naive and ahistorical". According to Gerd Lüdemann, the broad consensus among modern New Testament scholars is that the proclamation of the divinity of Jesus was a development within the earliest Christian communities. [...] N. T. Wright says the trilemma argument lacks historical context, oversimplifying first-century Judaism's {{understanding of the nature of}} God's dealings with his people. Wright points out that arguments over the claims of Jesus regarding divinity have been passed over by more recent scholarship, which sees a more complex understanding of the idea of God in first century Judaism.|$|E
2500|$|The ample {{influence}} of the military environment in Dacia {{is due to the}} dispersion of the military units (two legiones, 12 alae, 41 cohortes and 13 numeri), in this bridgehead of the Roman Empire defence, contrary (for ex.) to the Rhenish army, which – concentrated at the Germanic lines – was not in position to influence the spoken Latin in whole Gallia. The disclosure of numerous words which belong to the military (Dacian-)Roman environment – 52 semantic specific changes and inherited military Latin words with their classic sense – grounds the thesis that the Romanian language is the continuer of the military Latin spoken in the north-eastern frontier region of the Roman Empire. These military vestiges particularise the Romanian language in the neolatin area. Thus, the Romanian language becomes scientifically very interesting, from a linguistic and historical view-point, because the other frontier regions of the Roman Empire in Europe, Asia and Africa are <b>not</b> <b>today</b> Romances. Also, the conservation in Romanian language of these numerous vestiges of Latin military slang (sermo castrensis) and their absence/forgetfulness in Aromanian (Balkan Romanian dialect spoken in peaceful area) – such as a (se)aţine (“to waylay”), coif (“helmet”), împărat (“emperor”), a împresura (“encircle with pressure”), a (se) (în)cumeta (“to venture”), a înţina (“to make thin a tree for its collapse on the invaders”), aţinat (“made thin a tree”), mire “fiancé” (< Lat. miles “soldiers”, metonymy), a purcede (“to advance”), a răpune (“to kill”), rost “sense” a.s.o. (< Lat. rostrum “beak at prow of Roman warship”), (n)sat “village” (< Lat. fossatum “trench for defence”, metonymy), şes “plain” (< Lat. sessus “plane place for camping”, metonymy), a supune (“to subject”), tindă “veranda” (< Lat. tenda sub vallo “tent out of agglomerated fortress”, metonymy), ţară “homeland” (< Lat. earth ˃ Arom. ţară “earth”) a.s.o. – proves the continuity of the latinophones in the northern Danubian region by terrible and heroic battles, in order to safeguard their lands, existence, ethnicity (language and culture) and (military) honour, against the secular attacks of the barbarian (Germanic, Turanian, and Slav) tribes – after, states. This linguistic evidence challenges the Roeslerian theory. The vestiges from sermo castrensis particularize the Romanian language in the neolatin area, together with its isolated history.|$|E
