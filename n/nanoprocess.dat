The extracted voltage of 3 kV and 0. 3 kV was selected to obtain Ar 11 +. Under the fluenc of 1014 /cm 2, the irradiated area was discriminated from the unirradiated area by the SEM. Though the extraction voltage was different, the SEM observation showed the contrast of irradiated areas was almost the same. However, for the samples irradiated by singly charged ions (SCIs), the fluence {{in the order of}} 1016 /cm 2 was necessary to obtain similar contrast as that of HCI irradiation. Thus, compared to the singly charged ions, the HCIs are able to enhance the <b>nanoprocess</b> effectively on the solid surfac...|$|E
40|$|Nano-processes are {{gradually}} becoming {{more important than}} ever to realize the nano-metric cutting or nano-material formation. Although FEM and molecular dynamics (MD) are popular two analytical methods, they have their own limitations as used for <b>nanoprocess</b> simulation such as immense calculation time cost of MD, inappropriate governing equations of FE. To compensate the drawbacks of both methods and meet the demands on nanotechnology, multi-scale modeling approach is anticipated to provide a powerful analytical tool assuring materials simulation across length/time scale. In this paper one novel multi-scale simulation method combining the material point method (MPM) and MD by handshaking approach is proposed for nano-processes, i. e. nano-metric cutting and thin film formation. Quantitative assessment items: adhesion/cutting force, flatness and densification coefficient, etc. are provided to avoid drawbacks of current qualitative manner. Finally, various simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of proposed multi-scale simulation approach and clarify the mechanism of nano-processes...|$|E

30|$|Nanometer-scale protuberances and grooves can be {{produced}} on a silicon surface by diamond tip sliding in the atmosphere using an atomic force microscopy (AFM). In some cases, when a diamond tip is slid on Si, the surface protuberates. This upheaval phenomenon {{has been applied to}} processing, and the nanoprotuberance characteristics and formation mechanism were evaluated[9, 10]. Areas on a silicon (100) surface <b>nanoprocessed</b> by mechanical local oxidation through diamond tip sliding without a bias voltage have been found to act as an etching mask towards aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution[11 – 13]. Mechanical processing-induced mask patterns formed of such plastically deformed damaged layers are able to withstand selective wet etching processes for pattern transfer, resulting in the so-called maskless patterning[14, 15] or friction-induced fabrication[16 – 18], and their formation mechanisms have been evaluated.|$|R
40|$|Process {{engineering}} design {{relies on a}} host of mechanical devices that enable transport phenomena to take place under controlled conditions. These devices include pipes, valves, pumps, chemical reactors, heat exchangers, packed columns, etc. Mass, energy, and momentum transfer will also be essential phenomena in <b>nanoprocess</b> engineering, particularly at the interface between micro- and nanodevices. Control valves {{are one of the most}} fundamental components. In this paper we explore the design of a silicon cantilever valve for fluid transport control at the molecular level (34. 5 – 70 nm in length). We utilize design elements that can be synthesized with existing or emerging chemical and solid state fabrication methods. Thus, the valve is constructed with functionalized silicon surfaces, single-wall carbon nanotubes, and organic monolayers. While molecular mechanics design limitations were overcome with help from classical engineering approximations, nonlinear effects, such as nanotube crimping (for an in-line valve design), are accounted for through full-physics atomistic simulations. Optimal design geometries and operating deflection ranges have been estimated for a device containing over 75 000 atoms...|$|E
30|$|Since the {{transistor}} {{speed in}} circuit consideration is very impressive, III-V compound semiconductors[1] {{can be treated}} as potential channel replacement materials for Si in deep <b>nanoprocess</b> integration. III-V materials such as GaAs and InAs possessing higher electron mobility are expected to conduct higher drive current. Conventionally, operation of III-V field-effect transistors (FETs) mainly relies on a Schottky gate structure to modulate channel potential. However, the Schottky gate suffers from high leakage current issue which restrains III-V devices from very-large-scale integration. Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate structure used in Si MOSFET is thermodynamically stable and effective for leakage current reduction. In contrary, {{the lack of a}} high-quality oxide/semiconductor scheme has limited the applications of III-V devices for decades. Recently, several groups have demonstrated encouraging results in aspects of III-V surface cleaning or pretreatment methods[2, 3], growth of insulator on various III-V materials[4, 5], as well as realization of III-V MOSFETs[6 – 11]. Up-to-date III-V MOSFET technologies have demonstrated significant performance enhancement and have achieved low gate leakage[8, 10], high channel mobility[7, 11], and high drive current[6]. Consequently, it is feasible to produce high-performance MOSFETs using III-V materials. On the other hand, when the scaling of planar Si complementary-symmetry metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) gradually approaches its physical limit, three-dimensional fin-shaped FET (FinFET) device architecture[12 – 15] is a promising alternate enabling transistor scaling beyond the 22 -nm technology node. FinFET[16] structure provides superior control of short channel effects[13]; however, there are only few reports on III-V-based FinFETs[15, 17, 18]. In this letter, for the first time, a novel III-V MOSFET device technology based on a three-dimensional FinFET structure is reported. Al 2 O 3 film[19] is used as the gate insulator[4], and submicron GaAs fin is the channel. Both III-V MOSFET and metal–semiconductor FET (MESFET) with a FinFET structure were fabricated, characterized, and evaluated.|$|E

40|$|Although atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{has been}} used extensively to characterize cell membrane structure and cellular processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis, the corrugated surface of the cell membrane hinders the visualization of extracellular entities, such as liposomes, that may interact with the cell. To overcome this barrier, we used 90 nm nanogold particles to label FITC liposomes and monitor their endocytosis on human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) in vitro. We were able to study the internalization process of gold-coupled liposomes on endothelial cells, by using AFM. We found that the gold-liposomes attached to the HCAEC cell membrane during the first 15 – 30 [*]min of incubation, liposome cell internalization occurred from 30 to 60 [*]min, {{and most of the}} gold-labeled liposomes had invaginated after 2 [*]hr of incubation. Liposomal uptake took place most commonly at the periphery of the nuclear zone. Dynasore monohydrate, an inhibitor of endocytosis, obstructed the internalization of the gold-liposomes. This study showed the versatility of the AFM technique, combined with fluorescent microscopy, for investigating liposome uptake by endothelial cells. The 90 [*]nm colloidal gold nanoparticles proved to be a noninvasive contrast agent that efficiently improves AFM imaging during the investigation of biological <b>nanoprocesses...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use of proton beams {{in several}} modern {{technologies}} to probe or modify {{the properties of}} materials, such as proton beam lithography or ion beam cancer therapy, requires us to accurately know {{the extent to which}} the energy lost by the swift projectiles in the medium is redistributed radially around their tracks, since this determines several endpoints, such as the resolution of imaging or manufacturing techniques, or even the biological outcomes of radiotherapy. In this paper, the radial distribution of the energy deposited around swift-proton tracks in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) by the transport of secondary electrons is obtained by means of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation. The initial energy and angular distributions of the secondary electrons generated by proton impact, as well as the electronic cross sections for the ejection of these electrons, are reliably calculated in the framework of the dielectric formalism, where a realistic electronic excitation spectrum of PMMA is accounted for. The cascade of all secondary electrons generated in PMMA is simulated taking into account the main interactions that occur between these electrons and the condensed phase target. After analyzing the influence that several angular distributions of the electrons generated by the proton beam have on the resulting radial profiles of deposited energy, we conclude that the widely used Rudd and Kim formula should be replaced by the simpler isotropic angular distribution, which leads to radial energy distributions comparable to the ones obtained from more realistic angular distributions. By studying the dependence of the radial dose on the proton energy we recommend lower proton energies than previously published for reducing proximity effects around a proton track. The obtained results are of relevance for assessing the resolution limits of proton beam based imaging and manufacturing techniques.

40|$|The modern textile {{industry}} has experienced tremendous changes and {{become one of}} the best premier beneficiaries of advances in nanotechnology. This project is to explore the applications and management of nanotechnology to {{textile industry}}. The experimental studies include microwave absorption and magnetic induced heating on polyester textile using three magnetic nanoparticles [...] Carbonyl Iron Powder (CIP), Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and Ferrofluids. In comparison with the textile without applying magnetic nanoparticle material, these functional textiles show intersecting property of microwave absorption in the particular range of frequency and magnetic induced heating. I call these two promising textiles [...] Microwave-Absorption Textile (MAT) and Magnetic Heated Textile (MHT). Despite I have achieved significant and interesting results on MAT and MHT, there is plenty {{of work to be done}} not only in the development but also in the commercialization of the textiles. Thus, the public health and environmental safety become extremely important because there are a large number of imitators in the target market-China, and their lack of full knowledge, skills and understanding of the particular nanomaterials and <b>nanoprocesses</b> may result in the flood of counterfeit and poor-quality products in Chinese market which may endanger both public health and environmental safety. In order to minimize and manage the health and safety risks, I implement risk management for nanotechnology using two models [...] National Innovation System (NIS) and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), and significant findings are obtained. First, I find that a NIS can help nanotechnology manage health and safety risks in the development and commercialization of products with three stages: innovation inputs, innovation process and innovation outputs. Second, I find that IPR can be a good model for risk management, with which the risks associated with public health and environmental safety can be controlled, and those people or organizations that use our products without authorisation can be detected, and the violations of property rights and illegal imitations can be prevented. Chapter 1 introduces nanotechnology, risk management and the functional textiles. Chapter 2 reviews literature on the applications of functional textile using nanotechnology and the applications of nanofinishing and nanocoating. Chapter 3 introduces risk management principles and models, and I put the context in China which is the top player in the textile industries around the globe. Chapter 4 discusses the experimental work with the results from MAT and MHT. In Chapter 5 I apply the NIS and IPR models and discuss how to manage the risks associated with public health and environmental safety. Chapter 6 concludes and makes recommendations for future research. ...|$|R
