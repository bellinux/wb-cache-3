40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{ability to}} taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), a bitter {{chemical}} {{has long been}} known to be a heritable trait, which is being widely used for both genetic and anthropological studies. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>taster</b> and non-taster allele is found to vary in different populations. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency <b>of</b> <b>taster</b> trait in Mysore, South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present investigation was conducted in Mysore, South India during 2002 - 2003. About 3282 subjects irrespective of age, sex, religion, food habits, socio-economic status were randomly selected from various parts of the city and a total of 180 families, which included Christian (50), Hindu (61) and Muslim (69) were screened from different localities of the city. Harris and Kalmus method was used to assess the PTC taster and nontaster phenotype. RESULTS: It was found that tasters were significantly more frequent than nontasters in all the four categories. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>tasters</b> was more in unbiased category (85 %) and less in Muslim category (58 %). Investigations on PTC tasting in the families of three different religious groups revealed that the tasters were significantly more frequent than nontasters. It was also found that heterozygous father or mother for the taster genes with nontaster partner had taster and nontaster progenies in the ratio 1. 0 : 1. 54 indicating the deviation in the segregation pattern of test cross. CONCLUSION: In Mysore, tasters are more frequent than nontasters. Variation in the frequency of nontaster allele in the religious groups could be due to inbreeding. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} {{accuracy}} and reliability of four standard methods used for classification <b>of</b> people as <b>taster</b> or non-tasters based on their sensitivity to PROP (6 -n-propylthiouracil). A panel consisting of 21 subjects was tested for threshold and suprathreshold sensitivity of sodium chloride, PROP, and genotyped for TAS 2 R 38. Two threshold methods, staircase and modified Harris–Kalmus, were used to obtain detection and recognition thresholds and compared for accuracy and repeatability. Similarly, two suprathreshold techniques, the just noticeable differences (JND) and the general labeled magnitude scale (gLMS), {{were used to determine}} Weber fractions and individual psychophysical functions and compared for accuracy and repeatability. Results show both threshold methods have been able to correctly separate people into two groups <b>of</b> <b>tasters</b> and non-tasters, with the staircase method having a lower variability among subjects. On the suprathreshold front, we found differences in sensitivity between tasters and non-tasters when comparing Weber fractions and psychophysical functions; however, our data suggest that clustering people without previous knowledge <b>of</b> their <b>taster</b> status is less accurate when using Weber fractions. Intensity ratings are more reliable to classify people into tasters and non-tasters. Results show that the staircase for threshold measurement and the gLMS methods are more reliable methods than Harris–Kalmus and JND for phenotyping people and can be used in large-scale studies in the quest to discover new genotype–phenotype associations...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{distinct}} {{areas of research}} on which the work in this thesis impinges. They are methods {{for the analysis of}} patterns in correlation matrices and the analysis <b>of</b> <b>taster</b> performance in wine-tasting experiments in which the wines are scored. For the analysis patterns in correlation matrices, least squares procedures are developed to examine patterns under certain equal correlation hypotheses. The procedures are applied to the z-transforms of the elements of correlation matrices that can be based on either a single group of variables, or variables that can be cross-indexed by two factors such as the multitrait-multimethod matrices given by Campbell and Fiske (1959). The procedures are of the analysis of variance type, being investigative in the sense that, in the event that the correlation matrix is judged to depart from the hypothesised pattern, alternative models to be pursued further are indicated. The associated statistics are calculated directly from closed-form expressions, rather that requiring the iterative solution of some estimation function {{as is the case with}} some alternative methods. The procedures are used to analyse the data from a number of wine-tasting and other experiments. The results obtained are shown to be similar, in many instances, to those obtained with maximum likelihood procedures applied to variance-covariance matrices; in other instances, large differences occur between the methods. The test for the hypothesis of equal correlation between all variables developed here is also shown to give similar answers to Lawley’s (1963) test for the hypothesis, in a number of cases. For the analysis <b>of</b> <b>taster</b> performance in wine-tasting experiments in which the wines are scored, the method of examining patterns in correlation matrices can be applied to multitaster and multitaster-multisession correlation matrices. Certain conditions to be fulfilled by multitaster-multisession matrices are specified; the extent to which they are met in a particular experiment can be ascertained from the results of these analyses. The data from several wine-tasting experiments are analysed and the results provide further substantive evidence of the lack of agreement and differences in reliability that can occur between tasters in such experiments. As the technique is applied to data from a single experiment, it can be used, particularly when session replicates are included, to select tasters on the basis of their performance in the experiment under consideration – a highly desirable approach. Four duplicate-evaluation wine-tasting experiments, that were aimed at determining the effect of several treatments on wine quality, fit into this category and so are analysed in more detail. A group <b>of</b> less heterogeneous <b>tasters</b> is selected, where possible, for each of the experiments using the results of the analysis of the multitaster-multisession correlation matrices. Compared with other techniques for selecting tasters on the basis of their results in a wine-tasting experiment, the analysis of multitaster-multisession correlation matrices has the advantages that both reliability and agreement are measured and that the measures are correlation coefficients. However, even the subsets <b>of</b> selected <b>tasters</b> do not behave in a manner that would justify a single analysis for mean differences for each subset. Because this is likely to be a common phenomenon, it is recommended that wine-tasting experiments be designed to include session replicates and the scores <b>of</b> each <b>taster</b> be analysed for mean differences separately. The results of the analysis of the multitaster-multisession matrix can then be used to determine the confidence to be attached to the results <b>of</b> individual <b>tasters</b> in drawing inferences from the experiment.

40|$|Arthur L. Fox {{discovered}} {{that some of}} the population can detect PROP, called <b>tasters,</b> while some <b>of</b> the population cannot detec-t PROP, called nontasters. Scientists have {{discovered that}} the ability to taste the bitterness of PROP is heritable and follows an incompletely dominant pattern. Variations in PROP sensitivity appears to arise from underlying anatomical differences, since ratings of PROP intensity are highly correlated with the density of fungiform papillae on the tongue (Bartoshuk et al., 1994). Therefore, the tongue anatomy <b>of</b> <b>tasters</b> is different from nontasters, with supertasters tending to have the most taste pores and fungiform papillae. Additional studies suggest that women have larger proportions of fungiform papillae than men. Researchers are very interested in understanding the relationship between taster status and taste perception. Salt, sour, sweet, bitter, and the sensitivity to heat or burn are positively correlated to PROP sensitivity (Bartoshuk et al., 1994). For example, it has been found that the perception of sucrose is sweeter for tasters than nontasters (Bartoshuk, 1979).
