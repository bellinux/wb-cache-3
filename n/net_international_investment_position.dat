40|$|Financial {{globalisation}} has led {{to large}} increases in foreign assets and liabilities in recent decades, increasing the scope for valuation changes that are potentially greater than trade or financial flows. We confirm that the United States enjoys an ‘exorbitant privilege’ on flow income from foreign assets, which is primarily related to foreign direct investment (FDI). The geographical allocation of FDI assets explains {{only a small part}} of the US yield advantage. The key reason is that US, and also British and Japanese, investors were able to outperform the average yield earned in the countries of their FDI destinations, while most continental European investors earn the average. Further research should explore if large FDI investment in ‘tax optimisation’ countries, the improper consideration of intellectual property, or financial sophistication contributed to these high yields. For several countries, valuation changes were larger than current account and financial transactions, highlighting the importance of such changes. In the European Union, the generally negative <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> of a number of central and southern European countries were greatly supported by EU transfers. Valuation changes on net foreign assets do not look random and played an important role in the sustainability of <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> before and after the 2008 crisis. Countries with negative <b>net</b> <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> tend to have positive revaluation gains, while countries with large net foreign assets tend to suffer from revaluation losses. Large net foreign asset holders including China, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Japan and Germany, suffered significant losses in 2007 - 16, helping the sustainability of the negative positions of other countries. Risk sharing was also fostered by losses suffered by the US since 2007. There is no uniform tendency in relation to the asset classes from which these losses arose. Future research should aim to better understand the drivers of these valuation changes...|$|R

The perceived inability of these countries to rebalance their external positions is a major root of the euro crisis. • Intra-euro rebalancing through declines in unit labour costs (ULC) in southern Europe, and ULC increases in northern Europe should continue, but has limits because: the share of intra-euro trade has declined; intra-euro trade balances have already adjusted to a great extent; the intra-euro real exchange rates of Greece, Por-tugal and Spain have also either already adjusted or do not indicate significant appre-ciations since 2000; {{there are only two}} main current account surplus countries, Germany and the Netherlands; a purely intra-euro adjustment strategy would require too-significant wage increases in northern countries and wage declines in southern countries, which {{do not seem to be}} feasible. • Before the crisis, the euro was significantly overvalued despite the close-to-balanced current account position. • The euro has depreciated recently, but more is needed to support the extra-euro trade of southern euro-area members.
