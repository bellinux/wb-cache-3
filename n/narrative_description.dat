25|$|Work songs include music sung while {{conducting}} a task (often to coordinate timing) or a song {{linked to a}} task or trade which might be a connected <b>narrative,</b> <b>description,</b> or protest song. The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are rhythmic a cappella songs sung by people working on a physical and often repetitive task, like the 'Harvest song' common in south-west England. The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom. Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music {{with which they were}} familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances. Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry. As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in textile production, mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.|$|E

500|$|Overall, Walker concludes, [...] "Posterity {{may have}} {{overestimated}} {{the importance of}} extra-musical thought in Liszt's symphonic poems. We {{would not want to}} be without his prefaces, of course, nor any other that he made about the origins of his music; but we should not follow them slavishly, {{for the simple reason that}} the symphonic poems do not follow them slavishly either." [...] Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt [...] "held an idealized view of the symphonic poem" [...] as being evocative rather than representational. [...] "He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires," [...] MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from <b>narrative</b> <b>description</b> or pictorial realism.|$|E

[...] "I believe likewise in a sequel, written in finer style and probably cast in a still higher rank of society than the present story; although I am not convinced that we shall then be conscious of our pre-existence here. So much of your argument is, therefore, beside the mark; for {{to a certain point}} I am as orthodox as yourself. But where you begin to draw general conclusions from your own private experience, I must beg pointedly and finally to differ. You will not have forgotten, I believe, my daring and single-handed butchery of the five secret witnesses? Nor the sleight of mind and dexterity of language with which I separated Lelio from the merchant's family? These were not virtuous actions; and yet, how am I to tell you? I was conscious of a troubled joy, a glee, a hellish gusto in my author's bosom, which seemed to renew my vigour with every sentence, and which has indeed made the first of these passages accepted for a model of spirited <b>narrative</b> <b>description,</b> and the second for a masterpiece of wickedness and wit. What result, then, can be drawn from two experiences so contrary as yours and mine? For my part, I lay it down as a principle, no author can be moral in a merely human sense. And, to pursue the argument higher, how can you, for one instant, suppose the existence of free-will in puppets situated as we are in the thick of a novel which we do not even understand? And how, without free-will upon our parts, can you justify blame or approval on that of the author? We are in his hands; by a stroke of the pen, to speak reverently, he made us what we are; by a stroke of the pen he can utterly undo and transmute what he has made. In the very next chapter, my dear General, you may be shown up for an impostor, or I be stricken down in the tears of penitence and hurried into the retirement of a monastery!" ...|$|E

Method: <b>Narrative</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{of the injury}} events, sampled from a university teaching hospital, were categorized by three variables related to a residential child injury event. Four raters coded the descriptions. Results were tested on multirater reliability. Results: Satisfactory multirater kappa in coding "child's action (CA) " and "object becoming hazard (OBH) " variables confirms stability within these categories.
