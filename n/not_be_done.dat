5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} {{a request to}} administer an estate {{as soon as a}} flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards the Court did deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where it was appropriate to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in the ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert assets from a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E
5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a dental drill on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter who said that he was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and said could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with any equipment he knew.|$|E

5|$|The {{title was}} the first LucasArts {{adventure}} game to incorporate voice work on release. The game was not originally planned to include voice work, as at the time, the install base for CD-ROM was too low. As they neared the end of 1992, CD-ROM sales grew significantly. The general manager of LucasArts, Kelly Flock, recognizing that the game would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in time {{by the end of}} the year to make the holiday release, suggested that the team include voice work for the game, giving them more time to complete the title.|$|E

5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear warhead for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the Polaris missile. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith {{approached}} the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington Pump and Machinery but they turned it down, {{saying that it}} could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed {{to build a new}} factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories came up with a design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company came up with a revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E

5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E
5|$|While traveling, Einstein wrote {{daily to}} his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were {{included}} in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union. Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint {{director}} by James Kimball. The {{new director}} was {{more receptive to}} Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new designs for the non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint's authority to produce new designs. The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and {{had in the past}} introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for redesign in 1916.|$|E

5|$|In {{additional}} to {{the technical}} limitations, Robinett had struggled with Atari's management over the game. Around {{the time of}} Adventures development, Atari, now owned by Warner Communications, had hired Ray Kassar as general manager of their Consumer Division, and he was later promoted to president and CEO of Atari in December 1978. Kassar interacted with the programmers rarely and generally treated their contributions with indifference. Robinett was initially discouraged from working on Adventure by his supervisor, George Simcock, who said the ambitious game could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> based on knowing how much memory Colossal Cave Adventure used. When Robinett developed a working prototype within a month, the management at Atari were impressed, encouraging him to continue the game despite his supervisor's initial response. The management later tried to convince Robinett {{to make it a}} tie-in work for the upcoming Superman movie, which was owned by Warner Communication. Robinett remained committed to his initial idea. Instead, Atari had developer John Dunn offered to take Robinett's prototype source code to make the 1979 Superman game.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and sluice gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E
