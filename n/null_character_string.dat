5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a Procrustean string is a {{fixed length}} string into which strings of varying lengths are placed. If the string inserted is too short, {{then it is}} padded out, usually with spaces or <b>null</b> <b>characters.</b> If the <b>string</b> inserted is too long, it is truncated. The concept is mentioned in the Sinclair ZX81 and Sinclair Spectrum user manuals, where {{a portion of a}} string is replaced by another string using Procrustean assignment—the replacement string is truncated or padded in order to have length equal to the portion being replaced. Although the term did not catch on in wider usage, it appears in some references, notably FOLDOC.|$|R

In this method, we regard a <b>character</b> <b>string</b> as a line segment which width {{is equal to the}} character size, and extract the line segment (<b>character</b> <b>string)</b> using a robust line detection method, Hough Transform. The voting scheme of Hough transform is improved from black pixel-base to line segmentbase, which contributes to improvement of extracting accuracy and reduction of processing time. In order to estimate performance of our method, it was applied to 15 free formed images (512 x 512 pixels) involving about 60 strings. As a result, almost <b>character</b> <b>strings</b> were correctly extracted. ...|$|R
