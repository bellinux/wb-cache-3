Mills {{is quoted as}} saying that she intends it to be the first in a worldwide chain of vegan restaurants. Whilst promoting the restaurant, Mills gave an interview to the BBC, stating that she'd been very proactive in the building stages and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> open, would give as much time to it as she could – working it around her charity work. In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to local record producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton.|$|E
25|$|Dahomey faced a major {{economic}} recession. The country {{had not had}} a favorable trade balance since 1924, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> independent, France no longer offered subsidies. Maga helped to counter this by investing in the infrastructure and encouraging civil servants to take Dahomey as their residence. Still, Dahomey's GDP grew by 1.4 percent annually from 1957 to 1965, making Dahomey's economy one of the weakest in Africa.|$|E
25|$|Kurchatov's speech made it {{apparent}} that the three countries were all working on the same basic concepts and had all encountered the same sorts of problems. Cockcroft missed Kurchatov's visit because he had left for the US to press for declassification of the fusion work to avoid this duplication of effort. There was a widespread belief {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic that sharing their findings would greatly improve progress. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> known the Soviets were at the same basic development level, and that they were interested in talking about it publicly, the US and UK began considering releasing much of their information as well. This developed into a wider effort to release all fusion research at the second Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in September 1958.|$|E

25|$|The Jacobite army {{then turned}} north, losing men {{and failing to}} take Stirling Castle or Fort William but taking Fort Augustus and Fort George in Inverness by early April. Charles now took charge again, insisting on {{fighting}} an orthodox defensive action, and on 16 April 1746 they were finally defeated near Inverness at the Battle of Culloden by government forces made up of English and Scottish troops and Campbell militia, {{under the command of}} the Duke of Cumberland. The seemingly suicidal Highland sword charge against cannon and muskets had succeeded when launched against unprepared or disordered troops in earlier battles but failed <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pitted against regulars who had time to form their ranks properly. Charles promptly abandoned his army, blaming everything on the treachery of his officers, even though after the defeat the stragglers and unengaged units rallied at the agreed rendezvous and only dispersed when ordered to leave.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1805, Russian troops on the Askerani River near Zagam {{defeated}} the Iranian army during the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813) and saved Tbilisi from reconquest <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> officially part of the Imperial territories. Russian suzerainty over eastern Georgia was officially finalized with Iran in 1813 following the Treaty of Gulistan. Following the annexation of eastern Georgia, the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti was annexed by Tsar Alexander I. The last Imeretian king and the last Georgian Bagrationi ruler, Solomon II, died in exile in 1815, after attempts to rally people against Russia and to enlist foreign support against the latter, had been in vain. From 1803 to 1878, {{as a result of}} numerous Russian wars now against Ottoman Turkey, several of Georgia's previously lost territories – such as Adjara – were recovered, and also incorporated into the empire. The principality of Guria was abolished and incorporated into the Empire in 1829, while Svaneti was gradually annexed in 1858. Mingrelia, although a Russian protectorate since 1803, was not absorbed until 1867.|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp and Wright {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's 2–0 win against Everton {{on the first}} day of March. The team won by an {{identical}} scoreline at home to Nottingham Forest a week later and kept a third consecutive cleansheet against Southampton; midfielders Stephen Hughes and Paul Shaw both got themselves on the scoresheet. Defeat at home to Liverpool on 24 March 1997 was marred by a dubious penalty awarded to striker Robbie Fowler. The player himself [...] "stood and mouthed: 'No penalty!'" [...] given Seaman made no contact in the penalty box, but the referee unaltered his decision. Although Fowler's spotkick was later saved, the ball rebounded to Jason McAteer, who scored. Wenger ruled the team out of the title race again, by saying after the match, [...] "Everybody knows <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a penalty, but I can understand that a referee took a wrong decision. That's football and it eliminates our chance of the championship." ...|$|E

He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> me that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ...

Jonathan Landman, Blair's editor, told the Siegal committee he felt that Blair's being black played a large part in the younger man's initial promotion in 2001 to full-time staffer.

2500|$|As {{far back}} as the 1890s, French actress Polaire pioneered a look which {{included}} short, disheveled hair, emphatic mouth and huge eyes heavily outlined in kohl. The evolving flapper look required [...] "heavy makeup" [...] in comparison to what had previously been acceptable outside of professional usage in the theater. With the invention of the metal lipstick container as well as compact mirrors, bee stung lips came into vogue. Dark eyes, especially kohl-rimmed, were the style. Blush came into vogue <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> no longer a messy application process. Women shaped their eyebrows needle-thin and penciled them in dark, emulating such actresses as Clara Bow.|$|E

[...] Rather than return immediately to Austin, as their orders specified, Bowie and Fannin instead sent a courier to take Austin directions to their chosen campsite, the former Mission Concepción. [...] The scouting party camped along the San Antonio River near the mission, which was approximately [...] from San Antonio de Bexar and [...] from the Texian camp at Espada. [...] An angry Austin, fearing that his army would be easily defeated <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> split, issued a statement threatening officers who chose not to follow orders with court-martial.

2500|$|Crichel Down was a {{piece of}} {{farmland}} in Dorset compulsorily bought by the government for defence use. Commander George Marten, whose wife Mary was the only child and heiress of the original owner of the land Lord Alington, wanted to buy the land back in the 1950s <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> no longer used by the Ministry of Defence. [...] However, the Ministry of Agriculture resisted, wanting to use the land for experimental farming in a time of rationing and agricultural development. Marten, a former equerry in the Royal Family, had very influential friends and stirred up much trouble in the local Conservative Party and government backbenches. There followed a public inquiry which criticised the department's decision and civil servants, especially their methods, seen as an example of an over-powerful state.|$|E
2500|$|Gildas' remarks {{reflected}} his continuing concern {{regarding the}} vulnerability of his countrymen and their disregard and in-fighting: for example, [...] "it was always true of this people (as it is <b>now)</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> weak in beating off the weapons of the enemy but strong in putting up with civil war and the burden of sin." [...] However, after the War of the Saxon Federates, if there were acts of genocide, mass exodus or mass slavery, Gildas {{did not seem to}} know about them. Gildas, in discussing the holy shrines, mentioned that the spiritual life of Britain had suffered, because the partition (divortium), of the country, which was preventing the citizens (cives) from worshipping at the shrines of the martyrs. Control had been ceded to the Saxons, even control of access to such shrines. The church was now 'tributary', her sons had 'embraced dung' and the nobility had lost their authority to govern.|$|E

Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request of Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E
