This research aims to fill this gap by examining how employees change following the introduction of a new change initiative. Specifically, I investigate how employee knowledge of (1) a change objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives) and (2) how to best affect the objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions) changes following the introduction of a change initiative. To better understand potential attributes that may affect the trajectory of the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> constructs, I take a social cognitive approach to suggest five potential moderators (i. e., locus of control, interaction quality, valence, learning goal orientation, self-efficacy) based on the five core concepts of social cognitive theory (i. e., agency, observational learning, valued outcomes, goals, self-efficacy). Additionally, I propose a potential trajectory for behavioral alignment, based on a theory of change momentum; and, I examine the potential moderating effects of learning on the behavioral alignment trajectory.

The signal fingerprint positioning algorithm [4, 18] is based on the mapping relationship between some parameters obtained from the received signal and the position information of the target node. The range-based positioning algorithm with round-trip-time (RTT) measurements [19] is often used to meet the requirement of high-precision positioning because of its high time delay resolution. However, obtaining the accurate ranging estimation is a very challenging problem due to the effects of thermal noise, multi-path fading, <b>non-line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and other factors in wireless transmission channel.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{cooperative}} localization {{of mobile}} nodes in <b>non-line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (NLOS) situation is considered using a constrained square root unscented Kalman filter (CSRUKF). The NLOS measurements {{are used as}} quadratic constraints, which form a convex feasible region inside which {{the positions of the}} mobile nodes are supposed to be. The CSRUKF consists of two main stages: square root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF) and sigma point projection. In the former, a conventional SRUKF is used to estimate the state vector and the Cholesky factor of the error covariance matrix. In the latter, a new set of sigma points are generated, and the ones violating the constraints are projected onto the feasible region by solving a set of convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP). Each QCQP can be solved independently and in parallel for each sigma point violating the constraint, thus the algorithm is suitable for distributed processing. The simulation results show that our algorithm can perform well in different NLOS scenarios.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{two-stage}} robust distributed algo-rithm {{is proposed}} for cooperative sensor network localization using {{time of arrival}} (TOA) data without prior identification of <b>non-line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (NLOS) links. In the first stage, to overcome the effect of outliers, a convex relaxation of the Huber loss function is applied so that by using iterative optimization techniques, good estimates of the true sensor locations can be obtained. In the second stage, the original (non-relaxed) Huber cost function is further optimized to obtain refined location estimates based on those obtained in the first stage. In both stages, a simple gradient descent technique is used {{to carry out the}} optimization. Through simulations and real data analysis, it is shown that the proposed convex relaxation generally achieves a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to other convex relaxation techniques in the literature. Also by doing position refinement, the position estimates are improved and we can achieve an RMSE close to that of the other distributed algorithms which know a priori which links are in NLOS.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} M-ary {{spectral}} amplitude code (SAC) modulation technique {{to improve the}} performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems. Although this approach {{can be used in}} any dispersive FSO system, in this paper we focus on <b>non-line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) systems relying on atmospheric scattering. Spectral amplitude encoding is applied on a broadband UV source using the same code families for the M-ary alphabet as used previously in SAC optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) systems. A differential struc-ture using two photomultiplier tubes is utilized in conjunction with various demodulation algorithms to decode the received signal. Intersymbol interference (ISI), received beam divergence and shot noise are considered as the main factors limiting the system performance. An upper bound on the bit error probability is presented and compared with simulation results for various geometries and for different code parameters. The maximum bit rate for a fixed bit error probability is calculated in terms of the link length, and results for different alphabet sizes are shown. By sacrificing spectral efficiency without becoming more susceptible to ISI, the proposed system can support higher rates and longer distances for the same performance compared with on-off keying systems.
