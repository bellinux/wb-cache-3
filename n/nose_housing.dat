25|$|A {{total of}} 77 F-101As were built. They were {{gradually}} withdrawn from service starting in 1966. Twenty-nine survivors {{were converted to}} RF-101G specifications with a modified <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> reconnaissance cameras in place of cannons and radar. These served with the Air National Guard through 1972.|$|E
25|$|The {{airframe}} followed contemporary {{aircraft construction}} techniques, with weight savings {{from the use}} of advanced materials and the short airborne life of the missile. The fuselage was essentially tubular, tapering to a point at the <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> the guidance equipment, warhead and systems equipment. The engine was fed with air through a distinctive wedge shaped intake under the center fuselage. Its swept wings attached to its fuselage at the middle position, roughly halfway along its length, and a large swept fin attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage at the rear which was sometimes augmented by a large ventral fin at the extreme rear of the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|... had {{a rather}} abrupt, {{dome-shaped}} <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> the [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engine and its [...] turbo-supercharger. The engine was mounted with its output shaft low down in the nose and drove a two-blade propeller. [...] Though this was of the wooden, fixed-pitch type, it was intended {{that it would be}} replaced by a variable-pitch Lavasseur airscrew later. A single, roughly cylindrical Lamblin radiator was suspended below the engine, between the undercarriage legs.|$|E
500|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> the {{armament}} of one [...] Nudelman N-37 autocannon and two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon. The N-37 {{could be}} replaced by a [...] Nudelman N-45. The aircraft carried 100 rounds for each NS-23 and 40 rounds for the N-37. Two [...] FAB-250 high explosive bombs could be carried underneath the forward fuselage, but the N-37 had to be dismounted to do so.|$|R
50|$|The Microplano had a flat sided, {{rectangular}} section fuselage. The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> a 115 kW (157 hp) Hispano-Suiza water-cooled engine, {{driving a}} two bladed propeller. Behind the underwing single seat open cockpit the fuselage narrowed strongly in both height and width. Both the near circular rudder and semi-circular tailplane were all-moving. There was a fixed conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on V-form struts, assisted by a tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> the {{armament}} of one 37 mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon and two 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon. The N-37 {{could be}} replaced by a 45 mm Nudelman N-45. The aircraft carried 100 rounds for each NS-23 and 40 rounds for the N-37. Two 250 kg FAB-250 high explosive bombs could be carried underneath the forward fuselage, but the N-37 had to be dismounted to do so.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the V-12 first prototype, after {{exhaustive}} testing with test-rigs and mock-ups {{including a}} complete transmission system, began at Panki in 1965. The airframe was largely conventional, using stressed skin construction methods with high strength parts machined from solid. The large fuselage accommodated the [...] cabin and crew {{section in the}} extreme <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and electrical engineer in the lower cockpit, with the navigator and radio operator in the upper cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were built: W4052, W4053 and W4073. The second and third, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer. This caused some delays since half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the required higher combat loading. The nose sections also had to be changed from a design with a clear perspex bomb-aimer's position, to one with a solid <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> four [...]303 machine guns and their ammunition.|$|E
50|$|G.91R/1: Light attack/reconnaissance aircraft, {{fitted with}} {{modified}} <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> three cameras.|$|E
5000|$|As Beaufort units entered service, it {{was found}} that the {{defensive}} armament was inadequate and extra [...]303 in Vickers GO machine guns were fitted; two on a gimbal mounting in the forward nose and single guns on pivots on either beam. A remotely controlled [...]303 in Browning machine gun was fitted, firing to the rear under the <b>nose.</b> <b>Housed</b> in a clear blown transparency, {{it was found}} to be of little use and most operational units soon discarded them.|$|R
5000|$|Toe's {{older sister}} Stacey (Kat Dennings) arrives to tutor [...] "Nose" [...] Noseworthy (Jake Short), Toe's old, germaphobic friend. Nose picks his nose against his father's wishes and accidentally flicks the booger into his father's {{radioactive}} work study. Toe and Loogie, now friends, arrive at <b>Nose's</b> <b>house</b> {{in time to}} see Nose's booger mutate into a giant monster. After helping Nose's father (William H. Macy) capture the monster outside, Toe and Loogie take the rock and leave.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the tail-less Mü9 {{was almost}} {{complete}} when further work was abandoned {{due to the}} negative experiences of contemporary tail-less aircraft builders and the far from satisfactory Akaflieg München Mü5 Wastl. The sharply tapered wing was to have had moderate sweep {{on the leading edge}} and zero sweep on the trailing edge with small vertical surfaces at the wing-tips. The fuselage pod was to support the engine in the <b>nose,</b> <b>house</b> the cabin amidships and the tailwheel at the extreme rear, with no fin or rudder, (at least as initially designed), as well as the mountings for the main undercarriage legs which were to have been angled outwards to provide adequate track.|$|R
50|$|F2H-2P: Single-seat photo-reconnaissance {{version with}} {{lengthened}} <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> six cameras, 89 built.|$|E
50|$|F4D-2 {{version with}} {{extended}} <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> twin radar scanners, project only {{evolved into the}} F5D Skylancer.|$|E
50|$|The Su-17UM/Su-22U two-seat combat-trainer {{version with}} a {{completely}} re-designed <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> the tandem cockpits for student and instructor.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1950, the RCAF ordered 124 Mk 3s, {{the first}} {{entering}} service in 1953. These were armed with eight [...]50-caliber machine guns. The definitive rocket-armed Mk 4A {{was based on}} the prototype Mk 4 (a modified Mk 3), which first flew on 11 October 1952. The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> the much larger APG-40 radar with wingtip pods, each containing up to 29 Mk 4/Mk 40 [...] "Mighty Mouse" [...] Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket in addition to the guns. As the last 54 of an order for the Mk 3 were changed into the Mk 4 in 1954, total orders for the Mk.4 rose to 510. The Mk 4B version had more powerful Orenda 11s.|$|R
2500|$|At {{its most}} basic the Mk III Series C is nearly {{identical}} to the Mk III {{in terms of its}} layout. [...] At the front, a slanted <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> a radiator fed air from a vent above the front splitter, and exiting {{over the top of the}} bodywork just in front of the cockpit. [...] The sidepods were straight and flat and featured a variety of exchangeable panels for cooling and aerodynamics. [...] An engine intake was mounted behind and above the cockpit, and shrouded an engine bay which could accept multiple naturally aspirated engine designs. [...] Also shared with the Mk III was the use of a steel tube frame and carbon fiber chassis, rather than the all-carbon monocoque used by the Northstar LMP.|$|R
5000|$|The FP/RF-80A was an F-80A, with {{a longer}} and deeper <b>nose</b> to <b>house</b> cameras {{in place of}} the guns in the nose of the aircraft. After the end of the Korean War, the RF-80As were {{partially}} brought up to F-80C standards. These RF-80Cs had improved camera installations in a nose of modified contour ...|$|R
50|$|The S-52U two-seat combat-trainer, export {{version of}} the Su-17UM, with a {{completely}} re-designed <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> the tandem cockpits for student and instructor.|$|E
50|$|Unarmed {{training}} version {{fitted with}} new <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> cockpit for instructor, while the trainee {{sat in the}} normal cockpit. First flown 18 March 1950.|$|E
5000|$|P.57 Sea Prince T1 - Prince 3 {{with long}} <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> radar, twin wheeled main {{undercarriage}} and lengthened engine nacelles for navigation and anti-submarine training, 41 built.|$|E
25|$|Another {{company offers}} a {{modification}} {{for the entire}} King Air line that entails reworking and extending the entire <b>nose</b> to <b>house</b> a baggage compartment {{as well as the}} avionics normally found in the noses of King Air aircraft; while another offers winglets, {{similar to those of the}} B300, for 200 series and other 300 series King Airs.|$|R
5000|$|The main fuselage, or gondola, was {{centered}} on the aircraft's centerline. It was, {{from the tip of}} the nose {{to the end of the}} Plexiglas tail-cone, approximately five-sixths the length of one wing (root to tip). The <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> an evolved form of the SCR-268 Signal Corps Radar, the Western Electric Company's SCR-720A. Immediately behind the radar was the multi-framed [...] "greenhouse" [...] canopy, featuring two distinct levels, one for the pilot and a second for the gunner above and behind him, the latter elevated by approximately 6 in (15 cm). Combined with the nearly flat upper surface of the aircraft's nose, the two-tiered canopy gave the aircraft's nose a distinct appearance of three wide, shallow steps. The forward canopy in the XP-61 featured contiguous, smooth-curved, blown-Plexiglas canopy sections facing forward, in front of the pilot and the gunner. The tops and sides were framed.|$|R
25|$|In 1969, an {{improved}} version, the BN-2A Islander, conducted its maiden flight. It incorporated aerodynamic and flight equipment improvements, such as lower-drag engine cowlings and undercarriage, {{an improved}} interior, and an expanded rear baggage area with external access. In 1970, to improve hot-and-high performance, more powerful Lycoming O-540-K1-B5 engines were made available, alongside optional tiptanks and an elongated <b>nose</b> to <b>house</b> baggage.|$|R
50|$|The {{removal of}} the engine in the nose made the {{aircraft}} more aerodynamic, improved visibility for the pilots, and allowed the fitting of four machine guns. Its long slim <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> the bombsight, gained it the nickname Pinocchio.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 77 F-101As were built. They were {{gradually}} withdrawn from service starting in 1966. Twenty-nine survivors {{were converted to}} RF-101G specifications with a modified <b>nose,</b> <b>housing</b> reconnaissance cameras in place of cannons and radar. These served with the Air National Guard through 1972.|$|E
50|$|While other OKB's were {{designing}} {{the next generation}} of all-weather interceptors, OKB-301 was tasked with fitting the new Sokol (Falcon) radar into the La-200. The result was Aircraft 200B, with a new fuselage <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> the radar behind a large radome with three air intakes surrounding the radome. By mid 1953 the radar was working adequately but Aircraft 200B's performance was no longer good enough and further work was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, {{monoplane}} fighter, {{intended primarily}} as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long <b>nose</b> <b>housed</b> the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, {{with the main}} fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80L (20US gal) reserve fuel tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self-sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror.|$|R
50|$|House confronts Flynn, but Flynn still {{insists that}} he is a great magician. To demonstrate, Flynn has House pick a card. Then he throws the deck of cards at the wall. A card sticks to the window, but is not the card House picked. House removes the card and is about to scold the magician when he sees his card stuck {{on the other side of}} the glass wall. House cannot figure out how he did the trick. Suddenly, the magician starts to bleed profusely out of his <b>nose.</b> <b>House</b> realizes {{something}} is still wrong, and Flynn's cardiac arrest is actually a symptom of something more serious. House gathers the Fellows in his office. Amber suggests that Flynn has Polyarteritis nodosa. Taub throws out the possibility that the nose bleed was caused by cocaine. House tells Taub and Kutner to go to the patient's home. He orders Amber and Cole to do a biopsy of Flynn's heart.|$|R

50|$|Gonzo is {{also the}} namesake to the CT-142 Bombardier Dash 8 used by the Canadian Armed Forces for Air Combat Systems Officer {{training}} due to the blue paint job and elongated <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> a specialized radar. A similar flying example is the Gulfstream IV light jetliner bearing US registration N49RF, flown for severe weather research by the US Federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and is also named for Gonzo as portside nose art.|$|E

50|$|In January 1953, the USAF {{had asked}} McDonnell {{to develop an}} unarmed {{photographic}} reconnaissance version of the F-101 Voodoo as a possible replacement for the Republic RF-84F Thunderflash. The first RF-101A was delivered to the 17th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 6 May 1957 {{as a replacement for}} the subsonic RF-84F. The RF-101A had a redesigned and longer <b>nose</b> <b>housing</b> four cameras designed for low-altitude photography. In addition, two high-altitude cameras were mounted behind the cockpit in place of the ammunition boxes of the fighter variant.|$|E
5000|$|... '150' was {{provided}} with the latest radios, radars and navigation aids, with a ground mapping bombsight radar in a chin fairing under the <b>nose,</b> which also <b>housed</b> the taxi and landing lamps.|$|R
5|$|Tropic Moon III {{involved}} {{a completely new}} set of systems, up to date, and infinitely more capable than those previously installed. An entire new aircraft sub-variant, the B-57G, was developed for the purpose with a redefined <b>nose</b> to <b>house</b> the new sensor package. Development of the aircraft experienced major delays during which it was equipped with a laser target designated {{to be used with}} the then new first-generation Pave Way laser-guided bombs.|$|R
2500|$|First {{assigned}} Design 34, later G-41 by the builder, Grumman, {{the design}} was entered into competition alongside proposals from Bell, Brewster, Curtiss, Lockheed, and Vought. The XP-50 design {{was similar to}} that of the XF5F-1 with modifications to the fuselage <b>nose</b> to <b>house</b> the nose-wheel of the tricycle landing gear and provisions for self-sealing fuel tanks and pilot armor. The planned armament was two 20mm (.79in) cannon and two [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns.|$|R
