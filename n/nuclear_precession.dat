40|$|We consider, in the {{framework}} of the central spin s= 1 / 2 model, driven dynamics of two electrons in a double quantum dot subject to hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins and spin-orbit coupling. The nuclear subsystem dynamically evolves in response to Landau-Zener singlet-triplet transitions of the electronic subsystem controlled by external gate voltages. Without noise and spin-orbit coupling, subsequent Landau-Zener transitions die out after about 10 ^ 4 sweeps, the system self-quenches, and nuclear spins reach one of the numerous glassy dark states. We present an analytical model that captures this phenomenon. We also account for the multi-nuclear-specie content of the dots and numerically determine the evolution of around 10 ^ 7 nuclear spins in up to 2 × 10 ^ 5 Landau-Zener transitions. Without spin-orbit coupling, self-quenching is robust and sets in for arbitrary ratios of the <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>precession</b> times and the waiting time between Landau-Zener sweeps as well as under moderate noise. In presence of spin-orbit coupling of a moderate magnitude, and when the waiting time is in resonance with the precession time of one of the nuclear species, the dynamical evolution of nuclear polarization results in stroboscopic screening of spin-orbit coupling. However, small deviations from the resonance or strong spin-orbit coupling destroy this screening. We suggest that the success of the feedback loop technique for building nuclear gradients is based on the effect of spin-orbit coupling. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|Electron spin qubits {{confined}} in GaAs quantum dots {{are among the}} most established and well understood qubit systems. Long coherence times due to their weak interactionwith the environment and the electrical tunability of the semiconductor quantum dot have allowed GaAs-based spin qubits to {{play a central role in}} demonstrating the keyoperations of semiconductor spin qubits, such as initialization, read-out, universal control and two-qubit gates. Furthermore, spins {{confined in}} semiconductor nanostructuresprovide a solid-state approach to quantum computation which leverages current, well established semiconductor production technology for device fabrication and potential scalability. However, the interaction with nuclear spins in the GaAs host material complicates not only the preservation of qubit coherence, but also the precise control of the electronspins. As both these properties, the coherence time and the fidelity of gate operations, play a crucial role as prerequisites for quantum computing, the focus of this thesis areexperiments addressing these challenges on the basis of two-electron spin qubits. Interesting effects arise from the quadrupolar interaction of nuclear spins with electric field gradients. We show experimentally that quadrupolar broadening of the <b>nuclear</b> Larmor <b>precession</b> reduces electron spin coherence via faster decorrelation of transversenuclear fields. However, this effect disappears for appropriate field directions. Furthermore, we observe an additional modulation of coherence attributed to an anisotropicelectronic g-tensor. These results complete our understanding of dephasing in gated quantum dots and point to mitigation strategies. A key requirement for quantum computation are high-fidelity single qubit operations, which so far have not been demonstrated for encoded qubits in GaAs. Here, we realize such accurate operations by iteratively tuning of the all-electrical control pulses. Using randomized benchmarking, a well established characterization method, we find anaverage gate fidelity of F = (98. 5 ± 0. 1) % and determine the sum of gate leakage out of and back into the computational subspace to be L = (0. 4 ± 0. 1) %.

The potential of a feedback mechanism based on electric dipole spin resonance for narrowing the nuclear hyperfine field and its effectiveness for extending qubit coherencetime is investigated in a last experiment.
