5|$|Bush was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> melodist à la Dvorák, {{though he}} could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it.

5|$|The text {{presents}} Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully {{and being}} welcomed by {{the population as}} a liberator. This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors, notably the Assyrian rulers Tukulti-Ninurta I, who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC, and Sennacherib, who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region. The massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements. The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message; Johannes Haubold notes that it portrays Cyrus's takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> disaster but the salvation of Babylonia.|$|E
5|$|Thescelosaurus has {{generally}} been allied to Hypsilophodon and other small ornithopods as a hypsilophodontid, although recognized as being distinct among them for its robust build, unusual hindlimbs, and, more recently, its unusually long skull. Peter Galton in 1974 presented one twist to the classic arrangement, suggesting that because of its hindlimb structure and heavy build (not cursorial, or built for running, by his definition), it {{should be included in}} the Iguanodontidae. This has not been followed, with Morris arguing strongly against Galton's classification scheme. At any rate, Galton's Iguanodontidae was polyphyletic and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> group, and so would not be recognized under modern cladistic usage.|$|E
5|$|Around 66 BC, a {{movement}} to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The movement was based {{in the town of}} Faesulae, which was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In The Nature of Disease I {{argued that}} a value-free account of our concept of disease cannot be given. Part of this {{argument}} consisted in showing that diseases as <b>a</b> class do <b>not</b> constitute <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> kind. To understand this, we need only see that we define and classify conditions into diseases and non-diseases {{not in terms of}} their causes but in terms of their effects. While no philosophical position is watertight, the arguments overwhelmingly favour the conclusion that diseases do <b>not</b> constitute <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> kind...|$|R
5|$|During his career, Caldwell {{served on}} the faculties of the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Oklahoma, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley, and had shorter {{appointments}} at some 80 other collegiate institutions both within the U.S. and overseas. At various times, Caldwell served as advisor or consultant to the U.S. Senate, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, and Interior, and the National Institutes of Health. Although <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> scientist, {{as part of his}} work towards establishing interdisciplinary study in universities and achieving a greater merging of the two worlds of science and public policy, he became deeply involved in national and international environmental affairs and worked closely with several important scientific bodies serving, among many appointments, on the Sea Grant Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first Environmental Advisory Board of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Pacific Science Congress, the President’s National Commission on Materials Policy, the Science Advisory Board for the Great Lakes of the International Joint Commission, as chair of the first Commission on Environmental Policy, Law and Administration for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and as advisor to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the UNESCO working program for the environmental education and training of engineers.|$|E
25|$|The bewildering {{number and}} variety of phonetic values that signs could have in Sumerian led to an unfortunate detour in {{understanding}} the language – a Paris-based orientalist, Joseph Halévy, argued from 1874 onward that Sumerian was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> language, but rather a secret code (a cryptolect), and {{for over a decade}} the leading Assyriologists battled over this issue. For a dozen years, starting in 1885, even the great Friedrich Delitzsch accepted Halévy's arguments, not renouncing Halévy until 1897.|$|E
25|$|The pyramid {{suffered}} several catastrophic collapses {{in ancient}} and medieval times; medieval Arab writers {{described it as}} having seven steps – although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance. The hill on which the pyramid is situated is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> landscape feature – it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way.|$|E

25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> process {{but is a}} skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.|$|E

25|$|Shrewsbury was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> royalist stronghold as it {{had been}} the scene of {{political}} and ideological conflict between Puritans and Laudians for several decades. A group of Shrewsbury aldermen petitioned parliament on 16 July to recognise a militia that had begun to gather under the command of Thomas Hunt. Parliament responded positively and sent a deputation of three MPs to establish its military control of Shropshire. One of these was Sir John Corbet, 1st Baronet, of Stoke upon Tern, a grandson of Lord Chancellor Thomas Bromley and thus Wolryche's second cousin. However, it was Francis Ottley who seized the initiative and disrupted the parliamentary muster on 1 August, allowing Royalist forces to rally the following day under Sir Vincent Corbet of Moreton Corbet.|$|E

500|$|The {{organism}} {{has also}} prompted novel hypotheses about {{the classification of}} early arthropods. [...] One classification scheme has Schinderhannes classified basally to the crown arthropods, but closer to that group than Anomalocaris. [...] This {{would mean that the}} crown arthropod lineage evolved from a paraphyletic grade of anomalocaridids, and that the group of early arthropods with short 'great appendages' are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> grouping. [...] The biramous limb of arthropods may then have arisen through fusion of anomalocaridid lateral lobes and gills.|$|E
50|$|In Australian linguistics, the {{peripheral}} consonants are <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> class encompassing consonants articulated at {{the extremes of}} the mouth: labials and velars.
