5|$|Hanley council made {{a formal}} {{proposal}} in 1902 to the Local Government Board {{for the expansion}} of the County Borough of Hanley to include not only Stoke, Burslem, Longton, Fenton and Tunstall but also Smallthorne Urban District, Wolstanton Rural District, and the parishes of Milton, Goldenhill, Chell, Trentham, Stoke Rural, Caverswall and Stone. Only Longton council supported the idea as concurrently, Sir Hugh Owen, a former secretary to the Local Government Board, presented the six towns committee with a scheme of financial adjustment. Under this proposal, the <b>net</b> <b>assets</b> of each town would be calculated by deducting outstanding debts and liabilities from the values of its various properties. The proportion each town needed to contribute to the overall value of the county borough was then to be calculated. If the value of the <b>net</b> <b>assets</b> to be contributed by a town was less than the proportion calculated as due from that town towards the overall sum, then that town would need to set a higher general rate to be paid by the ratepayers of that town. Conversely, towns contributing a value of <b>net</b> <b>assets</b> greater than their proportion of the overall sum would be able to set a lower general rate. While five of the towns awaited a report from Alderman Frederick Geen of Stoke on the implications of the Owen proposal, Fenton immediately decided that it would impose undue financial hardship on the ratepayers of the district as the <b>net</b> <b>assets</b> of the district would show a deficiency and therefore a higher rate would have to be set. Fenton district council could not accept such a move and withdrew from all discussions on federation forthwith. Geen's July 1903 report increased opposition to the idea of federation while a poll of ratepayers in Burslem came out strongly against federation. Burslem council then withdrew from the scheme to be followed shortly afterwards by Stoke. Faced by such strong opposition, Hanley council felt compelled to withdraw its submission to the Local Government Board bringing the first attempt at federation in the twentieth century to an unsuccessful conclusion.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} The purpose of this thesis is to provide {{evidence}} on recent trends in the ETF industry. More specifically, this thesis examines <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows on physical and synthetic ETFs from 2010 to March 2015, and clarifies the factors affecting these <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows. In particular, {{the effect of the}} replication method, securities lending and critical report by IMF in 2011 are taken into account. Furthermore, the thesis compares the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows between mutual funds and ETFs by the asset class. Data and methodology The data for the thesis was received from Bloomberg and Lyxor Asser Management, a subsidiary of Société Générale. The data consists <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows, replication method, asset class and securities lending on 2054 European domiciled ETFs. In addition, the thesis includes data about European domiciled mutual funds. First, the thesis compares <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows between mutual funds and ETFs by asset class. Secondly, regression model is used to analyze the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows to ETFs by asset class. Replication method, securities lending and critical report by the IMF have been treated as dummy variables. Results The results show that the European domiciled equity and commodity ETFs have attracted larger <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows compared to their mutual fund peers in recent years. However, European domiciled fixed income mutual funds have attracted larger <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows compared to fixed income ETFs. The results of the regression model show that the physical ETFs have had a <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flow premium compared to their synthetic peers in equities, fixed income and commodities between January 2010 and March 2015. In addition, regression models show that the securities lending generates $ 149. 0 m monthly premium for equity ETFs, whereas the securities lending premium is $ 178. 2 m for fixed income ETFs over ETFs, which do not participate in securities lending. Finally, according to the regression model the critical report by IMF had a positive effect ($ 486. 7 m monthly premium) on the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows to physical equity ETFs and negative effect ($ - 845. 4 m monthly premium) on the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows to synthetic equity ETFs...|$|R
