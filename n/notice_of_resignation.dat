5|$|The {{growth of}} commercialism in English {{football}} {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{paved the way for}} Arsenal and other prominent clubs to seek the possibility of setting up a new top-flight division. Unhappy with how income was distributed to the lower leagues and wanting to exploit television rights, Arsenal and 21 other First Division clubs handed a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> from the Football League by August 1991. The breakway division, entitled the Premier League, was administered by The Football Association and received financial backing from Sky Television. Arsenal finished 10th in the inaugural season; the club did well in other competitions, winning a unique FA and League Cup double. They were victorious in the 1994 Cup Winners' Cup Final, and came close to defending the trophy in 1995, before losing to Real Zaragoza.|$|E

At first, {{attempts were made to}} persuade Mannerheim to become prime minister, but he rejected them because of his age and lack of experience running a civil government. The next suggestion was to elect him Head of State. Risto Ryti would resign as President, and parliament would appoint Mannerheim as Regent. The use of the title [...] "Regent" [...] would have reflected the exceptional circumstances of Mannerheim's election. Mannerheim and Ryti both agreed, and Ryti submitted a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> on 1 August. The Parliament of Finland passed a special act conferring the presidency on Mannerheim on 4 August 1944. He took the oath of office the same day.|$|E

In October 1870 Moon was able to inform Webb that his appointment as Locomotive Superintendent had been approved.
