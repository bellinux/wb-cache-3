2500|$|Residues {{from the}} {{breakdown}} of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, {{have been found in}} chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand. The European Union banned the use of <b>nitrofurans</b> in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of <b>nitrofurans</b> in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for <b>nitrofurans</b> leading to the implementation of a [...] "zero tolerance or no residue standard". In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for <b>nitrofurans.</b> The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all <b>nitrofurans</b> in 2002.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Nitrofuran</b> antibiotics, {{employed}} {{for the treatment}} of bacterial diseases in livestock production, were banned from use in the European Union (EU) in 1995 due to concerns about the carcinogenicity of their residues in edible tissue.

In-house method validation was performed and reported data of validation (specificity, linearity, recovery, CCα and CCβ).

40|$|<b>Nitrofurans</b> are {{synthetic}} broad-spectrum antimicobial {{agents that}} are often used in commercial animal production because of their excellent antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties. However, <b>nitrofurans</b> and their metabolites {{have been shown to}} have potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic characteristics which has led to a ban on the use of <b>nitrofurans</b> in preventive and therapeutic treatment of animals used for food production. Metabolites of <b>nitrofurans</b> that can be determined after their application are: a metabolite of furazolidone, furaltadone metabolite, a metabolite of nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone metabolite. The presence of residues of nitrofuran antibiotics in meat, fish and shrimps, and milk and eggs originating from countries outside the European Union is monitored and recorded by the RASFF system of the European Union. Furthermore, since <b>nitrofurans</b> are used in some countries as prophylactic agents and growth promoters, it is necessary to carry out constant control of various types of food of animal origin, in order to reduce to the minimum potential carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of these supstances for the health of consumers. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is no permanent control of <b>nitrofurans</b> in food of animal origin. The provisions of the „Regulation on the maximum allowable amounts of veterinary drugs and pesticides in products of animal origin", published in the Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina state the prohibiting of the use of certain veterinary drugs in animals intended for human consumption, including <b>nitrofurans.</b> The European Union has established the minimum required limit (MRLP) for performance which is 1 μg/kg of <b>nitrofurans</b> for edible tissues of animal origin.

Rejections of consignments by the foreign buyers have been recurrent {{for the last couple of}} years due to detection of these banned antibiotics. The increasingly complex requirements for food safety assurance and traceability set by major export markets represent a threat to the trade of this significant sector. In this study, the status and trends of the presence of <b>nitrofuran</b> and chloramphenicol in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man) and marine shrimp Penaeus monodon (Fabricius) and in their feeds in the Southwest coastal region of Bangladesh were investigated. The prawn/shrimp farmers, feed manufacturers and feed sellers were interviewed with well structured pre-tested Questionnaires. Antibiotic residues present in the animal muscles, feeds and feed ingredients were detected using LC–MS–MS by the Fish Inspection and Quality Control Wing of the Department of Fisheries. The study reveals that farmers did not deliberately use those banned antibiotics, but these chemicals were detected in many M. rosenbergii and P. monodon samples in 2008, 2009 and 2010, in both fresh muscles, pre-export and post-export consignments. The percentage of contamination with this banned antibiotics in M. rosenbergii samples were 17. 74 %, 22. 89 %, 13. 60 % and in P. monodon samples were 12. 65 %, 15. 79 %, 11. 85 % in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively.
