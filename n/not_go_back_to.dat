5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{as it did}} <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the 1860s, {{considered to be the}} period when the Mafia emerged around Palermo. It started as a form of private protection and {{has little to do with}} large estates as was the case in many other rural areas where many mafiosi started as caretakers and lease-holders (gabelloto or bailiff) for absentee landlords.|$|E
5|$|Mose Wright {{stayed on}} his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying to find Till. Unsuccessful, they {{returned}} home by 8:00am. After hearing from Wright {{that he would not}} call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E
5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E

5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E
25|$|In CKD {{numerous}} uremic toxins {{accumulate in}} the blood. Even when ESKD (largely synonymous with CKD5) is treated with dialysis, the toxin levels do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> normal as dialysis {{is not that}} efficient. Similarly, after a kidney transplant, the levels may <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> normal as the transplanted kidney may not work 100%. If it does, the creatinine level is often normal. The toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights, {{and some of them}} are bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Such toxic protein-bound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic dialysis procedures used today.|$|E

The majority of Christians are now Trinitarian and regard belief in the Trinity as a test of true orthodoxy of belief.|$|E

25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.|$|E
25|$|Irvine did {{not play}} Test cricket again and in fact never played cricket outside the {{domestic}} South African competitions after this brief taste of Test cricket. The South Africans had been due to tour England in 1970, but the tour was called off, and though other players, such as Barry Richards and Mike Procter returned to their English counties for the season, Irvine did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Essex. He played regularly for Transvaal {{for the next seven}} seasons, making a lot of runs and also acting as the regular wicketkeeper for the first five years. He was Transvaal captain in 1974–75 and 1975–76. He retired after the 1976–77 season.|$|E
25|$|After González was {{returned}} to his father's custody, he remained in the U.S. while the Miami relatives exhausted their legal options. A three-judge federal panel had ruled that he could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cuba until he was granted an asylum hearing, but the case turned {{on the right of}} the relatives to request that hearing on behalf of the boy. On June 1, 2000, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Elián was too young to file for asylum; only his father could speak for him, and the relatives lacked legal standing. On June 28, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision. Later the same day, Elián González and his family returned home to Cuba.|$|E

500|$|At the University of Chicago, {{where she}} earned an M.A. in 1936, Brodie lost {{her faith in}} {{religion}} entirely. In 1975, she recalled, [...] "It was like taking a hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly that I could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the old life, and I never did." [...] She continued to write to Jensen until shortly before she married Bernard Brodie on her graduation day, August 28, 1936.|$|E

However, Beyoncé said that their side {{projects}} were only [...] "a brief diversion in the juggernaut that has become Destiny's Child". As time did not permit, Beyoncé's musical aspirations were put on hiatus for her to concentrate on her Super Bowl performance, wherein she was slated to sing the US national anthem, and the recording of Destiny's Child's fourth album, Destiny Fulfilled; the group finally disbanded in 2005.|$|E

Instead, he played the piano in an assortment of taxi dance halls and other establishments in the city. Hope and Powell met fellow pianist Thelonious Monk in 1942, and the three {{spent a lot of}} time together. This was interrupted in March 1943, when Hope enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army. In the enlistment records, Hope was listed as being single, with dependents. He had been married and had a son, who died. The terms of enlistment stated that Hope would be in the army [...] "for the duration of the War [...] or other emergency, plus six months".|$|E

500|$|He {{was visiting}} the United States when Adolf Hitler {{came to power}} in 1933 and—being Jewish—did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Germany, where he had been a {{professor}} at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He settled in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of [...] "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" [...] and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to what would become the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported defending the Allied forces, but generally denounced the idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as a weapon. Later, with the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, Einstein signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{injuries}} were treated {{and by the}} time he was returned to the police station, some four thousand people had gathered outside. Inside the station, MalcolmX and an attorney were making bail arrangements for two of the Muslims. Johnson was not bailed, and police said he could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hospital until his arraignment the following day. Considering the situation to be at an impasse, MalcolmX stepped outside the station house and gave a hand signal to the crowd. Nation members silently left, after which the rest of the crowd also dispersed. One police officer told the New York Amsterdam News: [...] "No one man should have that much power." [...] Within a month the New York City Police Department arranged to keep MalcolmX under surveillance; it also made inquiries with authorities in other cities in which he had lived, and prisons in which he had served time. A grand jury declined to indict the officers who beat Johnson. In October, MalcolmX sent an angry telegram to the police commissioner. Soon the police department assigned undercover officers to infiltrate the Nation of Islam.|$|E
500|$|MacGregor reached Aux Cayes to find news of {{this latest}} debacle had preceded him, and he was shunned. A friend in Jamaica, Thomas Higson, {{informed}} him through letters that Josefa and Gregorio had been evicted, and until Higson's intervention had sought sanctuary in a slave's hut. MacGregor was wanted in Jamaica for piracy and so could not join his family there. He similarly could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Bolívar, who was so outraged by MacGregor's recent conduct that he accused the Scotsman of treason and ordered his death by hanging if he ever {{set foot on the}} South American mainland again. MacGregor's whereabouts for the half year following October 1819 are unknown. Back in London in June 1820, Michael Rafter published his highly censorious account of MacGregor's adventures, Memoirs of Gregor M'Gregor, dedicating the book to his brother Colonel William Rafter and the troops abandoned at Porto Bello and Rio de la Hacha. In his summary Rafter speculated that following the latter episode MacGregor was [...] "politically, though not naturally dead"—"to suppose", he wrote, [...] "that any person could be induced again to join him in his desperate projects, would be to conceive a degree of madness and folly of which human nature, however fallen, is incapable".|$|E

500|$|Disillusioned by her firing from Dr. Vegas, Adams, at 30 years old, {{considered}} {{looking for}} an alternate career after finishing work on the sole project she was signed to. It was the independent comedy-drama Junebug, which had a production budget of under $1 million. Directed by Phil Morrison, the film featured Adams as Ashley Johnsten, a perky and talkative pregnant woman. Morrison was impressed by Adams' ability to not question her character's inherently good motives. She found a connection with Johnsten's faith in God, and spent time with Morrison in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (where the film is set), attending Sunday church. She described making the film as [...] "the summer I grew into myself", and after dyeing her hair red for the part, she decided to <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her natural blonde color. Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where Adams won a special jury prize. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph labeled the film a [...] "small, quiet miracle" [...] and wrote that Adams had given [...] "one of the most delicately funny and heartbreaking performances it's ever been my pleasure to review". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post opined that her [...] "radiant portrayal" [...] reflected the film's [...] "deeply humanist heart". Adams received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination and won an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E
500|$|The House of Representatives {{debated the}} bill on July 13 and 14, 1965. The {{discussion}} was wide-ranging. Idaho Congressman Compton I. White opposed the bill, having prepared a chart showing the debasement of the Roman denarius between the years 1 and 300, though stating {{that he did}} not expect that coinage debasement would cause a government to fall. Nevada's Walter S. Baring noted that the Treasury was selling silver to the makers of cutlery and stated, [...] "I would rather eat with chopsticks than take the silver out of our coinage". Massachusetts' Silvio Conte denigrated Sir Thomas Gresham for illicit profits when the Royal Exchange in London was established, but conceded that Gresham's Law would nevertheless cause base metal coins to drive the silver ones from circulation. Iowa's Harold Gross asked Conte that if the U.S. was going to debase its coinage, why <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> wampum. Minor amendments, including removing the mint mark from coinage for up to five years, were agreed to. There was objection to the committee amendment removing silver entirely from the half dollar; it was defeated 48—94, leaving the half dollar at 40 percent silver. Congressman James F. Battin of Montana offered an amendment to make the dime and quarter out of 40 percent silver; although Patman objected that the committee had rejected the idea, it initially passed 122—112. However, this was at the Committee of the Whole stage, and Patman got the House to reject the Battin amendment, 197—218. After other attempts were made in vain to derail the bill, the House Minority Leader, Michigan's Gerald R. Ford, asked that there be a recorded vote on H.R. 8926, and the bill passed, 255—151, Ford voting in favor. Patman then had the House amend the Senate bill, S. 2080, to reflect the House-passed language, and pass it.|$|E
