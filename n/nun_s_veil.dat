We argue that previous tests for such <b>s</b> <b>veil</b> have lacked proper focus, identifying influences of corporate saving on private saving that are entirely consistent with a complete piercing of the corporate veil. We formulate two tests. Results based on the first find that wealth-neutral changes In corporate dividend policy do not significantly affect aggregate consumption, suggesting that no corporate veil exists, The second test finds the aggregate consumption response to changes in corporate wealth is close to zero, consistent with the presence of a veil but also with heterogeneity in the population with respect to consumption behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|Dennis Mueller has {{recently}} {{made a significant}} contribution to understanding issues of federalism and confederalism in the European Union - from a particular public choice point of view.

However, Mueller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>veiled</b> preference for a certain ideal form of federalism for Europe tends to reduce the parameters of his discussion, and gives his article an unrealistic and narrow focus, despite its ambitious scope. The present article explores some of the latent complexities in the public choice analysis and design of European integration, particularly by drawing on the wider experience of working federations and theory of federalism, using the unique and synthesizing Australian experience as a point of departure. It argues that Mueller 2 ̆ 7 s analysis is biased towards the reduction of decision-making costs of European governance, and thus undervalues the external costs that may be imposed through excessive central government...|$|R

Through his otherworldy language Miles Coverdale, the novel 2 ̆ 7 s unreliable narrator, creates a flawed or failed allegory about {{the creation of a}} new Eden. The characters both do and do not embody their allegorical figures.

Architectural divisions became prominent markets of the regulation of the shared space that remained (such as chapels).

Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, this view has taken on new significance, {{in light of the}} perceived civilizational divide between the Western and Muslim worlds. The Article calls into question this view, by examining cultural stereotypes of women used to oppose U.

A fresh look at the ways constitutionalism has masked cultural assumptions about women is particularly urgent given recent concerns over clashes between gender and culture in the evolving constitutional frameworks of Afghanistan and Iraq.

Decision making often increase variability, defects and consumes time. The goal {{of this paper is}} to offer a structured framework to design a machine-learning based solution to automate decisions. It will leverage recorded decisions made by Amazon's employees every minute. Using the stow problem as an example, the paper will showcase how captured decision data can be a source of knowledge about processes and products. The stow case is a perfect example for non-trivial continuous decision making process. The workers' decisions are recorded but to this day Amazon does not leverage them for learning purposes. Our framework will offer a few outcomes: 1) High accuracy decision model, improving forecasting abilities from 59 % to 95 % 2) Self healing mechanism and learning system 3) Coaching and training tool. Using only the first outcome, cost savings are estimated to be over $ 25 M annually across the US network.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} the appropriation and meaning of the hijab in the modern Middle East. During colonial times the veil’s depiction as a sign of backwardness, in social artifacts and in colonial discourse, was used to justify colonialism. Following the colonial period, indigenous scholars and other elites called for unveiling, seeing the hijab as an obstacle to “progress. ” However, in the 1970 <b>s,</b> a new <b>veiling</b> movement emerged that appropriated the veil as a sign of an authentic identity and an instrument to accommodate a changing modern world. This neo-veiling movement, furthermore, standardized a set of Islamic norms and practices that would use the veil as the embodiment of inner piety and ethical states. It is within this context that this thesis discusses contemporary pious fashion in Amman, Jordan. The ethics and aesthetics of veiling in Amman have again shifted the meaning and appropriation of the veil. Establishing an agreement or balance between piety and fashion/ethics and aesthetics in veiling is significant for contemporary urban residents of Amman. Furthermore, this balance has social significance and guides social and cultural interactions. Harmony, however, is not easily achieved; pious fashion is a complicated maze that is carefully navigated by veiled women. honors thesis 2013 International Comparative Studie...|$|R

It is the Mi`r 2 ̆ 6 amacr;jn 2 ̆ 6 amacr;ma genre that gave rise to the most complete pictorial cycles depicting the Prophet, engaged in prayer-dialogues and actions fit for emulation. The earliest extant series of images belonging to a Mi`r 2 ̆ 6 amacr;jn 2 ̆ 6 amacr;ma (TSK H. 2154) are reconstructed and matched with an appropriate text (SK Aya Sofya 3441) to prove that pictured “Books of Ascension” ca. 1317 – 35 promoted Sunni Islam during a period of religious fluctuation. ^ The most famous illustrated Mi`r 2 ̆ 6 amacr;jn 2 ̆ 6 amacr;ma of the 1430 s (BnF Sup Turc 190) also reveals an indebteness to theological writings and was culled for pictures of the Prophet at the Ottoman court as early as the late fifteenth century. Twenty-five folios inserted into the Mi`r 2 ̆ 6 amacr;jn 2 ̆ 6 amacr;ma manuscript contain Ottoman Turkish inscriptions commenting upon the paintings in the original manuscript. Such annotations not only are a testament to the manuscript 2 ̆ 7 s peregrinations, but, more importantly, reveal Ottoman procedures of naturalizing pictorial forms into the visual arts through the intermediary of written, ekphrastic commentary. ^ Images of the ascension during the sixteenth century exited the Mi`r 2 ̆ 6 amacr;jn 2 ̆ 6 amacr;ma genre and flourished in the prefaces of Persian poems, which praise God, his Prophet, and the Prophet 2 ̆ 7 s ascension. Artists drew on the symbolic language found in poetical eulogies (na`t or mun 2 ̆ 6 amacr;j 2 ̆ 6 amacr;t) to develop new ways of depicting the Prophet as primordial light (n 2 ̆ 6 umacr;r) and heavenly scent (b 2 ̆ 6 umacr;). On the other hand, the appearance of the Prophet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> facial <b>veil</b> was linked to the polito-religious claims of the Sh 2 ̆ 6 imacr;` 2 ̆ 6 imacr; Safavid ruler Sh 2 ̆ 6 amacr;h Ism 2 ̆ 6 amacr;` 2 ̆ 6 imacr;l (r. 1501 – 24). By examining ascension paintings that depict the Prophet in non-veristic ways, this study puts forward new ways of thinking about portraiture in pre-modern Islamic cultures. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} the non-human (the natural, not the other-worldly) {{world and its}} creatures were voiced in several late medieval English texts: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Nun</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Priest 2 ̆ 7 s Tale and Manciple 2 ̆ 7 s Tale, and the Towneley Second Shepherds 2 ̆ 7 Play. The dissertation is organized into three chapters which severally allocate voicing the non-human to three different (although conceivably overlapping) modes of representation - acoustic, formal, and performative. Underpinning this project is the objective to place these texts in a historicized ecocritical context. In the first chapter I analyze the figurative (and formative) sounds the natural world 2 ̆ 2 speaks 2 ̆ 2 as it advances a crescendo of insistent clamor in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. I argue that this poem exploits the common (and serviceable) conviction of the analogous equivalency of the two categories woman and nature - in order to register the anxieties engendered by the encroachments {{of women and the}} natural world in post-plague England. The second chapter addresses how the voices of domestication and its discontents unfold in the use Chaucer makes of the protean genres of fable and exemplum, proverbs, and the deployment of similes in two of his bird tales. I rely on current theorizing of interspecies and intra-species domestication to identify and extract the discontents I have found to be inhering in its processes: savagery/violence, hybridity, uninvited and unintended transformations, and theft. The third chapter considers how human and non-human voices confoundingly yet steadily implicated and entangled in one another - performatively discover homes amid multiple ranges, including silence, volume, laughter, and music. This chapter represents the effort to subtend and complicate existing understandings of this popular late medieval pageant by thinking in terms of ranges, variations, and multivalent characterizations, rather than slots, hierarchies, stabilities, and characters who have become little more than canned effigies. In conclusion, I argue that late medieval poetic texts show a remarkable diversity in the ways and means their authors chose to variously voice the non-human, and that the particular forms this voicing took shaped, even as it was shaped, by the non-human world around them. This diversity and variation enables a more complex understanding of the different avenues and directions this voicing afforded to succeeding generations...|$|R
40|$|The medieval {{understanding}} of Cain, fratricide and 2 ̆ 2 vagabond on the earth, 2 ̆ 2 and Nimrod, tyrannical giant and {{architect of the}} Tower of Babel, prompted the figuration of movement as an erotic act and the corollary figuration of sexuality as movement, a process I term 2 ̆ 2 the erotics of wandering. 2 ̆ 2 Cain 2 ̆ 7 s vagrancy was consonant {{with the belief that}} his descendants 2 ̆ 7 errant sodomy caused the Flood, and Nimrod 2 ̆ 7 s desire 2 ̆ 2 to penetrate heaven beyond nature 2 ̆ 2 contributed to the figuration of lechery as a form of illicit penetration. This dissertation examines such erotics in various categories aligned with 2 ̆ 2 wandering, 2 ̆ 2 whether literal or metaphorical, that were associated with Cain or Nimrod. The Alliterative Morte Arthure presents Arthur as a new Nimrod whose crusade is inherently sodomitical; likewise, Dante 2 ̆ 7 s Ulysses exhorts his 2 ̆ 2 brothers 2 ̆ 2 to transgress sanctioned bounds on an anti-crusade, aligning him with the lustful of Purgatorio 26. The idea of genealogical 2 ̆ 2 wandering 2 ̆ 2 predominates in Abelard 2 ̆ 7 s Historia Calamitatum and Langland 2 ̆ 7 s Piers Plowman, which depict social outcasts as agents of frustration: Abelard 2 ̆ 7 s abandonment of his birthright and Cainite exile are metaphysical versions of his castration, and Langland 2 ̆ 7 s bastards and friars both descend from Cain and enact sodomitical lechery. Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Nun</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Priest 2 ̆ 7 s Tale, in its engagement with the charged concepts of tyranny and scriptural translation, depicts 2 ̆ 2 woman 2 ̆ 2 and the peasantry in the context of Nimrodian confusion. Although in exploring such errancy these narratives attempt to displace sinfulness onto an 2 ̆ 2 Other, 2 ̆ 2 whether it be the Muslims, sodomites, or friars, they are themselves implicated in the Cainite and Nimrodian erotics of wandering. For rhetoric itself, according to medieval thinkers, was a process of movement that entailed the risk of lecherous promiscuity or sodomitical transgression. Abelard 2 ̆ 7 s narrative circularity, for example, conflicts with Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s model of autobiographical progression; Piers Plowman, although it accuses the friars of exceeding divinely ordained measure, transgresses that very bound in its succession of genres and lack of structure; and Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s program of displacement (epitomized by Chauntecleer 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Mulier est hominis confusio 2 ̆ 2), which registers in the context of debates over the translation of Latinate authority into the feminine vernacular, confirms his anxieties that his narratives 2 ̆ 2 sownen into synne. 2 ̆ 2...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{focuses on}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{decision}} in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 1800 (2009). In that case, the Supreme Court upheld an important change in the FCC indecency regulation. In the past, the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s policy had been that the broadcast of a single expletive did not violate FCC indecency policy. In order for such fleeting expletives to be actionable, the FCC required {{that they had to}} be repetitive and gratuitous. But in 2004, in response to the use of some expletives by entertainers during the Golden Globe Awards, the FCC changed its policy and ruled that a single expletive could be actionable. The broadcasters affected by this change in policy petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for review of this change in policy on both constitutional and statutory grounds. A three-judge panel of the Second Circuit held, per Judge Pooler, two to one, that the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s reversal of its fleeting expletives policy was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 489 F. 3 d 444 (2 d Cir. 2007). Since the panel 2 ̆ 7 s holding was based on a violation of a federal statute, the panel declined to rule on the First Amendment arguments of the broadcasters. But Judge Pooler 2 ̆ 7 s opinion for the panel expressed sympathy for those arguments. The Supreme Court, per Justice Scalia, reversed and remanded the Second Circuit decision. The Supreme Court ruled, five to four, that the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s change of policy had met the standard set by the Supreme Court in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, 463 U. S. 29 (1983) for changes in administrative policy. Justice Scalia declined to pass on the First Amendment issues presented by the broadcasters although he observed that fleeting expletives were on the 2 ̆ 2 periphery of First Amendment concern. 2 ̆ 2 This Article analyzes Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s majority opinion, the concurrences of Justices Kennedy and Thomas, and the dissents of Justice Stevens for the indications they provide for ascertaining the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s position if the First Amendment validity of the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s new fleeting expletive policy does come before the Court. This Article contends that behind Fox Television Station 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> administrative law <b>veil</b> there is an intense First Amendment debate going on among the Justices concerning whether the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s new policy on fleeting expletives violates the First Amendment. The Article concludes {{that a majority of the}} Court probably would support the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s prior fleeting expletive policy which it describes as a sensible one. The Article also suggests the Court would probably uphold FCC indecency regulation in general despite its attendant vagueness and chilling effect infirmities. But he believes the First Amendment future of the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s new fleeting expletive policy is more problematic...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the phenomenon of the glowing condition of TV programs which apply Islamic symbol, that is veil. Whereas, in the end of 1980 <b>s</b> decade the <b>veil</b> was still viewed discriminately. Veiled women were identical with oldfashioned and conservative styles. Veiled pupils, university students, and also lecturers were identical with fundamental things which is interpreted into radical and fanatism thought then it must be impeached and eradicated at all. Movie or film which is actually is an expression of entertainment has capability to bring morality values so the existence of the veil is not strange anymore in our society. The interaction between religion and mass media is getting more increase and increase day to day because of the changing era. Ayat-Ayat Cinta The Movie is the pioner of Islamic renaissanc. The islamic morality values movie is so attractive for its audience. This movie is the wonder drug when the Islamic image is identical with the war and terorism. However, is it the real Islamic phenomenon? In the fact, even the women are wearing the veil they are still wearing tight clothes. The arising of mass media which cause the increasing of commercial culture and entertainment has created so many kinds of problems and business so commercialization is considered as a more important than any intellectual quality and challenge. There is a paradox which is found here, that is a time when anything is able to sell into a modern capitalism frame. A certain time when pop culture as a keyword of all of these conditions. Alhtough it happen, there is no a kind of paradox which we face nowadays. Moslem fashion do not only place on respectable position but also drag anyone into typically consumptive life style of capitalism. Islamic policy is on the contrary position of luxurious life style which is identical with capitalism. Nowadays the veil has similar position with Japanese hair style, “Harajuku”, “leging” trousers or shirts, and punk style. It means that it is as the trendsetter and commodity. Capitalism of pop culture is successful to take a golden opportunity. The veil is created commercial market for pop culture by creating any kinds of the interesting veil even they are not based Islamic veil standard such as the type of veil which has cutting in side style until the shoulder and back. It may show indentation of side body (whereas in fact by open little by little of the body, it will make the body more interesting). Every type of the veil has its own values such as “instant” which is easy to wear and put off it until it creates anecdote “the veil for many mankind because so many people wear it. There is one more extreme phenomenon which is worried about the veil that it will plunge into more dangerous pop culture so it creates smattering meaning. Through research strategy which applies semiotics analyze technique, based on one of the Saussure theory’s follower, Roland Barthles, which formulates one systematical model in analyzing the meaning of signs. Barthes focuses on concept of two levels significance. By using Roland Barthes semiotics, it is based on several considerations. Barthes divides those two conceptual systems. They are denotation and connotation. By dividing them, which the first step is called by primary system (denotation) and the second system is namely secondary system (connotation), then both of them will be applied to interpreted the meaning of veil in Ayat-Ayat Cinta The Movie. The result of Ayat-Ayat Cinta The Movie which presents the entering of veil in the film industy creates the veil into two intersecting street, they are Islamic idealism and capitalism. Capitalism does not hold peace. Islam is the only one religion with the biggest obeyers. It is a chance for capitalism to change the veil as their commodity. They undermine anoher meaning of the veil. It seems in the movie which shows the longer size (covering the chest) as it may be seen in appendix of the Islamic veil criteria. Besides, it often appears the short veil (just covering the neck) which Aisyah and Nurul wear it. Then there is contradiction between idealism and capitalism on a sheet of the actress’ veil, each type of them maintain its self. The needs to be Islamic, religious, well behaved, not being free of “aurat” style is gone down before by the needs to be stylish, sexy, modern, and glamourous women. Based on those result, it may be recommended to the movie directors in order to show the wisdom of the Islamic true veil and to the people in order to have critical awareness and thought in selecting and watching TV programs which show the veil styles. It is also suggested to the people in order to have the right understanding about the Islamic veil so they are not the blind followers. The whole understanding may create sincere behaviors. It is so necessary to have the needs of being beatiful and modern women but it have {{to be based on the}} true Islamic standard...|$|R
