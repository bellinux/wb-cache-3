5000|$|Once World War II had {{erupted in}} 1939, Canada {{had a small}} navy. In 1939 Canada had seven warships. Once {{entering}} the war, Canada needed a naval reformation {{in order to keep}} up with and aid the British. On the outbreak of the war Canada had roughly 3,500 men supporting the RCN. In September 1940 [...] "the RCN grew to 10,000 men". The Canadian government agencies also {{played a major role in}} the patterns of warfare in the Atlantic. The Canadian Navies Division operated a network of <b>naval</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> agents in the neutral United States from 1939 to 1941. These agents managed the shipping movements of British shipping in the United States, and also managed the growing United States Navy systems in regards to basic trade movements. Special publications on trade matters were supplied to the United States Navy from Ottawa in 1941, and by the time of Pearl Harbor American port directors were working with Ottawa as a team. Ottawa’s job of studying trade movements and keeping track of intelligence was so effective and crucial that they were given the task of controlling shipping west of 40〫and north of the equator from December 1941 to July 1942, along with supplying the USN trade directorate with daily intelligence.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{following}} the abdication of Napoleon, 15,000 British troops {{were sent to}} North America under four of Wellington's ablest brigade commanders. Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsula and the rest came from garrisons. Prévost was ordered to neutralize American power on the lakes by burning Sackets Harbor, gain <b>naval</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the Upper Lakes, and defend Lower Canada from attack. He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives. Given the late season he decided to invade New York State. His army outnumbered the American defenders of Plattsburgh, but {{he was worried about}} his flanks so he decided he needed <b>naval</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Lake Champlain.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we design the fuzzy logic {{autopilot}} for precise control and track-keeping <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> Precise <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> has known an increasing {{interest in the}} last years. The main benefits of usage <b>of</b> autopilot for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> can be elimination of {{a man from the}} dangers of the undersea environment and reduction in cost of exploration of deep seas. Currently, it is common to use the special ship to accomplish missions as the inspection of coastal and off-shore structures, cable maintenance, as well as hydrographical surveys. In the military field, they are employed in such tasks as surveillance, intelligence gathering, torpedo recovery and mine counter measures. Hence, a problem of its ability to move along a reference path and keep a desired orientation is regarded. A non-linear mathematical model describes the vehicle’s dynamics. Command signals are generated by an autopilot with fuzzy control law implemented. Some results of computer simulations are provided to demonstrate effectiveness, correctness and usefulness of the approach...|$|R

5000|$|At last in August 1814, peace discussions {{began in}} the neutral city of Ghent. Both sides began {{negotiations}} warily The British diplomats stated their case first, demanding {{the creation of an}} Indian barrier state in the American Northwest Territory (the area from Ohio to Wisconsin). It was understood the British would sponsor this Indian state. The British strategy for decades had been to create a buffer state to block American expansion. Britain demanded <b>naval</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Great Lakes and access to the Mississippi River. The Americans refused to consider a buffer state and the proposal was dropped. Although article IX of the treaty included provisions to restore to Natives [...] "all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811", the provisions were unenforceable. The Americans (at a later stage) demanded damages for the burning of Washington and for the seizure <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> before the war began.|$|R
25|$|The war was {{frustrating}} for both sides. Both sides tried {{to invade the}} other and were repulsed. The American high command remained incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General William Henry Harrison finally gained <b>naval</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under Tecumseh in Canada, while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of Maine.|$|R
2500|$|Soon {{afterwards}} in November 1942, the Allies launched operation Torch in the west, {{an invasion}} of Vichy-controlled French North Africa.
