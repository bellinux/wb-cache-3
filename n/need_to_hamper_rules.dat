We did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>hamper</b> the train; if it wanted the road, we could switch off and let it go by, then overtake it and pass it later. We stopped at one place to see the Gladstone Cliff, a great crag which the ages and the weather have sculptured into a recognizable portrait of the venerable statesman. Mr. Gladstone is a stockholder in the road, and Nature began this portrait ten thousand years ago, with the idea of having the compliment ready in time for the event.|$|R

The practice of inclusion has been made mandatory in Victorian schools however, reviews suggest that inclusion, as practiced in Victoria, has not been fully implemented (Meyer, 2001). With over 48, 000 Victorian State Government Primary School students in need of special education assistance it was considered imperative to investigate the attitudes of teachers towards inclusion and the inclusive pedagogy they practise. Based in the interpretive paradigm of social equity, this thesis aims to investigate the attitudes towards inclusion and the inclusive pedagogy practised by Primary State School teachers in Melbourne, Victoria. To understand the participants reality from their perspective a constructionist epistemology was utilised. The response of 225 fulltime primary school teachers to the BCSQ (Bender, 1992) and STATIC (Cochran, 1998 a) questionnaires were analysed and compared with their personal background information. The database was tested for relationships between the variables. These results were used to develop questions for targeted interviews with ten selected respondents. The responses of the questionnaires and interviews were used to facilitate an understanding of the relationships between teachers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and their pedagogy. The results indicated that while teachers philosophically embraced inclusion and practised a range of inclusive pedagogies a perceived lack of quality support and limited education in special <b>needs</b> continued <b>to</b> <b>hamper</b> the implementation of inclusion in Victorian State Primary Schools. Forty percent of teachers had no education in special needs and felt challenged by inclusion and unsure about how to implement inclusion.;Furthermore, teachers identified an urgent <b>need</b> <b>to</b> provide additional support for the teacher-diagnosed students who represent eighty percent of the special needs students present in the majority of classrooms. A range of recommendations are made for improvements to the implementation of inclusion in Victorian State Primary Schools...|$|R

In my opinion the GM debate, on both sides, continues <b>to</b> <b>hamper</b> the urgent <b>need</b> <b>to</b> address the diverse and pressing challenges of global food security and environmental sustainability.

This report {{looks at a}} selection of initiatives in order to explore the past, present and future role of UB internationalization. As {{a basis for the}} review, 7 students are interviewed on their international experience in their education – exchange studies and minor field studies (MFS) respectively. The participants stress the role of personal development and career enablement, and perceive their international experience as a distinct, unique element of their education. Possibilities and problems are then identified and related to the current literature on international education, learning and pedagogics. The study lands in a critical discussion on the future development of UB education. Key points of development: To meet the Bologna 20 percent commitment, more efforts <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be made on promoting and enabling internationalization to students, faculty and administrators. Curricular hurdles <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be removed as not <b>to</b> <b>hamper</b> students’ programme progression for going abroad.
