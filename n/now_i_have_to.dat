25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of its}} {{marketing}} campaign for The Girl, HBO released a 30-second trailer in August 2012. During a Television Critics Association press tour promoting the film, Hedren said [...] "I {{have to say that}} when I first heard Toby's [...] voice as Alfred Hitchcock, my body just froze". Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith, attended a screening; when the film ended, the audience was silent until Griffith said [...] "Well, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back into therapy again!" [...] Hedren attended a London [...] screening in October. The Girl made its US television debut on HBO and HBO Canada on 20 October 2012. It had its UK premiere on 26 December, as part of BBC Two's Christmas programming. The film was released on DVD in the UK on 7 January 2013.|$|E
500|$|Developers tasked both art and map design {{personnel}} {{with creating}} levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a [...] "grow as you play" [...] philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like [...] "Beat" [...] {{or the use}} of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as [...] "very good" [...] or [...] "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: [...] "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's this thing and here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula will come up to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. So <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hit the guy three times..." [...] Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, [...] "What am I doing?" [...] Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what comes next in the current quest or storyline.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was what}} it was!" [...] cried Herrick. [...] "I thought they seemed unusually big, and <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to the money-changers at Charing Cross and get English silver." ...|$|R

500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the race, Jones gave his {{view on the}} circumstances surrounding the race and whether championship points should be awarded, writing in Motor magazine [...] "My job is to drive racing cars, not to get involved in politics. As far as I'm concerned, the Spanish GP was no different from normal: it required the same amount of effort, it covered the same distance and I gave it the same dedication that I give to any other Grand Prix. These things would have been the same whether I'd won or lost. As it happened, I won the race, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait and see if I'll be given the points." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] he asked, alarmed. [...] "What <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done <b>now?</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> croak the stiff--he'd {{have got}} me sure if I hadn't, and then he'd have got you, too. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{do it for}} your sake--I'm sorry you saw it." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 4 January 2014 whilst {{appearing}} on The Jonathan Ross Show, Saunders officially {{confirmed that the}} movie will definitely be happening, as she felt obliged to write a script for a film adaptation after threatening it for so long. Saunders was quoted as saying: [...] "Joanna Lumley kept announcing it and saying, 'Yes she's going to do it,' and then Dawn French on our radio show at Christmas said, 'I bet £100,000 that you don't write it,' so <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> write it, otherwise I have to pay her £100,000'" [...] In April 2014, Saunders again confirmed on BBC Breakfast {{that she was in}} the process of writing the film, and gave a prospective release date of sometime during 2015.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a member}} of the team Arena {{performed}} cover versions of popular tracks and in 1977 released a split album, Tiny Tina and Little John, alternating tracks with fellow team member, John Bowles. While with the TV series she appeared in TV specials, at shopping centres or tourist venues. In September 1982 she became a [...] "coach" [...] for new team members, Danielle Minogue and Mark McCormack; Arena told The Australian Women's Weeklys Debbie Byrne that [...] "They seem to be settling down a lot quicker than I did. They both have a really professional attitude." [...] At 14, she told Byrne [...] "my aim: to be a recording artist and actress but, <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> concentrate simply on what I'm doing and that can take enough effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Come Up Show following a recent performance in Canada in April 2011, Method Man replied with this regarding his current 'weed-loving' image: [...] "When you get older and you've got kids and your {{kids are going to}} school and you know [...] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [...] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. [...] "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet how slight a clue! Just a {{photograph}} of men's backs. What men? When and where? It was an athletic meeting. Of what club or society?

2500|$|It was {{announced}} on April 8, 2009 Khan would {{move up to}} the light welterweight division to fight Andreas Kotelnik (31-2-1, 13 KOs) at the MEN Arena in Manchester for the WBA light welterweight title on 18 July. Khan Said, [...] "This is the best news that I could have received. To fight for the world title in only my 22nd fight and at the age of just 22 is fantastic. Frank has done a great job getting the world title fight for me in Britain and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go out win it." [...] This would be Kotelnik's fourth title defense. Khan won by a unanimous decision, 120–108, 118–111, 118–111, in front of 10,000, and became the third-youngest Brit to win a world title, at the age of 22. Khan's lightning hand speed and fitness gave him the advantages to go well ahead on points in the first ten rounds. Kotelnik rallied in the closing rounds but could not land a decisive punch on Khan, Kotelnik throwing everything he had in the final two stanzas. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It's the best feeling ever. I want to thank Freddie Roach and my team for making this happen. I'm a world champion and I'm going to enjoy it. I'm still young and I've got big things to come." ...|$|E

And the verse came to me as being about separation from someone you really love.” — Tony Clarkin ...|$|R
60|$|When I heard how she {{was using}} old Van Hunker's wealth--in {{providing}} for our poor loyal folk, and especially for the clergy, pensioning some, hospitably receiving others in her own house, and seeking employment for others--I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> repent of all the scorn with which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> looked on Millicent Wardour as a poor fickle creature, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> own that my brother's love had been as nearly worthy of him as any creature could be.|$|R

60|$|Old John Fenwick was {{not much}} better pleased about Mark and me than Father was, though he didn't go {{to the length of}} forbidding it; he just acted grumpily and disagreeably.
