50|$|For tying, it is disputed if a halter {{should be}} made strong enough not to break under stress, or if it should give way when tension reaches {{a certain point in}} order to prevent injury to the animal. Usually the issue is of minimal concern if a tied animal is {{attended}} and the lead rope is tied with a slip knot that can be quickly released if the animal panics. However, in cases where a <b>non-slip</b> <b>knot</b> is tied, or if a soft rope is drawn tight and the knot cannot be released, or if the animal is left unsupervised, an animal panicking and attempting to escape can be seriously injured. Those who argue that the risk of injury is more of a concern than the risk of escape recommend halter designs that incorporate breakaway elements, such as a leather crownpiece, breakaway buckles, or easily detachable lead rope. Those who believe that escape is the greater danger, either due to concerns about escape or creating a recurring bad habit in an animal that learns to break loose that could become unable to be kept tied at all, recommend sturdy designs that will not break unless the handler deliberately releases a slipknot or cuts the lead rope. Between the two camps are those who recommend sturdy halters that will not break under normal pressure from a momentarily recalcitrant or frightened animal, but ultimately will break in a true panic situation, such as a fall.|$|E
500|$|Cattle {{may need}} to be {{deliberately}} thrown or tipped over for certain types of husbandry practices and medical treatment. [...] When done for medical purposes, this is often called [...] "casting", and when performed without mechanical assistance requires the attachment of [...] of rope around the body and legs of the animal. After the rope is secured by <b>non-slip</b> bowline <b>knots,</b> it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance. Once the cow is forced to lie down in sternal recumbency (on its chest), it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking.|$|R
