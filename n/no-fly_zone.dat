5|$|After {{the seizure}} of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air patrol operations {{in support of the}} <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone.</b> On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating {{situation}} led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9October 1992, ordering a <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{anticipation}} of terrorist attacks, particularly from militants, security measures are intensified, especially in major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai and in troubled states such as Jammu and Kashmir. The airspace around the Red Fort is declared a <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> to prevent aerial attacks and additional police forces are deployed in other cities.|$|E
25|$|Following the Persian Gulf War, {{to protect}} {{minority}} populations, the US, Britain, and France declared and maintained <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> in {{northern and southern}} Iraq, which the Iraqi military frequently tested. The <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although France withdrew from participation in patrolling the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> in 1996, citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation.|$|R

5|$|On 20 March 2011, USMC AV-8Bs were {{launched}} from USS Kearsarge {{in support of}} Operation Odyssey Dawn, enforcing the UN <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> over Libya. They carried out airstrikes on Sirte on 5 April 2011. Multiple AV-8Bs {{were involved in the}} defense of a downed F-15E pilot, attacking approaching Libyans prior to the pilot's extraction by a MV-22 Osprey.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March 2011 it was {{reported}} that an AASM missile fired from a Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light ground attack/trainer jet, the first Libyan warplane to challenge the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> during the 2011 Libyan civil war, on the runway just after the plane had landed at Misrata Airport.|$|E
5|$|Italian Tornado IDS and ECR {{aircraft}} {{participated in}} the enforcement of a UN <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Various coalition aircraft operated from bases in Italy, including RAF Tornados. Italian military aircraft delivered a combined 710 guided bombs and missiles during the strikes against Libyan targets. Of these Aeronautica Militare Tornados and AMX fighter-bombers released 550 guided bombs and missiles, and Italian Navy AV-8Bs delivered 160 guided bombs. Italian Tornados launched 20 to 30 Storm Shadow cruise missiles with the rest consisting of Paveway and JDAM guided bombs.|$|E

5000|$|The Iraqi <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> were {{a set of}} two {{separate}} <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> (NFZs), and were proclaimed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France after the Gulf War of 1991 to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslims in the south. Iraqi aircraft were forbidden from flying inside the zones. The policy was enforced by U.S., British, and French aircraft patrols until France withdrew in 1998. While the enforcing powers had cited United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 as authorizing the operations, the resolution contains no explicit authorization. The Secretary-General of the UN {{at the time the}} resolution was passed, Boutros Boutros-Ghali called the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> [...] "illegal" [...] in a later interview with John Pilger.|$|R
5|$|On 27 May 2011, {{military}} officials announced that Apaches would be deployed {{as part of}} Operation Ellamy, the ongoing military intervention in Libya. The helicopters operated from the flight deck of HMS Ocean in conjunction with French Eurocopter Tiger helicopters over Misrata. The Apaches were also to assist in Operation Unified Protector, the enforcement of an embargo and <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> upon Libya. On 14 June 2011, reports of British preparation to evacuate Yemen emerged, involving Apache and Merlin helicopters operating from Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels off the coast.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1995, {{a mortar}} shell {{slammed into a}} Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States {{subsequently}} blamed Bosnian Serb forces for the attack. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory air strikes against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> over Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|Operation Deny Flight was a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) {{operation}} that began on 12 April 1993 as {{the enforcement of}} a United Nations (UN) <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations and NATO later expanded {{the mission of the}} operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in Bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in Bosnia. Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties.|$|E

50|$|On 15 December 1998, France {{suspended}} {{participation in}} the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones,</b> arguing {{that they had been}} maintained for too long and were ineffective. On 16 December, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered execution of Operation Desert Fox, a four-day air campaign against targets all over Iraq, citing Iraq's failure to comply with UNSC Resolutions. This resulted in an increased level of combat in the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> which lasted until 2003.|$|R

5|$|Spanish EAV-8Bs joined Operation Deny Flight, {{enforcing}} the UN's <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Spain did not send its aircraft carrier {{to participate in}} the Iraq War in 2003, instead deploying F/A-18s and other aircraft to Turkey to defend that country against potential Iraqi attacks. Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 {{due to a lack of}} funds for a replacement aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{violation}} to the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down {{four of the}} six Serb jets over Banja Luka. This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. Perhaps more importantly, the Banja Luka incident was also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO. The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community helped install a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation in April 1997, but UNITA {{did not allow}} the regional MPLA government {{to take up residence}} in 60 cities. The UN Security Council voted on 28 August 1997, to impose sanctions on UNITA through Resolution 1127, prohibiting UNITA leaders from traveling abroad, closing UNITA's embassies abroad, and making UNITA-controlled areas a <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone.</b> The Security Council expanded the sanctions through Resolution 1173 on 12 June 1998, requiring government certification for the purchase of Angolan diamonds and freezing UNITA's bank accounts.|$|E

40|$|One {{focus of}} {{research}} at Frauhofer IOSB is the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles for data acquisition. Past efforts have {{lead to the development}} of a hardware and software system able to rapidly generate a complete and up-to-date aerial image by combining several single high resolution pictures taken by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the path planning component of the system was not designed to support <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> inside the area of interest. In this paper, we present a new complete coverage path planning algorithm that provides support for <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> inside the area, and also increases efficiency by reducing the number of turns. The proposed method is suitable for complex areas that may contain known obstacles and <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones,</b> to be covered by maneuverable systems such as multirotor aircraft...|$|R
5|$|The {{operations}} of Deny Flight spanned {{more than two}} years of the Bosnian War and {{played an important role in}} the course of that conflict. The <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> {{operations of}} Deny Flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in the conflict. Additionally, the air strikes flown during Deny Flight led to Operation Deliberate Force, a massive NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia that played a key role in ending the war.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, out of fear for car bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> above the summit in an operation called Operation Peaceful Summit. This enhanced ongoing Baltic Air Policing activities with additional aircraft, communications and maintenance support.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a <b>No-Fly</b> <b>Zone</b> over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E

50|$|<b>No-fly</b> <b>zones</b> are {{a modern}} phenomenon. They can be {{distinguished}} from traditional air power missions by their coercive appropriation of another nation’s airspace only, to achieve aims on the ground within the target nation. While the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted prototypical air control operations over contentious colonial possessions between the two World Wars of the 20th century, <b>no-fly</b> <b>zones</b> did not assume their modern form {{until the end of}} the Persian Gulf War in 1991.|$|R

5|$|Between 1991 and 1995, the 102d {{deployed}} to Panama {{as part of}} Operation Coronet Nighthawk, which was a drug interdiction operation. In 1992 the wing became simply the 102d Fighter Wing {{as part of an}} Air Force-wide renaming of units. The wing was deployed from 1995 to 1998 to Iceland for periodic 45-day deployments. In 1998, the wing's members also trained and {{deployed to}} Iceland, Canada, Korea, and Europe. The next year, the 102d participated in Operation Northern Watch and was deployed to Turkey in order to enforce the <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> over Iraq north of the 36th Parallel. In 2000, personnel were deployed to the Middle East and Europe in order to participate in Operation Southern Watch.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that the wing had a flying mission, the wing {{deployed}} to many locations around the globe to assist in missions for the Air Force. In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk. It also participated in Operation Northern Watch, helping to patrol the <b>No-Fly</b> <b>Zone</b> north of the 36th parallel in Iraq. During the 11 September attacks, the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Security {{measures}} included Turkish war {{ships and}} Turkish commandos in rubber boats patrolling the Bosporus, AWACS surveillance planes and F-16 warplanes circling {{above the city}} in order to monitor a <b>no-fly</b> <b>zone</b> over the city, and the assignment of 23,000 to 24,000 police officers, supported by police helicopters and armoured vehicles. The Bosphorus Strait was also closed to oil tankers, the underground rail system was suspended and whole city districts were sealed off. Nevertheless, a small bomb or explosive devise blew up on an empty Turkish Airlines plane on June 29 as workers were cleaning it at the main Istanbul airport.
