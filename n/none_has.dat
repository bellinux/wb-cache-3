5|$|The {{region has}} {{numerous}} faults, many considered active, but <b>none</b> <b>has</b> produced significant earthquakes in recorded history. These faults tend {{to move at}} a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep, which {{reduces the risk of}} an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but <b>none</b> <b>has</b> been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{economic}} downturns {{have been}} called a [...] "great depression", but <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been as widespread, or lasted for so long.

50|$|There were 3 {{households}} out {{of which}} <b>none</b> <b>had</b> {{children under the age}} of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, <b>none</b> <b>had</b> a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. Individuals make up 33.3% of all households, and <b>none</b> <b>had</b> someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.67 and the average family size was 2.00.|$|R
5|$|Infrared {{observation}} {{has shown}} {{there are no}} bodies of three or more Jupiter masses in this system, out to at least a distance of 500AU from the host star. Planets with similar masses and temperatures as Jupiter should be detectable by Spitzer at distances beyond 80AU, but <b>none</b> <b>has</b> been discovered in this range. Planets more than 150% as massive as Jupiter can be ruled out at the inner edge of the debris disk at 30–35AU.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the {{mathematical}} structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory {{may provide a}} framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far <b>none</b> <b>has</b> been verified to give rise to physics as observed at, for instance, the Large Hadron Collider.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} MS is unknown; however, it is {{believed}} to occur {{as a result of}} some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but <b>none</b> <b>has</b> proved definitive. While {{there are a number of}} environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.|$|E

5|$|Three other, {{significantly}} smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, but <b>none</b> <b>has</b> white plumage completely {{surrounding the}} eye. Further distinctions {{are that the}} red-breasted nuthatch has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the brown-headed and pygmy nuthatches each have a brown cap, and a white patch on the nape of the neck.|$|E
5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned {{to do at the}} Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; <b>none</b> <b>has</b> ever been proven.|$|E
5|$|During this season, Maryland outscored {{its opponents}} 298–38, {{accumulated}} six shutout wins, and allowed only one team, Georgia, to score more than 7 points. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967 and <b>none</b> <b>has</b> ever allowed fewer {{points in the}} regular season (31). Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points allowed per game). At the end of the regular season, the three wire services, the Associated Press, International News Service, and United Press, each named Maryland as the national championship team.|$|E

40|$|Some worse-than-expected {{materials}} degradation {{effects have}} been observed, but <b>none</b> <b>have</b> created any operational issues and some hardware (as with the anodized aluminum labels) {{appear to be}} recovering. Inadvertent materials substitutions have been observed, but <b>none</b> <b>have</b> created any operational issues. Hardware handling contamination effects have been observed, and although <b>none</b> <b>have</b> created operational issues, there is clearly room for improvement in this regard. Even with robust materials selections, space environmental effects will be observed. Be cautious when interpreting on-orbit photography, as lighting conditions and the space environment affect imaging...|$|R
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. <b>None</b> <b>has</b> a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
5|$|No multituberculates {{are known}} to have had hypsodont teeth, <b>none</b> <b>has</b> more than two molariform (molar-like) teeth in a single toothrow, and most have large, blade-like teeth. However, the form of the remains of TNM02067's third cheektooth {{suggests}} it was not such a blade-like tooth and that at least the last three cheekteeth were likely molariform. In these respects, TNM02067 does resemble gondwanatheres in the family Sudamericidae, and Krause and colleagues tentatively identified it as representing that family, primarily {{on the basis of its}} hypsodont teeth. Krause and colleagues compared the dentary in detail to that of Sudamerica, the only other gondwanathere for which a substantial fragment of the jaw was known. Sudamerica has only four, not five, cheekteeth (all of which are molariform), a higher, narrower incisor with a root that extends further through the dentary, and a shorter diastema; in all these respects, TNM02067 is more primitive. In addition, the mental foramen of the TNM02067 is located lower and the cheekteeth vary more in size.|$|E
5|$|With the issuing {{of letters}} patent by the Queen of Australia on 15 January 1991, Australia {{became the first}} Commonwealth realm to {{institute}} a separate Victoria Cross award in its own honours system. Although it is a separate award, the Victoria Cross for Australia's appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993, Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian Victoria Cross. The Canadian version has a different inscription, {{as well as being}} created from a different unspecified metal. The legend has been changed from FOR VALOUR to the Latin PRO VALORE. Although one Canadian VC has been cast, <b>none</b> <b>has</b> been awarded. In 1999, New Zealand created the Victoria Cross for New Zealand, identical to the Australian and British Victoria Crosses, and this has been awarded once, on 2 July 2007 to Corporal Willie Apiata.|$|E
