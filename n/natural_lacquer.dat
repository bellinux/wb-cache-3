Entitled “China Clean”, the exhibition featured eight sculptural pieces inspired by Cinzano’s travels to mainland China, crafted from recycled elm wood using traditional Chinese joinery, beeswax with <b>natural</b> <b>lacquer</b> finish, and eco-friendly glue. As opposed to his more “conservative” first collection, “China Clean” included details like hand-carved skulls and classic tattoo motifs. In a collaboration with Shanghai-based Stellar Works, Cinzano {{also created a}} recycled leather chair and table for the collection, designed as flat-pack for eco-friendly transport.|$|E

5000|$|The dai {{may vary}} in shape: oval ("more feminine") to {{rectangular}} ("more masculine") and color (<b>natural,</b> <b>lacquered,</b> or stained). The ha may also vary in style; for example, tengu-geta {{have only a}} single centered [...] "tooth". There are also less common geta with three teeth. Merchants use(d) very high geta (two long teeth) to keep the feet well above the seafood scraps on the floor. The teeth are usually not separate, instead, the geta is carved from one block of wood. The tengu tooth is, however, strengthened by a special attachment. The teeth of any geta may have harder wood drilled into the bottom to avoid splitting, and the soles of the teeth may have rubber soles glued onto them.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. A hygromechanical {{model has been}} {{developed}} to simulate the in-service behaviour of the <b>natural</b> <b>lacquer</b> urushi, using a phenomenological description of viscoelasticity. The material and mechanical properties were determined {{as a function of}} the relative humidity (RH), and the relationship between RH and moisture content was determined. These properties served as inputs to a finite-element-based model that was then tested against experimental measurements of the depth-averaged stresses in a thin layer of urushi deposited on a substrate and exposed to changes in the environmental conditions. Good agreement was seen between the predicted and measured behaviour. The validated model was used to investigate the spatial and temperature variation of stress in urushi films subjected to cyclic environmental conditioning...|$|E
40|$|Examination {{of thermal}} {{degradation}} {{of natural and}} synthetic lacquer films by pyrolysis-gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) is reviewed. Due to the instantaneous heating decomposition, side reactions of internal or intermediate samples hardly occur, and the pyrolysis products can be retrieved without any change. Py-GC/MS {{has been used to}} analyze the composition of insoluble polymers and investigate degradation of resin materials. Lacquer film is a cross-linked polymer that is insoluble in any solvent. The aim of this review is to describe the application of Py-GC/MS to the analysis of lacquer, including <b>natural</b> <b>lacquer</b> saps, synthetic lacquer derivatives, and their films. After analyzing the chemical structures of the specific pyrolysis products by mass spectrometry, the lacquer tree species and growing region can be determined. These results have great significance for the protection and restoration of lacquer-coated cultural treasures...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Urushi is a complex natural polymer {{that has been used}} to protect and decorate objects for many hundreds of years. Urushi is an important material as decorated objects can obtain great value and historical worth. A star item of urushi lacquerwares, the Mazarin Chest, property of Victoria & Albert (V&A) Museum in London, is famous as one of the finest pieces of Japanese lacquerware in the world, dating back to as early as the late 1630 s. These urushi lacquerwares are often exposed to environments that are detrimental to both their aesthetic appeal and structural performance, and restoration and conservation procedures are needed to preserve these objects over long periods of time. However, the precise behaviour of urushi lacquers is not sufficiently understood to allow accurate prediction of the material response to environmental effects or of the effectiveness of any proposed conservation procedure. Thus a need exists for a comprehensive understanding of this material and a finite element (FE) model to predict the mechanical response to varying environmental conditions. The aim of this research was to model the hygro-mechanical effects during the environmental ageing process of urushi films by means of FE modelling, which will help to make decisions about the environmental conditions required for storage and exhibition. This was achieved by a combination of experimental and computational methods. A synthetic thermosetting (crosslinked) lacquer, polyurethane (PU), was initially studied to develop the methodology of the experimental and numerical studies and to provide a comparison to the <b>natural</b> <b>lacquer.</b> Experimental work was carried out to characterise the material behaviour of both materials, such as hygroscopic expansion, moisture diffusion kinetics and mechanical behaviour under various environmental conditions. Moisture diffusion in the two lacquer films was well described by Fick s law. However, different sorption isotherm models, Flory-Huggins model for PU and Guggenheim-Anderson-de-Boer (GAB) model for urushi, were required to model the equilibrium sorption of these two materials. The mechanical properties of the lacquer films were found to have a complex dependence on environmental conditions. The tensile properties of both lacquer films were shown to change significantly after UV ageing. With increasing time of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, Young s Modulus and tensile strength increased dramatically, but the maximum strain decreased. With water absorption, both Young s modulus and tensile strength decreased, and maximum strain increased. The two lacquer films were found to behave with a non-linear viscoelasticity, which was highly dependent on environmental conditions. A modified Burger s model was found to provide a good fit to experimental creep data for the PU lacquer well at different stress levels, suggesting this is a satisfactory method for characterising PU rheological behaviour. A novel modified generalized Kelvin fluid (MGKF) model was found to be a powerful non-linear viscoelastic model capable of representing the rheological behaviour of the urushi below the yield stress. However, in order to include the post yield behaviour a visco-elastic-plastic model is required. A hygro-mechanical model of the urushi behaviour based on the MGKF viscoelastic model was developed and tested. Through careful determination of the mechanical behaviour the constitutive properties of a thin layer of lacquer were determined and used as an input to a FE based model of the deformation and stresses that develop in response to changes in the environmental conditions. The model was validated using experimental results that showed the depth averaged stress in a thin layer deposited on a glass substrate, which allowed insight into the time dependent and spatially varying stresses within the layer. It was shown that the regions of highest stress were found in areas of highest moisture ingress, emphasising the need for control of the environment in which urushi covered artefacts are stored. In order to perform a predictive study on the bending behaviour of urushi films with cracks, {{as can be seen in}} aged lacquers, a model with a grooved urushi film on an aluminium substrate was created and subjected to bending loads. The time-dependency of the urushi material properties seems to hardly affect the bending behaviour of the model, however, the profile of the displacement field around the groove was found to be considerably affected by the geometry of the groove. To evaluate the effectiveness of a traditional Japanese consolidation method for lacquerware objects, known as urushi-gatame, a strain-based progressive damage failure model was used to model the continuum failure in the bi-material strip under an increasing bending load. The behaviour of damage initiation and evolution was modelled for an unfilled groove, a filled groove with fresh filler and filled groove with UV aged filler. From the finite element analysis (FEA) results, the introduction of the filler, as a simple mimic of the consolidation method, does enable the strip to sustain a higher bending load. However, this effectiveness is weakened as the material is aged, with it behaving similar to a groove without any filler...|$|E
50|$|The hilt {{is either}} {{straight}} or slightly curved (most common on cockatua pommel hilts). Pommel variations are many, however {{the most common}} are the horse-hoof (the most distinctive variation coming from the Sulu Sultanate) and the cockatua. Commonly the pommel is made of beautiful hardwood burl (such as banati) with the hilt being wrapped in a <b>lacquered</b> <b>natural</b> fiber (such as jute). However, on higher end kalis, belonging to the upper class, the pommel would be made of such exotic materials as ivory, silver plating, solid brass, etc. with hilts often lavishly bound with silver or swasaa (an alloyed mixture of gold similar to red-gold) bands frequently with braided silver wire interspersing the chased bands.|$|R
40|$|A hybrid lacquer (HBL) paint {{prepared}} by combining a <b>natural</b> kurome <b>lacquer</b> (KL) paint and an amino silane reagent, for example, N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 -aminopropyl triethoxysilane (AATES), produced a polymerized film {{faster than the}} KL paint alone. However, the viscosity of the HBL paint was too viscous for easy handling. Addition of 10 [*]wt% of an epoxidized linseed oil, ELO- 6, with 6. 4 [*]mol% epoxidation as a reactive diluent to the HBL paint decreased the viscosity by 1 / 2 from 25476 [*]mPa·s to 12841 [*]mPa·s and improved the ease of coatability. The polymerization mechanism was elucidated by NMR measurements of extracts from the resulting polymerization films, suggesting that amino groups in the HBL paint reacted with epoxy groups of ELO- 6 in the lacquer matrix, and then the complex reacted with double bonds of the urushiol side-chain by autooxidation and cross-linking reactions to give a hard polymerized film with a high quality of color and gloss. These {{results indicate that the}} addition of ELO- 6 improved the polymerizability of both KL and HBL paints without decreasing the quality of the resulting films...|$|R
5000|$|The lacquer {{came from}} the Chinese lacquer tree, or Toxicodendron vernicifluum, a {{relative}} of the sumac tree, which grew in regions of China, Korea and Japan. The sap or resin of the tree, called urushiol, was caustic and toxic (it contained the same chemical compound as poison ivy) but, painted on to wood or metal, it hardened into a fine <b>natural</b> plastic, or <b>lacquer</b> surface. The pure sap was dark brown, but beginning in about the 3rd century BC, during the Han Dynasty, Chinese artisans colored it with powdered cinnabar or with red ochre (ferric oxide), giving it an orange-red color. [...] Beginning in about the 8th century, Chinese chemists began making synthetic vermilion from mercury and sulfur, which reduced {{the price of the}} pigment and allowed the production of Chinese lacquerware on a larger scale.|$|R
40|$|The Henze precipitate, a {{peculiar}} blue-green microparticulate obtained by lysis {{of the blood}} cells of the ascidian Phallusia mammillata (Protochordata), was investigated with atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray microanalysis. The precipitate was collected from the Henze solution, an unstable red-brown product obtained by treating blood with distilled water, whose degradation yields a characteristic blue-green product. The microparticulates measured 50 – 100 µm in diameter and appeared irregular in shape. SEM examination showed smooth, roughly round boundaries. The microparticulate surface examined with AFM appeared as an irregular matrix formed by 70 – 320 -nm-wide mammillate composites, including and embedding small (500 – 800 nm wide) crystal-like multilayered formations. X- ray analysis showed that the elements present in these same precipitates were mainly C, Si, Al and O. The microparticulate composition appeared close to those of <b>natural</b> waxes or <b>lacquers,</b> embedding amorphous silicates and/or other Si–Al components. The unusual occurrence of Si in ascidian blood and its role are discussed...|$|R
