5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas {{comments on the}} definitions of femininity and masculinity in the early <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the unbounded accumulation of wealth.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> the situation was further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae). It shares {{its position in the}} latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the temple is richly decorated. The frieze depicts a continuous line of acanthus. Furthermore, there are ornaments on the capital, architrave, and soffit. The stones in the front cornice have projecting sculptures of lion heads.

5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twelfth}} century {{education}} in the Faroe Islands {{was provided by the}} Catholic Church. The Church of Denmark took over education after the Protestant Reformation. Modern educational institutions started operating {{in the last quarter of}} the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> developed throughout the twentieth century. The status of the Faroese language in education was a significant issue for decades, until it was accepted as a language of instruction in 1938. Initially education was administered and regulated by Denmark. In 1979 responsibilities on educational issues started transferring to the Faroese authorities, a procedure which was completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the Mycenaean civilization by the German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> the {{discovery of}} the Minoan civilization in Crete by the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in the twentieth century, helped to explain many existing questions about Homer's epics and provided archaeological evidence for many of the mythological details about gods and heroes. Unfortunately, the evidence about myths and rituals at Mycenaean and Minoan sites is entirely monumental, as the Linear B script (an ancient form of Greek found in both Crete and mainland Greece) was used mainly to record inventories, although certain names of gods and heroes have been tentatively identified.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} legislatures in the British Virgin Islands can be roughly divided into two: colonial legislatures {{in the eighteenth}} <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> <b>and</b> then a hiatus, {{followed}} by the modern legislature after the re-introduction of democracy in 1950.|$|R

5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. The windows {{are believed to have}} been purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could have been following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Black cattle are the {{traditional}} breed of Wales. These hardy cows with horns and shaggy coats {{are able to}} thrive on poor quality pasture and moorland {{and can be used}} to provide both milk and beef. Large numbers were raised in Wales and herded on foot to be fattened in England for selling in English markets. On Welsh farms they were used to pull ploughs and sometimes wagons during the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> were the prized possessions by which a man's wealth could be estimated. Nowadays, many have been crossed with Charolais, Limousin or Hereford bulls but pure bred herds can still be found {{in many parts of the}} uplands.|$|E

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E
5|$|Pugs {{arrived in}} the United States during the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> were soon making {{their way into the}} family home and the show ring. The American Kennel Club {{recognized}} the breed in 1885. The Pug Dog Club of America was founded in 1931 and was recognised by the American Kennel Club that same year. In 1981, the Pug Dhandys Favorite Woodchuck won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in the United States, the only Pug to have won there since the show began in 1877. The World Champion, or Best in Show at the 2004 World Dog Show held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was a Pug named Double D Cinoblu's Masterpiece.|$|E

5|$|The Baronial style peaked {{towards the}} end of the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> the {{building}} of large houses declined in importance in the twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890 he produced a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller (1864–1906) in the Adam style. The baronial style continued to influence the construction of some estate houses, including Skibo Castle, which was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell (1872–1935) designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for the owner of a Moscow department store.|$|E
5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are {{dominated}} by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for {{the tens of thousands}} of geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.|$|E
5|$|Wilde, having {{tired of}} journalism, had been busy setting out his {{aesthetic}} ideas more fully {{in a series}} of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue appeared in The <b>Nineteenth</b> <b>Century,</b> <b>and</b> Pen, Pencil and Poison, a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in The Fortnightly Review, edited by Wilde's friend Frank Harris. Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, bons mots and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.|$|E
