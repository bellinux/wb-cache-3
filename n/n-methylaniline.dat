40|$|The {{conformational}} {{properties of}} ten ring-methylated N-methyl- and N,Ndimethylanilines {{have been studied}} using 13 C-NMR chemical shifts and spin-Iattice relaxation times in CDCI 3, and semi-empírical (AM 1) quantum-chemical calculations. The experimental results indicate that, like aryl methyl ethers, <b>N-methylanilines</b> prefer conformations in which the N-methyl carbon lies near the ring plane. Orthosubstitution in these compounds, while forcing the N-methyl group to adopt an anti orientation {{with regard to the}} ortho substituent, does not induce any important changes {{from the vantage point of}} the electron donor ability of the amine function and therefore does not affect the N-methyl 13 C chemical shifts or spin-Iattice relaxation times to any appreciable extent. The preferred conformations of ortho-unsubstituted N,Ndimethylanilines leave the N-methyl carbon atoms oscillating on eíther side of the ring plane, but the conformational space of these compounds is strongly limited by ortho-methylation, so that in these cases one of the N-methyl carbon nuclei is forced to remain c 10 se to the aromatic ring plane, resulting in much shortened relaxation times and deshielding of that nucleus. The quantum mechanical calculations reproduce these results, allowing the relative stability of the methylated aniline conformers to be discussed in terms of competitíon between the nuclear repulsion energy and electron delocalization. Ortho-methylation of N,N-dimethylanilines leads to an increase of electron density around the nitrogen atom and a change from almost Sp 2 to almost Sp 3 nitrogen hybridization, in agreement with the experimental results, including the increased basicity of these compounds.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess prenatal toxicity of <b>N-methylaniline</b> (NMA) administered by gavage to pregnant female rats. Material and Methods: Pregnant female rats were administered <b>N-methylaniline</b> in corn oil by gavage at daily doses of 0. 8 mg/kg of body weight (b. w.), 4 mg/kg b. w., 20 mg/kg b. w. and 100 mg/kg b. w. from implantation (the 5 th day post mating) to the day prior to the scheduled caesarean section (the 20 th day of pregnancy). General behavior, body weight, food and water consumption, hematological, biochemical analyses and pathomorphological changes of the dams were recorded. Results: All the females survived until the end of the study. The test substance was toxic to pregnant females, even at the lowest of the used doses, i. e., 0. 8 mg/kg b. w. /day. Lower weight gain during pregnancy and significantly higher NMA-dose-dependent absolute weight of the organs were noted in the exposed females. The females from the groups exposed at doses of 20 mg/kg b. w. /day and 100 mg/kg b. w. /day developed anemia and showed higher concentrations of free thyroxine (FT 3) and free triiodothyronine (FT 4) thyroid hormones. Total protein concentration exhibited an increase in all the exposed groups of females. In the prenatal toxicity study, administration of <b>N-methylaniline</b> throughout the embryonic and fetal periods produced embryotoxic effects at doses ranging 4 – 100 mg/kg b. w. /day. Conclusions: Considering the data obtained in this study, it is reasonable to assume that <b>N-methylaniline</b> administered orally to pregnant rats is toxic for mothers even at a low dose of 0. 8 mg/kg b. w. /day. However, this dose was not associated with any significant effects to their offspring.

40|$|Highly {{purified}} liver microsomal cytochrome P- 450 catalyzes the hydroperoxide-dependent hydroxylation of {{a variety}} of substrates in the absence of NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase, and molecular oxygen.

The absence of flavoproteins and cytochrome b 5 from the cytochrome P- 450 preparations rules out the involvement of other known microsomal electron carriers. The ferrous form of cytochrome P- 450 is not involved in peroxide-dependent hydroxylation reactions, as indicated by the lack of inhibition by carbon monoxide. With cumene hydroperoxide present, a variety of substrates is attacked, including <b>N-methylaniline,</b> N,N-dimethylaniline, cyclohexane, benzphetamine, and aminopyrine.
