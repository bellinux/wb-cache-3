Our main results are formulated as two stability theorems giving necessary and sufficient conditions for global stability of synchronous and asynchronous piecewise linear hybrid systems.

40|$|Model {{transformation}} {{is one of}} the key concepts in modeldriven software development. An increasingly popular technology to define modeling languages is provided by the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Several EMF model transformation approaches have been developed, focusing on different transformation aspects. This paper proposes parallel graph transformation introduced by Ehrig and Kreowski to be a suitable framework for modeling EMF model transformations with multiobject structures. Multi-object structures at transformation rule level provide a flexible way to describe the transformation of structures with a flexible <b>number</b> of recurring <b>structures,</b> <b>dependent</b> on concrete model instances. Parallel graph transformation means massively parallelizing the application of model transformation rules synchronized at a kernel rule. We apply our extended EMF model transformation technique to model the simulation of statecharts with AND-states...|$|R
40|$|Model {{transformation}} {{is one of}} the key activities in model-driven software development. An increasingly popular technology to define mod-eling languages is provided by the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Several EMF model transformation approaches have been developed, focus-ing on different transformation aspects. To validate model transformations wrt. functional behavior and correctness, a formal foundation is needed. In this paper, we define EMF model transformations as a special kind of typed graph transformations using node type inheritance. Containment con-straints of EMF model transformations are translated to a special kind of EMF model transformation rules such that their application leads to con-sistent transformation results only. Thus, we identify a kind of EMF model transformations which behave like algebraic graph transformations. As a consequence, the rich theory of algebraic graph transformation can be ap-plied to these EMF model transformations to show functional behavior and correctness. Furthermore, we propose parallel graph transformation as a suitable framework for modeling EMF model transformations with multi-object structures. Multi-object structures at transformation rule level pro-vide a flexible way to describe the transformation of structures with a flexi-ble <b>number</b> of recurring <b>structures,</b> <b>dependent</b> on concrete model instances. Parallel graph transformation means parallelizing the application of model transformation rules at several occurences at once. We illustrate our ap-proach by selected refactorings of simplified statechart models. Finally, we discuss the implementation of our concepts in a tool environment for EMF model transformations...|$|R

40|$|During the papacies of Urban II and Paschal II {{substantial}} changes {{took place in}} the relations between bishops and abbots and between abbots and their subordinate abbots. Until then the structure of {{the vast majority of the}} monastic networks, from Montecassino to Cluny, from Marmoutier to Chaise Dieu to Hirsau were of a oligarchic type. In fact they were constituted by a central abbey with a conspicuous <b>number</b> of <b>dependent</b> <b>structures,</b> mostly priorates, often quite far from the main house. Among the subject communities even abbeys, often of considerable size and great traditions, were not lacking. The summit of the monastic network became in this case also a sort of abbot of abbots, abbas abbatum, indicated in the contemporary sources even as archiabbas or archimandrita, with the function of correcting the subordinate abbots. In the early decades of the 12 th century the Cistercians, on the contrary, created a sort of horizontal “confederation”, composed substantially almost entirely of abbeys which maintained strong ties with the episcopate and were materially rather independent of each other. This turning point was not only the product of an “innovative act of greatest creative rationality” of the Cistercian fathers. One can observe these changes in action. In particular in this article the relationship between Marmoutier abbey in the diocese of Tours and the abbeys of St. Florentin of Bonneval and St Remì of Reims in the last decades of the 11 th century will be considered...|$|R
