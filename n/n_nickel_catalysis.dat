However the synthesis {{of these types of}} compounds require harsh conditions such as high temperatures and pressures. Dr. Louie’s research aims to mediate these transitions via metal catalyzed reactions, mainly involving <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Dr. Louie and her team focuses on nickel-based systems not only because it is much less expensive than the more widely used palladium and platinum, but also because it offers a wider range of chemical activity, such as nickel, being a more electropositive transition metal which allows it to undergo oxidative addition readily; oxidize Nickel and lessens the electron density around the atom itself.6 This allows for the cross-coupling of electrophiles to occur which is pivotal in the formation of carbocycles and heterocycles. Dr. Loui and her colleagues further enhance the catalytic ability by combining nickel   with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands.   The NHC ligands are largely sterically hindered and electron donating, which allows improved and less harsh reactions conditions by expanding the chemical scope of the substrate. (Taking all these chemical factors into account, the Ni/NHC catalyst can effectively couple diynes and nitriles to create pyridines using a hetero-oxidative coupling mechanism. Also, this <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis</b> method (Figure 1) offers a wider range of substrates for which nickel can perform cyclo-additions on, substrates such as; vinylcyclopropanes, aldehydes, ketones, tropones, 3-azetidinones, and 3-oxetanones).|$|R

Prior to this work there were few methods that allowed for the synthesis of these valuable compounds from simple alkenes. Using transition metal catalysis, I sought to develop a method to access unsaturated organosilanes using a reaction analogous to the Heck reaction.

Arynes and cyclic alkynes are highly reactive intermediates that act as electrophilic arene and alkyne surrogates. Additionally, this dissertation outlines the strategic activation of the amide C–N bond using <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis.</b> This recently discovered mode of reactivity is employed for the generation of molecular complexity. Chapter One describes a systematic experimental and computational study of a particularly important class of arynes, 3 -halobenzynes. Our efforts show that aryne distortion, rather than steric factors or charge distribution, {{are responsible for the}} regioselectivities observed in 3 -halobenzyne trapping reactions. Experiments also validate the synthetic utility of 3 -halobenzynes for the synthesis of heterocycles, using a tandem aryne trapping / cross-coupling sequence involving 3 -chlorobenzyne. Chapter Two outlines synthetic studies pertaining to two heterocyclic aryne intermediates: the 2, 3 -pyridyne and the 4, 5 -pyrimidyne. 2, 3 -pyridyne generation and trappings were used to access a variety of functionalized pyridines in a regioselective manner. Additionally, synthetic routes to two isomeric silyl triflates, which were intended to serve as precursors to the 4, 5 -pyrimidyne, are disclosed. Subsequent 4, 5 -pyrimidyne generation and trapping experiments were ultimately unfruitful. Chapter Three reports on the synthesis of poly(benzonorbornadiene) polymers via a strategic blend of benzyne chemistry and ROMP. Through a comparative study, we demonstrate that substitution at the benzylic / allylic position prevents oxidative deformation and polymer decomposition, yet does not inhibit polymerization by common ruthenium catalysts with good control over molecular weight dispersity. Chapter Four illustrates the strategic use of cyclohexyne and the more elusive intermediate, cyclopentyne, as efficient tools for the synthesis of new heterocyclic compounds with high sp 3 character. Experimental and computational studies of the first 3 -substituted cyclohexyne are also described. The observed regioselectivities are explained by the distortion / interaction model. Chapter Five describes the generation of the first 3, 4 -piperidyne and its use as a building block for the synthesis of highly decorated piperidines. Experimental and computational studies of this intermediate are disclosed, along with comparisons to the well-known 3, 4 -pyridyne aromatic analogue. Additionally, the distortion / interaction model is used to explain the observed regioselectivities. Chapter Six pertains to the generation of two stained oxacyclic intermediates, the 4, 5 -benzofuranyne and the 3, 4 -oxacyclohexyne. In situ trapping of these intermediates affords an array of heterocyclic scaffolds. Across all trapping reactions performed, product distributions are consistent with predictions made with the distortion / interaction model.

This dissertation mainly focuses on methodology development involving <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis.</b> In this work, a number of highly selective reactions of readily available precursors, such as alkynes, enals and enones were developed. In one application, a novel, nickel-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition of enals and alkynes was explored. This reaction provides a diastereoselective and chemoselective entry to five-membered rings, which are a common structural motif in many architecturally complex and biologically active natural products. In another application, a novel, nickel-catalyzed intermolecular reductive coupling of enones and alkynes was developed. The key feature of this reaction is the chemoselective coupling of two potential Michael acceptors such as enones and alkynoates. The direct participation of alkynes as an alternative to preparing and handling sensitive vinyl cuprate reagents provides potentially significant improvements in accessing γ,δ-unsaturated ketones. An intriguing, nickel-catalyzed, intermolecular reductive coupling of enals and alkynes has also been developed. The unique features of this reaction are the construction of geometrically pure Z-enol silanes and high functional group tolerance. The direct participation of enals, alkynes and silanes as an alternative to existing methods provides potentially significant improvements in accessing enol silanes. Additionally, this reaction provides direct evidence for the catalytic involvement of a seven-membered oxametallacycle intermediate.

VLPC enables reactive radical intermediates to be catalytically generated at ambient temperature, a feat not generally allowed through traditional pyrolysis- or radical initiator-based methodologies. VLPC has vastly extended the range of substrates and reaction schemes that have been traditionally the domain of radical reactions. In this review the photophysics background of VLPC will be briefly discussed, followed by a report on recent inroads of VLPC into decarboxylative couplings and radical C-H functionalization of aromatic compounds. The bulk of the review will be dedicated to advances in synergistic catalysis involving VLPC, namely the combination of photoredox catalysis with organocatalysis, including β-functionalization of carbonyl groups, functionalization of weak aliphatic C-H bonds, and anti-Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of alkenes; dual catalysis with gold or with <b>nickel,</b> photoredox <b>catalysis</b> as an oxidation promoter in transition metal catalysis, and acid-catalyzed enantioselective radical addition to π systems...|$|R
