The disaccharide yield tends to increase as the initial concentration of glucose in [C 2 mim][Cl] increases. Consequently, [C 2 mim][Cl] polymerizes glucose to oligosaccharides. We thus report a new and simple method for the production of various valuable oligosaccharides from various monosaccharides using an ionic liquid.|$|E

40|$|Trehalose {{is absorbed}} by two {{distinct}} systems—one constitutive, the other induced by turanose {{and to a}} lesser extent by <b>nigerose</b> but not by trehalose. The constitutive system is apparently mediated by a surface trehalase; the induced system has the characteristics of a permease. The specificity of the induced system is apparently limited to the α glucosyl-glucose or glucosyl-fructose linkage, because absorption of kojibiose, <b>nigerose,</b> maltose, isomaltose, turanose, sucrose, and melezitose, in addition to that of trehalose, was increased. Absorption of β-linked or of galactose-containing disaccharides was not increased. The constitutive and induced trehalose-absorbing systems differ in their activity, specificity, lability to acid treatment, effects of substrate concentration, and pH optima. Both systems require oxygen, and no marked differential effects of inhibitors were observed. The activity of the induced system is proportional to log turanose concentration (from about 1 to 300 μg/ml), and is an approximate linear function of time of exposure (from about 1 to 50 min). Accumulation of trehalose occurred against a concentration gradient in both systems but particularly in the induced. No leakage was observed. The activity of the induced system declined slowly upon removal of the inducer. Accumulated trehalose is metabolized after activation by azide as are the endogenous trehalose reserves. The accumulated trehalose appears to enter the endogenous trehalose pool found in these spores, although some data suggest it may be more accessible. Respiratory data indicate that absorbed trehalose is available for metabolism while in transit from the external membrane to the internal pool...|$|E
30|$|The {{detailed}} reaction {{behavior of}} cellulose in an ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([C 2 mim][Cl]), was investigated. Glucose is {{a component of}} cellulose; its oligomerization was studied during treatment with [C 2 mim][Cl] at around 100  °C. Glucose was polymerized to produce oligosaccharides such as disaccharides and trisaccharides. These oligosaccharides, however, disappeared upon prolonging the treatment time. Maltose, <b>nigerose,</b> kojibiose, laminaribiose, isomaltose, and gentiobiose were identified by gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer in the disaccharides produced. The yield of these disaccharides increased as the initial concentration of glucose in [C 2 mim][Cl] increased.

40|$|Two α-glucosidase-encoding genes (agl 1 and agl 2) from Bifidobacterium breve UCC 2003 were {{identified}} and characterized. Based on their similarity to characterized carbohydrate hydrolases, the Agl 1 and Agl 2 enzymes are both assigned to a subgroup of the glycosyl hydrolase family 13, the α- 1, 6 -glucosidases (EC 3. 2. 1. 10). Recombinant Agl 1 and Agl 2 into which a His 12 sequence was incorporated (Agl 1 His and Agl 2 His, respectively) exhibited hydrolytic activity towards panose, isomaltose, isomaltotriose, and four sucrose isomers—palatinose, trehalulose, turanose, and maltulose—while also degrading trehalose and, to a lesser extent, <b>nigerose.</b> The preferred substrates for both enzymes were panose, isomaltose, and trehalulose. Furthermore, the pH and temperature optima for both enzymes were determined, showing that Agl 1 His exhibits higher thermo and pH optima than Agl 2 His.

40|$|Spores of {{the fungus}} Myrothecium verrucaria are cryptic to maltose and isomaltose. Induction of a {{transport}} {{system can be}} effected by several sugars whose order of effectiveness is: turanose > maltulose > sucrose > d-arabinose, d-fructose, <b>nigerose,</b> maltotriulose, kestose > melezitose, raffinose, nystose, and stachyose. The transport system is not specific to maltose and isomaltose, and it is apparently identical to an induced trehalose permease described previously. Induction of the permease is markedly influenced by spore age—older spores being more responsive. Pure maltose is not absorbed by spores. Absorption of commercial reagent-grade maltose is due to permease induction by maltulose as an impurity. Maltulose contamination of maltose was demonstrated by charcoal column chromatography and comparison of its physical, chemical, and permease-inductive properties with those of authentic maltulose. Maltose accumulates temporarily in spores after absorption and then decreases, although no conversion to glucose can be detected. Although spores contain small quantities of maltase, metabolism of maltose may be via some nonhydrolytic pathway...|$|E
30|$|Glucose polymerizes {{into various}} {{oligosaccharides}} upon heating. In cellulose science, this oligomerization reaction {{is known as}} reversion. The reversion of glucose occurs during the acid hydrolysis of cellulose to produce various oligosaccharides. It {{has been reported that}} various disaccharides such as gentiobiose, isomaltose, cellobiose, maltose, sophorose, and β,β-trehalose have been produced by the heat treatment of d-glucose in HCl aq. at around 100  °C [20]. Helm and Young [21] reported that the reversion of glucose occurs during the high-temperature hydrolysis of Avicel cellulose between 160 and 250  °C with dilute sulfuric acid. The most abundant disaccharides were isomaltose and gentiobiose. Recently, the reversion of glucose in dilute sulfuric acid has been studied and the kinetics of conversion into various disaccharides has been modeled [22]. In food science, the oligomerization of glucose upon heating is recognized as a reaction that occurs during caramelization. Sugisawa and Edo [23] reported that various disaccharides such as kojibiose, sophorose, <b>nigerose,</b> laminaribiose, maltose, cellobiose, isomaltose, and gentiobiose were isolated from caramel upon heating glucose at 150  °C {{in the absence of a}} catalyst.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the Martini coarse-grained force field to carbohydrates. The parametrization follows the same philosophy as was used previously for lipids and proteins, focusing on the reproduction of partitioning free energies of small compounds between polar and nonpolar phases. The carbohydrate building blocks considered are the monosaccharides glucose and fructose and the disaccharides sucrose, trehalose, maltose, cellobiose, <b>nigerose,</b> laminarabiose, kojibiose, and sophorose. Bonded parameters for these saccharides are optimized by comparison to conformations sampled with an atomistic force field, in particular with respect to the representation of the most populated rotameric state for the glycosidic bond. Application of the new coarse-grained carbohydrate model to the oligosaccharides amylose and Curdlan shows a preservation of the main structural properties with 3 orders of magnitude more efficient sampling than the atomistic counterpart. Finally, we investigate the cryo- and anhydro-protective effect of glucose and trehalose on a lipid bilayer and find a strong decrease of the melting temperature, in good agreement with both experimental findings and atomistic simulation studies. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{precipitation}} reaction between concanavalin A, the jack-bean hemagglutinin and several dextrans has been examined {{by means of}} the quantitative precipitin technique. A synthetic linear [alpha]-(1 [...] > 6) [...] glucan did not form a precipitate with concanavalin A, demonstrating that only branched [alpha] [...] glucans precipitate with the protein. The dextran from Streptcoccus bovis produced a typical precipitation curve with concanavalin A and gave the disaccharide <b>nigerose</b> when subjected to acetolysis. On the basis of these data it is suggested that this dextran, hitherto believed to be linear, is in fact a branched polymer. The concanavalin A precipitation curves of the dextrans from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B- 512 -F and Betacoccus arabinosaceous (L. mesenteroides) Birmingham strain were compared with the S. bovis dextran and an attempt has been made to correlate these data with the molecular structures of these dextrans.

40|$|Prebiotic isomaltooligosaccharide (IMO) {{preparations}} contain α-D-glucooligosaccharides {{and their}} structure {{is the key}} factor for their prebiotic potential. The transglucosylation selectivity is known {{to depend on the}} enzyme specificity and moreover, maltose and α-glucooligosaccharides can actually act as both glucosyl donor and acceptor in the reaction. Thus, two commercial enzymes, a glucosyltransferase and an α-glucosidase, were tested alone and in combination on pure maltose to study their specificities and the IMO profile obtained. The reactions were monitored using a step-forward AEC-PAD analytical method which permitted to detect and resolve new unknown IMO. Structural determination of unknown IMO was attempted using their retention times and relative abundance. As a general rule, the α-glucosidase has a more expressed hydrolyzing activity leading to products containing less residual digestible α-(1 - 4) linkages such as isomaltose, isomaltotriose, isomaltotetraose, kojibiose and <b>nigerose</b> while the glucosyltransferase produces important amount of panose. Finally, the combination of the two enzymes leaded to an intermediate IMO profile. IMO syrups composition was thus proved to be dependant on the specificity of the transglucosylating enzyme so that products profiles can be designed using different enzymes and in different proportion...|$|E
30|$|More {{detailed}} investigations on {{the reaction}} of cellulose in ionic liquids have been carried out. Cellulose that undergoes heat processing at 120  °C {{in the presence of}} [C 2 mim][Cl] can be converted into useful chemicals such as glucose, cellobiosan, 5 -HMF and levoglucosan via cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharide through reaction pathways that produce anhydrosugars and hydrolysis with water, which is produced by degradation of cellulose or is present in the reaction environment. These various compounds are further decomposed and low-molecular-weight compounds produced then react to form new kinds of polymers that are completely different from cellulose. In such processes, the [C 2 mim][Cl] moiety is incorporated into the polymers [78, 79]. In addition, during these reactions, inversion of a portion of glucose occurs, to produce various disaccharides such as maltose, <b>nigerose,</b> kojibiose, laminaribiose, isomaltose, and gentiobiose [80]. [C 2 mim][Cl] is an interesting reaction solvent that induces two different types of reactions (depolymerization of cellulose and the formation of new polymers). Furthermore, although the same types of reaction are thought to occur with cellulose in ionic liquids with the pyridinium cation as those observed to occur in [C 2 mim][Cl], the reaction rate is faster in cases where the anions are Cl− compared with Br− [81].|$|E
40|$|Cyclic nigerosyl <b>nigerose</b> (CNN) is a cyclic {{tetrasaccharide}} that exhibits properties {{distinct from}} other conventional cyclodextrins. Herein, we demonstrate that treatment of B 16 melanoma with CNN {{results in a}} dose-dependent decrease in melanin synthesis, even under conditions that stimulate melanin synthesis, without significant cytotoxity. The effects of CNN were prolonged for more than 27 days, and were gradually reversed following removal of CNN. Undigested CNN was found to accumulate within B 16 cells at relatively high levels. Further, CNN showed a weak but significant direct inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase, suggesting one possible mechanism of hypopigmentation. While a slight reduction in tyrosinase expression was observed, tyrosinase expression was maintained at significant levels, processed into a mature form, and transported to late-stage melanosomes. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that CNN treatment induced drastic morphological changes of Pmel 17 -positive and LAMP- 1 -positive organelles within B 16 cells, suggesting that CNN is a potent organelle modulator. Colocalization of both tyrosinase-positive and LAMP- 1 -positive regions in CNN-treated cells indicated possible degradation of tyrosinase in LAMP- 1 -positive organelles; however, that possibility was ruled out by subsequent inhibition experiments. Taken together, this study opens a new paradigm of functional oligosaccharides, and offers CNN as a novel hypopigmenting molecule and organelle modulator...|$|E

40|$|Trehalose {{supports}} {{the growth of}} Thermus thermophilus strain HB 27, but the absence of obvious genes for the hydrolysis of this disaccharide in the genome led us to search for enzymes for such a purpose. We expressed a putative α-glucosidase gene (TTC 0107), characterized the recombinant enzyme, {{and found that the}} preferred substrate was α,α- 1, 1 -trehalose, a new feature among α-glucosidases. The enzyme could also hydrolyze the disaccharides kojibiose and sucrose (α- 1, 2 linkage), <b>nigerose</b> and turanose (α- 1, 3), leucrose (α- 1, 5), isomaltose and palatinose (α- 1, 6), and maltose (α- 1, 4) to a lesser extent. Trehalose was not, however, a substrate for the highly homologous α-glucosidase from T. thermophilus strain GK 24. The reciprocal replacement of a peptide containing eight amino acids in the α-glucosidases from strains HB 27 (LGEHNLPP) and GK 24 (EPTAYHTL) reduced the ability of the former to hydrolyze trehalose and provided trehalose-hydrolytic activity to the latter, showing that LGEHNLPP is necessary for trehalose recognition. Furthermore, disruption of the α-glucosidase gene significantly affected the growth of T. thermophilus HB 27 in minimal medium supplemented with trehalose, isomaltose, sucrose, or palatinose, to a lesser extent with maltose, but not with cellobiose (not a substrate for the α-glucosidase), indicating that the α-glucosidase is important for the assimilation of those four disaccharides but that it is also implicated in maltose catabolism...|$|E

It is a monomer with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa and a pI around 5. At 98 °C, the purified enzyme in buffer has a half-life around 35 min, which is increased to around 215 min in presence of l% (w/v) dithiothreitol and 1 % (w/v) BSA. Dithiothreitol (1 %, w/v) and BSA (0. 4 %, w/v) also substantially increase the enzyme activity. The Km at 75 °C is 0. 41 mM with pNP-α- -glucopyranoside as substrate. The substrate preference of the enzyme is: pNP-α-D-glucoside > <b>nigerose</b> > panose > palatinose > isomaltose > maltose and turanose.

In this study, the optimal set of conditions and substrate specificity for the trehalose production using resting cells was investigated. Optimum temperature and pH of the resting cell reaction were 55 oC and pH 5. 5, respectively, and the reaction was stable for two hours at 37 ～ 55 oC and for one hour at the wide pH ranges of 3 ～ 9. Various disaccharide substrates with different glycosidic linkages, such as maltose, isomaltose, cellobiose, <b>nigerose,</b> sophorose, and laminaribiose, were converted into trehalose-like spots in thin layer chromatography (TLC). These results indicated broad substrate specificity of this reaction {{and the possibility that}} cellobiose could be converted into other trehalose anomers such as α,β- and b,b-trehalose. Therefore, the product after the resting cell reaction with cellobiose was purified by b-glucosidase treatment and Dowex- 1 (OH−) column chromatography and its structure was analyzed. Component sugar and methylation analyses indicated that this cellobiose-conversion product was composed of only non-reducing terminal glucopyranoside. MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS/MS analyses suggested that this oligosaccharide contained a non-reducing disaccharide unit with a 1, 1 -glucosidic linkage. When this disaccharide was analyzed by 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR, it gave the same signals with α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1, 1) -α-D-glucopyranoside.

The calculated average values of the glycosidic torsional angles agree well with available experimental data, providing validation for the force field and simulation methodology employed in this study. These simulations show in particular that: 1) (1 → 6) -linked disaccharides are characterized by an increased flexibility, the absence of any persistent intramolecular hydrogen bond and a significantly higher configurational entropy (compared to the other disaccharides); 2) cellobiose presents a highly persistent interresidue hydrogen bond and a significantly lower configurational entropy (compared to the other disaccharides); 3) persistent hydrogen bonds are observed for all disaccharides (except (1 → 6) -linked) and typically involve a hydrogen donor in the reducing residue and an acceptor in the nonreducing one; 4) the probability distributions associated with the glycosidic dihedral angles ϕ and ψ are essentially unimodal for all disaccharides, and full rotation around these angles occurs at most once or twice for ϕ (never for ψ) on the 50 -ns timescale; and 5) the timescales associated with torsional transitions (except around ϕ and ψ) range from ∼ 30 ps (rotation of hydroxyl groups) to the nanosecond range (rotation of the lactol and hydroxymethyl groups, and around the ω-glycosidic dihedral angle in (1 → 6) -linked disaccharides) ...|$|E

We identified gene clusters associated with the production and intracellular catabolism of CNN in the K. flavida genome. One cluster encodes 6 -alpha-glucosyl-transferase and 3 -alpha-isomaltosyltransferase, which are known to coproduce CNN from starch. The other cluster contains four genes annotated as a transcriptional regulator, sugar transporter, glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 31 protein (Kfla 1895), and GH 15 protein (Kfla 1896). Kfla 1895 hydrolyzed the alpha-(1 -> 3) -glucosidic linkages of CNN and produced isomaltose via a possible linear tetrasaccharide. The initial rate of hydrolysis of CNN (11. 6 s(- 1)) was much {{higher than that of}} panose (0. 242 s(- 1)), and hydrolysis of isomaltotriose and <b>nigerose</b> was extremely low. Because Kfla 1895 has a strong preference for the alpha-(1 -> 3) -isomaltosyl moiety and effectively hydrolyzes the alpha-(1 -> 3) -glucosidic linkage, it should be termed 1, 3 -alpha-isomaltosidase. Kfla 1896 effectively hydrolyzed isomaltose with liberation of beta-glucose, but displayed low or no activity toward CNN and the general GH 15 enzyme substrates such as maltose, soluble starch, or dextran.

However, the reaction only permits to reach yields between 50 - 75 % in IMOs. Impurities are composed of residual maltooligosaccharides (glucose with exclusively α - 1 - 4 linkages) from the starting vegetal material and glucose released during the transglucosylation step. These digestible saccharides are deleterious for the prebiotic preparation. Therefore, these compounds must be eliminated from the medium or converted in prebiotic species. Residual maltooligosaccharides are thus specifically hydrolyzed by a thermostable α-glucosidase (EC. 3. 2. 1. 20) in order to produce glucose as the only unwanted specie. This glucose can then be converted to gluconic acid and/or its salts using a glucose-oxidase (EC. 1. 1. 3. 4) in combination with a catalase. Gluconic acid (C 6 H 12 O 7) is a saccharide derivative which has been recognized as a prebiotic compound. It is also known for its purgative action and proved to be effective for lipid peroxidation prevention. A first option can then be chosen, leaving gluconic acid in the product in order to obtain an original prebiotic product enjoying new prebiotic potential properties due to the combination of both types of prebiotic compounds (IMO and gluconic acid). The second option is to eliminate the gluconic acid from the prebiotic mixture. This separation doesn’t present the same difficulties than for glucose as gluconic acid is charged and can therefore be separated on anion-exchange resins (Dowex AcO-). This overall process, fulfilling the principles of green chemistry and being applicable to produce organic prebiotic, is an elegant solution, from an economical, an environmental, a nutri-functional and a techno-functional point of view. Indeed, it can lead to original prebiotic preparations, with yields close to 100 %, by avoiding product loss, as the digestible saccharides portion is converted to gluconic acid. Furthermore, the presence of gluconic acid can provide many functional properties to the prebiotic preparations for their incorporation in food products...|$|E
40|$|The immunochemical {{specificity}} of the combining sites of murine myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 was studied by quantitative precipitin and precipitin inhibition assays. Myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 precipitated {{with only three}} dextrans, B 1355 S 4, B 1498 S, and B 1501 S, with high proportions of alpha(1 leads to 3) linkages, but not with any other dextrans, glycogen, and pullulan. Inhibition tests with various sugars show that the combining site of myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 is most complementary to panose, a trisaccharide DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4) DGlc. Panose was 3. 3 times more potent than a tetrasaccharide DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4) DGlc and 8, 23, 42, > 42 times more active than maltose, <b>nigerose,</b> isomaltose, and kojibiose, respectively. These findings were paralleled by their binding properties as determined by affinity electrophoresis. The association constants (Ka) of these three dextrans to myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 ranged from 3. 8 X 10 (3) ml/g to 5. 02 X 10 (3) ml/g. The association constant of inhibitor (Kia) of panose was 8. 19 X 10 (3) M- 1. Myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 is an antidextran with specificity {{different from those of}} other murine myeloma antidextrans and from human antidextrans reported previously and its combining site size is at least as large as a trisaccharide. The binding constant of methyl alpha-D-glucoside (7. 2 X 10 (2)) was 73 % of that of panose and comparable to that of myeloma protein W 3129 (9. 4 X 10 (2)) with a cavity-type site and 600 times lower (1. 6 X 10 (0)) for QUPC 52 with a groove type site, indicating that the terminal nonreducing residue is held in a cavity. Inhibition data with various alpha(1 leads to 4) -linked oligosaccharides also indicate that the internal portions of these inhibitors may react directly with a portion of the combining site. These findings suggest that myeloma antidextran CAL 20 TEPC 1035 has a partial cavity-type combining site in which the terminal nonreducing dGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) moiety is held in a cavity with the other two sugars forming a groove. However, oligosaccharides with one or more alternating [leads to 3 DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 3) DGlcl leads to] units with and without terminal nonreducing DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) or DGLc alpha(1 leads to 3) side chains remain to be tested to determine whether structures known to be present in the three dextrans which precipitate CAL 20 TEPC 1035 may not prove to be more active than panose...|$|E
40|$|Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) are non-digestible oligosaccharides, {{considered}} as prebiotics and therefore aim to selectively feed probiotics indigenous {{to the human}} colon. Recent data obtained in human subjects, support the involvement of dietary oligosaccharides in physiological processes in the different intestinal cell type and also outside the gastrointestinal tract (e. g. hormone production, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism). IMOs consists of glucose monomers linked {{by at least one}} α- 1 - 6, or in a lower proportion α - 1 - 3 (<b>nigerose</b> family) or α - 1 - 2 (kojibiose family) glucosidic linkages. In our case they are produced enzymatically from corn starch. It results in a very complex mixture with molecules characterized at the same time by their DP value (from 2 to ~ 20), linkages types (α- 1 - 2, 3 or 6) and the proportion and position of each type of linkage (only α - 1 - 6 or combined types). The challenge {{of this study was to}} find a qualitative and quantitative method to characterize the syrups. In a subsequent study, every unidentified peak could be determined by NMR or Mass spectrometry. Three different chromatographic methods have been tested and compared over their selectivity, sensibility, robustness, applicability and their quantitative power. The HPLC-RID (Refractive Index Detector) used with a Prevail Carbohydrate column (Alltech), adapted for carbohydrates with a certain value of DP, appear to be poorly selective due to the obligation of working in isocratic conditions. The HPLC-ELSD (Evaporating Light Scattering Detector) used with the same column gave a very good separation upon the DP as the Prevail accepts a wide range of solvant changing and even a separation of the different DP 2 molecules. The sensibility was also improved due to the stability of the baseline. The quantitative analysis is a bit more awkward due to the relatively limited linear portion of the calibration curve. High-performance Anion Exchange Chromatography coupled with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD) appeared to deserve a special mention, since it provides selective separation and sensitive detection. In fact, this technique is the only chromatographic one to separate with effectiveness homologue molecules having a difference only in their DP (up to high DPs) or linkage types. This is due to the separation mode based on the difference in ionic force of the sugars in alkaline conditions (mainly due to the DP and the structure of the molecule). However, during the detection, the electrochemical behavior of carbohydrates can be affected by molecular weight as well as by structural differences giving rise to different response factors; as a consequence, HPAEC-PAD is not generally {{considered as}} suitable for quantitative studies of complex mixtures of oligosaccharides. In this work a methodological approach is presented in order to get a quantitative response through a rigorous methodology for our IMOs. It also opens the way to the theoretical determination of the response factor for the homologue molecules in relation with their structure and DP...|$|E
40|$|Many {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} are able to synthesize dextrans from sucrose by dextransucrases. Weissella confusa strains have attracted increasing attention due to their production of texture-modifying dextrans during food fermentation. Potential prebiotic oligosaccharides have also been produced by dextransucrases {{in the presence of}} sucrose and acceptor sugars. However, only few W. confusa dextransucrases have been previously studied, and the reactions of Weissella dextransucrases to synthesize oligosaccharides have not been investigated. In this thesis, two W. confusa dextransucrases from efficient dextran-producers were studied, and their products were structurally characterized because this information is essential for a better usability of these enzymes and corresponding bacteria in food and health applications. The biochemical and kinetic properties of one of the W. confusa dextransucrases were studied. Two activity assays were compared to determine the kinetic parameters. A sucrose radioisotope assay gave a KM of 14. 7 mM and a Vmax of 8. 2 µmol/(mg∙min), whereas a Nelson-Somogyi assay gave values of 13. 0 mM and 19. 9 µmol/(mg∙min), respectively. The dextrans from the two W. confusa dextransucrases were found by, e. g., NMR analysis to consist of mainly α-(1 → 6) linkages and 3 % α-(1 → 3) branches, of which some were elongated. A high-performance size-exclusion chromatography analysis of the dextrans revealed high molar masses of 107 ‒ 108 g/mol. Weissella dextransucrases were also studied with acceptor sugars for the synthesis of glucooligosaccharides. The most efficient acceptor was maltose, followed by isomaltose, maltotriose, and <b>nigerose,</b> which formed series of glucooligosaccharides by the further elongation of intermediate acceptor products. The products derived from maltose formed two homologous series, with one series being predominant and the other being minor. The major maltose product series were linear isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) with reducing-end maltose units, as identified by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn) analysis. The minor maltose series were revealed by an NMR analysis of the isolated minor trisaccharide product to bear a novel branched structure. These products contained an α-(1 → 2) -linked glucosyl residue on the reducing residue of the linear IMOs. These structures have not been previously obtained by a dextransucrase. They probably formed by the attachment of a single-unit branch to linear IMOs. For the acceptor analogs lactose and cellobiose, their main acceptor products were identified by NMR analysis to be branched trisaccharides, with a glucosyl residue α-(1 → 2) linked to the acceptor s reducing end. Surprisingly, a side product, isomelezitose (6 Fru-α-Glcp-sucrose), was produced when using lactose as an acceptor. The synthesis of this nonreducing trisaccharide by a dextransucrase was reported here for the first time. Linear IMOs with a degree of polymerization ≥ 3. 3 serve as prebiotics for their resistance to digestion. However, industrial IMO production often leads to a high portion of unwanted digestible sugars. The dextransucrase reaction {{in the presence of the}} efficient acceptor maltose was demonstrated here as a promising alternative synthesis process to control IMO size distribution by varying the sucrose/maltose ratio. The effects of substrate concentrations (0. 15 1 M) and dextransucrase dosage (1 10 U/g sucrose) on the IMO yield and profile were modeled. High sucrose (1 M) and medium maltose (0. 5 M) concentrations were found to be optimal for the synthesis of long-chain IMOs, with 366 g/L of total IMOs attained. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that NIR might {{be capable of}} discriminating one floral source from another was explored. No prior analysis of NIR for New Zealand honeys has been reported. A visual inspection of the NIR spectra of ten New Zealand honey types indicates that beech honeydew honey is significantly different from nectar honeys. Rata honey is the most unique nectar honey with very little variability seen in the NIR spectra compared to other honey types. Both beech honeydew and rata honey can be distinguished from other floral types using Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) on selected wavelengths. A degree of clustering within other honey types is achieved, however none of these are fully resolved. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) model successfully classified all main New Zealand unifloral honeys with an average correct classification of 93 %. 100 % of all beech honeydew honeys were correctly classified with close to 100 % achieved for rata, kamahi, manuka, rewarewa and clover honeys. Honeys with a clover contribution: tawari, thyme, nodding thistle and vipers‟ bugloss displayed reduced performance in this model with a proportion of samples misclassified as clover honey. These {{results indicate that the}} NIR spectra evaluated using a PLS model would be an effective industry classification method for the identification of New Zealand unifloral honeys with the exception of nodding thistle and vipers‟ bugloss honeys. A multi-technique classification model incorporating NIR classification results with conductivity, colour and sugar analysis has been proposed. A series of compounds in manuka honey were examined in respect to UMF activity. The carbohydrate profiles of 38 manuka honeys of varying UMF activity were determined using a combination of HPLC, GC-FID and GC-MS. A method was developed to determine the proportion of <b>nigerose,</b> turanose, maltose and maltulose in reduced and silylated honey using the ratio of m/z 307 to m/z 308 ion responses as determined by GC-MS-SIM. An examination of the glucose and fructose concentrations in manuka honey revealed a moderate correlation between the glucose/fructose ratio and UMF activity. Due to an improvement in chromatographic resolution, the peak assignment of three disaccharides (cellobiose, laminaribiose and gentibiose) differed from that of a previous investigation. Despite the retention time of palatinose being identical to the corresponding peak in honey, an examination of the mass spectra provided strong evidence to suggest that the corresponding honey disaccharide is α- 1 → 2 linked as opposed to β- 1 → 6 linked and that it was therefore unlikely that this peak arose from palatinose. The mono and disaccharide composition of manuka honey was evaluated with respect to the level of UMF activity. Linear Discriminant analysis successfully distinguished between high, moderate and low UMF activity honeys. Glucose was identified as the single most important compound in the discriminant model. The connection between glucose concentration and UMF activity was not unexpected as a significant proportion of UMF activity has been attributed to the presence of methyl glyoxal, a degradation product of glucose. The existences of indicator compounds in honeys from various floral origins were examined. The extractable organic substances of five New Zealand honeys: beech honeydew honey, kamahi, pohutukawa, rata and tawari were determined by GC-MS of methylated extracts. This survey confirmed the results of a previous investigation and established ranges for marker compounds. Due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient certified unifloral honeys, previous studies on these honey types were exploratory only and not published. Statistical analysis of the extractable organic substances showed that each honey contains a unique fingerprint of compounds. Agglomerative clustering successfully separated all honeys into the correct floral group with the exception of two samples. Well separated clusters were produced in the score plot of the first and second Linear Discriminants. 4 -Hydroxyphenylacetic acid, salicylic acid, indole- 3 -acetic acid and an unknown compound (identified by characteristic ions in the mass spectra) were identified as being the most important discriminants, all of which were present in a single floral source...|$|E
