5|$|On 16 October, before Pakistan {{had started}} playing any {{games in the}} tournament, it was {{revealed}} that two Pakistani players, Mohammad Asif and Shoaib Akhtar had failed a drugs test for the banned anabolic steroid <b>nandrolone.</b> Abdur Rehman and Yasir Arafat were called up to replace them.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted {{an article}} on its website {{as part of its}} {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. The article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Orton, who was alleged to have obtained anastrozole, clomiphene citrate, <b>nandrolone,</b> oxandrolone, stanozolol, and testosterone. WWE simply claimed that the allegations preceded their Talent Wellness program launched in February 2006.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} later on March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted on its website another article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned that ten other professional wrestlers were implicated to have received performance-enhancing drugs from the same drug ring, including four WWE wrestlers and Eddie Guerrero. Angle never failed a drug test for pain pills, but he did fail a steroid test under WWE's Wellness Policy because his prescription for <b>nandrolone</b> had expired.|$|E
5|$|During the Games, Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan won {{the gold}} in women's artistic {{individual}} all-around, so she stripped her gold medal after she tested a banned positive substance. As so, her teammates Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru, originally won silver and bronze, upgraded to gold and silver, respectively. While Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan moved up to bronze. At freestyle wrestling 76 kg event Alexander Leipold of Germany stripped off his gold medal after he was tested positive for <b>nandrolone,</b> handing it over to his American rival Brandon Slay.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{posted on}} its website an article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Helms who was alleged to have obtained HGH. WWE has since made a statement on this situation, mentioning that the allegations preceded the Talent Wellness program WWE launched in April 2006. On August 30, 2007, an article by Sports Illustrated named Helms and nine other wrestlers to be given growth hormone not in compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness program. He was said to have received testosterone, HGH and <b>nandrolone</b> between November 2003 and February 2007.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), <b>nandrolone</b> esters (most commonly <b>nandrolone</b> decanoate and <b>nandrolone</b> phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and <b>nandrolone</b> {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and <b>nandrolone,</b> as <b>nandrolone</b> phenylpropionate and <b>nandrolone</b> decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and <b>nandrolone</b> esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Christie {{was found}} guilty of using the performance-enhancing drug <b>nandrolone</b> {{following}} a doping test after an indoor meet in Germany. He was found to have more than 100 times normal levels of the metabolites of <b>nandrolone</b> in his urine. Various explanations were offered to explain the results, including eating avocado, or using nutritional supplements.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like <b>nandrolone</b> (as an ester like <b>nandrolone</b> {{decanoate}} or <b>nandrolone</b> phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like <b>nandrolone</b> esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like <b>nandrolone</b> esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E
25|$|The optimal ranges {{listed for}} {{testosterone}} only apply to individuals taking bioidentical hormones {{in the form}} of testosterone (including esters) and do not apply to those taking synthetic AAS (e.g., <b>nandrolone)</b> or dihydrotestosterone.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{commonly}} used, methyltestosterone {{is one of the}} few AAS {{that remains}} available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone (and esters), <b>nandrolone</b> decanoate, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and fluoxymesterone.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 2006, Asif was {{suspended}} by the PCB along with team mate Shoaib Akhtar, and was {{pulled from the}} Champions Trophy after the pair failed drug tests for the performance-enhancing substance <b>Nandrolone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Sherk {{successfully}} {{defended his}} title against Hermes França at UFC 73. After the fight, the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) announced that Sherk had {{tested positive for}} <b>Nandrolone,</b> a banned steroid, in a urine test the day prior to the fight. After testing positive for 12ng/ml of <b>Nandrolone,</b> Sherk was fined $2,500 and suspended from competing in California for one year. Sherk's suspension was reduced to six months after appealing his allegations on December 4, 2007, making him eligible to fight in early January 2008. Sherk argued that errors were made in lab testing procedures. He asserted that the lab had failed to properly test the vials used in earlier, positive tests for any remaining steroid content, which may have resulted in his sample becoming contaminated. Quest Diagnostics and the CSAC denied any errors were made.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Davids began wearing {{protective}} glasses following surgery {{in his right}} eye caused by glaucoma, which developed in 1995 following eye injuries. Davids first wore them on 4 September 1999 in a friendly match against Belgium. On 17 May 2001, Davids was suspended by FIFA when he {{tested positive for the}} banned anabolic steroid, <b>nandrolone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 1999, Christie {{competed in}} an indoor meet in Dortmund, Germany. A routine unannounced drug test found the banned {{substance}} <b>nandrolone.</b> After a six-month delay, a disciplinary hearing was convened by the British Athletic Federation which found Christie {{to be not}} guilty. But the IAAF overruled and confirmed a two-year suspension. Christie is also banned for life from British Olympic Association teams.|$|E
25|$|On 6 December 2006, Asif {{spoke out}} in his defence in an {{interview}} with the BBC. When asked to explain the presence of <b>Nandrolone</b> in his body, Asif cited a lack of awareness in Asian countries and said that he had taken some vitamins and protein supplements during the team's 2006 tour of England, which led to the problem. He also mentioned that medicines are easier to obtain in Pakistan, with little information available about the quality of the medicines.|$|E
25|$|Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, {{including}} <b>nandrolone,</b> trenbolone, ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), metribolone (R-1881), trestolone, 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the progesterone receptor (AR) {{and hence}} are progestogens {{in addition to}} AAS. Similarly {{to the case of}} estrogenic activity, the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as s and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility).|$|E
25|$|The major {{effect of}} estrogenicity is {{gynecomastia}} (woman-like breasts). AAS {{that have a}} high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show {{a high risk of}} gynecomastia, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like <b>nandrolone</b> show a much lower risk (though still significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 2007, Akhtar and Asif were {{ruled out}} of the Pakistani squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup by team officials, minutes before the squad was to depart for the West Indies. The team {{management}} along with the PCB said their injuries were too severe to risk taking them to the Caribbean. Since neither of the two had been declared fit they had not undergone official doping tests. However, Pakistani officials told cricket sources off the record that the team management had feared that they would fail the doping tests as it was likely traces of <b>Nandrolone</b> were still present in their system.|$|E
25|$|Ortiz {{would face}} Berto, whose first thrilling slugfest in April {{was one of}} the best fights of the year, once again. The fight, which had been in {{discussion}} for weeks, was originally supposed to take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on February 11, 2012. The fight was postponed to June 30, 2012, due to Berto rupturing his biceps in training and being unable to meet the original date. On May 20, 2012, Berto failed an anti-doping test, testing positive for <b>nandrolone.</b> Although Berto denied having ever taken the substance intentionally, the rematch was cancelled and Light Welterweight Josesito Lopez was chosen to take his place. They did have a rematch eventually, in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{endogenous}} {{testosterone levels}} may {{also contribute to}} differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. AR agonists are antigonadotropic – that is, they dose-dependently suppress gonadal testosterone production and hence reduce systemic testosterone concentrations. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body {{with that of the}} exogenous AAS, the myotrophic-androgenic ratio would be expected to be further increased, and this hence may be yet an additional mechanism contributing to the differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio. In addition, some AAS, such as <b>nandrolone,</b> are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity might further increase the myotrophic-androgenic ratio for a given AAS.|$|E
25|$|NET {{displays}} 8 {{times higher}} progestational activity than progesterone. It {{is also a}} potent progestogen and binds to the PR with approximately 150% of the affinity of progesterone. In contrast, its parent compounds, testosterone, <b>nandrolone</b> (19-nortestosterone), and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), have 2%, 22%, and 44% of the relative binding affinity of progesterone for the PR. Unlike NET, its major active metabolite 5α-dihydro-NET (5α-DHNET), which is formed by 5α-reductase, {{has been found to}} possess both progestogenic and marked antiprogestogenic activity, although its affinity for the PR is greatly reduced relative to NET at only 25% of that of progesterone. NET produces similar changes in the endometrium and vagina and is similarly thermogenic in women compared to progesterone, which is in accordance with its progestogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|On the women's side, the Olympic 100m was {{affected}} by state-sponsored doping in East Germany. Stasi documents released {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall revealed extensive drug usage by Olympic sprinters, including the 1976 and 1980 silver medallists Renate Stecher and Marlies Göhr, as well as the 1988 bronze medallist Heike Drechsler. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, twice Olympic champion, received a six-month ban for taking a banned narcotic for pain relief. The 2008 runner-up Sherone Simpson was banned in 2013 after a positive test for a stimulant and two-time bronze medallist Veronica Campbell-Brown failed a test for a diuretic that same year. A fourth Jamaican medallist, Merlene Ottey, received a ban for the steroid <b>nandrolone</b> in 1999 but this was rescinded on appeal due to laboratory errors.|$|E
25|$|NET has {{approximately}} 15% of the affinity of the anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) metribolone (R-1881) for the AR, and in accordance, is weakly androgenic. In {{contrast to}} NET, 5α-DHNET, the major metabolite of NET, shows higher {{affinity for the}} AR, with approximately 27% of the affinity of metribolone. However, although 5α-DHNET has higher affinity for the AR than NET, it has significantly diminished and in fact almost abolished androgenic potency in comparison to NET in rodent bioassays. Similar findings were observed for ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and its 5α-reduced metabolite, whereas 5α-reduction enhanced both the AR affinity and androgenic potency of testosterone and <b>nandrolone</b> (19-nortestosterone) in rodent bioassays. As such, {{it appears that the}} ethynyl group of NET at the C17α position is responsible for its loss of androgenicity upon 5α-reduction.|$|E
25|$|NET was {{synthesized}} for {{the first}} time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951. It was the first highly active oral progestogen to be synthesized, and was preceded (as a progestogen) by progesterone (1934), ethisterone (1938), 19-norprogesterone (1944), and 17α-methylprogesterone (1949), as well as by <b>nandrolone</b> (1950), whereas noretynodrel (1952), and norethandrolone (1953) followed the synthesis of NET. The drug was first introduced, alone as Norlutin, in the United States in 1957. NET was subsequently introduced in combination with mestranol as Ortho-Novum in the U.S. in 1963, and was the second progestin, after noretynodrel in 1960, to be used in an oral contraceptive. In 1964, additional contraceptive preparations containing NET in combination with mestranol or EE, such as Norlestrin and Norinyl, were marketed in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and metandienone are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like <b>nandrolone</b> can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E
25|$|On February 19, 2016, at , Slice faced Dada 5000. The duo {{had a big}} {{rivalry between}} them due to their old street fight {{legacies}} they had in Perrine, Florida. After a back and forth fight, Slice won the fight via TKO when Dada collapsed from apparent exhaustion in the third round. Following the bout {{it was reported that}} Slice had failed his pre-fight drug test. Lab results found traces of the anabolic steroid <b>nandrolone.</b> He was also found to have an elevated testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio of 6.4:1, which is above the maximum allowed limit of 4:1. On May 2, 2016, it was revealed that Slice had settled with the Texas Athletic Commission with a fine of $2,500 and a revoking of his license in the state of Texas. The result of the bout has also been changed to a no contest. Despite being widely panned by critics, the fight attracted approximately 2.5 million viewing households, breaking the Bellator record of 2.4 million, set by Kimbo vs Shamrock.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be robustly {{converted}} by 5α-reductase into DHT {{in so-called}} androgenic tissues such as skin, scalp, prostate, and seminal vesicles, {{but not in}} muscle or bone, where 5α-reductase either is not expressed or is only minimally expressed. As DHT is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an agonist of the AR than is testosterone, the AR agonist activity of testosterone is thus markedly and selectively potentiated in such tissues. In contrast to testosterone, DHT and other 4,5α-dihydrogenated AAS are already 5α-reduced, and for this reason, cannot be potentiated in androgenic tissues. 19-Nortestosterone derivatives like <b>nandrolone</b> can be metabolized by 5α-reductase similarly to testosterone, but 5α-reduced metabolites of 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., 5α-dihydronandrolone) tend to have reduced activity as AR agonists, resulting in reduced androgenic activity in tissues that express 5α-reductase. In addition, some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT)), 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone (11β-MNT), and dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone), cannot be 5α-reduced. Conversely, 17α-alkylated AAS can be 5α-reduced and are potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone, with an exception being 17α-alkylated AAS that are already 4,5α-reduced.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{posted on}} its website an article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Gutierrez who was alleged to have obtained <b>nandrolone</b> and stanozolol. WWE subsequently stated that the allegations preceded the Talent Wellness program WWE launched in February 2006. On August 27, 2009, WWE announced that Gutierrez would receive a 30-day suspension due to a violation of the wellness program. Days later Gutierrez defended himself in a newspaper interview by explaining the drugs as being on a prescription for his knee and arm. While the Wellness Policy allows for prescribed drugs, Gutierrez further contested he had been on a family holiday and subsequently in Europe promoting SummerSlam, giving him only a day to provide the prescription after being notified. On April 26, 2012, it was announced that Gutierrez would be suspended for 60 days due to a second violation of the WWE Wellness Program.|$|E
25|$|NET has a {{terminal}} half-life of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, {{with a mean}} terminal half-life of 8.0 hours. The metabolism of NET {{is very similar to}} that of testosterone (and <b>nandrolone)</b> and is mainly via reduction of the Δ4 double bond to 5α- and 5β-dihydro-NET, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 keto group to the four isomers of 3,5-tetrahydro-NET. These transformations are catalyzed by 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues such as the pituitary gland, uterus, prostate gland, vagina, and breast. With the exception of 3α,5α- and 3β,5α-tetrahydro-NET, which have significant affinity for the ER and are estrogenic to some degree, the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of NET are inactive in terms of affinity for sex steroid receptors (specifically, the PR, AR, and ER). A small amount of NET is also converted by aromatase into EE. NET is metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation as well, mainly by CYP3A4. Some conjugation (including glucuronidation and sulfation) of NET and its metabolites occurs in spite of steric hindrance by the ethynyl group at C17α. The ethynyl group of NET is preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites.|$|E
500|$|Six days later, Japanese {{news agency}} Kyodo News {{reported}} that Indian middle distance runner Sunita Rani had {{tested positive for}} a banned substance, which was later confirmed by Lee Choon-Sup, Deputy Secretary General of the Busan Asian Games Organizing Committee; an unofficial report stated that the substance was the anabolic steroid <b>nandrolone.</b> Sunita had won two medals in athletics: a gold in the 1,500m (setting an Asian Games record) and a bronze in the 5,000m, (in which Sunita jointly bettered the Games record set by Indonesian Suprianti Sutono in Bangkok during the 1998 Asian Games with six other athletes). The Indian Chef de Mission at the Games backed Sunita—who denied using any banned drug—and asked for a [...] "B" [...] sample test from Bangkok, but tests were run only at the Asian Games’ Doping Control Center (AGDCC) in Seoul (the laboratory accredited by the IOC). On October 16, the AGDCC confirmed the steroid <b>nandrolone</b> in Sunita's urine sample; as a consequence, the OCA stripped her of both medals and dismissed her Asian Games record for the 1,500m.|$|E
500|$|On March 6, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{reported}} that Angle's name {{was found in}} the client database of a Florida wellness center suspected of being a front for distributing performance enhancing drugs. The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for trenbolone (which is not approved for human use by the FDA) and <b>nandrolone,</b> both anabolic steroids. Angle responded on his official website: [...] "I did not improperly receive prescriptions. It is well documented that in my career I have broken vertebrae in my neck on five occasions and each time the course of treatment was under the care and supervision of my doctors. Any attempt to link me to the athletes in the current news accounts who may have improperly sought performance-enhancing drugs is without foundation".|$|E
500|$|St-Pierre is {{a fighter}} with very strong wrestling, and trains with the Canadian Olympic team. His conditioning, {{strength}} and athleticism {{have also been}} identified as strong attributes. He became the undisputed UFC Welterweight Champion by winning the interim-championship against Matt Hughes at UFC 79, and successfully unifying the championship against Welterweight title holder Matt Serra at UFC 83 in Quebec, St-Pierre's home province. St-Pierre's fight prior to the UFC 94 event was a successful title defense against Jon Fitch at UFC 87 via unanimous decision, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards. Penn is a fighter noted for his outstanding jiu-jitsu, as {{he is the first}} non-Brazilian to win the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship at the black belt level. His other notable strengths include boxing, and wrestling/takedown defense. Penn captured the vacant UFC Lightweight Championship by defeating Joe Stevenson at UFC 80. The belt was vacant {{as a result of the}} California State Athletic Commission stripping then-champion Sean Sherk of the title for testing positive for anabolic steroid <b>Nandrolone,</b> or more commonly known as Decadurabolin, following a title defense. [...] Penn entered the UFC 94 fight following a successful title defense as well, with a 3rd round TKO of former champion Sean Sherk at UFC 84. St-Pierre and Penn had fought once before in a welterweight number one contenders match at UFC 58 on March 4, 2006, where St-Pierre won in a very evenly matched contest by split decision.|$|E
2500|$|... 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: {{testosterone}} enanthate, <b>nandrolone</b> decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, {{trenbolone acetate}} ...|$|E
2500|$|Natural AAS like {{testosterone}} and DHT {{and synthetic}} AAS are analogues {{of each other}} and are very similar structurally. For this reason, they have the capacity to bind to and be metabolized by the same enzymes. According to the intracellular metabolism explanation, the androgenic-to-anabolic ratio of a given AR agonist is based on its capacity to be transformed by the aforementioned enzymes in conjunction with the AR activity of any resulting products. As an example, whereas the AR activity of testosterone is greatly potentiated by local conversion via 5α-reductase into DHT in tissues where 5α-reductase is expressed, an AAS that is not metabolized by 5α-reductase or has already been 5α-reduced, such as DHT itself or a derivative (like mesterolone or drostanolone), would not experience such potentiation in said tissues. Moreover, <b>nandrolone</b> is metabolized by 5α-reductase, but unlike the case of testosterone and DHT, the 5α-reduced metabolite of <b>nandrolone</b> has much lower affinity for the AR than does <b>nandrolone</b> itself, and this results in reduced AR activation in 5α-reductase-expressing tissues. As so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues such as skin/hair follicles and reproductive tissues are very high in 5α-reductase expression, while skeletal muscle is virtually devoid of 5α-reductase, this may primarily explain the high myotrophic-androgenic ratio and dissociation seen with <b>nandrolone,</b> as well as with various other AAS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{activity}} of boldenone is mainly anabolic, {{with a low}} androgenic potency. Boldenone will increase nitrogen retention, protein synthesis, increases appetite and stimulates the release of erythropoietin in the kidneys. Boldenone was synthesized {{in an attempt to}} create a long-acting injectable methandrostenolone (Dianabol), for androgen deficiency disorders. Boldenone acts similar to methandrostenolone with fewer adverse androgenic effects. [...] Although commonly compared to <b>nandrolone,</b> boldenone lacks progesterone receptor interaction and all the associated progestogenic side effects.|$|E
