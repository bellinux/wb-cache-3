5|$|A bus-powered hub is a {{high-power}} device providing low-power ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the hub controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The hub may also have some <b>non-removable</b> functions in place of ports. A self-powered hub is a device that provides high-power ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows RT {{and core}} edition of Windows 8.1 include device encryption, a feature-limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system. Logging {{in with a}} Microsoft account with {{administrative}} privileges automatically begins the encryption process. The recovery key is stored to either the Microsoft account or Active Directory, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of 8.1, unlike BitLocker, device encryption requires that the device meet the InstantGo (formerly Connected Standby) specifications, which requires solid-state drives, <b>non-removable</b> RAM (to protect against cold boot attacks) and a TPM 2.0 chip.|$|E
25|$|While {{the hazards}} of x-rays are now well-controlled in most medical contexts, MRI still {{may be seen as}} {{superior}} to CT in this regard. MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging of disease and follow-up without exposing the body to ionizing radiation. MRI often may yield different diagnostic information compared with CT. There may be risks and discomfort associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT, MRI scans typically take greater time, are louder, and usually require that the subject go into a narrow, confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other <b>non-removable</b> metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely.|$|E
500|$|The One’s {{industrial}} design and camera were also praised by both CNET (who gave the phone a 4 out of 5) and PC Magazine (who gave the phone an Excellent rating); however, PC Magazine criticized {{the inability to}} properly perform digital cropping and zooming on images taken with the camera, along with the <b>non-removable</b> [...] "bloatware" [...] applications added by AT in its version. CNET panned BlinkFeed for its lack of content sources and {{for not being able}} to use custom sources or turn it off completely, but praised the updates to Sense and the TV app. Again, the [...] "bloatware" [...] added by Sprint and AT was criticized, but HTC’s placement of carrier apps in their own separate folder in the application drawer was noted.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the SDA {{specified}} Embedded SD, [...] "leverag well-known SD standards" [...] {{to enable}} <b>non-removable</b> SD-style devices on printed circuit boards. However this standard was not {{adopted by the}} market while the MMC standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems. SanDisk provides such embedded memory components under the iNAND brand.|$|E
2500|$|The Switch is {{primarily}} powered in portable mode by a <b>non-removable</b> 4310 mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion rechargeable battery. The battery life {{is estimated to}} be between 2.5 and 6.5 hours, depending on the software being used. Nintendo gives the example of [...] supporting approximately three hours of battery life. The battery can be charged either while in the Dock, or through a standard USB-C connector on the Console. The estimated recharge time while the unit is in sleep mode is about 3 hours. Nintendo offers the means for replacing batteries through its customer support. Each Joy-Con has its own <b>non-removable</b> 525 mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion battery separate from the Console, with an estimated twenty-hour lifespan. These batteries are automatically charged if they are attached to the Console while it is charging itself. Additional accessories have other means to charge the Joy-Con. While the basic Joy-Con Grip that ships with the Switch does not offer charging capabilities, a separate premium Joy-Con Grip includes a USB-C connector port {{that can be used to}} charge the Joy-Con batteries while they are connected to this Grip.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the first}} {{removable}} pack drive, the first [...] "Winchester" [...] drives used platters [...] in diameter. A few years later, designers were exploring {{the possibility that}} physically smaller platters might offer advantages. Drives with <b>non-removable</b> eight-inch platters appeared, and then drives that used a [...] form factor (a mounting width equivalent to that used by contemporary floppy disk drives). The latter were primarily intended for the then-fledgling personal computer (PC) market.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1962, IBM {{introduced}} the model 1311 disk drive, {{which was about}} the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removable disk pack. Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels of magnetic tape. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. <b>Non-removable</b> HDDs were called [...] "fixed disk" [...] drives.|$|E

2500|$|Where most {{earrings}} worn in {{the western}} world are designed to be removed easily to be changed at will, earrings can also be permanent (<b>non-removable).</b> [...] They were once used as a mark of slavery or ownership (e.g., see , [...] ). They appear today in the form of larger gauge rings which are difficult or impossible for a person to remove without assistance. [...] Occasionally, hoop earrings are permanently installed by the use of solder, though this poses some risks due to toxicity of metals used in soldering and the risk of burns from the heat involved. [...] Besides permanent installations, locking earrings are occasionally worn by people of both genders, due to their personal symbolism or erotic value.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} HDD code-named [...] "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to [...] "land" [...] on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, [...] "taking off" [...] again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of [...] "Winchester technology" [...] drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later [...] "Winchester" [...] drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to <b>non-removable</b> platters.|$|E
2500|$|The Priv {{features}} a , 1440p AMOLED display, which is slightly curved around the horizontal {{sides of the}} device. The rear of the device is coated in a [...] "glass weave" [...] material. The screen can be slid up to reveal a hardware keyboard; similarly to the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard is touch-sensitive and can register sliding gestures across its keys for scrolling, text selection, and autocomplete suggestions. The device's bezel also features dedicated camera and Convenience buttons. The Priv utilizes a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 system-on-chip with 3GB of RAM, consisting of four low-power Cortex-A53 cores and two Cortex-A57 cores, and includes a <b>non-removable</b> 3420mAh battery which BlackBerry claims can last for 22-and-a-half hours of [...] "mixed use". The Priv includes 32GB of internal storage, with the option to expand the amount of available storage using a microSD card up to 2TB in size. The device {{features a}}n 18-megapixel rear-facing camera with phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilization, and a 2-megapixel front camera.|$|E
2500|$|Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, {{implements}} out-of-band management, giving administrators remote administration, remote management, {{and remote}} control of PCs with no {{involvement of the}} host processor or BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and power-down, remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second <b>non-removable</b> spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have [...] "the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.|$|E
2500|$|In some Lego products, figures {{other than}} {{standard}} minifigures are used. A catalog that shows all these LEGO figures is available. Some Lego sets from 1974 on included much larger figures where only the heads and hair were special pieces , {{which is why}} the usual figures are [...] "mini". Technic used larger scale action figures between 1986 and 2001. These figures featured more realistic sculpts, although still distinctively angular, and featured more articulation, including bendable elbows and knees. These figures are further distinguished from minifigures in that they cannot be easily disassembled; even the hair pieces are <b>non-removable.</b> Duplo includes figures that have less articulation than standard minifigures and cannot be disassembled for safety reasons. Likewise, the Fabuland collection, produced in the 1980s, consisted of larger anthropomorphized animal characters, which also could not be easily disassembled. Belville and Scala, Lego products marketed to girls, also include larger scale figures. These figures are similar to Technic figures in articulation, but feature less angular body sculpts. Scala figures more closely resemble dolls, in that clothes are separate from the figures and hair is made of strands rather than molded plastic. In 2001 Lego further expanded the minifigure system, with the introduction of Bionicle figures. These figures are a part of a fictional story developed by Lego, and resemble biomechanical creatures. Initially, these figures were produced without articulation, only able to hold tools and weapons. Bionicle later got replaced with Hero Factory in 2010. In 2005, Lego released Bionicle playsets, with minifigure variations of characters that had previously been produced in the larger Bionicle scale, notably the Toa and Visorak characters. While these minifigures did not feature movable parts, Lego released Piraka and Inika playsets in 2006, which included minifigures with movable parts. The Friends theme, released in 2012, included mini-doll figures, a more doll-like construction with more realistic anatomy, soon introduced into other themes chiefly aimed at girls. Even though the mini-dolls in the Lego Friends theme have a more realistic anatomy, the mini-dolls' legs can only move ninety degrees into a sitting position. [...] The mini-dolls' legs are also molded together and can not move separately like the traditional Lego minifigure legs can. The mini-doll in the Lego Friends theme is slightly taller than the traditional minifigure.|$|E
