5|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} rollerblading in Central Park stumble across {{the body of a}} woman with several lacerations hidden in a bush. Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb {{around the time of the}} murder. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E

25|$|Keating was {{a regular}} on the Munster inter-provincial {{football}} team during this period as well. In 1972 {{he was a member}} of the starting team that faced Leinster in the decider. A 1-15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, the southern province made <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> in the replay. A double scores 2-14 to 0-10 victory gave Keating a Railway Cup medal with the footballers, his third overall.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} semi finalists {{rested on}} the return leg {{encounter}} in Goa. The match started off with nerves on both sides forcing rookie mistakes in both camps. It was however the visitors Aizawl, who drew first blood, all thanks to their wonderman Joel Sunday who put them ahead in the 37th minute. The 1–0 lead meant Aizawl had an away goal advantage and Sporting Goa would have to score two to progress into the final. The Goans however got their rescue act in place, seconds away from the lemon break whistle. A Sumit Passi header found {{the back of the}} net to draw Sporting Clube de Goa to level terms. The visitors however made the Goan recovery more difficult after the referee awarded a penalty to the highlanders as their captain David Lalrinmuana was tripped in the box by a Sporting Goa defender. Lalchawnkima made <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> in finding the net from the penalty spot to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead. In the 80th minute however, a butter finger moment from Aizawl goalkeeper Soram Poirei saw him push an easy shot right onto Glan Martins' boots. The forward made <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> in scoring from close range to draw the Goans 2–2. Sporting Goa however needed another goal to advance to the final. They had their best chance in injury time, but Sumit Passi failed to tap in an easy ball into an open net. The ending however was not very happy for the visitors. Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana was given the marching orders by the referee when he tried to delay a free-kick from being taken. This made the vital midfielder unavailable for the all important final encounter. The match finished 2–2 on the night and the same on aggregate seeing Aizawl go through to the final having two more away goals than their opponents.|$|E
25|$|When Cobden began what {{proved to}} be the final over, the score was still 175/7, with four runs needed to win. From the first ball, F.H. Hill played a shot which seemed sure to reach the {{boundary}} and thus to win the match. However it was brilliantly fielded and the batsmen could only run one. Hill then had to watch the tail-enders try to cope with Cobden in poor light. S.E. Butler was caught off the second ball of the over and T.H. Belcher was bowled by the third. With four ball overs at that time, Cobden had one ball left. If the batsman, W.A. Stewart, could survive it, then Hill would face the next over and would probably see Oxford home. But Cobden made <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> and Stewart was bowled. Cobden finished with figures of 4/35, and 8/76 in the match.|$|E

25|$|The {{fixtures}} postponed due to Piermario Morosini's death {{were played}} mid-week {{in the last}} full week of April and Parma were up against a tricky trip to Sicily to play Palermo. Abel Hernández got the first goal with a header at the back post after he was found by Andrea Mantovani in the sixth minute. Palermo had the better {{of the first half}} and deserved their lead, but it was Parma who started the second half better and Giovinco's fine run and shot was parried into Stefano Okaka's path and the striker made <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> to level with his head. With 20 minutes to go, Giovinco again did some good work and then found Jonathan Biabiany free in the area. The Frenchman steered the ball into the Palermo net to give the away side the lead. This left Parma 9 points clear of relegation with 4 games to go.|$|E
25|$|The inaugural All-Ireland senior hurling final {{was played}} on Easter Sunday 1888 in Birr, County Offaly. Tipperary and Galway were the opponents, {{with both sides}} vigorously contesting the game from start to finish. Early in the game one of the Thurles players {{received}} facial injuries when he fell on his hurley and had to retire from the game. In a sporting gesture of unrivalled magnitude Galway representatives Meelick withdrew {{one of their own}} players to level the teams. Thurles, the Tipp representatives, scored a point after eleven minutes and led by that score at half-time. With no number of points equaling a goal in those days the destination of the very first All-Ireland hurling title was wide open. At a crucial stage in the second-half, Jim Stapleton lead a charge down the field. The Thurles captain spotted an opening and passed the ball to Tom Healy. Healy made <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> in sending a low, hard drive {{to the back of the}} Galway net. The game ended shortly afterwards with Tipperary winning on a score line of 1 goal, 1 point and 1 forfeit point to Galway’s no score.|$|E

The next year, the category's name was changed to Best Country Vocal Collaboration, a name it held until 1996 when it was awarded as the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.

[...] Similarly, Kill Hipsters called it [...] "one hell of a comeback for a guy everyone–including myself–thought was well and truly dead and gone." [...] Loudwire's Graham Hartmann praised the album as a whole, as did Rick Florino of Artistdirect, who said: [...] "From top to bottom, it's Manson's most vicious and vibrant effort since Antichrist Superstar.

[...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about it.

500|$|U2 is {{credited}} with composing the music for all of Achtung Babys tracks, despite periods of separated songwriting. They wrote the music primarily through jam sessions, a common practice for them. The album represents a deviation {{from the sound of}} their past work; the songs are less anthemic in nature, and their musical style demonstrates a more European aesthetic, introducing influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music. The band referred to the album's musical departure as [...] "the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree". Accordingly, the distorted introduction to the opening track [...] "Zoo Station" [...] was intended to make listeners think the record was broken or was mistakenly not the new U2 album. Author Susan Fast said that with the group's use of technology in the song's opening, [...] "there can be <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> that U2 has embraced sound resources new to them".|$|E

He also played the full 90 minutes in Sunderland's next league outing against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. However, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Sunderland's 1–0 win against Manchester City on 29 August 2010, which sidelined him for an expected six months. Steve Bruce said [...] "It's a tragedy. But Fraizer will be back. He's a larger-than-life character. He {{was just starting to}} show what he was about.

His men said that they were always sure of a cup of tea from him when he visited the trenches late at night and he was certain to check that they were not short of ammunition. Gleeson sent requests to Ireland for hymn books for the men in the field and also bought mouth organs for their entertainment. One of Gleeson's men said [...] "He's a warrior and <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> There's no man at the Front more brave or cooler. Why, it is in the hottest place up in the firing line he do be to give comfort to the boys that are dying."

500|$|The league {{title in}} the 1970–71 season was decided in mid-April {{in front of the}} Match of the Day cameras at Elland Road, when Leeds lost their lead at the top with defeat by West Bromwich Albion. The Leeds players blamed the referee for costing them the title as offside was not given for Colin Suggett for Jeff Astle's winner, and despite Bremner saying [...] "But we fight on. Make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about that, it is not over yet" [...] Leeds could not {{overtake}} Arsenal, who {{went on to win the}} Double. Success instead came in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as Leeds knocked out Sarpsborg (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany), Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to reach the final with Juventus (Italy). Bremner recovered from an ankle injury just in time to face Liverpool in the semi-finals, and scored the only goal of the two-legged tie with a header at Anfield. Leeds won the final on the away goals rule after recording a 2–2 draw at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino and then a 1–1 draw at Elland Road.|$|E
500|$|Once {{he became}} Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker insisted on {{exceptionally}} tight {{control over his}} client's career. Songwriter Robert B. Sherman (of the Sherman Brothers) bore witness to the deal being forged between Hill and Range co-owner Jean Aberbach and The Colonel in 1955. Early on, [...] "The Colonel" [...] and his Hill and Range allies, the brothers Jean and Julian Aberbach, perceived the close relationship that developed between Presley and songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as {{a serious threat to}} that control. Parker effectively ended the relationship, deliberately or not, with the new contract he sent Leiber in early 1958. Leiber thought there was a mistake—the sheet of paper was blank except for Parker's signature and a line on which to enter his. [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> boy, just sign it and return it," [...] Parker directed. [...] "Don't worry, we'll fill it in later." [...] Leiber declined, and Presley's fruitful collaboration with the writing team was over. Other respected songwriters lost interest in or simply avoided writing for Presley because of the requirement that they surrender a third of their usual royalties.|$|E
