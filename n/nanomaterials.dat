5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex <b>nanomaterials.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Nanomaterial</b> is a {{field that}} takes a {{materials}} science-based approach to nanotechnology. The toxicity and values of <b>nanomaterial</b> are largely dependent on their effects on cellular structure and function. Research {{has focused on the}} cellular internalization and metabolism of <b>nanomaterial.</b> Little attention was paid to their actions on cells.

40|$|Silicon <b>nanomaterial</b> was {{prepared}} using the peroxide/acid/salt technique {{in which an}} aqueous silicon-based salt solution was added to H 2 O 2 /HF etchants. In order to optimize the experimental conditions for silicon <b>nanomaterial</b> production, the amount of <b>nanomaterial</b> produced was studied {{as a function of}} the volume of the silicon salt solution used in the synthesis. A set of samples {{was prepared}} using: 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mL of an aqueous 1 mg/L metasilicate solution. The area under the corresponding peaks in the infrared (ir) absorption spectra was used as a qualitative indicator to the amount of the <b>nanomaterial</b> present. The results indicated that using 10 mL of the metasilicate solution produced the highest amount of <b>nanomaterial.</b> Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the peroxide/acid/salt technique results in the enhancement of the production yield of silicon <b>nanomaterial</b> at a reduced power demand and with a higher material to void ratio. A model in which the silicon salt forms a secondary source of silicon <b>nanomaterial</b> is proposed. The auxiliary <b>nanomaterial</b> is deposited into the porous network causing an increase in the amount of <b>nanomaterial</b> produced and a reduction in the voids present. Thus a reduction in the resistance of the porous layer and consequently reduction in the power required, are expected...|$|R

Smalley, {{a chemist}} at Rice University, {{was best known}} as a co-discoverer of the C60 form of carbon known as buckminsterfullerine in 1985, along with Harry Kroto, Robert Curl, James Heath, and Sean O'Brien. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be {{discovered}} of the class of molecules known as fullerenes, which also includes carbon nanotubes. The study and application of fullerenes forms {{a significant part of the}} fields of <b>nanomaterials</b> and nanoelectronics, and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery.|$|E

Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology startups. Smalley died of leukemia in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{writings}} and policy documents define the terms <b>nanomaterial</b> and nanoparticle in various ways. This variation is considered problematic because {{the absence of}} a shared definition is understood as potentially hindering <b>nanomaterial</b> knowledge production and regulation. Another view is that the existence of a shared definition may itself cause problems, as rigid definitions arguably exclude important aspects of the studied phenomena. The aim {{of this paper is to}} inform this state of disagreement by providing analytical concepts for a systematic understanding of how, and even whether, <b>nanomaterial</b> and nanoparticle could and should be defined. To do this, we review definitions of <b>nanomaterial</b> and nanoparticle presented in research articles and policy documents. Definitions were identified by first conducting a Scopus search and then tracing cited definitions back to their sources. In total, 36 definitions were identified. Theories of definition from philosophy and linguistics provide analytical guidance for structuring and categorizing the identified definitions, and the main analytical dimensions of the definitions are then identified and discussed. Finally, we propose a framework for understanding the process of defining <b>nanomaterial</b> and nanoparticle. This framework considers both the generality needed for a shared understanding (by suggesting proto-definitions of <b>nanomaterial</b> and nanoparticle) and the level of precision required for different purposes (by allowing for various explications of the proto-definitions) ...|$|R
30|$|Once {{injected}} downhole into fractures or high permeability streaks, {{the long-term}} thermal resiliency of hydrogels to continuously seal fractures under adverse reservoir conditions is important. Without long-term endurance, gels rapidly degrade, {{leading to a}} re-opening of an already sealed fracture, thus re-creating a water-thief channel. Therefore, ensuring hydrogels can adequately seal fractures over a prolonged period of time is paramount. Figure  5 presents long-term thermal stability testing of hydrogels in both 1  % brine and formation water. As is clearly seen from Fig.  5, hydrogels with no <b>nanomaterial</b> rapidly degraded within days whereas for hydrogels with <b>nanomaterial,</b> degradation occurred over a year in some cases and in others hydrogels have not degraded yet. Additionally, we observed that an increase in <b>nanomaterial</b> concentration led {{to an increase in}} long-term thermal resistance of hydrogels. This is as expected because increasing <b>nanomaterial</b> concentration leads to an increased participation of <b>nanomaterial</b> in the gelation process, affording a stronger gel. Such dramatic improvement in long-term thermal stability of nanocomposite hydrogels is one key reason why we believe they are potentially valuable in conformance control applications.|$|R
