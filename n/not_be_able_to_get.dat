5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E
5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} {{were reversed}} after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, {{as was the}} division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing and your children would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into the better schools.|$|E

Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel 8085/8088 based system dubbed the H100 (or Z-100, in preassembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured very advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 512 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 was interesting in that it could run either the CP/M operating system, or their OEM version of MS-DOS named Z-DOS, which were the two leading business PC operating systems at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, they could read each other's disks.|$|E
25|$|The {{relocation}} effort faced {{a setback}} on March 2010 when NICTD {{announced that it}} was short necessary funds to complete the preliminary engineering study. Unless the funding was found, the relocation would have been postponed indefinitely since, without the engineering study, NICTD would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> state and federal funds necessary to complete the relocation. NICTD and the city continued to work on obtaining the funds needed. In 2011 NICTD accepted bids for a $1 million study, expected to take 18 months. The study was completed in October 2013. The preferred alternative identified by the study preserves an alignment similar to the current route but relocates the tracks alongside the street. It proposes replacing the two existing stations with a new station near the center of Michigan City.|$|E

500|$|Actor and comedian Adrian Edmondson guest-starred in {{the episode}} as surgeon Abra Durant, {{having been a}} fan of the show since its 1999 conception. His {{character}} proved so popular that Edmondson reprised the role twice in 2005, and signed a six-month contract in 2006, with series producer Emma Turner commenting that: [...] "He made a huge impact in the few episodes that he was involved in." [...] Edmondson returned to the series again in 2007, then 2008, making his final appearance in December 2008, when Abra returned to Ghana with Holby General nurse Kyla Tyson (Rakie Ayola). Edmondson ultimately departed from the series to pursue a full-time music career as part of the folk band The Bad Shepherds.

500|$|Public {{support for}} the Korean War {{initially}} resulted in anger towards communists, and Nixon advocated the passage of legislation he had previously introduced with Senator Mundt which would tighten restrictions on communists and the Communist Party. Douglas argued that there was already sufficient legislation to effect any necessary prosecutions, and that the Mundt-Nixon bill (soon replaced by the similar McCarran-Wood bill) would erode civil liberties. With the bill sure to pass, Douglas was urged to vote in favor to provide herself with political cover. She declined to do so, though fellow California Representative Chester E. Holifield warned her that she would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around the state fast enough to explain her vote and Nixon would [...] "beat [...] brains in". Douglas {{was one of only}} 20representatives (including Marcantonio) who voted against the bill. Truman vetoed it; Congress enacted it over his veto by wide margins in late September. Douglas was one of 47representatives (including Marcantonio) to vote to sustain the veto. In a radio broadcast soon after the veto override, Douglas announced that she stood with the President, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in their fight against communism.|$|E
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 1991 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Harries {{personally}} {{bought the}} television rights to An Evening with Gary Lineker, a comedy play written by Arthur Smith and Chris England based around {{a group of}} England fans at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Smith bet Harries £100 that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the adaptation on television before the next World Cup. Harries tried selling Smith and England's screenplay to the BBC, Channel 4, LWT, Yorkshire Television and Central Independent Television to no avail. The BBC offered to produce it as a studio play but Harries wanted a full-length film to distinguish it from the original play, which was by then playing at London's West End. He was reluctant to offer the script to Granada because of his previous experience with the company. However, in 1992 he was accepted the position of controller of comedy at Granada and An Evening with Gary Lineker was made. Harries was disappointed that pressure from Granada's management had forced him to replace {{so many of the}} original stage cast; England was replaced by Paul Merton, leaving Caroline Quentin as the only original actor. The Edinburgh Fringe {{played an important role in}} Harries' early commissions at Granada; he was not fond of traditional styles of comedy and was always looking for alternative comedians. These included Caroline Aherne, Steve Coogan and John Thomson (though Coogan [...] "got away" [...] from him after the BBC offered to produce his Alan Partridge shows). After the failure of Bhundu Beat, Harries commissioned Peter Morgan to write [...] "Mickey Love" [...] in 1993, one of a series of short comedy films for the Rik Mayall series Rik Mayall Presents.|$|E

Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live {{in such a way that}} I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
