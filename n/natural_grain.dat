60|$|They led us--three of {{them and}} all fresh and pretty--into a room {{furnished}} with a golden-brown bearskin. The tokonoma, recess aforementioned, held one scroll-picture of bats wheeling in the twilight, a bamboo flower-holder, and yellow flowers. The ceiling was of panelled wood, {{with the exception of}} one strip at the side nearest the window, and this was made of plaited shavings of cedar-wood, marked off from the rest of the ceiling by a wine-brown bamboo so polished that it might have been lacquered. A touch of the hand sent one side of the room flying back, and we entered a really large room with another tokonoma framed on one side by eight or ten feet of an unknown wood, bearing the same grain as a Penang lawyer, and above by a stick of unbarked tree set there purely because it was curiously mottled. In this second tokonoma was a pearl-grey vase, and that was all. Two sides of the room were of oiled paper, and the joints of the beams were covered by the brazen images of crabs, half life-size. Save for the sill of the tokonoma, which was black lacquer, every inch of wood in the place was <b>natural</b> <b>grain</b> without flaw. Outside was the garden, fringed with a hedge of dwarf-pines and adorned with a tiny pond, water-smoothed stones sunk in the soil, and a blossoming cherry tree.|$|E
60|$|From its house a {{staircase}} of cut stone takes {{you down to}} the temple of Chion-in, where I arrived on Easter Sunday just before service, and {{in time to see}} the procession of the Cherry Blossom. They had a special service at a place called St. Peter's at Rome about the same time, but the priests of Buddha excelled the priests of the Pope. Thus it happened. The main front of the temple was three hundred feet long, a hundred feet deep, and sixty feet high. One roof covered it all, and saving for the tiles there was no stone in the structure; nothing but wood three hundred years old, as hard as iron. The pillars that upheld the roof were three feet, four feet, and five feet in diameter, and guiltless of any paint. They showed the <b>natural</b> <b>grain</b> of the wood till they were lost in the rich brown darkness far overhead. The cross-beams were of grained wood of great richness; cedar-wood and camphor-wood and the hearts of gigantic pine had been put under requisition for the great work. One carpenter--they call him only a carpenter--had designed the whole, and his name is remembered to this day. A half of the temple was railed off for the congregation by a two-foot railing, over which silks of ancient device had been thrown. Within the railing were all the religious fittings, but these I cannot describe. All I remember was row upon row of little lacquered stands each holding a rolled volume of sacred writings; an altar as tall as a cathedral organ where gold strove with colour, colour with lacquer, and lacquer with inlay, and candles such as Holy Mother Church uses only on her greatest days, shed a yellow light that softened all. Bronze incense-burners in the likeness of dragons and devils fumed under the shadow of silken banners, behind which, wood tracery, as delicate as frost on a window-pane, climbed to the ridge-pole. Only there was no visible roof to this temple. The light faded away under the monstrous beams, and we might have been in a cave a hundred fathoms below the earth but for the sunshine and blue sky at the portals where the little children squabbled and shouted.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Settling {{velocities}} in air {{have been}} measured for <b>natural</b> quartz sand <b>grains</b> selected {{to provide a}} range of grain diameters and shapes (roundness and sphericity). The measured settling velocities Win, obtained in an 11. 2 m-long settling tube, are {{significantly lower than the}} settling velocity w, of a sphere having the same weight. The two are empirically related by the equation w ~- 1. 10 w ~ o with R 2 = 0. 84. Although this departure of the settling velocities of <b>natural</b> <b>grains</b> from the settling rates of spheres is most likely due to grain shape effects, no dependence could be found on shape measures uch as the Corey Shape Factor. Simple Gibbs-type mpirical equations are also obtained for sand grains settling in air, one equation for the settling of spheres and a second for the irregular <b>natural</b> sand <b>grains...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Crystal {{inclusions}} in diamonds {{occurs in}} the form of lines known as graining. Graining {{should not be confused with}} a rough diamonds <b>natural</b> <b>grain</b> lines [...] Graining forms due to the improper crystallization of the diamond or when a diamond is twinned. Twinned diamonds are two diamonds that have grown together and causes cross-grains within the diamond during its growth / crystallization process. Twinning causes natural lines, planes or cross-grains in a diamond. Graining can't be removed during the polishing process of a diamond as it is a natural plane within the diamond. Cross-graining also makes the polishing process extremely difficult for diamond cutters as a diamond only cuts against its <b>natural</b> <b>grain</b> lines and never with the grain. One will always find graining in rough diamonds known as [...] "Macle's". Macles are easily identified by its triangular shape. The graining line on the Macle is a natural cleaving plane where the diamond can easily be split in half. Diamonds with graining will never be graded as Flawless as its maximum grade would only fetch Internally Flawless (IF). Although graining seems like a severe flaw it is not visible with the naked eye and does not impact the overall brilliance or quality of a diamond.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{shape of}} {{sedimentary}} particles has been quantified by many different form indices, {{which have been}} utilized mainly in de-termining grain hydrodynamic behavior. Although the orthogonal axis dimensions required for calculating shape indices are easily measured {{in the case of}} grains larger than 2 mm, this is impractical for sand and silt. Different data sets of the settling velocity of <b>natural</b> quartz <b>grains</b> varying in size between 0. 0001 and 1 cm are used in this paper to determine their mean Hofmann shape factor, which defines a polyno-mial curve. In the grain-size range from clay to medium-size pebbles, sand exhibits the highest sphericity, culminating with coarse to very coarse sand. The two polynomial equations describing the curve are employed to determine the settling velocity of <b>natural</b> <b>grains,</b> with a mean accuracy of 95. 1 (64. 5) %. The latter is similar to that obtained for both smooth ellipsoids and angular grains, which suggests that grain roundness does not {{play a major role in}} the settling velocity of particles up to a Reynolds number of at least 4, 200...|$|R

50|$|Intarsia is a {{woodworking}} {{technique that}} uses varied shapes, sizes, and species of wood fitted {{together to create}} a mosaic-like picture with an illusion of depth.

After selecting the specific woods to be used within the pattern, each piece is then individually cut, shaped, and finished. Sometimes areas of the pattern are raised to create more depth.
