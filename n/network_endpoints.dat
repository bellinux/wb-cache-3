Endpoint Security Solutions are available to protect the stealing of information through USB Mass Storage, USB Printer interfaces but still they have no control over the USB audio and USB keyboard interfaces. So these interfaces can be used in an unintended way to attack a <b>network</b> <b>endpoint</b> and steal the information.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} improve a memory {{registration}} strategy for Remote DMA operations over pinningbased {{networks in the}} context of Clusters of Multiprocessors (CLUMPS). Although existing approaches focus primarily on bandwidth as a metric for evaluating the cost of DMA page registration (or pinning), there are many levels of host synchronization that hide the true cost of registration and prevent efficient use of one-sided RDMA communications and seriously impacts the cost for small messages. Furthermore, existing approaches do not tailor their implementations for Multiprocessors that share a single <b>network</b> <b>endpoint,</b> and as such ignore to exploit the spatial and temporal locality in the remote memory pages referenced by running many SPMD parallel programs over a single <b>network</b> <b>endpoint.</b> The proposed solution extends the idea of the Firehose algorithm and proposes a new Firehose API and library for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor variants. The SMP-aware version of Firehose pursues the same design goals of minimizing host-level synchronization [...] or more specifically, allowing operations to complete one-sided in the common case and reverting to rendezvouslike synchronization between endpoints when operations in the uncommon case. We motivate the need for special attention for CLUMPS and supplement a complete Firehose-SMP implementation with an evaluation of its design and some of the initial performance results are promising...|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} new threat vector to networks and <b>network</b> <b>endpoints</b> is a HT appearing {{as a physical}} peripheral device {{that is designed to}} interact with the network endpoint using the approved peripheral device's communication protocol. For example, a USB keyboard that hides all malicious processing cycles from the target network endpoint to which it is attached by communicating with the target network endpoint using unintended USB channels. Once sensitive data is ex-filtrated from the target network endpoint to the HT, the HT can process the data and {{decide what to do with}} it: store it to memory for later physical retrieval of the HT or possibly ex-filtrate it to the internet using wireless or using the compromised network endpoint as a pivot.|$|E
50|$|The WSDL {{describes}} {{services as}} collections of <b>network</b> <b>endpoints,</b> or ports. The WSDL specification provides an XML format for documents for this purpose.The abstract definitions of ports and messages {{are separated from}} their concrete use or instance, allowing the reuse of these definitions. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, {{and a collection of}} ports defines a service. Messages are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types are abstract collections of supported operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding, where the operations and messages are then bound to a concrete network protocol and message format. In this way, WSDL describes the public interface to the Web service.|$|E
