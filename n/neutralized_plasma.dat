40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that magnetized electron clouds can diagnose picoamp ion currents (or equivalent <b>neutralized</b> <b>plasma</b> flows) on a kHz time scale. This {{could be used}} to measure the dynamics of neutral plasma losses to the walls, e. g., along divertor field lines. In essence, a current passing through an electron cloud in a Penning trap transfers angular momentum to the cloud, driving an easily measured orbital "diocotron" instability (from ion currents) or orbital damping (from electron currents). With <b>neutralized</b> <b>plasma</b> flows, the predominant effect is from the lower velocity (i. e., higher density) charge species. Experiments with electron, ion, and neutralized currents have fully characterized this collective (collisionless) electrostatic interaction, and demonstrate the picoamp and kHz resolutions.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a one-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). If a beam-chopping system could be {{developed}} for the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility low-energy beam line, there would be potential to operate the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) at much higher power and duty factor and enable such operation with a radio-frequency quadrapole (RFQ) injector. This would greatly extend the capability of the facility. To accommodate LANSCE operation in the new configuration, a chopped beam must be created in the low-energy transport line before the RFQ. Chopping in this region has never been demonstrated and constitutes the major uncertainty of the proposal and determines the critical path for project completion. This study produces {{a better understanding of}} the physics involved in chopping an H-beam in a dilute plasma background, and in transporting a chopped H-beam through a neutralized or partially <b>neutralized</b> <b>plasma</b> channel, as well as an estimate for the optimum neutralization strategy for the beam chopping and transport between the ion source and the RFQ...|$|E

Here, {{we examined the}} basis of enhanced sensitivity of an env clone amplified from cross <b>neutralizing</b> <b>plasma</b> of an antiretroviral naïve chronically infected Indian patient (ID 50 > 600 -fold higher compared to other autologous env clones). The enhanced autologous neutralization of pseudotyped viruses expressing the sensitive envelope (Env) was associated with increased sensitivity to reagents and monoclonal antibodies targeting distinct sites in Env. Chimeric viruses constructed by swapping fragments of sensitive Env into resistant Env backbone revealed {{that the presence of}} unique residues within C 2 V 3 region of gp 120 governed increased neutralization. The enhanced virus neutralization was also associated with low CD 4 dependence as well as increased binding of Env trimers to IgG 1 b 12 and CD 4 -IgG 2 and was independent of gp 120 shedding.

40|$|In this {{manuscript}} the dispersion relations of streaming instabilities, {{by using the}} unique property (neutralized in charge and current by default) of plasma shells colliding, have been generalized and studied. This interesting property for interpenetrating beams enables one to find the general dispersion relations without any restrictions used in the previous works in this area. In our previous work [H. Mehdian et al., ApJ. 801, 89 (2015) ], employing the plasma shell concept and boost frame method, the general dispersion relation for filamentation instability has been derived in the relativistic classical regime. But in this paper, using the above mentioned concepts, the general dispersion relations (for each of streaming instabilities, filamentation, two-stream and multi-stream) in the non-relativistic quantum regime have been derived by employing the quantum fluid equations together with Maxwell equations. The derived dispersion relations enable to describe any arbitrary system of interacting two and three beams, justified neutralization condition, by choosing the inertial reference frame embedded on {{the one of the}} beams. Furthermore, by the numerical and analytical study of these dispersion relations, many new features of streaming instabilities (E. g. their cut-off wave numbers and growth rates) in terms of all involved parameters have been illustrated. The obtained results in this paper can be used to describe many astrophysical systems and laboratory astrophysics setting, such as collision of non-parallel plasma shells over a background plasma or the collision of three <b>neutralized</b> <b>plasma</b> slabs, and justifying the many plasma phenomena such as particle accelerations and induced fields...|$|E

The kinetic energy of the reflected particles will thus be a considerable portion of the energy that their parent ions had gained in the acceleration over the plasma sheath that naturally interfaces the plasma and the wall.

40|$|The {{physics of}} {{partially}} <b>neutralized</b> <b>plasmas</b> is largely unexplored, {{partly because of}} the difficulty of confining such plasmas. Plasmas are confined in a stellarator without the need for a plasma current, and regardless of the degree of neutralization. The Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) is a stellarator dedicated to the study of non-neutral, and partially <b>neutralized</b> <b>plasmas.</b> This thesis describes the first systematic studies of plasmas of arbitrary neutrality. The degree of neutralization of the plasma can be parameterized through the quantity η ≡ |n_e - Z n_i|/|n_e + Z n_i|. In CNT, η can be varied continuously from pure electron (η = 1) to quasi-neutral (η ≈ 0) by adjusting the neutral pressure in the chamber, which controls the volumetric ionization rate. Pure electron plasmas are in macroscopically stable equilibria, and have strong self electric potentials dictated by the emitter filament bias voltage on the magnetic axis. As η decreases, the plasma potential decouples from the emitter, and spontaneous fluctuations begin to appear. Partially <b>neutralized</b> <b>plasmas</b> (10 ^- 3 < η < 10 ^- 1) generally exhibit multi-mode oscillations in CNT. However, when magnetized ions are present, the electron-rich plasma oscillates at a single dominant mode (20 - 100 kHz). As the plasma approaches quasi-neutrality (η < 10 ^- 5), it also reverts to single mode behavior (1 - 20 kHz). A parametric characterization of the single mode fluctuations detected in plasmas of arbitrary neutrality is presented in this thesis along with measurements of the spatial structure of the oscillations. The single mode fluctuations observed for η ≈ 0. 01 to 0. 8 are identified as an ion resonant instability propagating close to the E × B velocity of the plasma. The experiments also show that these oscillations present a poloidal mode number m = 1, and a toroidal number n = 0, which is identical to the spatial structure of the diocotron instability in pure-toroidal traps, and implies that the ion-driven instability breaks parallel force balance and the conservation of poloidal flux in CNT. The low frequency oscillations detected in the quasi-neutral regime are a global instability convected by the E × B flow of the plasma. In this case, the mode aligns almost perfectly with the field lines, and presents a resonant m = 3 poloidal structure...|$|R

Serum neutralizing activity is well documented, but we show here that type 5 adenovirus also interacts with human blood cells. Over 90 % of a typical virus dose binds to human (but not murine) erythrocytes ex vivo, and samples from a patient administered adenovirus in a clinical trial showed that over 98 % of viral DNA in the blood was cell associated. In contrast, nearly all viral genomes in the murine bloodstream are free in the plasma. Adenovirus bound to human blood cells fails to infect A 549 lung carcinoma cells, although dilution to below 1. 7 x 10 (7) blood cells/ml relieves this inhibition. Addition of blood cells can prevent infection by adenovirus that has been prebound to A 549 cells. Adenovirus also associates with human neutrophils and monocytes ex vivo, particularly {{in the presence of}} autologous plasma, giving dose-dependent transgene expression in CD 14 -positive monocytes. Finally, although plasma with a high neutralizing titer (defined on A 549 cells) inhibits monocyte infection, weakly <b>neutralizing</b> <b>plasma</b> can actually enhance monocyte transduction.

CAP 206 is a South African subtype C HIV- 1 -infected individual previously shown to have broadly <b>neutralizing</b> <b>plasma</b> antibodies targeting the envelope gp 41 distal membrane proximal external region (MPER). We have now used a fluoresceinated peptide tetramer antigen with specific cell sorting to isolate a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the HIV- 1 envelope gp 41 MPER. The isolated recombinant mAb, CAP 206 -CH 12, utilized a portion of the distal MPER (HXB 2 amino acid residues, 673 - 680) and neutralized a subset of HIV- 1 pseudoviruses sensitive to CAP 206 plasma antibodies. Interestingly, this mAb was polyreactive and used the same germ-line variable heavy (V(H) 1 - 69) and variable kappa light chain (V(K) 3 - 20) gene families as the prototype broadly neutralizing anti-MPER mAb, 4 E 10 (residues 672 - 680).

We analyzed a small cohort of elite controllers (ECs) for HIV-neutralizing antibodies using a panel of standardized HIV- 1 pseudovirions on TZM-bl cells. An HIV- 1 Env-tailored phage display library was generated to select epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the EC 26 plasma sample showing the broadest neutralizing activity. Selected Env fragments were mostly allocated to the membrane proximal external region of gp 41. After preabsorbing the EC 26 plasma with the selected phage EC 26 - 2 A 4, we achieved 50 % depletion of its neutralizing activity.

Here, we investigated the activities of a panel of 24 broadly <b>neutralizing</b> <b>plasmas</b> from subtype B- and C-infected donors using a series of complementary mapping methods, focusing mostly on JR-FL as a prototype subtype B primary isolate. Adsorption with gp 120 immobilized on beads revealed that an often large but variable fraction of plasma neutralization was directed to gp 120 and that in some cases, neutralization was largely mediated by CD 4 binding site (CD 4 bs) Abs. The results of a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay using JR-FL trimers further suggested that half of the subtype B and a smaller fraction of subtype C plasmas contained a significant proportion of NAbs directed to the CD 4 bs. Anti-gp 41 neutralizing activity was detected in several plasmas of both subtypes, but in all but one case, constituted only a minor fraction of the overall neutralization activity. Assessment of the activities of the subtype B plasmas against chimeric HIV- 2 viruses bearing various fragments of the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV- 1 gp 41 revealed mixed patterns, implying that MPER neutralization was not dominated by any single specificity akin to known MPER-specific monoclonal Abs. V 3 and 2 G 12 -like NAbs appeared to make little or no contribution to JR-FL neutralization titers.

To determine the neutralization profiles of sequential viruses over time and study whether neutralization patterns correlate with sequence evolution, 12 broadly <b>neutralizing</b> <b>plasmas</b> from HIV- 1 subtype B-infected individuals were tested for their ability to neutralize sequential primary HIV- 1 subtype B viruses from four individuals. Three patterns of neutralization were observed, including a loss of neutralization sensitivity by viruses over time, an increase in neutralization sensitivity by sequential viruses, or a similarity in the sensitivity of sequential viruses to neutralization. Seven to 11 gp 160 clones from each sequential virus sample were sequenced and analyzed to identify mutational patterns. Analysis of the envelope sequences of the sequential viruses revealed changes characteristic of the neutralization patterns. Viruses that evolved to become resistant to neutralizing antibodies also evolved with diverse sequences, with most of the changes being due to nonsynonymous mutations occurring in the V 1 /V 2, {{as well as in the}} constant regions (C 2, C 3, C 4), the most changes occurring in the C 3. Viruses from the patient that evolved to become more sensitive to neutralization exhibited less sequence diversity with fewer nonsynonymous changes that occurred mainly in the V 1 /V 2 region. The V 3 region remained constant over time for all the viruses tested. This study demonstrates that as viruses evolve in their host, they either become sensitive or resistant to neutralization by antibodies in heterologous plasma and mutations in different envelope regions account for these changes in their neutralization profiles...|$|R

Recent high-time-resolution rocket ion data have revealed that the transverse acceleration process is of very short duration (about 100 ms) and occurs in a very limited volume (a few hundred kilometers along B and on the order of the ion gyrodiameter across B). Such impulse acceleration events are correlated with waves near the lower hybrid resonance...|$|R
40|$|The design {{update of}} the European Spallation Source (ESS) {{accelerator}} is almost complete {{and the construction}} of the prototype of the microwave discharge ion source able to provide a proton beam current larger than 70 mA to the 3. 6 MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) started. The source named PS-ESS (Proton Source for ESS) was designed with a flexible magnetic system and an extraction system able to merge conservative solutions with significant advances. The ESS injector has taken advantage of recent theoretical updates and new plasma diagnostics tools developed at INFN-LNS (Laboratori Nazionali del Sud, Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). The design strategy considers the PS-ESS and the low energy beam transport line as a whole, where the proton beam behaves like an almost <b>neutralized</b> non-thermalized <b>plasma.</b> Innovative solutions have been used as hereinafter described. Thermo-mechanical optimization has been performed to withstand the chopped beam and the misaligned focused beam over the RFQ input collimator; the results are reported here...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} number of infants acquire HIV- 1 through their infected mother’s breast milk, primarily due to limited access to antiretrovirals. Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) may prevent this transmission. Previous studies, however, have generated conflicting results {{about the ability of}} nAbs to halt mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and their impact on infant outcomes. This study compared <b>plasma</b> <b>neutralizing</b> activity in exposed infants and the infected mothers (n = 63) against heterologous HIV- 1 variants and the quasispecies present in the mother. HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HEU) (n = 42), compared to those that eventually acquired infection (n = 21), did not possess higher nAb responses against heterologous envelopes (P = 0. 46) or their mothers’ variants (P = 0. 45). Transmitting compared to nontransmitting mothers, however, had significantly higher <b>plasma</b> <b>neutralizing</b> activity against heterologous envelopes (P = 0. 03), although these two groups did not have significant differences in their ability to neutralize autologous strains (P = 0. 39). Furthermore, infants born to mothers with greater neutralizing breadth and potency {{were significantly more likely to}} have a serious adverse event (P = 0. 03). These results imply that preexisting anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing activity does not prevent breast milk transmission. Additionally, high maternal neutralizing breadth and potency may adversely influence both the frequency of breast milk transmission and subsequent infant morbidity...|$|R
