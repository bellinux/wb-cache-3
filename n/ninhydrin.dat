25|$|Some {{of these}} techniques, such as <b>ninhydrin,</b> {{diazafluorenone}} and vacuum metal deposition, show great sensitivity {{and are used}} operationally. Some fingerprint reagents are specific, for example <b>ninhydrin</b> or diazafluorenone reacting with amino acids. Others such as ethyl cyanoacrylate polymerisation, work apparently by water-based catalysis and polymer growth.

25|$|<b>Ninhydrin</b> {{reacts with}} amino acids and amines {{to form a}} colored {{compound}} “Ruhemann’s purple” (RP). Spraying with a zinc chloride solution forms a 1:1 complex RP:ZnCl(H2O)2, which is more readily detected as it fluoresces better than Ruhemann’s purple.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprints can be visualized with {{fluorescent}} compounds such as <b>ninhydrin</b> or DFO (1,8-Diazafluoren-9-one). Blood {{and other}} substances are sometimes detected by fluorescent reagents, like fluorescein.

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} by o-phthaldialdehyde assay (NOPA) {{is used to}} measured available primary {{amino acids}} in grape juice using a spectrophotometer that can measure at 335nm wavelengths. Since the assay only measures primary amino acids, the results produces won't include proline or ammonia concentrations. Proline can be separately measured with an assay that uses <b>ninhydrin</b> to react with the amino acid {{in the presence of}} formic acid, yielding a compound that can be absorbed at 517nm.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the ion-exchange {{chromatography}} is given by the NTRC using sulfonated polystyrene as a matrix, adding the amino acids in acid solution and passing a buffer of steadily increasing pH through the column. Amino acids are eluted when the pH reaches their respective isoelectric points. Once the amino acids have been separated, their respective quantities are determined by adding a reagent that will form a coloured derivative. If the amounts of amino acids are in excess of 10 nmol, <b>ninhydrin</b> {{can be used for}} this; it gives a yellow colour when reacted with proline, and a vivid purple with other amino acids. The concentration of amino acid is proportional to the absorbance of the resulting solution. With very small quantities, down to 10 pmol, fluorescent derivatives can be formed using reagents such as ortho-phthaldehyde (OPA) or fluorescamine.|$|E

2500|$|Quantitative {{amino acid}} {{analysis}} is typically performed using the <b>ninhydrin</b> reaction, followed by liquid chromatography {{to measure the}} amount of amino acid in the sample (either urine, plasma/serum, or CSF).

2500|$|The Degnan {{ransom note}} was first {{examined}} by the Chicago Crime Detection Laboratory, but they couldn't find any usable prints on the note. Captain Timothy O'Connor took the note to the FBI crime laboratory in Washington, D.C. on January 18, 1946 {{with the idea of}} enlisting the FBI's more sophisticated technology in finding any latent prints. The FBI subjected the note to the then advanced method of iodine fuming to raise latent prints. The process was similar in execution to today's polycyanoacrylate [...] "super glue" [...] fuming in which Cyanoacrylate is heated to a vapor. This vapor sticks to the skin oils on the friction ridges of a latent fingerprint. The older <b>Ninhydrin</b> method which is a liquid that is sprayed on paper to detect latent prints on paper is similar. The FBI were able to raise two prints which they photographed promptly because, unlike modern polycyanoacrylate, fuming prints revealed by the iodine process fade quickly. Captain O'Connor later testified at Heirens's sentencing hearing that he only saw two prints {{on the front of the}} note and did not mention the existence of any on the back.|$|E
2500|$|To {{get to this}} point, Sanger refined a {{partition}} chromatography method first developed by Richard Laurence Millington Synge and Archer John Porter Martin to determine the composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (now, also known as Sanger's reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from poisonous gas research by Bernhard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger's reagent proved effective at labelling the [...] N-terminal amino group {{at one end of}} the polypeptide chain. He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as trypsin. The mixture of peptides was fractionated in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by electrophoresis in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by chromatography in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with <b>ninhydrin,</b> moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called [...] "fingerprints". [...] The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete acid hydrolysis and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ninhydrin</b> (2,2-dihydroxyindane-1,3-dione) is a {{chemical}} {{used to detect}} ammonia or primary and secondary amines. When reacting with these free amines, a deep blue or purple color known as Ruhemann's purple is produced. <b>Ninhydrin</b> is most commonly used to detect fingerprints, as the terminal amines of lysine residues in peptides and proteins sloughed off in fingerprints react with <b>ninhydrin.</b> It is a white solid which is soluble in ethanol and acetone at room temperature. <b>Ninhydrin</b> {{can be considered as}} the hydrate of indane-1,2,3-trione.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ninhydrin</b> is {{also used}} in amino acid {{analysis}} of proteins. Most of the amino acids, except proline, are hydrolyzed and react with <b>ninhydrin.</b> Also, certain amino acid chains are degraded. Therefore, separate analysis is required for identifying such amino acids that either react differently or do not react at all with <b>ninhydrin.</b> The rest of the amino acids are then quantified colorimetrically after separation by chromatography.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ninhydrin</b> was {{discovered}} in 1910 by the German-English chemist Siegfried Ruhemann (1859-1943). [...] In the same year, Ruhemann observed ninhydrin's reaction with amino acids. [...] In 1954, Swedish investigators Oden and von Hofsten proposed that <b>ninhydrin</b> {{could be used to}} develop latent fingerprints.|$|E
50|$|Note that to {{generate}} the <b>ninhydrin</b> chromophore (2-(1,3-dioxoindan-2-yl)iminoindane-1,3-dione), the amine is condensed with a molecule of <b>ninhydrin</b> to give a Schiff base. Thus only ammonia and primary amines can proceed past this step. At this step, {{there must be an}} alpha hydrogen present to form the Schiff base. Therefore, amines bound to tertiary carbons do not react further and thus are not detected. The reaction of <b>ninhydrin</b> with secondary amines gives an iminium salt, which is also coloured, and this is generally yellow-orange in color.|$|E

50|$|A <b>ninhydrin</b> {{solution}} {{is commonly used}} by forensic investigators {{in the analysis of}} latent fingerprints on porous surfaces such as paper. Amino acid containing fingermarks, formed by minute sweat secretions which gather on the finger's unique ridges, are treated with the <b>ninhydrin</b> solution which turns the amino acid finger ridge patterns purple and therefore visible.|$|E
50|$|Hydrindantin is a {{chemical}} intermediate formed during the <b>ninhydrin</b> test for amines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ninhydrin</b> {{can also}} be used to monitor deprotection in solid phase peptide {{synthesis}} (Kaiser Test). The chain is linked via its C-terminus to the solid support, with the N-terminus extending off it. When that nitrogen is deprotected, a <b>ninhydrin</b> test yields blue. Amino-acid residues are attached with their N-terminus protected, so if the next residue has been successfully coupled onto the chain, the test gives a colorless or yellow result.|$|E

50|$|A {{solution}} {{suspected of}} containing the ammonium ion {{can be tested}} by <b>ninhydrin</b> by dotting it onto a solid support (such as silica gel); treatment with <b>ninhydrin</b> should result in a dramatic purple color if the solution contains this species. In the analysis of a chemical reaction by thin layer chromatography (TLC), the reagent {{can also be used}} (usually 0.2% solution in either n-butanol or in ethanol). It will detect, on the TLC plate, virtually all amines, carbamates and also, after vigorous heating, amides.|$|E
50|$|When Dr. Pierce assumed {{leadership}} of the company, his objective was to transition the firm from its humble origins manufacturing chlorophyll to a manufacturer of fine organic chemicals. His goal came to fruition when, in 1950, he changed {{the name of the}} company to Pierce Chemical Company and his newly renamed company was the first commercial producer of <b>ninhydrin,</b> a chemical used in amino acid analysis. For the first several years, the company focused on producing and selling <b>ninhydrin,</b> but it soon began to expand its horizons and look for other products and markets.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, proline is {{the only}} amino acid that does not form a blue/purple colour when {{developed}} by spraying with <b>ninhydrin</b> for uses in chromatography. Proline, instead, produces an orange/yellow colour.|$|E
50|$|When <b>ninhydrin</b> {{reacts with}} amino acids, the {{reaction}} also releases CO2. The carbon in this CO2 originates from the carboxyl carbon of the amino acid. This reaction {{has been used}} to release the carboxyl carbons of bone collagen from ancient bones for stable isotope analysis in order to help reconstruct the palaeodiet of cave bears. Release of the carboxyl carbon (via <b>ninhydrin)</b> from amino acids recovered from soil that has been treated with a labeled substrate demonstrates assimilation of that substrate into microbial protein. This approach was successfully used to reveal that some ammonium oxidizing bacteria, also called nitrifying bacteria use urea as a carbon source in soil.|$|E
50|$|A triketone or trione is a {{molecule}} containing three ketone groups.Simple cyclic triketones include cyclopropanetrione, barbituric acid and the triazine cyanuric acid. Croconic acid also has hydroxy groups. In <b>ninhydrin</b> {{one of the}} ketone groups is normally hydrated.|$|E

50|$|A partial {{structure}} of bottromycin was reported {{shortly after the}} initial discovery of bottromycin. The first structural studies relied on traditional methods of analysis. Its peptide-like structure, including the presence of glycine and valine, was first suggested {{by a combination of}} acidic hydrolysis, acetylation, <b>ninhydrin</b> staining, and paper chromatography, among other experiments. The presence of a thiazole ring, along with an adjacent β-methylated phenylalanine, was established by <b>ninhydrin</b> staining, potassium permanganate oxidation, and comparison to synthetic standards. A methyl ester substituent was reported in 1958. The same study also reported that the Kunz hydrolysis product lacking a methyl ester was biologically inactive. Nakamura and colleagues later reported that bottromycin contained tert-leucine and cis-3-methylproline. They also proposed a linear iminohexapeptide structure.|$|E
50|$|Lawsone is {{hypothesized}} {{to undergo a}} reaction similar to Strecker synthesis in reactions with amino acids. Recent {{research has been conducted}} on lawsone's potential applications in the forensic science field. Since lawsone shows many similarities with <b>ninhydrin,</b> the current reagent for latent fingerprint development, studies have been conducted to see if lawsone can be used in this field. As of now the research is inconclusive, but optimistic. Lawsone non-specifically targets primary amino acids, and displays photoluminescence with forensic light sources. It has a characteristic purple/brown coloration as opposed to the purple/blue associated with ninhydrin.Lawsone shows promise as a reagent for fingerprint detection because of its photoluminescence maximized at 640nm, which is high enough that it avoids background interference common for <b>ninhydrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Millon's test is not {{specific}} for proteins (it detects phenolic compounds), and so must {{be confirmed by}} other tests for proteins such as the biuret test and the <b>ninhydrin</b> reaction.

5000|$|The PDP-8 is {{also used}} to control the {{temperature}} of the separation tube.

50|$|Tissue {{transaminase}} {{activities can}} be investigated by incubating a homogenate with various amino/keto acid pairs. Transamination is demonstrated if the corresponding new amino acid and keto acid are formed, as revealed by paper chromatography.
