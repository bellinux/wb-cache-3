5|$|Although {{it could}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> large air {{arm in the}} wider context of World War II, the ZNDH {{nonetheless}} had on its charge {{at one time or}} another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} thought to have diverged from a {{population}} of brown bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> species under some species concepts.|$|E

5|$|In June 1832 Yagan led a {{party of}} Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat {{alongside}} the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> criminal but {{a prisoner of war}} and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E

In 2014, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that one out of every six seniors in the U.S. who lived in their own home or apartment had FI. Men and women were equally affected. 45–50% of people with FI have severe physical and/or mental disabilities.|$|E
