In 1989, he joined with Missouri senator Kit Bond to form the Senate <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> Caucus, a {{coalition}} of senators committed to advancing <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> capabilities and readiness. Ford said he was motivated to form the caucus after seeing the work done by Mississippi Representative Sonny Montgomery with the <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> Association and the <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> Bureau. Ford co-chaired the caucus with Bond until Ford's retirement from the Senate in 1999. The Kentucky Army Guard dedicated the Wendell H. Ford Training Center in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky in 1998.

5|$|McNair had {{difficulty}} implementing {{a training program}} for <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the Secretary of War disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> senior commanders wanting; in his view, <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.|$|E
