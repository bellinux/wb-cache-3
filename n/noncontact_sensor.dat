40|$|International audienceIn plastic {{injection}} mould and prosthesis industries, "mirror-effect" polished surfaces {{are required for}} obtaining transparent parts or surfaces without scratches. Traditionally done manually, we have proposed to automate polishing on 5 -axis machining centre. One of the main advantages of automatic polishing is the repeatability of the machine movements {{in order to achieve}} confined form deviations. However, the material removal rate (MRR) during polishing depends on parameters such as contact pressure, velocity, tool path and tool wear. We have thus developed a virtual tool to model the effective MRR and choose the correct polishing parameters before any machining regarding the specified form deviation. After a brief review of MRR modeling in the literature, we present our approach to polish surfaces on 5 -axis milling centers as well as the simulation tool we have developed to predict the material removal rate.

40|$|With {{commercially viable}} global wind power potential, wind energy {{penetration}} is further expected to rise, as will the related problems. One {{issue is the}} collision of wind turbine blades with the tower during operation. Structured health monitoring is required to improve operational safety, {{minimize the risk of}} sudden failure or total breakdown, ensure reliable power generation, and reduce wind turbine life cycle costs. Large numbers of sensors such as fiber Bragg grating and piezoelectric devices have been attached to the structure, a design that is uneconomical and impractical for use in large wind turbines. This study proposes a single laser displacement sensor (LDS) system in which all of the rotating blades could be cost-effectively evaluated. Contrary to the approach of blade sensor installation, the LDS system is installed in the tower to enable noncontact blade displacement monitoring. The concept of a <b>noncontact</b> <b>sensor</b> and actuator and their energy delivery device installation in the tower will enable various approaches for wind turbine structural health monitoring.

40|$|Remote Sensing is the {{acquisition}} of information about an object without physical contact. In geomorphology, remote sensing often implies the collection of information from aerial platforms (e. g., airplanes, balloons or kites) or from spacecraft orbiting the earth. The term remote sensing is credited to Evelyn L. Pruitt and her staff in the United States Office of Naval Research. It was coined during the early 1960 s in recognition that instruments other than cameras and regions {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} outside those visible to the human eye and to which photographic film is sensitive were increasingly being used to image the earth. The current American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) definition of photogrammetry and remote sensing reads ‘the art, science, and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording, measuring, and interpreting imagery and digital representations of energy patterns derived from <b>noncontact</b> <b>sensor</b> systems ’ (Colwell 1997 : 3). While remote sensing will not replace the traditional geomorphic field study, the value of remote sensing to provide a synoptic overview of a landscape cannot be overlooked. Historically, the use of remote sensing in geomorphology has been mainly interpretive, enabling geomorphologists to develop a ‘mental picture ’ of the landscape and as a map-making aid (Hayden et al. 1986).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{instrument}} (the Purdue instrument) and the corresponding methodologies to measure the electrostatic charge development (chargeability) of dry powders when they are in dynamic contact with stainless steel surfaces. The system used an inductive <b>noncontact</b> <b>sensor</b> located inside an aluminum Faraday cage and was optimized to measure the charging capabilities of a fixed volume of powder (0. 5 cc). The chargeability of 5, 5 -diphenyl-hydantoin, calcium sulfate dihydrate, cimetidine, 3 grades of colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, 4 grades of microcrystalline cellulose, salicylic acid, sodium carbonate, sodium salicylate, spray-dried lactose, and sulfin-pyrazone were tested at 4 linear velocities, and the particle size distribution effect was assessed for 3 different grades of colloidal silicon dioxide and 4 different grades of micro-crystalline cellulose. The chargeability values exhibited a linear relationship for the range of velocities studied, with colloidal silicon dioxide exhibiting the maximum negative chargeability and with spray-dried lactose being the only compound to exhibit positive chargeability. The instrument sensitivity was improved by a factor of 2 over the first generation version, and the electrostatic charge measurements were reproducible with relative standard deviations ranging from nondetectable to 33. 7 % (minimum of 3 replicates).

40|$|Ultrasonics {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} method for detecting a variety of defects in gas transmission pipes including cracks, wall thinning and corrosion pits. The use of Lamb waves for the detection of defects and in situ process monitoring applications has been successfully pursued for many years [1 – 6]. The use of a laser-based ultrasound (LBU) inspection technique to detecti defects is attractive because of the potential for rapid inspection of large areas and because it is noncontact with large standoff distances. Owing to its noncontacting and remote nature, the LBU technique is being investigated as an alternative technology to piezoelectric transducers or electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for the rapid nondestructive inspection of pipelines. Currently, the preferred methods for introducing ultrasonic waves into the pipe are by using a piezoelectric transducer in a liquid-filled wheel or an EMAT. In field use, the wheel or the EMAT is attached to a moveable platform (known as a pig), which travels {{along the length of the}} transmission line. The wheel must maintain contact with the pipe wall during the inspection. Although the EMAT is a <b>noncontact</b> <b>sensor,</b> it must be operated close to the pipe’s surface. The contact and near-contact requirements can result in a loss of data when pipe irregularities such as dents or joints between sections cause the wheel or the EMAT to lift off from the surface of the pipe. The liquid-filled wheel uses longitudinal waves that propagate into the wall of the pipe. For a complete inspection of the pipe’s circumference, many wheels must be used. The EMAT generates a Lamb wave in the wall of the pipe that can be directed either circumferentially or axially along the pipe. Although the LBU technique also uses Lamb waves, unlike EMAT systems, the detection sensitivity of the LBU system does not decrease with increased separation from the part. However, a potential difficulty for LBU techniques is that Lamb waves are a family of guided waves that exist in plate-like structures, and a large number of modes of vibration may coexist in a given plate thickness. A laser that has been focused to a spot or line represents a broadband Lamb wave source in both the temporal and spatial frequency domains, which leads to the simultaneous excitation of many modes. Consequently, LBU techniques for generating Lamb waves have generally been pursued only when the lowest order symmetric or asymmetric mode was needed, probably because these modes are generated and detected with the greatest efficiency and thus offer a de facto mode selection mechanism since these modes dominate the others that may be present. We previously demonstrated [7] a mechanism for efficiently generating and selecting a single Lamb wave mode using simulated arrays. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a laser array for the generation of Lamb waves. We also present some preliminary results of a study of the characteristics of Lamb wave modes to identify suitable modes for detecting defects in pipelines. The features that are important include the generation and detection efficiency of the Lamb wave modes, the mode’s energy distribution, and the velocity dispersion of the waves...|$|E
