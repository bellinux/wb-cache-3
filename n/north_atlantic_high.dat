40|$|Abstract. Caribbean {{rainfall}} {{is affected}} by climate variabil-ity of Pacific and Atlantic origin, e. g. the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, and variability in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>High</b> sea level pressure (SLP) center, respectively. During the lifetime of an ENS 0 cycle, the basin experiences dry and wet extremes. In {{the case of a}} warm event, the dry extreme precedes the mature ENS 0 phase, and can be explained in terms of a direct response to the atmospheric anomaly generated by the warm sea surface temperatures (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The wet extreme follows the mature phase, and is consistent with the lagged warming effect of ENS 0 on tropical North Atlantic SSTs. The wintertime state of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>High</b> is hypothe-sized to affect Caribbean rainfall through its effect on trop-ical SST. A strong <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>High</b> SLP center during the early months of the calendar year strengthens the trade winds, hence cooling SSTs in the tropical latitudes of the North Atlantic. The effect lingers on most noticeably until the start of the Caribbean rainy season, in May-June, when cool SSTs are associated with deficient rainfall in the basin...|$|E

50|$|A {{jet stream}} {{perturbation}} model is employed by Weather Logistics UK, which simulates {{the diversion of}} the air streams in the upper atmosphere. <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> air flow modelling is simulated by combining a monthly jet stream climatology input calculated at 20 to 30°W, with different blocking high patterns. The jet stream input is generated by thermal wind balance calculations at 316mbars (6 to 9 km aloft) in the mid-latitude range from 40 to 60°N. Long term blocking patterns {{are determined by the}} weather forecaster, who identifies the likely position and strength of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Highs</b> from synoptic charts, the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns. The model is based on the knowledge that low pressure systems at the surface are steered by the fast ribbons (jet streams) of air in the upper atmosphere. The jet stream - blocking interaction model simulation examines the sea surface temperature field using data from NOAA tracked along the ocean on a path to the British Isles. The principal theory suggests that long term weather patterns act on longer time scales, so large blocking patterns are thought to appear in a similar locations repeatedly over several months. With a good knowledge of blocking high patterns, the model performs with an impressive accuracy that is useful to the end user.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePV {{inversion}} {{techniques have}} been widely used in numerical studies of severe weather cases. These techniques can be applied as a way to study the sensitivity of the responsible meteorological system to changes in the initial conditions of the simulations. Dynamical effects of a collection of atmospheric features involved {{in the evolution of the}} system can be isolated. However, aspects, such as the definition of the atmospheric features or the amount of change in the initial conditions, are largely case-dependent and/or subjectively defined. An objective way to calculate the modification of the initial fields is proposed to alleviate this problem. The perturbations are quantified as the mean absolute variations of the total energy between the original and modified fields, and an unique energy variation value is fixed for all the perturbations derived from different PV anomalies. Thus, PV features of different dimensions and characteristics introduce the same net modification of the initial conditions from an energetic point of view. The devised quantification method is applied to study the high impact weather case of 9 ? 11 November 2001 in the Western Mediterranean basin, when a deep and strong cyclone was formed. On the Balearic Islands 4 people died, and sustained winds of 30 ms ? 1 and precipitation higher than 200 mm/ 24 h were recorded. Moreover, 700 people died in Algiers during the first phase of the event. The sensitivities to perturbations in the initial conditions of a deep upper level trough, the anticyclonic system related to the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>high</b> and the surface thermal anomaly related to the baroclinicity of the environment are determined.

40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study examines}} the circulation mechanisms of anomalously {{wet and dry}} years in the Amazon basin. Data sources include surface ship observations in the tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as various hydrometeorological indices in Amazonia during 1951 1983. Rainfall and river water level anomalies in northern Amazonia are associated with distinct circulation patterns in the tropical Atlantic, particularly at the March April peak of the rainy season. Thus, abundant rainfall in northern Amazonia and high Rio Negro water levels are accompanied by a strong <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>high,</b> steep meridional pressure gradient on its equatorward side, accelerated North-east trades, and cool surface waters in the tropical North Atlantic. The intensified North-east trades may entail enhanced boundary-layer moisture transport from the tropical North Atlantic into the Amazon basin.

40|$|The forcing {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the mid-Holocene onset of the Mediterranean-type climate in south-western Europe are currently unclear, but understanding these is critical for accurate climate projections under future greenhouse gas warming. Additionally, regional studies that present conflicting patterns for the onset and advancement of Mediterranean climatic conditions complicate definitively ascribing causality. Here, we use a new high resolution stalagmite density record obtained non-destructively using Computed Tomography (CT scanning) to reconstruct southern Iberian climate between 9. 3 and 2. 9 ka BP. We suggest that stalagmite density {{can be used as}} a water-excess proxy, with lower densities associated with more variable drip rates, possibly reflecting increased seasonality consistent with expectations from previous studies of speleothem textures and crystal fabrics. Our results reveal an early Holocene humid interval and mid-Holocene year-round aridity that preceded the onset of Mediterranean climate at 5. 3 ka BP in southern Iberia. Using this new dataset combined with previously published results, we link the gradual advancement of the Mediterranean climate to the southward migration of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Subtropical <b>High</b> induced by an orbitally driven decrease in Northern Hemisphere insolation. Future anthropogenic warming could result in a reversal of this trend, a northward migration of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Subtropical <b>High,</b> and a return to year-round aridity in south-western Europe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNitrogen {{fixation}} is {{an important}} yet still incompletely constrained component of the marine nitrogen cycle, particularly in the subsurface. A Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) survey in the subtropical <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> found <b>higher</b> than expected Trichodesmium colony abundances at depth, leading to the hypothesis that deep nitrogen fixation in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> may have been previously underestimated. Here, Trichodesmium colony abundances and modeled nitrogen fixation from VPR transects completed on two cruises in the tropical and subtropical <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> in fall 2010 and spring 2011 were used to evaluate that hypothesis. A bio-optical model was developed based on carbon-normalized nitrogen fixation rates measured on those cruises. Estimates of colony abundance and nitrogen fixation were similar in magnitude and vertical and geographical distribution to conventional estimates in a recently compiled climatology. Thus, in the mean, VPR-based estimates of volume-specific nitrogen fixation rates at depth in the tropical <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> were not inconsistent with estimates derived from conventional sampling methods. Based on this analysis, if Trichodesmium nitrogen fixation by colonies is underestimated, {{it is unlikely that}} it is due to underestimation of deep abundances by conventional sampling methods...|$|R
40|$|Palaeontological, geomorphological and sedimentological data {{supported}} by isotopic dating on Oxygen Isotopic Stage (OIS) 5 e deposits from the Spanish Mediterranean coast, are interpreted {{with the aim}} of reconstructing climatic instability in the Northern Hemisphere. Data point to marked climatic instability during the Last Interglacial (OIS 5 e), with a change in meteorological conditions and, consequently, in the sedimentary environment. The oolitic facies generated during the first part of OIS 5 e (ca. 135 kyr) shift into reddish conglomeratic facies during the second part (ca. 117 kyr). Sea surface Temperature (SST) and salinity are interpreted mainly on the basis of warm Senegalese fauna, which show chronological and spatial differential distribution throughout the Western Mediterranean. Present hydrological and meteorological conditions are used also as modern analogues to reconstruct climatic variability throughout the Last Interglacial, and this variability is interpreted within the wider framework of the North Atlantic record. All the available data indicate an increase in storminess induced by an increase in the influence of northwesterlies, a slight drop of SST in the northern Western Mediterranean, and an important change in meteorological conditions at the end of OIS 5 e (117 kyr). These changes correlate well with the decrease in summer insolation and with the climatic instability recorded in <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>high</b> latitudes...|$|E

Implantable archival tags (n = 561) were deployed in bluefin tuna from 1996 to 2005 and 106 tags were recovered. Movement paths of the fish were reconstructed using light level and sea-surface-temperature-based geolocation estimates. To quantify habitat utilization we employed a weighted kernel estimation technique that removed the biases of deployment location and track length. Throughout the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>high</b> residence times (167 +/- 33 days) were identified in four spatially confined regions on a seasonal scale. Within each region, bluefin tuna experienced distinct temperature regimes and displayed different diving behaviors. The mean diving depths within the high-use areas were significantly shallower and the dive frequency and the variance in internal temperature significantly higher than during transit movements between the high-use areas. Residence time in the more northern latitude high-use areas was significantly correlated with levels of primary productivity. The regions of aggregation are associated with areas of abundant prey and potentially represent critical foraging habitats that have seasonally abundant prey. Throughout the North Atlantic mean diving depth was significantly correlated with the depth of the thermocline, and dive behavior changed in relation to the stratification of the water column. In this study, with numerous multi-year tracks, there appear to be repeatable patterns of clear aggregation areas that potentially are changing with environmental conditions. The high concentrations of bluefin tuna in predictable locations indicate that Atlantic bluefin tuna are vulnerable to concentrated fishing efforts in the regions of foraging aggregations...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{expanded}} and clay-enriched interval following the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~ 55. 8 Ma) at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 401 (eastern <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic),</b> <b>high</b> abundances of well-preserved biserial planktic foraminifera such as Zeauvigerina aegyptiaca and Chiloguembelina spp. occur. The paleoecological preferences of these taxa are only poorly constrained, largely because existing records are patchy {{in time and}} space. The thin-walled Z. aegyptiaca is usually rather small (< 125 μm) and thus prone to recrystallization and dissolution; stable isotopes measurements are therefore virtually non-existent. A comparative stable isotope (δ 13 C and δ 18 O) study of well-preserved specimens of Z. aegyptiaca and several planktic foraminiferal species (Morozovella subbotinae, Subbotina patagonica, Chiloguembelina wilcoxensis) enabled us to determine the preferred depth habitat and mode of life for Z. aegyptiaca. Oxygen isotope values of Z. aegyptiaca range from - 1. 57 ‰ to - 2. 07 ‰ and overlap with those of M. subbotinae indicating that their habitat is (1) definitely planktic, which has been questioned by some earlier isotopic studies, and (2) probably within the lower surface mixed layer. Carbon isotope ratios range from 0. 99 ‰ to 1. 34 ‰ and are distinctly lower than values for non-biserial planktic species. This may indicate isotopic disequilibrium between ambient seawater and the calcareous tests of Z. aegyptiaca, which we relate to vital effects and to its opportunistic behavior. The observed isotopic signal of Z. aegyptiaca relative to the other planktic foraminiferal species is highly similar to many other microperforate bi- and triserial planktic genera that have appeared through geological time such as Heterohelix, Guembelitria, Chiloguembelina, Streptochilus and Gallitellia and we suggest that Z. aegyptiaca shares a similar ecology and habitat. Thus, {{in order for the}} opportunistic Z. aegyptiaca to bloom during the aftermath of the PETM, we assume that at that time, the surface waters at Site 401 were influenced by increased terrestrial run-off and nutrient availability. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Organic carbon fluxes {{through the}} sediment/water {{interface}} in the high-latitude North Atlantic have been calculated from oxygen microprofiles. A wire-operated in situ oxygen bottom profiler was deployed, and oxygen profiles were also measured on board (ex situ). Diffusive oxygen fluxes, obtained by fitting exponential functions to the oxygen profiles, were translated into organic carbon fluxes and organic carbon degradation rates. The mean Corg input to the abyssal plain sediments of the Norwegian and Greenland Seas {{was found to}} be 1. 9 mgCm- 2 d- 1. Typical values at the seasonally ice-covered East Greenland continental margin lay between 1. 3 and 10. 9 mgCm- 2 d- 1 (mean 3. 7 mgCm- 2 d- 1), whereas fluxes on the East Greenland shelf are considerably higher, with 9. 1 to 22. 5 mgCm- 2 d- 1. On the Norwegian continental slope Corg fluxes of 3. 3 to 13. 9 mgCm- 2 d- 1 (mean 6. 5 mgCm- 2 d- 1) were found. Fluxes are considerably higher here compared to stations on the East Greenland slope at similar water depths. By repeatedly occupying three sites off southern Norway in 1997 the temporal variability of diffusive O 2 fluxes {{was found to be}} quite low. The seasonal signal of primary and export production from the upper water column appears to be strongly dampened at the seafloor. Degradation rates of 0. 004 to 1. 1 mgCcm- 3 a- 1 at the sediment surface were calculated from oxygen profiles. First-order degradation constants, obtained from Corg degradation rates and sediment organic carbon content, are in the range of 0. 03 to 0. 6 a- 1. Thus, the corresponding mean lifetime of organic carbon lies between 1. 7 and 33. 2 years, which also suggests that seasonal variations in Corg flux are small. The data presented here characterize the Norwegian and Greenland Seas as oligotrophic and relatively low organic carbon deep-sea environments.

40|$|Certain {{variables}} suspected {{to influence}} {{the behavior of the}} Sargassum Migratory Loop System (SMLS) were examined using Robert Webster?s Development and Implementation of Sargassum Early Advisory System (SEAS). This analysis of the SMLS during the 2014 and 2015 Sargassum seasons was conducted as a case study to assign quantifiable weights to the behavioral characteristics of the SMLS. In 2014, Galveston, Texas experienced the largest landing of Sargassum in recorded history; in stark contrast it received practically no landings in 2015. The nations in the Caribbean Sea experienced an exceptionally large influx of Sargassum during the 2015 season. Based on the observations, it was theorized that among the causative factors for Texas were twenty-six cold fronts that occurred on the Upper Texas Coast in 2014, which held the Sargassum offshore in the nutrient-rich waters of the Gulf of Mexico. This period of suspension afforded the biomass an extended period of growth before landing. Similarly, in 2015 sustained southward fluctuations of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>high</b> pressure system forced Sargassum into contact with the nutrient-rich waters of the Orinoco and Amazon flood waters, thus producing enhanced growth of the Sargassum and its containment in the Caribbean Sea. Both of these instances involved specific atmospheric drivers influencing the flow of the Sargassum as it made its way through the SMLS. The areas the Sargassum was suspended in were high in nutrients due to the flushing of runoff from nearby shores. The annual flooding of the Amazon and Orinoco create a plume of neritic water that has been shown to cause increased growth as the Sargassum pass through that portion of the SMLS. The Gulf of Mexico, particularly the area known as the Bay of Campeche is so nutrient-rich that it has been thought to be the source of Sargassum. For this case study the relevant factors include a combination of atmospheric forces known as teleconnection patterns, oceanic currents, and nutrient availability. A greater understanding of the relationship between these variables in the SMLS is a natural and necessary step. The extreme differences in the Sargassum landings between the 2014 and 2015 Sargassum seasons point to which variables drive the Sargassum?s movement to the greatest extent. Analyzing the relationship has increased forecasting accuracy and helps explain why particular seasons are seemingly incongruent with the current understanding of the causes...|$|E
40|$|Climate change happens {{naturally}} and {{the earth}} has been cooling and warming since it was formed. These climate changes have {{a direct impact on}} the physical makeup of the marine environment which in turn has a major impact on the ecosystems of the world’s oceans. The Arctic Ocean has a major influence on the North Atlantic Ocean and the formation and melting of ice sheets in the Arctic effect the North Atlantic Ocean in a number of ways. The Arctic Ocean is currently in a warming period causing ice sheets to melt. Melting ice sheets can affect the salinity, temperature, and ocean circulation of the Arctic Ocean as well as the North Atlantic Ocean. These physical changes in the ocean waters affect the ecological makeup of the area. Zooplankton and fish distribution and abundance are affected by the physical factors influenced by climate change. Regime changes in both the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic Ocean have been observed in the recent past and have been connected with physical factors in the marine environment directly influenced by changes in climate. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a way of measuring areas of high and low wintertime surface pressure at two different points in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Icelandic Low pressure system in the north and the Azores High pressure system in the south. The NAO varies decade to decade and sometimes changes yearly. It effects the wind and water movement in the North Atlantic Ocean and has an inverse effect from the Northwest to Northeast Atlantic Ocean. It is a major influence on the physical makeup of the marine environment in the North Atlantic Ocean as well as the ecosystem in the area. Depending on the pressures at each location, the NAO alternates between positive and negative periods. These positive and negative periods have associated climactic responses that have been observed and documented for well over a century. When the NOAI is in a positive phase there is strong wind circulation from the Northwest in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>high</b> atmospheric and sea temperatures in currents off the western coast of Europe and low temperatures along the east coast of Canada. Different environmental responses are experienced in the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic in response to the NAO and have a direct influence and impact on the marine ecosystem in the areas.

40|$|The role of wind stress curl (WSC) forcing in the {{observed}} interannual variability of the Florida Current (FC) transport is investigated. Evidence is provided for baroclinic adjustment {{as a physical}} mechanism linking interannual changes in WSC forcing {{and changes in the}} circulation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> subtropical gyre. A continuous monthly time series of FC transport is constructed using daily transports estimated from undersea telephone cables near 278 N in the Straits of Florida. This 25 -yr-long time series is linearly regressed against interannual WSC variability derived from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis. The results indicate that a substantial fraction of the FC transport variability at 3 – 12 -yr periods is explained by low-frequency WSC variations. A lagged regression analysis is performed to explore hypothetical adjustment times of the wind-driven circulation. The estimated lag times are at least 2 times faster than those predicted by linear beta-plane planetary wave theory. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed within the context of recent observational and theoretical developments. The results are then linked with earlier findings of a low-frequency anticorrelation between FC transport and the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation (NAO) index, showing that this relationship could result from the positive (negative) WSC anomalies that develop between 208 and 308 N in the western <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> during <b>high</b> (low) NAO phases. Ultimately, {{the observed}} role of wind forcing on the interannual variability of the FC could represent a benchmark for current efforts to monitor and predict the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> circulation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} {{and size}} distributions of small (~ 200 nm) colloids were measured at three {{stations in the}} <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and two stations in the Southern Ocean. The stations were chosen to cover a range of occanographically distinct rcgimcs, from highly productive nearshore environments to oligotrophic open-ocean waters. Colloid number concentrations decreased appreciably from the surface to- 150 -m depth at three of these stations. Concentrations in deep waters of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> were <b>high</b> but erratic, suggesting that colloid abundance is regulated by rapid rates of reactions. The colloids were mainly organic and their immediate sources appear to include both autotrophic and heterotrophic activity as well as sediment resuspension. Transmission clcctron microscope examination of colloid size distributions and morphology indicates that aggregation is the principal removal mechanism for these colloids. Evidence from the cumulative size spectra of small colloids indicates that colloid aggregation is most intense in vertically delineated zones near the surface, around the main thermocline (- l,OOO- 1, 500 m), and in bottom waters. These findings show that the marine colloidal state is abundant but discontinuous in both space and time throughout {{a wide range of}} oceanographic environments. Marine colloids are attracting increasing in...|$|R

Also, costs to operate ships were increasing, mostly due to prices of crude oil. [...] Thus, the new ship would be larger than the Ile, but smaller and cheaper to operate than the Normandie. She would also only be a two-class liner, which would, like the recently built , {{be able to be}} converted from a segregated, class restricted crossing mode to a unified, classless cruising mode, thereby allowing the ship to be more versatile in its operations. Despite these requirements, she was still to be the longest ship ever built, as well as one of the fastest, meaning not only an advanced propulsion system, but also a hull design which would withstand the rigours of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> at <b>high</b> speed.|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} {{context is}} the following. Recent numerical simulations ([5], [6]) {{have investigated the}} impact of high horizontal resolution (up to 1 / 64 th degree) on the oceanic cir-culation in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> Such <b>high</b> resolution leads to {{an explosion in the}} number and strength of mesoscale (O(100 km)) and small-scale (O(10 km)) eddies and fronts in all oceanic regions, with a resulting eddy kinetic energy increase by a factor of 10 when compared with a resolution of 1 / 6 th degree. This strong eddy kinetic energy increase and the qualitative nature of the mesoscale structures that emerge (involving coherent vortices as small as 10 km) are consistent with recent satellite and in-situ observations ([7], [8]). However, because of computer resource limitations, these simulations have a poor resolution in the vertical (6 layers at most). As a consequence some important dynamical features...|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and its {{possible}} change during the Holocene are {{examined in this}} study, using long-term simulations of the Earth system model COSMOS. A quasi-persistent ~ 55 - to 80 -year cycle characterizing in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sea surface temperature, is highly associated with the multidecadal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the Holocene. This mode can be found throughout the Holocene, indicating that the AMO is dominated by internal climate variability. Stronger-than-normal AMOC results in warmer-than-normal surface temperature, spreading over almost the whole North Hemisphere, in particular the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean. During the warm phase of the AMO, more precipitation is detected in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> low and <b>high</b> latitudes. It also generates a dipolar seesaw pattern in the sea ice anomaly. The results reveal that {{the influence of the}} AMO can be amplified by a more vigorous AMOC variability during the early Holocene {{in the presence of a}} remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and when freshwater entered the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean. This conclusion could have potential application for the past AMO reconstruction and the future AMO estimation...|$|R
40|$|Models {{indicate}} that a complete shutdown of deep and intermediate water production is a possible consequence of extreme climate conditions in the northern <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> and the <b>high</b> ratio of 231 Pa to 230 Th on Bermuda Rise is evidence that this might have happened ? 17 ka during Heinrich event 1 (H 1). However, new radiocarbon data from bivalves that lived at ? 4. 6 km on the Bermuda Rise during H 1 lead to a different conclusion. The bivalve data do indeed indicate ventilation of the deep western <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> was suppressed during H 1 {{but not as much}} as it was during the last glacial maximum. We propose that high diatom flux to the Bermuda Rise during H 1 is at least in part responsible for increased 231 Pa/ 230 Th at that time. Although we cannot say for sure why opal production was so high in a gyre center location at that time, increased leakage of silica rich waters from the Southern Ocean to the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> is one possibility...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAll {{climate models}} predict a {{freshening}} of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> at <b>high</b> latitude that may induce an abrupt {{change of the}} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (hereafter AMOC) if it resides in the bistable regime, where both a strong and a weak state coexist. The latter remains uncertain {{as there is no}} consensus among observations and ocean reanalyses, where the AMOC is bistable, versus most climate models that reproduce a mono-stable strong AMOC. A series of four hindcast simulations of the global ocean at 1 / 12 ° resolution, which is presently unique, are used to diagnose freshwater transport by the AMOC in the South Atlantic, an indicator of AMOC bistability. In all simulations, the AMOC resides in the bistable regime: it exports freshwater southward in the South Atlantic, implying a positive salt advection feedback that would act to amplify a decreasing trend in subarctic deep water formation as projected in climate scenarios...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{objective of}} Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 65 was to study crustal accretion at an ocean ridge axis with an intermediate-spreading rate for comparison with previously studied sections displaying slowand fast-spreading rates. The southern Gulf of California {{was selected for}} this purpose because the basement displays high seismic velocities (comparable to those observed for Cretaceous basement in the western <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic)</b> and <b>high</b> ambient sedimentation rates, which facilitated penetration of zero-age basement. Four sites were drilled, forming an axial transect immediately south of the Tamayo Fracture Zone (Figs. 1 and 2) and providing a series of characteristic sections into the crust. This chapter attempts to provide a brief synthesis of the results from Leg 65, focusing particularly on the lithology, geochemistry, and paleomagnetic properties of the cored basement material.
