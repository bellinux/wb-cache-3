50|$|Chloramine {{has become}} a popular {{disinfectant}} in the US, {{and it has been}} found to produce <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA),</b> which is a possible human carcinogen, as well as highly genotoxic iodinated DBPs, such as iodoacetic acid, when iodide is present in source waters.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} is that chlorine forms many byproducts, including trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAA), whereas chloramine forms a significantly lower amount of THMs and HAAs but also forms <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA).</b> One of the principal benefits of chloramine is that its use reduces the overall levels of these regulated contaminants compared to chlorine.|$|E

50|$|<b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA),</b> {{also known}} as {{dimethylnitrosamine}} (DMN), is a semi-volatile organic chemical, produced as by-product of several industrial processes and present at very low levels in certain foodstuffs, especially those cooked, smoked, or cured. NDMA is water-soluble, colorless, and its taste and odor are weak or absent. It is toxic to the liver and other organs, and is a suspected human carcinogen.|$|E

Groundwater contamination was first found through well sampling in 1979. Contaminants include high levels of volatile organic compounds such as perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE), perchlorate, 1,4-dioxane, and <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA).</b> More than 100 facilities are identified as contributors to this contamination in Irwindale, mainly through improper disposal and handling of chemicals over the years.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{discussion}} about chloramine has focused on <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA),</b> and {{it is critical to}} distinguish between chloramine and NDMA. NDMA can be a byproduct of chloramination or chlorination, but drinking water is not a major source of exposure to NDMA. The biggest sources of human exposure to NDMA are tobacco smoke, chewing tobacco, bacon and other cured meats, beer, fish, cheese, toiletries, shampoos, cleansers, interior air of cars, and household pesticides. In addition, NDMA can form in the stomach during digestion of foods or drugs that contain alkylamines, which are naturally occurring compounds.|$|E
50|$|In the USA, San Diego, California is {{the leading}} state {{implementing}} IPR. MF, RO and UV/H2O2 are employed prior to groundwater replenishment with the treated effluents (CDPH, 2013). In San Diego, the effort to increase the share of recycled water was rekindled with an extensive study in 2006. MF provides substantial removal of the dissolved effluent organic matter (dEfOM), while dEfOM reduction down to 0.5 mg/L (in terms of TOC) is achieved through RO application. The chemical oxidation treatment (UV/H2O2) following the membrane steps, results in the mitigation of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA),</b> {{as well as in}} the improvement of the effluent quality with respect to its organic content.|$|E
50|$|Aerojet's manufacture, {{testing and}} {{disposal}} methods led to toxic contamination {{of both the}} land and groundwater in the Rancho Cordova area, leading to the designation of a Superfund site. Solvents such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and chloroform and rocket fuel by-products such as <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA)</b> and perchlorate were discovered in drinking water wells near Aerojet in 1979. Since then, two State agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency {{have been working with}} Aerojet to ensure that the company cleans up pollution caused by its operations at the site. Under state and federal enforcement orders, Aerojet installed several systems on the borders of its property to pump out and treat contaminated groundwater. Aerojet has also conducted a number of removal actions for onsite soils, liquids, and sludges. In 2003, groundwater sampling data revealed a plume of contamination extending northwest under Carmichael.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that certain disinfection practices may result {{in the formation of}} significant amounts of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA),</b> and quite likely other nitroso compounds in drinking water. These compounds are believed formed when chlorine is added to water containing ammonia, and certain organic nitrogen compounds ("precursors"). Measurements in several drinking water distribution systems suggest that unprotected sources receiving point and non-point waste discharges are particularly susceptible to their formation, especially when chloramination is practiced. The formation of NDMA and possibly other nitroso compounds in drinking water is an emerging concern because they are generally carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic (Loeppky et al., 1994; O'Neill et al., 1984). For example, the nitrosamine, <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine,</b> <b>NDMA</b> (CH 3) 2 NNO) is a particularly potent carcinogen. Risk assessments from California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and US EPA identify lifetime de minimis (i. e., 10 - 6) risk levels of cancer from NDMA exposures as 0. 002 ppb (2 ng/L) and 0. 0007 ppb, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 The {{cleanliness}} {{of water}} is a major issue with regards to humanity's continued survival. The chlorination and chloro-amination {{of water is}} essential to the creation of microbiologically clean water. However these processes also give rise to oxidative byproducts such as nitrosamines. In particular, due to its high toxicity, <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA)</b> is of high concern for many communities. As a consequence, the destruction of small concentration of NDMA from drinking water can be considered a priority. This work investigates the degradation of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA)</b> through experimentation in a microreactor and develops a computational model based on the results. The microreactor developed for this study was a 2 cm in length, 1 cm in width and 200 µm deep microchannel. One of the walls of the microreactor was coated with TiO₂, a semi-conductor photo-catalyst, and activated through the use of lower energy UV-A light. Reactor effluent was characterized using a cationic and anionic ion chromatograph.

40|$|Rhodococci {{are common}} soil heterotrophs that possess diverse {{functional}} enzymatic activities with economic and ecological significance. In this study, {{the correlation between}} gene expression and biological removal of the water contaminant <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA)</b> is explored. NDMA is a hydrophilic, potent carcinogen that has gained recent notoriety due to its environmental persistence and emergence as a widespread micropollutant in the subsurface environment. In this study, we demonstrate that Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA 1 can constitutively degrade NDMA and that activity toward this compound is enhanced by approximately 500 -fold after growth on propane. Transcriptomic analysis of RHA 1 and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR assays demonstrate that growth on propane elicits the upregulation of gene clusters associated with (i) the oxidation of propane and (ii) the oxidation of substituted benzenes. Deletion mutagenesis of prmA, the gene encoding the large hydroxylase component of propane monooxygenase, abolished both growth on propane and removal of NDMA. These results demonstrate that propane monooxygenase is responsible for NDMA degradation by RHA 1 and explain the enhanced cometabolic degradation of NDMA {{in the presence of}} propane. Recently recognized as a drinking water contaminant (19), <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA)</b> is now closely monitored by municipal water providers to minimize human exposure (3, 6...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} engineered nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a source and precursor for disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. The {{aim of this study}} was to extend previous research of CNTs by investigating the potential for other classes of CNTs to generate disinfection byproducts (DBP) during chlorination. We examined particular types of CNTs with surface groups analogous to suspected model precursors for DBP formation. Specifically, we conducted experiments to determine the formation of haloacetic acids (HAAs) and <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA)</b> via the chlorination of carbon nanotubes. Polymer coated CNTs generated the greatest total HAA concentration of up to 170 μg-HAA/mg-CNT. Results showed that the presence of surface oxide groups (e. g. surface carboxylic acid groups) promotes HAA formation. We observed a reasonably strong correlation between the extent of HAA formation and the concentration of surface oxygen on the CNT surface. Results also showed that CNTs behave similar to model precursors for di- and trichloroacetic acid formation (DCAA and TCAA, respectively). Nitrogen containing CNTs have been shown as source of <b>N-nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA).</b> Surprisingly, CS PEG, which does not contain N, produces NDMA when reacted with ethylenediamine (EDA). Ultimately, EDA is contributing N to CS PEG by sorbing to the CNT surface, which is the likely source of N for NDMA formation. At lower EDA concentrations, NDMA production is limited by available EDA. Conversely, at higher EDA concentrations, NDMA production is limited by available chlorine that is in competition with EDA and the CNT surface...|$|E

Because of the relatively high concentrations of NDMA formed during wastewater chlorination, the intentional and unintentional reuse of municipal wastewater is a particularly important area of concern. Although ultraviolet (UV) treatment can effectively remove NDMA, there is considerable interest in the development of less expensive alternative treatment technologies.
