40|$|This paper {{concerns}} both rhythm {{recognition and}} tempo analysis of expressive music performance {{based on a}} probabilistic approach. In rhythm recognition, the modern continuous speech recognition technique is applied {{to find the most}} likely intended note sequence from the given sequence of fluctuating note durations in the performance. Combining stochastic models of note durations deviating from the <b>nominal</b> <b>lengths</b> and a probabilistic grammar representing possible sequences of notes, the problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation that can be implemented using efficient search based on the Viterbi algorithm. With this, significant improvements compared with conventional “quantization ” techniques were found. Tempo analysis is performed by fitting the observed tempo with parametric tempo curves in order to extract tempo dynamics and characteristics of performance to use. Tempo-change timings and parameter values in tempo curve models are estimated through the segmental k-means algorithm. Experimental results of rhythm recognition and tempo analysis applied to classical and popular music performances are also demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Zero length quantum wires (or point contacts) exhibit unexplained {{conductance}} structure {{close to}} 0. 7 × 2 e 2 /h {{in the absence}} of an applied magnetic field. We have studied the density- and temperature-dependent conductance of ultra-low-disorder GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires with <b>nominal</b> <b>lengths</b> l = 0 and 2 µm, fabricated from structures free of the disorder associated with modulation doping. In a direct comparision we observe structure near 0. 7 × 2 e 2 /h for l = 0, whereas the l = 2 µm wires show structure evolving with increasing electron density to 0. 5 × 2 e 2 /h in zero magnetic field, the value expected for an ideal spin-split sub-band. Our results suggest the dominant mechanism through which electrons interact can be strongly affected by the length of the 1 D region. A one-dimensional (1 D) quantum wire may be produced by constricting a two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) formed at the GaAs/AlGaAs interface in a semi-conductor heterojunction.

40|$|Collimator wakefields in the Beam Delivery System (BDS) {{of future}} linear colliders, {{such as the}} International Linear Collider (ILC) [1] and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) [2], can be an {{important}} source of emittance growth and beam jitter amplification, consequently degrading the luminosity. Therefore, a better understanding of collimator wakefield effects is essential to optimise the collimation systems of future linear colliders in order to minimise wakefield effects. In the past, measurements of single-bunch collimator wakefields have been carried out at SLAC [3, 4, 5, 6] with the aim of benchmarking theory, nu-merical calculations and experiments. Those studies revealed some discrepan-cies between the measurements and the theoretical models. New experimental tests using available beam test facilities, such as the End Station A Test Beam (ESTB) at SLAC [7], would help to improve our understanding on collimator wakefields. ESTB will provide the perfect test bed to investigate collimator wakefields for different bunch length conditions, relevant for both ILC (300 µm <b>nominal</b> bunch <b>length)</b> and CLIC (44 µm <b>nominal</b> bunch <b>length)</b> studies.
