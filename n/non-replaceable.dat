This was the only system to operate on DC, since reliability proved inferior to the AC systems. The Type 9500 system was not used on any other models, and was discontinued after Osram's takeover of Sylvania in 1997. All HID headlamps worldwide presently use the standardised AC-operated bulbs and ballasts.

50|$|Although Apple {{had hoped}} that the IIc would outsell the IIe, the latter was more popular because of its slots. The IIGS {{supports}} both 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppy disks and, like the IIe before it, has several expansion slots.

The IIGS, like the IIc, also has dedicated ports for external devices. These include a port to attach even more floppy disk drives, two serial ports for devices such as printers and modems (which can also be used to connect to a LocalTalk network), an Apple Desktop Bus port to connect the keyboard and mouse, and composite and RGB video ports. These ports are associated with the slots, so for example using a card in slot 1 means that the printer port is disabled.

50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a dummy bar (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the dummy bar once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a <b>non-replaceable</b> component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|E

40|$|Feature {{selection}} {{is one of}} the most prominent learning tasks, especially in high-dimensional datasets in which the goal is to understand the mechanisms that underly the learning dataset. However most of them typically deliver just a flat set of relevant features and provide no further information on what kind of structures, e. g. feature groupings, might underly the set of relevant features. In this paper we propose a new learning paradigm in which our goal is to uncover the structures that underly the set of relevant features for a given learning problem. We uncover two types of features sets, <b>non-replaceable</b> features that contain important information about the target variable and cannot be replaced by other features, and functionally similar features sets that can be used interchangeably in learned models, given the presence of the <b>non-replaceable</b> features, with no change in the predictive performance. To do so we propose a new learning algorithm that learns a number of disjoint models using a model disjointness regularization constraint together with a constraint on the predictive agreement of the disjoint models. We explore the behavior of our approach on a number of high-dimensional datasets, and show that, as expected by their construction, these satisfy a number of properties. Namely, model disjointness, a high predictive agreement, and a similar predictive performance to models learned on the full set of relevant features. The ability to structure the set of relevant features in such a manner can become a valuable tool in different applications of scientific knowledge discovery...|$|E

The advantage of using such hub proteins as drug targets lies in their essentiality, <b>non-replaceable</b> position in the PIN and lower rate of mutation, which can help to counter bacterial resistance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} developing inspection schedules to detect non-self- announcing events {{which can only}} detected by inspections. Failures of protective sys- tems,such as electronic equipments, alarms and stand-by systems, incipient failures {{and the emergence of}} certain medical diseases are examples of such events. Inspec- tions are performed at pre-determined times to detect whether or not the event has occurred, and necessary actions are taken upon the detection. In this research, my interest is in developing effective inspection schedules to detect non-self-announcing events that balance system downtime and inspection effort. To evaluate the quality of an inspection schedule, I use the availability (for re- placeable) and the detection delay (for <b>non-replaceable</b> systems) as performance mea- sures. When the monetary cost of inspection and the cost of delay are difficult to determine, non-monetary performance measures become more meaningful. In this research, the focus is on maximizing availability or minimizing detection delay given a limited number of inspections or a limited inspection rate. I show that for replace- able and <b>non-replaceable</b> systems, it is possible to construct inspection schedules that perform better than periodic inspection with respect to our performance measures. The occurrence of the event I would like to detect may be influenced by certain individual characteristics. For instance, the risk of developing a certain type of dis- ease might be different for different subgroups within the population. In this case, because of the non-homogeneity in the population, benefits of performing screening tests may not be fully achieved for each sub-group by using an inspection strategy developed for the entire population. Thus, it may be of value for an individual to learn more information about his/her likehood to have the disease. To address this issue, I analyze the change in the expected delay if schedules are based on the whole population information or the individual information and provide numerical results...|$|E

Customer equity has traditionally been seen as the discounted sum of the lifetime earnings from all current and future customers and thus it has been largely assumed that maximizing customer lifetime value would lead to maximum customer equity.

Although the CLV model is appropriate for managing a single <b>non-replaceable</b> customer, {{the application of a}} CLV model to the acquisition and valuation of customers as an ongoing concern for the firm leads to sub-optimal customer relationship management and acquisition strategies.
