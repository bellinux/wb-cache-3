500|$|Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally {{inactive}} for the 2004–05 season, {{using the}} time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last [...] "a year-and-a-half [...] two years," [...] as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from 10 different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Four days later, he was officially introduced {{as a member of}} the Predators at a news conference. Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as [...] "unquestionably the biggest signing in [...] club's history." [...] He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier League-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized league rules, stating, [...] "As an offensive player, I'm going through the neutral zone, and I have a player tugging me the whole way. If I don't go down, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> call because they are not going to make the call." [...] Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.|$|E

2500|$|Karl Joseph Schneider (15 August 1905 [...] 25 September 1928) was a cricketer {{who played}} for Victoria and South Australia. A tiny man at just 157cm tall, {{he was born in}} the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn and was a {{specialist}} left-hand batsman who occasionally bowled right-arm wrist spin. Schneider showed precocious talent as a schoolboy player and was selected for his first-class debut as a 17-year-old while attending Xavier College, Melbourne. Batting at number eight, he contributed 55 runs to Victoria's (then) world record total of 1059, against Tasmania. Despite this promising start, Schneider had to wait two years for another opportunity and he eventually relocated to Adelaide in 1926 when it became obvious that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> regular place in the strong Victorian batting line-up. Schneider was also a noted footballer and he joined the Norwood Football Club on his move to Adelaide.|$|E
2500|$|This {{being the}} first stage after the Pyrenees, many riders were hoping to get an easy day, sitting {{at the back of}} the peloton; however, there were also a lot of riders who had lost a lot of time during those {{mountain}} stages and who knew that they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good position in the general standings. Those riders all tried to get into the escape group which led to everyone chasing everyone for the first 100 kilometers and an extremely fast pace which caused the first riders already passing the 46-kilometre mark after just one hour. As a result, 4 riders dropped from the race during the first hour; among those were Paolo Savoldelli and Benjamín Noval from [...] and the sprinter Isaac Gálvez. Another important fact for the large number of riders trying to escape was the fact that it was the 14 July, in France known as Bastille Day. On this day the French are extra motivated as it is their national holiday, which shows in the results of the latest years with David Moncoutié winning in 2005 and Richard Virenque in 2004 on this day.|$|E
2500|$|During {{its opening}} weekend, After Earth took in $27.5 million in box office {{receipts}} in North America and $2.5M in South Korea. Sony Pictures projected a launch of around $38 million, but the actual number was 17% lower than the lowest pre-release expectation of $33 million. It finished in third place behind Fast & Furious 6, an action film, and Now You See Me, a caper film. Taking into account the popularity of principal actor Will Smith, the disappointing finish led The Wall Street Journal {{to call it a}} [...] "flop". Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo noted the $27 million weekend placed it between two sci-fi flops of 2012 films with 200 million-plus budgets, Battleship ($25.5 million) and John Carter ($30.2 million), and also drew half of the co-stars' previous openings, Will Smith's Men in Black 3 ($54.6 million) and Jaden Smith's The Karate Kid ($55.7 million). Scott Mendelson from Forbes argued that Sony made a mistake of hiding M. Night Shyamalan as they promoted the film because for better or worse, the general public knows who he is and [...] "His name on the marquee reflects that you’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> conventional genre film, that there may be something else up its sleeve." ...|$|E

5000|$|As a result, {{the desired}} premium pricing {{for the new}} {{technology}} was harder to achieve, and capacity had shifted to other sectors.

Kenneth Bancroft Clark and Mamie Phipps Clark approached social service agencies in New York City to urge them to expand their programs to provide social work, psychological evaluation, and remediation for youth in Harlem.

[...] Some other reviews were less positive. Publishers Weekly called the book [...] "derivative and unpolished". [...] Elizabeth Day in The Guardian said the book was a [...] "disappointment" [...] and that Oates had not succeeded in her effort to rework the themes of Lolita.
