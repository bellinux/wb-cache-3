5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the <b>need</b> <b>on</b> the part of the government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{was planned}} in the 1930s to improve {{transportation}} across the Appalachian Mountains of central Pennsylvania. It used seven tunnels bored for the abandoned South Pennsylvania Railroad project during the 1880s. The highway opened on October 1, 1940 between Irwin and Carlisle {{as the first}} long-distance controlled-access highway in the United States. Following its completion, other toll roads and the Interstate Highway System were built. The highway was extended east to Valley Forge in 1950, and west to the Ohio border in 1951. It was completed at the New Jersey border (the Delaware River) in 1954; the Delaware River Bridge opened two years later. During the 1960s, the entire highway was expanded to four lanes by adding a second tube at four of the tunnels and bypassing the other three. Other improvements have been made, including the addition of interchanges, the widening of portions of the highway to six lanes and {{the reconstruction of the}} original section. An interchange is planned at I-95 to meet a <b>need</b> <b>on</b> that route.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the <b>need</b> <b>on</b> some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E

Captains and department heads ensure that proper procedures and safety practices are followed, ensure that machinery is in good working order, and oversee the loading and discharging of cargo and passengers.

25|$|In 1968, he {{published}} two novels, Easy Go and A Case of Need, {{the second of}} which was re-published in 1993, under his real name. Easy Go relates the story of Harold Barnaby, a brilliant Egyptologist, who discovers a concealed message while translating hieroglyphics, informing him of an unnamed Pharaoh whose tomb {{is yet to be}} discovered. A Case of <b>Need,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, was a medical thriller in which a Boston pathologist, Dr. John Berry, investigates an apparent illegal abortion conducted by an obstetrician friend, which caused the early demise of a young woman. The novel would prove a turning point in Crichton's future novels, in which technology is important in the subject matter, although this novel was as much about medical practice. The novel earned him an Edgar Award in 1969.|$|E

Outlet Magazine applauded [...] "Heaven" [...] for [...] "bringing the summer heat" [...] and for being [...] "the ideal song to sit outside and listen to all day long as the sun's rays caress your skin".

500|$|Despite {{the capture}} of Watten, it was still not known at this time what the site had been {{intended}} for.

Based on the discovery of large aluminium tanks installed in {{the main part of}} the bunker, he opined that the Germans had intended to use it as a factory for the production of hydrogen peroxide for use in the fuelling of V-1 and V-2 missiles. He ruled out the possibility that it could have been used for LOX production and concluded, erroneously, that [...] "the site had no offensive role." [...] He recommended that (unlike the Mimoyecques and Wizernes sites) the Watten bunker presented no threat to the UK's security and [...] "there is thus no imperative <b>need,</b> <b>on</b> that account, to ensure the destruction of the workings." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1919, {{the matter}} went to {{consideration}} in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their <b>need</b> <b>on</b> the Teschen coal, useful {{in order to}} influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles were to get {{most of the people}} and the strategic rail line. Watt writes: [...] "Czech envoy Edvard Beneš proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Beneš was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Beneš knew what he was doing. A plebiscite would take some time to set up, and a lot could happen in that time – particularly when a nation's affairs were conducted as cleverly as were Czechoslovakia's." ...|$|E

Arnison revealed {{that he and his}} team [...] "are not going to give [...] singing lessons– we don't need to", and said that when he met Talbot, he was [...] "blown away". A schedule was worked out allowing Talbot to continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as [...] "a better solution [...] which has not robbed her of her childhood". Although Arnison claimed he did not [...] "want to put her through the promotional grind which most artists go through because she is too young", plans were made for an appearance on daytime television programme This Morning, as well as an appearance on Children in <b>Need</b> <b>on</b> 16 November 2007.|$|E

In the next few years, Warren led the Court {{in a series of}} liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court. Some writers believe that Eisenhower once remarked that his appointment was [...] "the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made". However, Eisenhower biographer Jean Edward Smith concluded in 2012 that [...] "Eisenhower never said that. I have no evidence that he ever made such a statement." [...] Eisenhower gave Warren a recess appointment that began on October 1, 1953. It was made permanent when the Senate acted on March 1, 1954. No serious opposition had appeared and he was confirmed by unanimous voice vote.|$|E
