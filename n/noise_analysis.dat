2500|$|During 1977 and 1978, Rundgren {{attempted}} to tour with a true quadraphonic sound system, however it proved ultimately unworkable – despite successfully delivering high-quality sound in a concert setting – {{due to the}} enormous technical requirements involved. Since most concert arenas of the day were ill-equipped to host large towers of sound equipment {{in the rear of}} the halls, the speakers often had to be hung from the ceiling rigging. This installation could take up to two days to complete, meaning that it was necessary to send two separate sound systems, each with its own, complete set-up crew, out on the road, so that they could [...] "leapfrog" [...] and allow Rundgren to play dates on consecutive days, which would have otherwise been impossible. The system featured a then-new technology called [...] "signal analysis", which required white and pink noise to be pumped through the speakers, in order to set the active equalizers so as to minimize feedback and distortion. The pink and white <b>noise</b> <b>analysis</b> had to be performed twice: once with the hall empty, and then again with the audience present, which many concertgoers found annoying. Additionally, Rundgren's insistence on personally overseeing the acoustic set-up of the system left him exhausted and unable to continue, and he pulled the plug on the experiment.|$|E

40|$|Mountainous areas {{create a}} complex and {{challenging}} environment to conduct <b>noise</b> impact <b>analysis</b> of development projects. This paper presents a <b>noise</b> impact <b>analysis</b> methodology using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Traffic Noise Model (FHWA TNM 2. 5) to portray spatial distribution of noise due to the broadening of the national highway in the mountainous terrain of East Sikkim. Two noise level indices viz., Hourly Equivalent Sound Level (Leq(H)) and Day and Night Average Sound Level (Ldn) were calculated for the year 2004 as pre-project scenario, 2014 as project implementation scenario and 2039 as post-project scenario. The overall trend shows {{that the proportion of}} area under adverse noise level decreases from pre-project scenario to project implementation scenario. Over the time the adverse noise impact in the post-project scenario reaches very close to pre-project scenario in case of both the <b>noise</b> indices. Overlay <b>analysis</b> of <b>noise</b> based landuse maps over actual landuse map show that non-compliance of noise based landuse will show similar trend. This trend is mainly attributed to traffic composition and highway broadening induced-traffic volume. The study shows that TNM and spatial interpolation of noise data using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) are reliable tools to perform <b>noise</b> impact <b>analysis</b> in mountainous areas. Multiple regression analysis show that, radial distance and elevation difference of noise receivers from the nearest point in the highway are significant predictors of Leq(H) and Ldn at lower percentage of heavy trucks in traffic composition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — SRAM-based memory arrays {{designed}} in deeply scaled technologies become increasingly susceptible to soft errors. A full account of SRAM cell stability requires dynamic noise margin models that {{take into account}} the temporal behavior of noise injection mechanism. One critical component of dynamic <b>noise</b> margin <b>analysis</b> is the determination of stability boundary, or the separatrix. Different from the unrealistic assumption made in prior work, we show that the separatrix is subject to significant perturbation due to device mismatch and hence must be carefully accounted for in <b>noise</b> margin <b>analysis.</b> More importantly, by applying a rigorous nonlinear system theory, we present an efficient separatrix tracing technique that can accurately determine the separatrix via fast transistor-level transient simulation. The presented technique is shown to be up to thousands times faster than a brute-force approach. I...|$|R
50|$|The voltage noise Sv is {{considered}} to be a small signal outside the linewidth and thus can be accurately predicted using small-signal analyses. Conversely, the voltage noise within the linewidth is a large signal (it is large enough to cause the circuit to behave nonlinearly) and cannot be predicted with small-signal analyses. Thus, small-signal <b>noise</b> <b>analysis,</b> such as is available from RF simulators, is valid only up to the corner frequency (it does not model the corner itself).|$|E
