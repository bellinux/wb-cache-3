40|$|BACKGROUND: Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) play an {{important}} role in developing potential cell-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease. Microfluidics has proven a powerful tool in mechanistic studies of NSC differentiation. However, NSCs are prone to differentiate when the nutrients are limited, which occurs unfavorable by fast medium consumption in miniaturized culture environment. For mechanistic studies of NSCs in microfluidics, it is vital that <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> is triggered by controlled factors only. Thus, we studied the correlation between available cell medium and spontaneous <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> of C 17. 2 NSCs in standard culture medium, and proposed the necessary microfluidic design criteria to prevent undesirable cell phenotype changes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A series of microchannels with specific geometric parameters were designed to provide different amount of medium to the cells over time. A medium factor (MF, defined as the volume of stem cell culture medium divided by total number of cells at seeding and number of hours between medium replacement) successfully correlated the amount of medium available to each cell averaged over time to <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation.</b> MF smaller than 8. 3 × 10 (4) µm 3 /cell⋅hour produced significant <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> marked by cell morphological change and significantly more cells with positive β-tubulin-III and MAP 2 staining than the control. When MF was equal or greater than 8. 3 × 10 (4) µm 3 /cell⋅hour, minimal spontaneous <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> happened relative to the control. MF had minimal relation with the average neurite length. SIGNIFICANCE: MFs can be controlled easily to maintain the stem cell status of C 17. 2 NSCs or to induce spontaneous <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> in standard stem cell culture medium. This finding is useful in designing microfluidic culture platforms for controllable NSC maintenance and differentiation. This study also offers insight about consumption rate of serum molecules involved in maintaining the stemness of NSCs...|$|R

25|$|The {{putative}} {{function of}} SCO-spondin in <b>neuronal</b> <b>differentiation</b> is discussed regarding these features and homologies with other developmental molecules {{of the central}} nervous system exhibiting TSR domains, and involved in axonal guidance. Peptides corresponding to SCO-spondin TSR domains strongly increased adhesivity and neuritic outgrouth of cortical neurons and induced disaggregation of spinal cord neurons. Therefore, it is a candidate to interfere with neuronal development and/or axonal guidance during ontogenesis of {{the central nervous system}} in the modulation of side-to-side and side-to-substratum interactions, and also in promoting neurite outgrowth.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) and neurotrophic factors embedded {{together into}} biocompatible matrices {{is a relatively}} new concept being investigated. CAMs of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), which includes L1/NgCAM and neurofascin, are particularly promising, because they are expressed in the developing nervous system on neurons or Schwann cells. They are known to serve as guidance cues and mediate <b>neuronal</b> <b>differentiation.</b> Neurotrophic factors such as NGF and growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5), however, are well established as promoters of regeneration in vivo. A recent study by Niere, Brown et al. investigated the synergistic effects of combining L1 and neurofascin with NGF and GDF-5 on DRG neurons in culture; this combination enhanced neurite outgrowth. Further enhancement was demonstrated by combining L1 and neurofascin into an artificial fusion protein, which improves efficiency since factors are not delivered individually. Not only can different cues be used, but they may even be fused into a single 'new' cue.|$|E
25|$|Not all proneural {{genes are}} equally {{sensitive}} to lateral inhibition. For example, in Xenopus, Chitnis and Kintner demonstrated that ‘’XASH-3’’ and NeuroD (achaete-scute complex) respond differently to lateral inhibition, which reflect different ability to activate target genes and differential susceptibility of these target genes to repression by notch. Posterior studies revealed {{that even when}} Notch/Delta signaling pathway is blocked, Wnt2b is capable of inhibiting <b>neuronal</b> <b>differentiation,</b> through the downregulation of mRNA expression of multiple proneural genes and also of Notch1. With this mechanism Wnt2b maintains progenitor cells undifferentiated by attenuating the expression of proneural and neurogenic genes, preventing cells from getting into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch. Although notch signaling {{is involved in the}} control of proneural gene expression, positive-feedback loops are required to increase or maintain the levels of proneural genes. The transcription factors responsible for this maintenance can act through the inhibition of the notch signaling pathway in particular cells or at a post-transcriptional level, affecting proneural genes transcription and function.|$|E
40|$|The neuregulin- 1 (Nrg- 1) gene is {{translated}} into several protein isoforms, which are either secreted or membrane-anchored. In vitro, neural stem cells (NSC) express mainly the cystein-rich-domain NRG (CRD-NRG) isoform, a membrane-anchored type III form. This isoform exhibits a cystein-rich-domain, which constitutes a second transmembrane domain {{and can be}} cleaved to release both a signaling EGF-containing domain (ECD) at the cell surface and an intracellular domain (ICD). The main goal {{of this paper was}} to determine the exact role of ECD and ICD in NSC survival and differentiation. Using an siRNA approach, we demonstrated that CRD-NRG inhibition was followed by a decrease in NSC proliferation and of <b>neuronal</b> or oligodendroglial <b>differentiation.</b> Overexpression of ICD but not ECD was followed by a decrease in NSC proliferation and an increase in <b>neuronal</b> and oligodendroglial <b>differentiation.</b> Moreover, we showed that ICD physically interacted in cultured NSC with BRM and BAF 57, two members of the Swi/Snf remodeling complex, and that ICD stimulation of <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> is dependent on the presence of BAF 57.

An alternative to conventional bioreactors, microfluidic devices are {{a simple and}} effective platform for stem cell investigations. In this study, we describe {{the design of a}} microfluidic device as a chemical and mechanical shear stress bioreactor to stimulate rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) into neuronal cells. 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutylxanthine (IBMX) was used as a chemical reagent to induce rBMSCs differentiation into neurons. Furthermore, the shear stress applied to rBMSCs was generated by laminar microflow in the microchannel. Four parallel microfluidic chambers were designed to provide a multiplex culture platform, and both the microfluidic chamber-to-chamber, as well as microfluidic device-to-device, culture stability were evaluated. Our research shows that rBMSCs were uniformly cultured in the microfluidic device and differentiated into neuronal cells with IBMX induction. A three-fold increase in the <b>neuronal</b> cell <b>differentiation</b> ratio was noted when rBMSCs were subjected to both IBMX and fluid flow shear stress stimulation.

2500|$|The Notch pathway is {{essential}} for maintaining NPCs in the developing brain. Activation of the pathway is sufficient to maintain NPCs in a proliferating state, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the critical components of the pathway cause precocious <b>neuronal</b> <b>differentiation</b> and NPC depletion. Modulators of the Notch signal, e.g., the Numb protein are able to antagonize Notch effects, resulting in the halting of cell cycle and differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, the Fibroblast Growth Factor pathway promotes Notch signaling to keep stem cells of the cerebral cortex in the proliferative state, amounting to a mechanism regulating cortical surface area growth and, potentially, gyrification. [...] In this way, Notch signaling controls NPC self-renewal as well as cell fate specification.|$|E
2500|$|The 5-HT2C receptors are G protein–coupled receptors {{that are}} coupled to {{phospholipase}} C (PLC) via Gαq, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and possibly Gα13. PLC metabolizes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which regulates cellular Ca2+ flux by binding to IP3 receptors, thereby inducing {{the release of}} Ca2+. In addition, the activation of PLA2 also results in recruitment of a RhoA/PLD pathway through RhoA, an enzyme that regulates {{a wide spectrum of}} cellular functions through PLD (phospholipase D) target protein. The 5-HT2C receptors can also stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway which is activated by neurotrophins and other neuroactive chemicals. Production of these chemicals effects <b>neuronal</b> <b>differentiation,</b> survival, regeneration, and structural and functional plasticity. Early studies of the ERK pathway showed that mood stabilizers for the treatment of manic-depressive illness stimulated the pathway.
