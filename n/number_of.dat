5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's <b>number</b> <b>of</b> votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> votes for the two candidates with the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) <b>number</b> <b>of</b> A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> A and B alleles, chances are that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
