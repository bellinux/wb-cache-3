Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not think he is guilty. Poirot agrees {{to go to the}} town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> to talk to Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, however, Aloysius is in {{love with}} Clarissa Whortle, the {{daughter}} of a judge. Sir Trevor has led everyone to believe {{that he is going to}} marry Clarissa to assist Aloysius in evading Clarissa's father. Aloysius, on the other hand, has allowed everyone to believe that he will marry Jane. Before going to the Registrar to be married, Aloysius decides that Clarissa's clothing is too fashionable, so Clarissa borrows Jane's nurse attire. Rosebud appears and the mortals criticise her because her skirts are too short. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> her assistance, but she explains (mistaking Clarissa for Jane because of the change of clothing) that a demon is planning to carry off the lady. She vanishes, and everyone is angry with her, thinking her rude. Now Demon Alcohol meets Sir Trevor, who has been left alone. The demon is also confused by the change of clothing; he abducts Clarissa (thinking her to be Jane) and takes her to Sir Trevor's lodgings.|$|E

25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she pauses for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E
25|$|Season 5 follows two {{timeline}}s. The first timeline {{takes place}} on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with Richard Alpert, one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> to return. The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 {{to return to the}} island and in order to go back, they have to take John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, in which they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by Daniel Faraday that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

[...] "Part of that force is the sex drive. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> to be a victim of that, {{but when you look at}} Pauline's interest in the murders, it's sexual.

500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> to be their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E

According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people.

Anachronox went gold and shipped to manufacturers in late June.|$|E
500|$|After {{yet another}} attack at the Krusty Krab by Plankton, SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs why they hate each other. Mr. Krabs tells {{his side of}} the story, in a series of flashbacks. In the flashback, Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth, and did {{everything}} together. One day, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and being located in a landfill, is very popular among the local children due to being the only place in town to get a burger. When Stinky refuses to give them a burger Plankton and Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves, and create their own burger, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> to try it. They then find out that the local health department closed Stinky's, so the two open [...] "Plabs Burgers" [...] at the dump, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's. Plankton says that they are now ruling the children. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon they get into an argument, and Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as we were hoping, and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> to see the next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah with a sense of humor, and I love the idea of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E

The Billboard review of the album complimented Price's [...] "ability to create consistent sound without sacrificing each track's individuality", and termed Aphrodite a [...] "journey cohesive, fun and fitting for a goddess". Ian Wade from BBC Music gave the album an extremely positive review and {{found it to be}} an [...] "astonishing return to form" [...] for Minogue. Wade commended her for returning to her roots and becoming the [...] "Kylie of Fever and Light Years"; he concluded the review by calling Aphrodite an [...] "all-killer, flags-aloft amazing triumph" [...] and that [...] "not liking this (album) would be like not being keen on breathing". Nick Levine from Digital Spy felt that it was her best album since Fever and admitted that while Aphrodite isn't [...] "deep", it [...] "sure ain't dumb either", opining that it is meant to be heard for relaxation and enjoyment. Mikael Wood praised the tracks' danceability and concluded that [...] "The diminutive Australian diva is still delivering disco thunder from Down Under". Priya Elan from NME felt that Price was the [...] "perfect choice of musical partner" [...] and complimented him for producing Minogue's [...] "most unified work in ages". Christel Loar from PopMatters found the album similar to Light Years and Fever and commended the production, opining that while [...] "dance pop with this much gloss and unabashed glee is relegated to the realms of guilty pleasure", Aphrodite is [...] "that rare representation of perfect production that is just pleasure, pure and simple". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's [...] "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph complimented Price for enlisting a [...] "top notch" [...] team of collaborators and termed Aphrodite a [...] "mainstream pop blast". Barry Walters from Spin commended Minogue for returning to her original style of music, saying [...] "Finally even the suits realize that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> ersatz hip-hop or Americanized AOR from Australia's ultimate pop tart".|$|E
