40|$|The cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) in {{guinea-pig}} peritoneal macrophages were isolated, partially characterized {{and their}} role in regulating the cyclic AMP content in intact cells evaluated. Differential centrifugation of macrophage lysates revealed that ∼ 90 % of the PDE activity was membrane-bound and exclusively hydrolyzed cyclic AMP. This activity was not removed by KCl (200 [*]mM) but was readily solubilized by the non-ionic detergent, Triton X- 100 (1 % v/v). Greater than 80 % of the hydrolytic activity was suppressed by the PDE 4 inhibitors, R-rolipram and <b>nitraquazone</b> with IC 50 s of 240 and 540 [*]nM, respectively. Anion-exchange chromatography of the total protein extracted from macrophages resolved two major peaks of cyclic AMP PDE activity that were insensitive to cyclic GMP (10 [*]μM), calmodulin (50 units plus 2 [*]mM CaCl 2) and a PDE 3 inhibitor, SK&F 95654 (10 [*]μM), but were markedly suppressed by RS-rolipram (10 [*]μM). The two peaks of PDE activity were arbitrarily designated CPPDE 4 α and CPPDE 4 β {{with respect to the}} order from which they were eluted from the column where the prefix, CP, refers to the species, Cavia porcellus. The hydrolysis of cyclic AMP catalyzed by CPPDE 4 α and CPPDE 4 β conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetic behaviour with similar Kms (13. 4 and 6. 4 [*]μM, respectively). Thermal denaturation of membrane-bound PDE 4 at 50 °C followed bi-exponential kinetics with t 1 / 2 values of 1. 5 and 54. 7 [*]min for the first and second components, respectively. In contrast, CPPDE 4 α and CPPDE 4 β each decayed mono-exponentially with significantly different thermostabilities (t 1 / 2 = 2. 77 and 1. 15 [*]min, respectively). Gel filtration of CPPDE 4 β separated two peaks of rolipram-sensitive PDE activity. The main peak eluted at a volume indicative of a ∼ 180 [*]kDa protein but was preceded by a much larger form of the enzyme that had an estimated weight of 750 [*]kDa. Size exclusion chromatography of CPPDE 4 α resolved a broad peak of activity with molecular weights spanning 50 to 200 [*]kDa. Of ten PDE inhibitors examined, none distinguished CPPDE 4 α from CPPDE 4 β with respect to their IC 50 values or their rank order of potency. RS-rolipram acted as a purely competitive inhibitor of cyclic AMP hydrolysis with Kis of 2 [*]μM and 1. 5 [*]μM for CPPDE 4 α and CPPDE 4 β, respectively. In contrast to the membrane-associated enzyme(s), R-rolipram and <b>nitraquazone</b> were 4 to 19 fold less potent as inhibitors of CPPDE 4 α and CPPDE 4 β. In intact macrophages, Ro 20 - 1724 and RS-rolipram potentiated isoprenaline-induced cyclic AMP accumulation under conditions where a PDE 3 inhibitor, SK&F 94120, was essentially inactive. These data demonstrate that the predominant cyclic AMP hydrolyzing activity in guinea-pig macrophages is a PDE 4. Moreover, thermostability studies and size exclusion chromatography indicates the possible expression of two intrinsic, membrane-associated isoenzymes which can regulate the cyclic AMP content in intact cells. The finding that soluble and particulate forms of the same enzyme exhibit different sensitivities to rolipram and <b>nitraquazone</b> implies that PDE 4 can change conformation. Finally, the identification of multiple molecular weight species of CPPDE 4 suggests that this enzyme(s) might form multimeric complexes of variable association states...|$|E
40|$|A perplexing {{phenomenon}} {{identified in}} several tissues {{is the lack}} of correlation between inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) and certain functional responses such as smooth muscle relaxation, gastric acid secretion and cAMP accumulation. Interpretation of these data is complicated further by the finding that function correlates with the ability of PDE 4 inhibitors to displace [3 H]rolipram [4 -(3 -cyclopentenyloxy- 4 -methoxyphenyl) - 2 -pyrrolidone] from a high-affinity site in rat brain that is apparently distinct from the catalytic centre of the enzyme. We have investigated this discrepancy by using guinea pig macrophages as a source of PDE 4 and have confirmed that the ability of a limited range of structurally dissimilar PDE inhibitors (Org 20241, <b>nitraquazone</b> and the enantiomers of rolipram and benafentrine) to increase cAMP content did not correlate with their potency as inhibitors of partly purified PDE 4, whereas a significant linear and rank order correlation was found when cAMP accumulation was related to the displacement of [3 H]R-(-) -rolipram from a specific site identified in macrophage lysates. An explanation for these data emerged from the finding that the IC 50 values and rank order of potency of these compounds for inhibition of partly purified PDE 4 and the native (membrane-bound) form of the same enzyme were distinct. Similarly, no correlation was found when membrane-bound PDE 4 was compared with the same enzyme that had been solubilized with Triton X- 100. These unexpected results were attributable to a selective decrease in the potency of those inhibitors [nitraquazone, R-(-) - and S-(+) -rolipram] that interacted preferentially with the rolipram binding site. Indeed, if membrane-bound PDE 4 was used as the enzyme preparation, excellent linear and rank order correlations between inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis, displacement of [3 H]R-(-) -rolipram and cAMP accumulation were found, which improved further {{in the presence of the}} vanadyl (Vo) / 2. GSH complex. Moreover, using Vo/ 2. GSH-treated membranes, the IC 50 values of <b>nitraquazone</b> and the enantiomers of rolipram for the inhibition of PDE 4 approached their affinity for the rolipram binding site. Collectively, these data suggest that the rolipram binding site and the catalytic domain on CPPDE 4 might represent part of the same entity. In addition, these results support the concept that PDE 4 can exist in different conformational states [Barnett, Manning, Cieslinski, Burman, Christensen and Torphy (1995) J. Pharmcol. Exp. Ther. 273, 674 - 679] and provide evidence that the cAMP content in macrophages is regulated primarily by a conformer of PDE 4 for which rolipram has nanomolar affinity...|$|E
40|$|The non-hydrolysable cyclic AMP analogue, dibutyryl (Bu 2) -cyclic AMP, {{inhibited}} the stimulated {{release of}} histamine from both basophils and human lung mast cells (HLMC) in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations required to inhibit histamine release by 50 % (IC 50) were 0. 8 and 0. 7 [*]mM in basophils and HLMC, respectively. The cyclic GMP analogue, Bu 2 -cyclic GMP, was ineffective as an inhibitor of histamine release in basophils and HLMC. The non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, theophylline and isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) inhibited the IgE-mediated release of histamine from both human basophils and HLMC in a dose-dependent fashion. IBMX and theophylline were more potent inhibitors in basophils than HLMC. IC 50 {{values for the}} inhibition of histamine release were, 0. 05 and 0. 2 [*]mM for IBMX and theophylline, respectively, in basophils and 0. 25 and 1. 2 [*]mM for IBMX and theophylline in HLMC. The PDE 4 inhibitor, rolipram, attenuated the release of both histamine and the generation of sulphopeptidoleukotrienes (sLT) from activated basophils at sub-micromolar concentrations but was ineffective at inhibiting the release of histamine and the generation of both sLT and prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) in HLMC. Additional PDE 4 inhibitors, denbufylline, Ro 20 - 1724, RP 73401 and <b>nitraquazone,</b> were all found to be effective inhibitors of mediator release in basophils but were ineffective in HLMC unless high concentrations (1 [*]mM) were employed. Neither 8 -methoxymethyl IBMX (PDE 1 inhibitor), zaprinast (PDE 5 inhibitor) nor a range of PDE 3 inhibitors (siguazodan, SKF 94120, SKF 95654) were effective inhibitors of mediator release from either basophils or HLMC. In basophils, rolipram acted to potentiate the inhibitory effects of the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, whereas in HLMC, rolipram failed to potentiate the inhibitory effects of forskolin. Extracts of purified HLMC and basophils hydrolysed cyclic AMP. IBMX (100 [*]μM) inhibited the PDE activity in basophil extracts by 67 ± 7 % (P< 0. 0001) and in HLMC extracts by 63 ± 9 % (P< 0. 0005). The hydrolysis of cyclic AMP by basophil extracts was inhibited by the selective PDE inhibitors (all at 10 [*]μM), rolipram (56 ± 8 %, P< 0. 0001) and the mixed PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor, Org 30029 (47 ± 9 %, P< 0. 01), whereas 8 -methoxymethyl IBMX, siguazodan and zaprinast were ineffective. In HLMC, rolipram, Org 30029, 8 -methoxymethyl IBMX, siguazodan and zaprinast all inhibited the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP by extracts to a significant (P< 0. 05) and similar extent (approximately 25 % inhibition at 10 [*]μM). In total, {{these data suggest that}} modulation of the PDE 4 isoform can regulate basophil responses whereas an association of the PDE 4 isoform with the regulation of HLMC function remains uncertain...|$|E
