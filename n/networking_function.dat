50|$|A social news website is an Internet {{website that}} {{features}} user-posted stories. Such stories are ranked based on popularity, as voted on by other {{users of the}} site or by website administrators. Users typically comment online on the news posts and these comments may also be ranked in popularity. Since their emergence {{with the birth of}} Web 2.0, social news sites have been used to link many types of information, including news, humor, support, and discussion. All such websites allow the users to submit content and each site differs in how the content is moderated. On the Slashdot and Fark websites, administrators decide which articles are selected for the front page. On Reddit and Digg, the articles that get the most votes from the community of users will make it to the front page. Many social news websites also feature an online comment system, where users discuss the issues raised in an article. Some of these sites have also applied their voting system to the comments, so that the most popular comments are displayed first. Some social news websites also have a social <b>networking</b> <b>function,</b> in that users can set up a user profile and follow other users' online activity on the website.|$|E
40|$|We examine {{investment}} banks' <b>networking</b> <b>function</b> {{in capital}} markets, using {{a sample of}} Private Investments in Public Equity (PIPEs). We argue that investment banks develop relationships with investors through repeat dealings, and that investment banks' networks of relationship investors {{form the basis of}} their <b>networking</b> <b>function.</b> We find that investment banks, especially those with larger investor networks, help issuers attract investors. Correspondingly, an issuer that desires more investors is more likely to hire an investment bank than place the shares directly. We also find that issuers pay higher fees to hire investment banks with larger investor networks. Our empirical findings suggest that the <b>networking</b> <b>function</b> of investment banks is important in securities offerings.

40|$|Abstract — The {{growth in}} ubiquity, performance, and commer-cial and {{academic}} use of computer networks continues to demand more performance and flexibility from the underlying network infrastructure. The lack of security, quality of service, and man-ageability {{in the current}} Internet poses a significant challenge and {{highlights the importance of}} considering other network designs. Programmable routers provide a vehicle for experimenting with new architectures that allow the dynamic deployment of new protocols and services. To achieve the necessary throughput performance, programmable routers employ network processors, which are embedded system-on-a-chip multiprocessors. This paper discusses the challenges that such systems pose in terms of system architecture, programming abstraction, and deployment. The potential applications highlight the benefits of making router programmability a first-class <b>networking</b> <b>function.</b> I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of online social {{networking}} functions on user participation with data collected from a Chinese online community. Leveraging on an exogenous change to the social <b>networking</b> <b>function,</b> we use a differences-in-differences approach to identify {{the effect of}} role identity salience on user participation. A formal theoretical model is proposed to investigate the equilibrium participation and friend network usage behavior. Predictions made from our theoretical model are confirmed by our empirical results. We also check the robustness of our result for different model settings and sub-samples. This research contributes to the IS literature about user participation in online communities. We extend previous literature by introducing another factor, role-identity, from the social economics literature, and empirically testing its significance with observational data. In this way, our research also contributes to the recent literature on empirical social economics...|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} {{routing protocols}} in Mobile Ad hoc Networks take after various methodologies {{to send the}} data starting from one node then onto the next. The nodes in the system are non-static and they move arbitrarily and are inclined to interface disappointment which makes dependably to discover new routes to the destination. During the forwarding of packets to the destination, various intermediate nodes take part in routing, where such node should be an ideal node. An algorithm is proposed here to know the ideal node after studying {{the features of the}} reactive routing protocols. The malicious node can be eliminated from the <b>networking</b> <b>function</b> and the overhead on the protocol can be reduced. The node chooses the neighbor which can be found in less number of bounces and with less time delay and keeping up the QoS.
