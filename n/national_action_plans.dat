And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> By means of these <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, sale of children and organs, child prostitution, child pornography, as well as other forms of sexual abuse. This gave an influence to adoptions of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.|$|E

This <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> {{is a whole}} of government effort, coordinated by the Office for Women. It will consolidate and build on the broad program of work already underway in Australia to integrate a gender perspective into peace and security efforts, protect women and girls’ human rights, particularly in relation to gender-based violence, and promote their participation in conflict prevention, management and resolution. The delivery of a <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> on Women, Peace and Security is a 2010 Australian Government election commitment, and is Australia’s next step in implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) and related resolutions under the UN Women, Peace and Security agenda. UNSCR 1325 recognises that the experiences and needs of women and girls {{differ from those of}} men and boys in conflict and post-conflict situations, particularly in relation to human rights violations such as sexual and gender-based violence.   UNSCR 1325 also underlines the essential role of women in conflict prevention, management and resolution. The Government has consulted widely in developing the <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan,</b> releasing a Draft <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> for a two-month public consultation period from August 2011 and hosting a roundtable discussion with non-government organisations in November 2011.

[...] A short time later, all 75 Weatherwomen appeared at South Hills High School in Pittsburgh to participate in a [...] "jailbreak".

50|$|Two {{years after}} Resolution 1325 launched, the Security Council began {{encouraging}} {{the development of}} <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> (NAPs) as a tool that member states could use to detail steps that they will take to fulfill the resolution's objectives. As of September 2016, 63 countries have adopted such plans. NAPs address political, social, and human security policies and often require interagency coordination. Many donor country NAPs tend to be externally focused, outlining and documenting their commitments to promoting Resolution 1325's principles in focal countries; developing and conflict-affected countries generally use NAPs to support women's internal participation in politics and peace processes, as well as outline internal commitments on protection from sexual and gender-based violence. Currently, Europe (27) and Africa (19) are the regions with {{the highest number of}} <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans.</b> While the number of NAP countries rapidly increased in the lead up to both the 10th (in 2010) and 15th (in 2015) anniversaries of Resolution 1325, only 32% of UN member states have implemented NAPs. A major gap is in troop contributing countries (TCC) and police contributing countries (PCC) to peacekeeping missions—the top four countries providing police, military experts, and troops do not yet have <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|E
