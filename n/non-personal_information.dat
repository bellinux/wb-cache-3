40|$|The present {{investigation}} examines {{a relationship between}} Rotter°s (1966) Locus of Control Theory and Kelley°s (1967) Attribution Theory {{in the field of}} Consumer Decision-Making. The main hypothesis tested whether there was a difference in the probability of choosing in favour of a product with consensus information between individuals who have a belief in external control and individuals who believe in internal control. Secondary hypotheses were also investigated to detail other aspects of this relationship. Firstly, it was suggested that with externally and internally controlled Individuals, the probabilities of choosing in favour of consensus and distinctiveness information will differ. Secondly, that the probability of choosing in favour of personal control, and <b>non-personal</b> control <b>information</b> will differ for externals and internals. Finally it was suggested that the probability that externals and internals will have their responses rated as external or internal respectively, will be greater than the reverse. The main hypothesis was not substantiated, however there was a strong trend in the predicted direction, suggesting the value of future research. Some support was found for the secondary hypothese. Results are discussed in light of social learning and attribution theories and suggestions for future research offered...|$|R
40|$|Advertising is a {{force that}} makes it {{possible}} to sell more merchandise due to its persuasive nature. As a tool of marketing communication, advertising is the structured and composed, <b>non-personal</b> communication of <b>information.</b> It is usually paid for and usually persuasive in nature. The language of persuasion is employed for successful advertising campaign thereby, boosting patronage of idea, product or service. The persuasive nature of advertising however, has generated criticisms and controversies. Advertising has been vigorously attacked on the ground that it is unnecessary and wasteful and that through it, people are induced to buy worthless products. It is further argued by the objectors that much advertising is misleading and untruthful. Thus, this paper examines how consumers can be persuaded to patronise goods and services advertised...|$|R

40|$|The search-experience-credence {{framework}} from {{economics of}} information, the human-environment relations models from environmental psychology, {{and the consumer}} evaluation process from services marketing provide a conceptual basis for testing the model of 2 ̆ 2 Pre-purchase Information Utilization in Service Physical Environments. 2 ̆ 2 The model addresses the effects of informational signs, as a dimension of the service physical environment, on consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions (perceived veracity and perceived performance risk), emotions (pleasure) and behavior (willingness to buy). The informational signs provide attribute quality information (search and experience) through <b>non-personal</b> sources of <b>information</b> (simulated word-of-mouth and non-personal advocate sources). ^ This dissertation examines: (1) the hypothesized relationships addressed in the model of 2 ̆ 2 Pre-purchase Information Utilization in Service Physical Environments 2 ̆ 2 among informational signs, perceived veracity, perceived performance risk, pleasure, and willingness to buy, and (2) the effects of attribute quality information and sources of information on consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceived veracity and perceived performance risk. ^ This research is the first in-depth study about the role and effects of information in service physical environments.

It affects people's values, social outlook, and outlook on life, social relations and cultural psychology. Comprehensive and universal attribute of the television advertising determines {{it is an important}} source that influences children's morality. Marketers have many approaches to attract consumers by using different media, such as television, network and radio. Many consumers are attracted by those exaggerated claims advertising; especially some children who do not possess the mature mentality. According to some researches, there are some negative impacts such as children’s mental health and physical health will be affected. Therefore, advertising creates some immoral logic that not good for children’ growing up healthy. With the advent of the information era, newspapers, magazines and radio advertising and other media in people's lives plays an important role, there are some bad impact on children moral. First of all, a considerable part of children spend some time every day to sit in front of the television, and television ads will change their way of life, behavior, values, consumption view, life goals, etc. Some advertisers attempt to sell goods, usually contrary to the spirit and use irresponsible sales pitch. For example, the acquisition of knowledge or test scores presumes on their [...] "magic" [...] products, misleading the children who lack of judgment so that they will not diligent to study. These kinds of ads only can encourage children have the mentality of opportunistic and reap without sowing. Secondly, a lot of wrong ideas which from TV ads distort morality of children, for instance, advertising in the performance of give an expensive gift or dinner for someone just for close the relationship. The stodgy way profoundly affected the healthy growth of children. A big number of children may think [...] " [...] purchase =acquire identity [...] " [...] such a concept, will cause the child judge a person by their status level. In addition, the value of the judgment has not yet fully developed on children, sometimes causing [...] "expensive is better" [...] concept. Those children may extravagance and waste in their life. Thirdly, most junk food companies create very attractive advertising, which lead to children deep fascination with them, and even develop their unhealthy eating habits. America Psychological Association shows: “Research has found strong correlation between growing in advertising for unhealthy foods and rates of childhood obesity. Children are on the physiological development period, they should have healthy habit in their daily life. Not greedy, not picky eaters and living on time, which can promote their healthy growth. However, television commercials mostly introduce high fat and high salt food, such as KFC. Even some advertising says junk food is “nourishing and healthy food”. Thus, children’s behavior and personality are influenced by TV advertising. Business also use the unethical way to sale their products.|$|R
5000|$|The {{expansion}} {{of the doctrine of}} breach of confidence under the Human Rights Act began with the Douglas v Hello! decision. Section 6 of the Human Rights Act requires English courts to give effect to the rights in the Convention when developing the common law. There is no need to show a pre-existing relationship of confidence where private information is involved and the courts have recognised that the publication of private material represents a detriment in itself. The Human Rights act has horizontal effect in disputes between private individuals meaning that the Human Rights Act is just as applicable as if one party had been a public body. Breach of confidence now extends to private information (regardless of whether it is confidential) so as to give effect to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Before this breach of confidence afforded [...] "umbrella protection" [...] to both personal and <b>non-personal</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{demonstrates}} that {{there exists a}} ground for building personal information theory through the exploration of several notions such as personal information privacy, security, sharing, and mining. It introduces a methodology for developing a conceptualization of these notions in the personal information context. To illustrate unique techniques {{that can be applied}} only to personal information, we develop a general model for sharing personal information. A protection strategy, based on separating <b>non-personal</b> <b>information</b> from its proprietors, is introduced and applied to personal information...|$|E

More simply, TBDF is interna- tional movement of information over transnational computer-communi- cation systems. Transfer of information over transnational computer systems is the underlying concept. Proposed or actual restrictions on such transfers are the underlying problem.

40|$|Government {{has charged}} the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) with leading {{government}} ICT to provide system-wide assurance, enable integrated digital service delivery, and deliver sustainable business savings of $ 100 {{million per year}} by 2017. The Strategy and Action Plan is the response to this challenge. It sets out an action plan to transform service delivery through digital self-service channels and to unlock the full economic potential of government’s information holdings. It proposes an exit from owning and operating commodity technology assets in favour of a services-based model, and a maturing of the risk assurance framework. These combined approaches, together with other improvement programmes, will deliver the required savings and necessary enhancements in service delivery. Guiding principles 	Centrally led, collaboratively delivered. The Strategy and Action Plan will be led by the GCIO and delivered in collaboration with agency chief executives. 	Customer centricity. Customer insights must inform service design and delivery. Customers should be shielded from the internal complexities of government. 	Trust and confidence. Build public trust and confidence in government’s ability to maintain the privacy and security of information. This underpins our ability to use digital channels. 	Simplify by design. Remove complexity, fragmentation and duplication, and re-engineer business processes end-to-end. 	Share by default. Capabilities must be shared by default rather than by exception. 	Openness and transparency. <b>Non-personal</b> <b>information</b> is a public asset that must be open by default for economic and social benefit...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the treatment methods of depression in public health care, and to conduct an analysis of the findings referring to a theoretical framework. A secondary objective was finding useful facts about the state of data recording, price formation, significance of outpatient care and others. The research first investigated possible and applicable approaches and metrics. Once they were chosen, they were described. The database of choice was the Ecomed system – a software package developed by Datawell Oy for the purpose of keeping patient records at HUS. The data was extracted from the database, evaluated and an empirical analysis was conducted. The empirical data consisted of an excel worksheet containing <b>non-personal</b> <b>information</b> of patient visits, costs, dates, places and other variables. The research showed that there are distinct patterns in treatment methodologies in terms of the duration of treatment. There are patient groups with treatment durations of 0 days, of up to 30 days, of up to 90 days, of up to 350 days, and of up to 1100 days. The mainly qualitative results show a degree of coherence with the theoretical framework. In addition, practicalfacts about price formation, frequencies of visits and others were shown (useful to the organization, not to the main aim of the study). The study paves way for progress in implementation of modernization projects at the organization...|$|E
