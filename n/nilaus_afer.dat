50|$|The first bird {{list for}} Mbam Djerem, a {{synthesis}} of the Fotso and Bobo/ Languy surveys, numbered 360 species, and, as for the mammal fauna, included both true savannah species such as Emberiza affinis, Lagonosticta rara, Lamprotornis chloropterus, Grafisia torquata, <b>Nilaus</b> <b>afer,</b> Anthoscopus parvulus and true forest species such {{as some of the}} hornbills Black and White Casqued Hornbill Ceratogymna subcylindricus, Black Casqued Hornbill Ceratogymna atrata, Red-billed Dwarf Hornbill Tockus camurus, and passerines such as Bleda syndactyla, Bleda eximia, Alethe diademata, Stiphrornis erythrothorax Criniger Calurus, Indicator maculatus (Fotso 2000). The Bamenda Apalis Apalis bamendae was discovered to be relatively widespread throughout the area (Bobo & Languy 2000 a,b; Fotso 2000) - this bird had previously thought to have been restricted to a small area in the Bamenda Highlands of Northwest Cameroon, two hundred kilometres to the west of Mbam Djerem.|$|E
