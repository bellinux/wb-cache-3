40|$|SUMMARY We report 8 {{cases of}} {{complete}} heart block (CHB) occurring {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis and review 20 similar patients previously reported. Complete heart block occurs generally in patients with established erosive nodular rheumatoid disease. It usually appears to be sudden and permanent, but progression from minor conduction delays is not uncommon. The characteristic histopathological finding is a rheumatoid granuloma {{in or near the}} AV node or bundle of His. If syncope or Stokes-Adams attacks occur, the treatment of choice is the insertion of a permanent pacemaker. The prognosis is good provided no other cardiac lesions occur, whether pericardial, valvular, or myocardial. The first account of cardiac involvement in rheumatoid arthritis was given by Charcot in 1881,' when he described pericarditis both as a clinical and as a <b>necropsy</b> <b>finding</b> in patients with 'rheumatisme articulaire chronique'. No further observations were made for sixty years when Baggenstoss and Rosen-berg in 19412 noted valvular lesions in associatio...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To provide {{information}} on the safety of ACM, we carried out a single oral dose-increasing toxicity and 4 -weeks repeated oral dose determining test of ACM in beagle dogs. Methods: In a single oral dose-increasing toxicity test, beagles were treated with ACM orally increasing dose level (1, 000, 2, 000, 5, 000 mg/㎏) at interval of 3 days. After administration, signs of toxicity were observed for two weeks. In 4 -weeks repeated oral dose determinating test, beagles were treated with ACM with oral dose 500, 1, 000, 2, 000 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Mortality, clinical signs, body weight changes, food consumption, urinalysis, hematological and biochemical parameters, organ weights, <b>necropsy</b> <b>findings,</b> and histological findings were monitored during the study period.

40|$|Necrotizing {{enteritis}} (NE) of newborn piglets still {{represents an}} economical problem in Swiss pig breeding and production. The aim {{of our study}} was to identify risk factors for NE and evaluate the prevalence of C. perfringens with the toxingenes cpb and cpb 2 in Swiss pig breeding farms. The prevalence of theses C. perfringens was investigated using fecal swabs followed by bacteriological culturing and genotyping. Close proximity to other breeding farms and large herd sizes were shown to predispose to NE. C. perfringens type C, carrying the genes cpa, cpb and cpb 2 were frequently identified in herds with acute outbreaks of NE. Farms not affected by NE or those using prophylactic vaccination against NE were predominantly positive for C. perfringens type A strains with cpb 2 and showed much lower prevalence of C. perfringens type C, compared to acutely affected herds. Our results demonstrate that C. perfringens type A strains with cpb 2 are not associated with NE. Besides typical <b>necropsy</b> <b>finding,</b> only the identification of cpb can be used for the diagnosis of NE in affected herds...|$|R

40|$|Iniencephaly {{is a rare}} neural tube defect {{characterized}} by extreme retroflexion of {{the head with the}} absence of neck due to spinal deformities. The important features that help us to diagnose a case of iniencephaly are occipital bone deficit leading to enlarged foramen magnum, fusion of malformed cervical and thoracic vertebrae, and upward turned face with chin continuous with chest because of the absence of neck. The differential diagnoses include anencephaly with spinal retroflexion, Klippel–Fiel syndrome, nuchal tumors such as teratoma, goiter, and lymphangioma and Jarcho–Levin syndrome.

40|$|Absrracr. Torsion of the {{caudate lobe}} was an {{incidental}} <b>necropsy</b> <b>finding</b> in three livers of 984 rabbits. The affected rabbits were mature (18 - 24 months), without a common back-ground, {{and did not}} have clinical signs related to hepatic torsion. No lesions secondary to lobar torsion were seen. Torsion of the liver or its separate lobes has been reported as an infrequent lesion with sporadic and nonrecurrent distribution in several species, in-cluding the rat [2] and pig [l]. In the domestic rabbit torsion of the caudate lobe has been reported in the older European literature as a recurrent lesion of low (but unspecified) prevalence [3]. The observation of three additional cases of torsion of the caudate lobe in unrelated rabbits in this laboratory over a 6 -year period suggests that the lesion occurs naturally but rarely.

40|$|Severe {{pulmonary}} haemorrhage {{is a rare}} <b>necropsy</b> <b>finding</b> in dogs but the leptospiral pulmonary {{haemorrhagic syndrome}} (LPHS) is a well recognized disease in humans. Here we report a pulmonary haemorrhagic syndrome in dogs that closely resembles the human disease. All 15 dogs had massive, pulmonary haemorrhage affecting all lung lobes while haemorrhage in other organs was minimal. Histologically, pulmonary lesions were characterized by acute, alveolar haemorrhage without identifiable vascular lesions. Seven dogs had mild alveolar wall necrosis with hyaline membranes and minimal intraalveolar fibrin. In addition, eight dogs had acute renal tubular necrosis. Six dogs had a clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis based on renal and hepatic failure, positive microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and/or positive blood/urine Leptospira-specific PCR. Leptospira could not be cultured post mortem from the lungs or kidneys. However, Leptospira-specific PCR was positive in lung, liver or kidneys of three dogs. In summary, a novel pulmonary haemorrhagic syndrome was identified in dogs but the mechanism of the massive pulmonary erythrocyte extravasation remains elusive. The lack of a consistent post mortem identification of Leptospira spp. in dogs with pulmonary haemorrhage raise questions as to whether additional factors besides Leptospira may cause this as yet unrecognized entity in dogs...|$|R

Compared to warm-housed calves, cold-housed calves in experiment A had metabolic rates which were significantly higher (p less than 0. 001) in a standing position but which were not significantly different (p less than 0. 05) in a recumbent position. Recumbent and standing cold-housed calves in experiment B had an increased (p less than 0. 05) metabolic rate compared to warm-housed controls.
