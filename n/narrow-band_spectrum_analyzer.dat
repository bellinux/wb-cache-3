Background. Coherent optical <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> (COSA) {{are widely}} used in data {{processing}} systems. The efficiency of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> is determined by their generalized characteristics such as the operating range of spatial frequencies, spatial bandwidth, the spatial spectral resolution and the energy resolution. One of such characteristics is geometric noise bandwidth GNBW that determines the spatial spectral resolution of <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer.</b> Objective. The {{purpose of this article}} is to provide a physical and mathematical model of COSA for calculating its geometric noise bandwidth, which determines the spatial spectral resolution of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer.</b> Methods. Based on the analysis of physical-mathematical model of COSA invited to determine the field amplitude at the output of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> using the geometric noise bandwidth. Results. It was found that the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> can be considered as a coherent optical invariant linear system characterized by the impulse response and a transfer function. The geometric noise bandwidth of COSA is equal the square of the input transparency, amplitude transmittance of which is determined by the amplitude of the investigated signal. Conclusions. Analysis of the developed physical and mathematical model of the COSA showed that the geometric noise bandwidth is one of the important characteristics of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> as it allows us to calculate the spatial spectral resolution. It was found that the coherent transfer function of the optical <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> is equal to the square of the input transparency, amplitude transmittance of which is determined by the amplitude of the investigated signal. ????????????. ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????????
