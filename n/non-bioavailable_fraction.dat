40|$|When {{attempting}} {{to assess the}} extent and the impli-cations of environmental pollution, it is often essen-tial to quantify not only the total concentration of the studied contaminant but also its bioavailable fraction: higher bioavailability, often correlated with increased mobility, signifies enhanced risk but may also facili-tate bioremediation. Genetically engineered microor-ganisms, tailored to respond by a quantifiable signal {{to the presence of}} the target chemical(s), may serve as powerful tools for bioavailability assessment. This review summarizes the current knowledge on such microbial bioreporters designed to assay metal bio-availability. Numerous bacterial metal-sensor strains have been developed over the past 15 years, display-ing very high detection sensitivities for a broad spec-trum of environmentally significant metal targets. These constructs are based on the use of {{a relatively small number of}} gene promoters as the sensing ele-ments, and an even smaller selection of molecular reporter systems; they comprise a potentially useful panel of tools for simple and cost-effective determi-nation of the bioavailability of heavy metals in the environment, and for the quantification of the <b>non-bioavailable</b> <b>fraction</b> of the pollutant. In spite of their inherent advantages, however, these tools have not yet been put to actual use in the evaluation of metal bioavailability in a real environmental remediation scheme. For this to happen, acceptance by regulatory authorities is essential, as is a standardization of assay conditions...|$|E
