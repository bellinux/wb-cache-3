50|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration, with hydraulically operated wheel brakes and <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|An electric/hydraulic {{powerpack}} provides {{hydraulic power}} for the flaps, landing gear and <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> The hydraulic pack and battery {{are located in the}} nose compartment.|$|R
50|$|Steering on land is {{provided}} by differential braking. Hydraulic <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is available as an option. A retractable water rudder is slaved to the air rudder for water operation.|$|R
5000|$|After {{touchdown}} at O'Hare airport, {{the first}} officer kept pushing the rudder pedals back and forth while the outside view shows the plane veering right and left during the rollout. That too was impossible, since the hydraulic fluid had been lost on both hydraulic systems. Neither the rudder or the <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> can move at all, without hydraulics operating normally.|$|R
25|$|The aircraft's design {{placed the}} wing behind {{the cabin and}} allowed easy entry via automobile-like doors {{on each side of}} the cabin. The {{propeller}} is well protected and provides safety on the ground in comparison to tractor configuration aircraft. The airfoil employed is a NACA 4418 giving high lift and a stable stall characteristics. The flaps are two-position and mechanically operated by a flap handle on the cabin floor between the seats. The engine starter is foot-actuated and the <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is connected to the control wheel.|$|R
500|$|The Victor had fully {{duplicated}} powered controls; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of artificial feel to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|R
50|$|The Space Shuttle APUs {{provided}} hydraulic pressure. The Space Shuttle {{had three}} redundant APUs, powered by hydrazine fuel. They were only powered up for ascent, re-entry, and landing. During ascent, the APUs provided hydraulic power for gimballing of the Shuttle's three engines {{and control of}} their large valves, and for movement of the control surfaces. During landing, they moved the control surfaces, lowered the wheels, and powered the brakes and <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> Landing could be accomplished with only one APU working.In {{the early years of}} the Shuttle there were problems with APU reliability, with malfunctions on three of the first nine Shuttle missions.|$|R
5000|$|The M42 Truppenfahrrad [...] was a {{military}} bicycle issued to the Wehrmacht during World War II. Special equipment for Wehrmacht use was: the <b>steering</b> <b>bar,</b> the saddle, the toolbox and the porter at the back. The headlamp {{had to work with}} dynamo and/or battery. On the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> were two holders mounted which were holding the half-shelter tent or the drivers trenchcoat.|$|R
500|$|The {{first of}} more than a dozen Tornado prototypes took flight on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett stated of the occasion: [...] "Aircraft {{handling}} was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to wonder whether this was not yet another simulation". Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds. Testing revealed that a <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts. In August 1976, Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Ullman Steering system, a <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> <b>steering</b> system, which {{improves}} manoeuvrability {{and control}} of high speed boats. Since late 90s this steering system is the standard in both the Swedish Coast Guard's [...] and the Swedish Sea Rescue Institution's [...] 8-9m boats.|$|R
25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly.|$|R
50|$|For European market Xiaomi {{released}} Ninebot Mini Pro, {{known as}} Segway miniPro in the US. This version {{has a slightly}} modified design and a different <b>steering</b> <b>bar.</b> Maximum speed of this scooter is 18.5 kph and a range is 30 km.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing. The gearshift lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|R
5000|$|These {{include the}} Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) and Attitude Director Indicator (ADI). The HSI {{combines}} the magnetic compass with navigation signals and a Glide slope. The navigation information {{comes from a}} VOR/Localizer, or GPS. The ADI is an Attitude Indicator with computer-driven <b>steering</b> <b>bars,</b> a task reliever during instrument flight.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe track-bridge {{interaction}} {{is a widely}} discussed and important topic today, as the modern railway bridges commonly exceed the maximum dilatation lengths allowed for the continuous welded rail. In this case, the Meyer-Wunstorf <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> {{is one of the}} suitable solutions that can move the fixed point of the bridge {{to the middle of the}} span and thus exceed the possibility of the application of the continuous welded rail without any rail expansion devices. However, this solution is new in the Czech Republic and its functionality and durability should be verified. The paper deals with the extensive load tests, made on the first Czech railway bridge with the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> Meyer-Wunstorf. The two-track railway arch bridge on the Tábor - Sudoměřice track crosses the D 3 highway with the span of 100 m. The load tests were focused on the horizontal brake and acceleration forces with the heavy train (totally 1056 t) and four locomotives of weight 318, 6 t. During the test, a number of values were measured, such as stresses in the rail and MW system, movements of the MW and the bridge, temperature. The behaviour of the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> and the bridge – track {{interaction is}} described and compared with the design and theoretical assumptions. The paper also gives the recommendations for the practical design and analysis of the MW system...|$|R
50|$|The {{shaft of}} the {{steering}} control was connected directly to the track rods controlling the front wheels, resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme ("lock to lock"). The handlebar-shaped steering control would be operated with small, controlled inputs by swivelling the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|One {{drawback}} of the M107 {{in combat}} was that laying the gun involves skilled minute {{movements of the}} entire vehicle. The gunner uses hand signals to the driver, who views them in the left rear view mirror and moves the vehicle left or right by tapping on the <b>steering</b> <b>bar.</b> The other cannoneers (aka [...] "Gun Bunnies") set the collimator and aiming stakes {{under the direction of}} the gunner.|$|R
50|$|Since the AMCA is {{a relaxed}} static {{stability}} design, it {{is equipped with}} a quadruplex digital fly-by-optics flight control system to ease pilot handling. The AMCA's aerodynamic configuration is based on a diamond shaped trapezoidal-wing layout with shoulder-mounted wings. Its control surfaces are electro hydraulically actuated and digitally controlled using fiber-optic cables. The wing's outer leading edge incorporates three-section slats, while the inboard sections have additional slats to generate vortex lift over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-angle of attack stability and prevent departure from controlled flight. The wing trailing edge is occupied by two-segmented elevons to provide pitch and roll control. The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the Pelikan tail with single-piece rudder which includes two airbrakes located in the upper rear part of the Pelikan tail, one each {{on either side of the}} tail. The AMCA feature a highly evolved integrated control laws for flight, propulsion, braking, <b>nose-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and fuel management and adaptive neural networks for fault detection, identification and control law reconfiguration. Flights controls of the aircraft are both highly integrated and independent of each other which includes flight controls, engine controls, brake and landing controls, and other systems this is possible due the active controls gears systems (ACGS).|$|R

An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved. [...] To evade enemy detection and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were operated by the air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|R
60|$|March 24: Leg all right, pretty nearly. Rigged up <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> so I {{can work}} {{it with one}} foot. Flew a mile to-day, went not badly. Hope to fly at Springfield, Ill. meet next week. Will {{be able to make}} Brazil trip with Forrest Haviland all right. The dear old boy has been writing to me every day while I've been on the bum. Newspapers have made a lot of my flying so soon again, several engagements and now things look bright again. Reading lots and chipper as can be.|$|R
5000|$|PPCs {{are often}} {{considered}} to be safer than normal fixed-wing aircraft because of their inherent stability, limited response to control inputs, and stall resistance. There are two primary means to control a PPC: increasing or decreasing engine power (which controls vertical rate of climb) and deflecting the right or left trailing edge of the parachute—typically by moving the <b>steering</b> <b>bars</b> with the feet—which turns the aircraft right or left. If {{the trailing edge of}} the wing is pulled in on both sides at the same time, the aircraft [...] "flares", i.e., slows and temporarily gains additional lift. The flare is generally used to make fine adjustments in altitude when flying close to the ground and, in particular, when landing.|$|R
500|$|This airship that {{lifted a}} rider {{consisted}} of a cigar-shaped hydrogen balloon that looked like an inverted boat wrapped in netting. It had a velocipede seat and <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> for a rider. A cloth screw propeller was operated by the rider through a cog wheel and ratchet attachment operated by the rider pedaling. He first called the hybrid invention an [...] "air bicycle", that navigated through the air like driving a bicycle. He later named it a [...] "gas kite", an [...] "aerial velocipede", an [...] "aerial bicycle", [...] and ultimately a [...] "sky-cycle." [...] The propeller acted like a screw of a boat and propelled the airship forward and up with the backward air current generated. It {{could go to a}} thousand feet, be maneuvered, and brought back at will by the rider. Myers' wife was an expert in sky-cycling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power-off}} {{glide ratio}} of a powered parachute ranges from 3:1 to 6:1. Glide ratio {{varies depending on}} the chute size and shape, and the weight that the chute is carrying. Engine-off landings are generally safe, provided that the aircraft is within glide range of a suitable landing zone and the pilot is properly trained {{in the use of}} proper [...] "flaring" [...] technique. [...] "Flaring", in terms of powered parachuting, refers to the usage of the <b>steering</b> <b>bars</b> pushed out simultaneously, causing the aircraft to rock forward. This is caused by the reshaping of the rear of the wing or parachute, which is pulled downwards. This results in the entire aircraft rocking on the lateral axis, thus slowing the aircraft momentarily, allowing an engine-out landing to become less brutal within the last few feet off the ground. Done properly, flaring will allow an engine-out landing to be much smoother than simply relying on the lift of the ram-air canopy to cushion the landing.|$|R
5000|$|The Edge {{includes}} full {{dual controls}} for flight training, including dual <b>steering,</b> dual control <b>bar</b> extenders and two throttles. Engines supplied include the twin cylinder, two-stroke air-cooled [...] Rotax 503 or the liquid-cooled [...] Rotax 582.|$|R
50|$|Recumbent bicycles, due {{to their}} wide variety, are often {{equipped}} with handlebars seen nowhere else. These include handlebars with a very far reach, similar to ape hangers (see above) but mounted less vertically, and handlebars designed for under-seat <b>steering,</b> called Whatton <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{is independent}} {{at the front}} using a transverse leaf spring and wishbones and the rigid axle at the rear uses torsion <b>bars.</b> <b>Steering</b> is by rack and pinion. The brakes are Lockheed hydraulic with 11 in inch drums all round.|$|R
50|$|Full trailer - 2 axle (4 wheels), with a {{draw bar}} which also {{controls}} the trailer's front axle <b>steering.</b> The draw <b>bar</b> {{does not take}} load of the full trailer. Heavy full trailer needs {{to have its own}} brakes remotely controlled by the prime mover vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The 2009 Liberty was {{relatively}} unchanged from the 2008 models {{with the exception}} of stiffer rear axle shafts and retuned springs, shocks, anti-roll <b>bars,</b> <b>steering</b> gear valve, low rollback brake calipers and a revised brake pedal ratio. The six-speed manual transmission was dropped, and the four-speed automatic was now standard.|$|R
40|$|The major {{advantage}} of a motorcycle {{with respect to a}} passenger car is the possibility of the driver to tilt during cornering and thereby maintaining stability whereas a passenger car will suffer from the risk of capsizing at high speed. This observation has lead Brink Dynamics to create and develop a new concept of a man-wide vehicle that is able to tilt like a motorcycle but which offers the comfort of a passenger car, allowing further downsizing of vehicle enabling higher fuel efficiency. This resulted into a three-wheeled passenger car referred to as the MWV, with two seats in a row consisting of two bodies, a two-wheeled rear-assembly and a front assembly being the passenger compartment including the front-fork assembly, that tilts with respect to the rear assembly. Tilting is controlled by the driver through a <b>steering</b> <b>bar.</b> This paper includes a mathematical treatment of the behaviour of the MWV. The tilting mechanicsm is discussed and included in the model. The sensitivity of some further design characteristics will be discussed. In particular the MWV will be compared with a motor-cycle and a passenger car. Finally the dynamic performance of the vehicle will be examined based on the full dynamic equations for the MWV. within this paper, this analysis will be restricted to step-steer where the dynamic vehicle behaviour will be discussed with reference to its steady state performance...|$|R
50|$|The {{landing gear}} is tubular steel with springs for shock absorption. The landing gear is a fixed {{tricycle}} configuration with nose wheel <b>steering</b> through rudder <b>bar</b> deflection.

40|$|Abstract—The {{unmanned}} {{control of}} the steering wheel is, at present, {{one of the most}} important challenges facing researchers in autonomous vehicles within the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In this paper, we present a two-layer control architecture for automatically moving the steering wheel of a mass-produced vehicle. The first layer is designed to calculate the target position of the steering wheel at any time and is based on fuzzy logic. The second is a classic control layer that moves the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> by means of an actuator to achieve the position targeted by the first layer. Real-time kinematic differential global positioning system (RTK-DGPS) equipment is the main sensor input for positioning. It is accurate to about 1 cm and can finely locate the vehicle trajectory. The developed systems are installed on a Citroën Berlingo van, which is used as a testbed vehicle. Once this control architecture has been implemented, installed, and tuned, the resulting steering maneuvering is very similar to human driving, and the trajectory errors from the reference route are reduced to a minimum. The experimental results show that the combination of GPS and artificial-intelligence-based techniques behaves outstandingly. We can also draw other important con-clusions regarding the design of a control system derived from human driving experience, providing an alternative mathematical formalism for computation, human reasoning, and integration of qualitative and quantitative information.
