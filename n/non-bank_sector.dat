40|$|In former studies about Russian banks, {{analysis}} from a comprehensive viewpoint {{has been almost}} completely ignored. In order to clarify the characteristics of Russian banking activities, an {{analysis from}} the viewpoints of bank location, foundation and scale is indispensable. Russian banks have shown some distinguishing characteristics in their activities when viewed by these classifications. To analyze this situation, we have classified Russian banks in this article by their location, foundation and scale. To do this we used the lists of large Russian banks that were periodically published in "Ekonomika i zhizn'" (data as of July 1994, January 1995, January 1996 and January 1997; the list has not been published since 1998) and "Finansovye izvestiia" (data as of January 1996, January 1997 and January 1998). The situation after 1998 was not analyzed {{because of the lack}} of information. For an analysis of Russian banking activities by bank foundation, banks were classified into former state banks and non-former state banks. Former state banks include the Savings Bank of Russia, Promstroibank of USSR, Agroprombank of USSR, Zhilsotsbank of USSR (excluding the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia) and the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia. For an analysis of activities by their location, banks were classified into those which were located in Moscow city and Moscow oblast (hereafter referred to as Moscow banks) and those in 11 other economic regions (North, Northwest, Central excluding Moscow city and Moscow oblast, Volga-Vyatka, Central Black-Soil, Volga, North Caucasus, Urals, West Siberia, East Siberia, and Far East; Kaliningrad was excluded because there were no data about it). The banks in these economic regions are referred to below as regional banks. In addition, regression analysis was applied to clarify differences in banking activities by bank foundation and location. Because of the limited data, in the regression banks were classified by foundation into former state banks and non-former state banks, and banks were classified by location into Moscow banks and regional banks. In the analysis by bank scale, data were taken into account for the banks that were ranked as the 50 top banks in the 100 largest bank lists and for 50 banks from the bottom of the lists. Regression was then used to confirm whether or not differences existed in the activities between large banks and medium-sized banks. Before analyzing Russian banks' activities by these classifications, let us survey the trends and changes of their lending and investing activities. Russian banks earned profits under the hyperinflation caused by the liberalization of prices in January 1992, through devaluation of their liabilities and from other sources. Subsequent government tight money policies led to the suppression of inflation and stabilization of the ruble exchange rate. From about 1994, therefore, banks tended to increase loans to other banks, although they still held a large share of hard currency as non-working assets. The banks made profits by raising funds in the call market and lending the money as call loans under a positive yield curve for terms longer than the call money repayment period. Such a profit-making structure collapsed under tight monetary and fiscal policies, however, and some banks fell into default in August 1995. Banks therefore began to place more emphasis on their lending activities to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> or to holdings of state securities. Especially after 1995 the amount of outstanding state securities has increased dramatically, because the government was prohibited in 1995 from compensating its budget deficits with Central Bank loans. Because the inflation rate decreased further in 1996 - 1997, the refinance rate of the Central Bank also was reduced. This resulted in the decline of the yield on state securities. During these years banks tended to increase the amount of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors,</b> reducing the proportion of non-working assets. In the following sections we will analyze loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors,</b> loans to other banks and holdings of state securities. 1. Loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors.</b> In this section we will analyze the general situation regarding loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> and the situation of foreign currency-denominated loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors.</b> (1) General situation of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors.</b> First we analyzed the situation by foundation of banks. In the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" the share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> in the assets of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank was high. This was because these banks had strong relationships with their customers, industrial and agricultural companies. In contrast, the share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> in the assets of the former Zhilsotsbank was lower than that of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank. Banks that originated from the former Zhilsotsbank did not tend to participate in unprofitable government economic programs such as agricultural programs. Activities of these banks were quite different [...] some of them gave priority to loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors,</b> while others gave weight to operations of state securities. The share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia was much lower than that of banks of other categories. That was because its main activities were to hold its assets in hard currency in foreign banks. The share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at non-former state banks was lower than that of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank but higher than that of the former Zhilsotsbank. Let us further analyze the situation of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> by the location of banks. In the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" the share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at Moscow banks was much lower than that of regional banks in 1994 and 1995, but in 1996 and 1997 differences between Moscow banks and regional banks became smaller. Furthermore, regression indicates that the share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at smaller Moscow former state banks tended to be greater in 1994 and 1995. From the viewpoint of the scale of banks, the share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at larger banks tended to be lower. But in 1996 and 1997 differences between classifications were smaller. In the data of "Finansovye izvestiia" the share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> in the assets of non-former state banks was the highest of all categories by foundation of bank. At the former Promstroibank, Agroprombank and Zhilsotsbank and at the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia, the share was about 20 - 30 %. In the data of "Finansovye izvestiia" the share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at non-former state banks exceeded that of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank. This is different from the result of the analysis based on the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" and is caused by the difference in the definition of "asset" in the data. This means the share of interest arrears, the inter-office account and other assets in the assets of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank was larger than the share at non-former-state banks. The share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at the Savings Bank of Russia was much lower than that of other categories. This was caused by the weakness of the bank's relationship with companies in the Soviet era. In the data of "Finansovye izvestiia" regression shows that larger non-former state banks tended to loan more, whereas differences between Moscow banks and regional banks were weaker. On the other hand, differences between large banks and medium-sized banks became greater as years passed, which is distinguished by the smaller proportion of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> at larger banks. (2) Foreign currency loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors.</b> The data of "Finansovye izvestiia" were used for an analysis of foreign currency loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> (there were no such data in "Ekonomika i zhizn'"). The data showed that of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors,</b> the share of foreign currency loans tended to be larger at the non-former state banks than at the former state banks, but differences by location of banks were weak. Regression shows that the share of foreign currency loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> denominated at larger non-former state banks tended to be greater. Differences between large banks and medium-sized banks were evident. 2. Loans to other banks. In this paper we defined "loans to other banks" as loans that were included in the category "Loans" on the balance sheet, excluding deposits in correspondent accounts at other banks. Only the data in 1994 and 1995 of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" were consistent with this definition. According to the data the proportion of loans to other banks in the total of all bank loans was high in Central (excluding Moscow city and Moscow oblast) in 1994, and high in Moscow city and Moscow oblast and Urals in 1995. Therefore differences in loans to other banks between Moscow banks and regional banks were not so evident. From the viewpoint of the foundation of banks, the share of loans to other banks at non-former state banks was higher. This was related to the weakness of their relationship with companies when compared with the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank, as well as the lower overall share of loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> (in the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'"). Moreover, regression proved that non-former state banks tended to loan to other banks more than former state banks. On the other hand, differences between large banks and medium-sized banks were not observed in the data. 3. Holdings of state securities. Data about holdings of state securities were available in "Finansovye izvestiia. " From the viewpoint of the foundation of banks the share of state securities in the assets of the Savings Bank of Russia was far larger than that of other categories, and the share in the assets of the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia was relatively high. Differences between former state banks and non-former state banks were clear. From the viewpoint of location, the share of state securities in the assets of Moscow banks tended to be higher than the share at regional banks. Analysis by regression showed that in 1996 and 1998, differences in holdings of state securities by both foundation and location were clear, and the share of state securities at larger Moscow former state banks tended to be higher. Furthermore, in 1996 and 1998 differences between large banks and medium-sized banks were clear, judged from the higher share of state securities in the assets of large banks than those of medium-sized banks. Conclusion. In many phases of Russian banking activities, differences in characteristics according to the foundation of banks came to the fore. Differences in characteristics by the location of banks were weaker, except for holdings of state securities. Differences based on the scale of banks were outstanding, especially differences in loans to <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors.</b> Recently differences in the activities between large banks and medium-sized banks have attracted more media attention. On the other hand, differences by foundation of banks in particular have tended to be ignored. Our analysis indicates, however, that viewing bank activity from the standpoint of the foundation of banks is still effective to explain Russian banking activities. Our work may as well be the first step towards understanding the changing activities of Russian banks since the collapse of USSR. The task of analyzing the situation after the crisis of August 1998 remains to be addressed...|$|R

50|$|Algeria’s banking {{sector is}} {{dominated}} by public banks, which suffer from high levels of non-performing loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). As of 2007, public banks controlled 95 percent of total bank assets. In 2007 nonperforming loans represented a towering 38 percent of total loans at public banks, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. Modest {{progress has been made}} in implementing several reforms proposed by the IMF, including replacing bank credits to SOEs with government subsidies; boosting bank supervision, accountability, and transparency; and modernizing the payments system. One specific reform that has been achieved is the establishment in 2006 of the Algerian Real Time Settlements system, which facilitates the prompt and reliable electronic transfer of payments. In November 2007, the proposed sale and privatization of Crédit Populaire d’Algérie was postponed because of turbulent market conditions.

5000|$|... 'Loans create deposits': for {{the banking}} system as a whole, drawing down a bank loan by a {{non-bank}} borrower creates new deposits (and the repayment of a bank loan destroys deposits). So while the quantity of bank loans may not equal deposits in an economy, a deposit is the logical concomitant of a loan - banks {{do not need to}} increase deposits prior to extending a loan.While banks can be capital-constrained, in most countries a solvent bank is never reserve-constrained or funding-constrained: it can always obtain reserves or funding either from the interbank market or from the central bank.Banks rationally pursue any profitable lending opportunities that they can identify up to the level consistent with their level of capital, treating reserve requirements and funding issues as matters to be addressed later—or rather, at an aggregate level.Therefore, the quantity of broad money in an economy is determined endogenously: in other words, the quantity of deposits held by the <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector</b> 'flexes' up or down according to the aggregate preferences of non-banks. Significantly, the theory states that if the non-bank sector's deposits are augmented by a policy-driven exogenous shock (such as quantitative easing), the sector can be expected to find ways to 'shed' most or all of the excess deposit balances by making payments to banks (comprising repayments of bank loans, or purchases of securities).|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{monetary}} DSGE model by Gertler and Karadi (2011) with a non-bank financial intermediary {{to investigate the}} impact of monetary policy shocks on aggregate loan supply. We distinguish between bank and non-bank intermediaries based on the liquidity of their credit claims. While banks can endogenously create deposits to fund rm loans, non-banks have to raise deposits on the funding market to function as intermediaries. The funding market is modeled via search and matching by non-banks for available deposits of households. Because deposit creation responds to economy-wide productivity automatically, bank reaction to shocks corresponds to the balance sheet channel. Non-banks are constrained by the available deposits and their behavior is better explained by the lending channel. The two credit channels are affcted differently following a monetary policy shock. As {{a result of these}} counteracting effects, an increasing <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector</b> leads to a reduced reaction of aggregate loan supply following a monetary policy shock, which is consistent with the data. An extension to deposit like-issuance by the <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector</b> will allow further studies of re-regulating the <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|E

40|$|Euroisation in Serbia {{is rooted}} in {{a long history of}} {{macroeconomic}} instability. Extreme inflation volatility has undermined trust in the dinar and discouraged dinar savings. At the same time, an abundant supply of foreign capital inflows has provided easy access to foreign currency lending at low interest rates in an environment of perceived exchange rate stability – a perception reinforced by the choice of exchange rate regime. As a result, both the asset and the liability side of banks’ balance sheets, and even those of the <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector,</b> is heavily foreign currency-denominated. This paper documents the forces that promote euroisation in Serbia. The paper argues that, {{in the wake of the}} global crisis, a window of opportunity has emerged that could foster a process of de-euroisation. The lack of foreign funding and recent exchange rate volatility has tilted borrower incentives towards local currency borrowing. If disinflationary macroeconomic policies gain credibility, with the possible support of regulatory options, euroisation could drop sharply. ...|$|E

30|$|Quantitative easing {{and lifting}} of credit caps {{will provide the}} {{necessary}} conditions for commercial banks and borrowers to do their part to help the economy grow. It {{is still in the}} interest of the central government to improve tax policies in order to create internal growth stimuli for economic sectors that produce material outputs. For instance, the tax burden on small businesses should be reduced, and technology firms, especially those which create original products, should be exempted from taxes altogether. This would encourage private investment toward companies and projects engaged in technological innovation. If we did this, the foundation of China’s industries will undergo considerable improvement within 5  years. In addition to preferential tax policies for small businesses and technology companies, corporate tax rates should be cut for private enterprises of all kinds. The Chinese economy has now entered a period of cost increases, and profit margins for most companies in <b>non-banking</b> <b>sectors</b> are generally quite low. Banks, by contrast, have been extraordinarily profitable. The government should try to rectify this situation with appropriate policies to channel more financial resources toward <b>non-banking</b> <b>sectors.</b> History has taught us that if the profitability of the financial sector is substantially higher than that of any other sectors, especially industrial sectors, the economy will sooner or later lose momentum.

We define an individual or a sector to be engaged in the carry trade if it has a short position in yen and a long position in other currencies. The tendency of large yen movements to be skewed toward appreciations is consistent with the existence of substantial carry positions, and other evidence from market prices provides some modest support for an effect from the carry trade. Data on bank loans and bond holdings by currency reveal a large apparent yen carry position of the Japanese official sector and modest carry positions in the Japanese and foreign banking sectors. The Japanese private <b>non-banking</b> <b>sector</b> has a large long foreign-currency position, but does not have a short yen position, and is thus not engaged in the yen carry trade in the aggregate. However, it is possible that exporters and investors in Japan use the derivatives markets to hedge some of their long foreign-currency exposure, with the private <b>non-banking</b> <b>sector</b> outside of Japan (including most hedge funds) likely to be taking on most of the associated carry exposure.

40|$|Episodes of {{boom and}} bust in credit markets have often coincided with cycles in {{economic}} activity and property markets. The coincidence of these cycles has already been widely documented in the literature, but few studies address the issue in a formal way. In this study we analyse the determinants of credit to the private <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector</b> in 16 industrialised countries since 1980 based on a cointegrating VAR. Cointegration tests suggest that the long-run development of credit cannot be explained by standard credit demand factors. But once real property prices, measured as a weighted average of real residential and real commercial property prices, {{are added to the}} system, we are able to identify long-run relationships linking real credit positively to real GDP and real property prices and negatively to the real interest rate. These long-run relationships may be interpreted as long-run extended credit demand relationships, but we may also capture effects on credit supply. Impulse response analysis based on a standard Cholesky decomposition reveals that there is significant two-way dynamic interaction between bank credit and property prices. We also find that innovations to the short-term real interest rate have a strong and significant negative effect on bank credit, GDP and property prices. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{severity}} of the financial market crisis most central banks reached the limits of their traditional monetary policy instruments and relied to a very large extent on instruments of unconventional monetary policy. In our paper we develop a simple theoretical framework for the money supply process which is able to analyze the need for such measures as well as their implications for the banking system. The paper starts with a presentation of a price-theoretic model for the money supply under "normal conditions". It then shows how the different shocks of the financial market crisis have affected the market for bank loans and how a central can compensate such shocks. The need for unconventional measures derives from the size of these shocks and the zero lower bound of the central bank's policy rate. Under such conditions the central bank can only stabilize the loan market by providing direct loans to the <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector.</b> A by-product of this approach is a net creditor position of the banking system vis-à-vis the central bank which can lead to high excess reserves and a "decoupling" of the policy rate and the level of reserves. The paper also discusses the impact of bank losses and the role of maturity transformation on the banks' loan supply. bank regulation; maturity transformation; money multiplier; money supply process; unconventional monetary policy...|$|E

Nonetheless, the country has not been spared the regulatory changes that are being implemented at the global level.

Allocations to equities have on average remained above 40 per cent, whereas fixed-interest securities declined significantly from being dominant to roughly 20 per cent. Meanwhile, cash and deposits have increased. The observed trends are mainly on account of regulatory developments, asset-liability management strategies and the need to close funding gaps, which ultimately impact on the investment behaviour and strategies. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present paper is the topic of {{financial}} stability {{and the effects of}} existing regulation mechanisms. Investment decisions made by financial institutions generate aggregate risk, which poses a threat of systemic collapse. Conceptually this process has been regarded as a negative externality. The present thesis explores to what extent the Basel III requirements provide optimal microprudential regulation and are able to secure financial stability. This is done by the means of a theoretical model representing an aggregation of banks that differ in their ability to handle risk, which cannot be improved upon. Each bank has a choice between safe and risky investments and has to make a decision on the proportion between the two alternatives in the asset portfolio. The risky asset generates a higher return, but increases the probability of going bankrupt for an individual bank. The aggregate amount of investment in the risky asset determines the level of systemic risk. At the same time banks may decrease the probability of going bankrupt by increasing the proportion of equity in the liability structure. However, this is associated with a cost, because investors demand a higher return on capital than on demand deposits. It is suggested that investors may pose market capital requirements : demand more equity if a bank increases the amount of risky investment. The problem is formalized mathematically as a Net Present Value function that each bank seeks to maximize. Given the model above, three different regulation mechanisms are considered with reference to the Basel III Accord: the liquidity ratio, risk-weighted capital requirements and the leverage ratio. The regulation alternatives are formulated mathematically and the problem is solved by the means of control theory, where the social planner finds an optimal path of liquidity and capital requirements. Specifically, it is shown that under perfect information Pareto optimality may be achieved {{with the help of a}} combination of liquidity regulation and risk-weighted capital requirements that both decrease in risk handling ability. In other words, banks that are good at risk handling are allowed to hold less liquidity and less capital as a fraction of their assets and liabilities respectively. Under asymmetric information, however, financial institutions that are bad at risk handling acquire incentives to mimic institutions that are good at risk handling in order to increase their revenues and save on capital. Such incentives are strongest when liquidity regulation is used in a combination with either the leverage ratio or risk-weighted capital requirements that decrease in risk handling ability. In order to prevent excessive aggregate risk accumulation and secure financial stability, the regulators may choose to equalize liquidity requirements for banks with different risk handling ability and use the latter in a combination with the leverage ratio. This results in inefficient risk sharing, suboptimal liquidity and capital buffers, at least for some banks. Alternatively, the regulators may choose to use liquidity requirements that decrease in risk handling ability in a combination with equal capital requirements for all banks. Depending on the strictness of the latter this may result in suboptimal liquidity and capital buffers, inefficient risk sharing or contribute to general underinvestment. The thesis thus shows that when the main source of heterogeneity across financial institutions is the ability to handle risk, the existing regulation requirements cannot achieve the first-best solution. In particular, they always produce suboptimal capital and/or liquidity buffers, at least for some banks. This is because financial stability is secured through what is known as bunching : treating different financial institutions alike. Since the latest Basel Accords are expected to be fully implemented in 2018, the predictions of the model are compared to the currently observed trends in the financial sector. Specifically, it has been noted that because of stricter risk-weighted capital requirements introduced by Basel III, banks have started a process of derisking of their assets. This might be an indicator of movement towards greater financial stability. At the same time concerns have been expressed as to whether financial activity may be simply migrating to the unregulated <b>non-bank</b> <b>sector.</b> Moreover, it is debated whether risk-weighted capital requirements introduced by Basel III are strict enough and will be able to combat excessive risk taking. Finally, it is uncertain whether Basel III has succeeded in providing incentives for truthful revelation of information. As long as banks have mimicking incentives, they will try to use any kind of cosmetic adjustments in order to maximize their profits at the cost of financial stability, which has been illustrated by the present thesis...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} factors influencing the liquidity of the financial market is the amount of currency in circulation. Although the central bank is responsible for the distribution of the currency it cannot assess the demand for the currency, as that demand is influenced by the <b>non-banking</b> <b>sector.</b> Therefore, the amount of currency in circulation has to be forecasted. This paper introduces a feedforward structured neural network model and discusses its applicability to the forecasting of currency in circulation. The forecasting performance of the new neural network model is compared with an ARIMA model. The results indicate that the performance of the neural network model is better and that both models might be applied at least as supportive tools for liquidity forecasting.

40|$|This thesis, {{entitled}} “An {{analysis of}} bank risk management and its relevance for the non-bank corporate sector”, investigates {{the extent to}} which financial risk management by the banking sector {{can be applied to the}} <b>non-bank</b> corporate <b>sector.</b> As banks’ risk management techniques are more sophisticated than those of the <b>non-bank</b> corporate <b>sector</b> we have endeavoured to ascertain the applicability of these established risk management methods to the <b>non-bank</b> corporate <b>sector.</b> The main objectives of this study were to analyse the banking sectors’ risks and management thereof, and compare them to the risks faced by the nonbank corporate sector. This analysis was then used to present a theoretical financial risk management model for the corporate sector. This analysis was conducted using qualitative research. The thesis engaged in an in-depth investigation of financial risk management through a documentary, literature and media analysis. It was elucidated that not all companies face the same financial risks and therefore each company requires its own unique financial risk management model. Furthermore, it was established that there are several risks that both banks and non-bank corporates are subjected to. However, the management of these risks is not necessarily the same for these two types of institutes. This thesis concludes by putting forward a financial risk management model which presents all the possible financial risks that non-bank corporates may face. ...|$|R

50|$|Before the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) was established, Korea’s {{financial}} {{supervisory system}} was largely fragmented, with the banking, securities, insurance, and <b>non-bank</b> <b>sectors</b> individually managed and regulated by a separate agency. Furthermore, {{the authority of}} supervision was split between two governing entities, i.e. the supervisory agencies and the Ministry of Finance and Economy (formerly known as the Ministry of Finance; currently the Ministry of Strategy and Finance). Under this segregated supervisory system, the banking sector was overseen by the Bank of Korea and the ministry, the securities sector by the Securities Supervisory Board and the ministry, and the insurance sector by the Insurance Supervisory Board and the ministry. As to non-bank financial institutions established after the 1970s, the overall authority lay with the ministry while functions of examination were delegated to the Banking Supervisory Authority within the Bank of Korea and the Korea Non-Bank Deposit Insurance Corporation.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} compares {{systemic risk}} in the banking sector, the insurance sector, the construction sector, and the food sector. To measure systemic risk, we use extreme negative returns in stock market data for a time-varying panel of the 20 largest U. S. firms in each sector. We find that systemic risk is significantly larger in the banking sector relative to the other three sectors. This result is robust to separating out correlations with an economy-wide stock market index. For the <b>non-banking</b> <b>sectors,</b> the ordering from high to low systemic risk is: insurance sector, construction sector, and food sector. The difference between the insurance sector and the construction sector is no longer significant after correcting for correlations with {{the economy as a}} whole. The correction has a large effect for the banking sector and the insurance sector, and a smaller effect for the other two sectors. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} new half-yearly time {{series for the}} asset ratios of commercial banks in England and Wales, 1860 - 1913. The series reveal new evidence {{on the nature of}} the banks' business and are, therefore, relevant to the debate on the role of banks in British economic development. The new estimates are used to examine trends and short-term changes in bank liquidity. Analysis is concerned with the changing stability of bank asset structure and with substitutability across different asset ratios. The main finding is of a sharp, long-term increase in liquidity and a concomitant decline in bank credit to the <b>non-bank,</b> private <b>sector.</b> The article also highlights the significance of short-term shocks to the trend increase in bank liquidity. The new findings are supportive of the argument that, over time, English banks became less involved with the <b>non-bank</b> private <b>sector.</b> In general, the results confirm that the English and Welsh bank asset structure became more liquid over time. However, no detailed breakdown of bank loans to the <b>non-bank,</b> private <b>sector</b> (for example, between business loans and personal loans), is available for this period. Moreover, the current study offers no evidence as to the trend in financial provision to the business sector from institutions other than the commercial banks. Nevertheless, the results are clear in showing a strong upward trend in commercial bank liquidity and a relative decline in private sector credit provision by the commercial banks.

30|$|The chaebol of Korea, which {{appeared}} in the 1950 s, rapidly accumulated wealth through foreign aid and government property transfers to private ownership. Under Park, who came to power in the 1960 s, the chaebol dominated the product market of Korea, assisted by heavy and chemical industry policy and an import-substitution industrialization policy. The government intensively supported the chaebol in order to raise the competitiveness of Korean corporations in the international market. Furthermore, the financial liberalization policy of the 1980 s helped the chaebol to enter the financial market. The chaebol expanded to the <b>non-banking</b> <b>sector</b> immediately, prompted by deregulation of non-bank depository institutions and the privatization of some government-owned banks. Through financial liberalization and the growth of the stock market, the fund-raising strategy of the chaebol changed from indirect to direct. This has been noted in previous research and is also found in the FOF accounts used in this analysis, which are composed of only financial items.|$|R
30|$|The {{shrinking}} {{of overseas}} demand is {{largely due to}} the debt crisis in Europe and weak economic recovery in the USA, both of which are quite beyond Chinese control. Even though it may seem as though weak domestic demand is caused by restrictions on the housing industry and squeezes on demand for local financing, the real culprit is defective policies. Some have suggested that China’s current economic woes are partly attributable to mid- and long-term factors such as tight profit margins and excess capacity within <b>non-banking</b> <b>sectors.</b> While this is true, knowing this fact sheds no light on how to choose the best macroeconomic policy responses. As was noted above, a basic requirement of short-term policies is that they distinguish between short-term and long-term economic factors. We can, therefore, try to understand the feasibility of policy fine-tuning by focusing on two short-term factors: the regulation of the real estate industry and the squeeze on demand for local financing.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether contagion {{is present in}} the banking sector by analyzing how banks are affected by negative earnings surprises from their competitors. The banking sector is of crucial importance for the economy and, thus, highly regulated on an individual bank level. However, a high degree of contagion risk should call for a regulation of the financial network rather than solely regulating on an individual level. To {{be able to make a}} judgement about the magnitude of possible contagion effects we compare the results of the banking sector with the results of the non-banking industries. We find that earnings surprises cause significant contagion in the banking sector. In contrast, we do not find this effect in the <b>non-banking</b> <b>sectors,</b> including the insurance sector. The magnitude of contagion in the banking sector is positively related with the size of the bank reporting an earnings surprise, as well as the size of the affected banks...|$|R
