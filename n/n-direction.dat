40|$|Small {{maps of the}} Rees-Sciama (RS) effect are {{simulated}} {{by using}} an appropriate N-body code and a certain ray-tracing procedure. A method designed for the statistical analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps is applied to study the resulting simulations. These techniques, recently proposed [...] by our team [...] to consider lens deformations of the CMB, are adapted {{to deal with the}} RS effect. This effect and the deviations from Gaussianity associated to it seem to be too small to be detected in the near future. This conclusion follows from our estimation of both the RS angular power spectrum and the RS reduced <b>n-direction</b> correlation functions for n< 7.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{constructing}} smooth <b>n-direction</b> fields (line fields, cross fields, etc.) on surfaces that is {{an order of magnitude}} faster than state-of-the-art methods, while still producing fields of equal or better quality. Fields produced by the method are globally optimal {{in the sense that they}} minimize a simple, well-defined quadratic smoothness energy over all possible configurations of singularities (number, location, and index). The method is fully automatic and can optionally produce fields aligned with a given guidance field such as principal curvature directions. Computationally the smoothest field is found via a sparse eigenvalue problem involving a matrix similar to the cotan-Laplacian. When a guidance field is present, finding the optimal field amounts to solving a single linear system...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{introduce}} a discrete definition of connection on simplicial manifolds, involving closed-form continuous expressions within simplices and finite rotations across simplices. The finite-dimensional parameters of this connection are optimally computed by minimizing a quadratic {{measure of the}} deviation to the (discontinuous) Levi-Civita connection induced by the embedding of the input triangle mesh, or to any metric connection with arbitrary cone singularities at vertices. From this discrete connection, a covariant derivative is constructed through exact differentiation, leading to explicit expressions for local integrals of first-order derivatives (such as divergence, curl, and the Cauchy-Riemann operator) and for L_ 2 -based energies (such as the Dirichlet energy). We finally demonstrate the utility, flexibility, and accuracy of our discrete formulations for the design and analysis of vector, n-vector, and <b>n-direction</b> fields...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOrthonormal ridgelets {{provide an}} {{orthonormal}} basis for L 2 (R 2) built from special angularly-integrated ridge functions. In this {{paper we explore}} the relationship between orthonormal ridgelets and true ridge functions r(x 1 cosθ+x 2 sinθ). We derive a formula for the ridgelet coefficients of a ridge function {{in terms of the}} 1 -D wavelet coefficients of the ridge profile r(t). The formula shows that the ridgelet coefficients of a ridge function are heavily concentrated in ridge parameter space near the underlying scale, direction, and location of the ridge function. It also shows that the rearranged weighted ridgelet coefficients of a ridge function decay at essentially the same rate as the rearranged weighted 1 -D wavelet coefficients of the 1 -D ridge profile r(t). In short, the full ridgelet expansion of a ridge function is in a certain sense equally as sparse as the 1 -D wavelet expansion of the ridge profile. It follows that partial ridgelet expansions can give good approximations to objects which are countable superpositions of well-behaved ridge functions. We study the nonlinear approximation operator which “kills” coefficients below certain thresholds (depending on angular- and ridge-scale); we show that for approximating objects which are countable superpositions of ridge functions with 1 -D ridge profiles in the Besov space B 1 /pp, p(R), 0 <p< 1, the thresholded ridgelet approximation achieves optimal rates of N-term approximation. This implies that appropriate thresholding in the ridgelet basis is equally as good, for certain purposes, as an ideally-adapted N-term nonlinear ridge approximation, based on perfect choice of <b>N-directions...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} Potts model (defined geometrically {{in the cluster}} picture) on finite {{two-dimensional}} lattices of size L x N, with boundary conditions that are free in the L-direction and periodic in the <b>N-direction.</b> The decomposition of the partition function {{in terms of the}} characters K_ 1 + 2 l (with l= 0, 1, [...] .,L) has previously been studied using various approaches (quantum groups, combinatorics, transfer matrices). We first show that the K_ 1 + 2 l thus defined actually coincide, and can be written as traces of suitable transfer matrices in the cluster picture. We then proceed to similarly decompose constrained partition functions in which exactly j clusters are non-contractible with respect to the periodic lattice direction, and a partition function with fixed transverse boundary conditions.

40|$|B-splines are {{attractive}} basis functions for the continuous-domain representation of biomedical images and volumes. In this paper, we {{prove that the}} extended family of box splines are closed under the Radon transform and derive explicit for-mulae for their transforms. Our results are general; they cover all known brands of compactly-supported box splines (tensor-product B-splines, separable or not) in any dimensions. In particular, we prove that the 2 -D Radon transform of an <b>N-direction</b> box spline is generally a (non-uniform) polynomial spline of degree N − 1. The proposed framework allows for a proper discretization {{of a variety of}} 2 -D and 3 -D tomographic reconstruction problems in a box spline basis.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} ingredient for semantic labeling is {{a reliable}} method for determining and representing the relevant spatial features of an environment. We address this challenge for planar metric-topological maps based on occupancy grids. Our method detects arbitrary dominant orientations {{in the presence}} of significant clutter, fits corresponding line features with tunable resolution, and extracts topological information by polygonal cell decomposition. Real-world case studies taken from the target application domain (autonomous forklift trucks in warehouses) demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method, while results from a preliminary algorithm to extract corridors, and junctions, demonstrate its expressiveness. Contribution of this work starts with the formulation of metric-topological surveying of environment, and a generic <b>n-direction</b> planar representation accompanied with a general method for extracting it from occupancy map. The implementation also includes some semantic labels specific to warehouse like environments. © 2014 IEEE.

40|$|Image edge {{gradient}} direction {{not only}} contains important information of the shape, {{but also has}} a simple, lower complexity characteristic. Considering that the edge gradient direction histograms and edge direction autocorrelogram {{do not have the}} rotation invariance, we put forward the image retrieval algorithm which is based on edge gradient orientation statistical code (hereinafter referred to as EGOSC) by sharing the application of the statistics method in the edge direction of the chain code in eight neighborhoods to the statistics of the edge gradient direction. Firstly, we construct the <b>n-direction</b> vector and make maximal summation restriction on EGOSC to make sure this algorithm is invariable for rotation effectively. Then, we use Euclidean distance of edge gradient direction entropy to measure shape similarity, so that this method is not sensitive to scaling, color, and illumination change. The experimental results and the algorithm analysis demonstrate that the algorithm can be used for content-based image retrieval and has good retrieval results...|$|E

In fact, the CAC property of Q 2 indicates its solution u(n,m) can be consistently embedded into a 3 -dimension cube (see Fig.  1 (b)). Although there is no explicit independent variable l in u(n,m), one can introduce a bar shift (shift in l-direction) for it according to [...] [...] or [...] [...] shifts. For example, for w defined in (2.3), we have w= 1 / 2 (A α^nβ^mα+A^- 1 α^-nβ^-mα^- 1) and α is related to p (the spacing parameter of <b>n-direction)</b> as in (2.4). Then w̅ should be accordingly defined as w= 1 / 2 (A α^nβ^m s +A^- 1 α^-nβ^-ms^- 1) and s is related to the spacing parameter k of l-direction by k=(1 -s)^ 2 / 2 s, which is coincident with (2.4). For x_i defined in (2.7), we have x_i=x_i+c^i where we suppose c^ 2 =k to coincide with (2.8).|$|E
40|$|While scalar {{fields on}} {{surfaces}} have been staples of geometry processing, {{the use of}} tangent vector fields has steadily grown in geometry processing {{over the last two}} decades: they are crucial to encode both directions and sizing on surfaces as commonly required in tasks such as texture synthesis, non-photorealistic rendering, digital grooming, and meshing. There are, however, a variety of discrete representations of tangent vector fields on triangle meshes, and each approach offers different trade-offs among simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy depending on the targeted application. This course reviews the three main families of discretizations used to design computational tools for vector field processing on triangle meshes: face-based, edge-based, and vertex-based representations. In the process of reviewing the computational tools offered by these representations, we go over a large body of recent developments in vector field processing in the area of discrete differential geometry. We also discuss the theoretical and practical limitations of each type of discretization, and cover increasingly-common extensions such as <b>n-direction</b> and n-vector fields. While the course will focus on explaining the key approaches to practical encoding (including data structures) and manipulation (including discrete operators) of finite-dimensional vector fields, important differential geometric notions will also be covered: as often in Discrete Differential Geometry, the discrete picture will be used to illustrate deep continuous concepts such as covariant derivatives, metric connections, or Bochner Laplacians...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of cyclic decapeptides {{based on the}} loloatin family of bioactive cyclic peptides is described. Two procedures were used. In the first procedure, developed at Bayer AG Central Research, the resin-linked linear decapeptides were assembled manually in the C- to <b>N-direction</b> by iterative coupling reaction employing TentaGel S RAM resin, with coupling reactions performed in DMF with excess of Fmoc amino acid derivatives, and excess of the coupling reagent DCC/HOBt. Fmoc deprotection was effected with 20 % piperidine in DMF, Pd(PPh 3) 4 was used for allyl deprotection, and cyclization was effected with TBTU and HOBt in N-methylpyrrolidone solution with DIEA. Residues were purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and products identified by FAB-MS and NMR spectroscopy. In this way were synthesized all-L loloatin A [cyclic (L-valyl-L-ornithyl-L-leucyl-L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl-L-phenyl-alanyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-tyrosyl) (10 %); an unidentified product corresponding partly {{to the structure of}} all-L loloatin B [cyclic (L-valyl-L-ornithyl-L-leucyl-L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl-L-phenyl- alanyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophanyl) ] (12 %), and all-L loloatin C [cyclic (L-valyl-L-ornithyl-L-leucyl-L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl-L-tryptophanyl-L- phenylalanyl-L-asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophanyl) (19 %), whose structure was confirmed by FAB-MS, and NMR data. Because of low yields, and difficulties in purification, the resin and peptide coupling was substantially modified for the preparation of natural loloatins A-C, as follows. Polystyrene AM-RAM resin was used, and coupling reactions performed in 25 % DMF in 1, 2 -dichloroethane with 3 -fold excess of Fmoc amino acid derivatives, and 3 -fold excess of PyBOP/DIEA coupling reagent. The reaction progress was monitored with bromophenol blue. Fmoc- and allyl deprotection was carried out as described above. An excess of HATU/HOAt/DIEA was used for cyclizing the peptide. The residues were purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and FAB-MS and NMR spectra were acquired to confirm the structures of target compounds. In this way were synthesized loloatin A [cyclic (L-valyl-L-ornithyl-L-leucyl-D-tyrosyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-tyrosyl) ] (30. 9 %), loloatin B [cyclic (L-valyl-L-ornithyl-L-leucyl-D-tyrosyl-L-prolyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophanyl) ] (34. 6 %), and loloatin C [cyclic (L-valyl-L-ornithyl-L-leucyl-D-tyrosyl-L-prolyl-L-tryptophanyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-asparaginyl-L-asparaginyl-L-tryptophanyl) (36. 6 %), where all the structures were consistently confirmed by FAB-MS, HRMS and 1 H-NMR and 2 D NMR data. In addition, the new procedure was applied to {{synthesis of}} all-L loloatin B [cyclic (L-valyl-L-ornithyl-L-leucyl-L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophanyl) ] (35. 4 %), of which the structure was also confirmed. By use of NOESY spectra, it was established preliminarily the 3 D structures of loloatins. There are no turn or sheet structures in loloatin A. Whilst for loloation B, there is a γ-turn between Asp 9, Tyr 10, Val 1, with a hydrogen bond between Asp-CO and Val-NH, and a hydrogen bond between Val-CO and D-Phe-NH, suggesting the presence of a β-sheet among D-Phe 7, Asn 8, Asp 9, Tyr 1, Val 1. As for loloatin C, there is a type I β-turn between Leu 3, Tyr 4, Pro 5, and a hydrogen bond between Pro-CO and Leu-NH, implying the presence of a 10 -membered ring within the cyclic peptide; a intramolucular hydrogen bond also is found between Asn 8 -NH and Val 1 -CO. The CNS-X-Plor program was applied to establish the solution conformations of loloatin C in three different solutions. In DMSO solution, the molecule was shown to possess a hydrophobic aromatic "wall" consisting of Trp 6 and Phe 7, and a type I β-turn structure involving Val 1, Tip 10, Asp 9 and Asn 8 with a hydrophobic “head” at Val 1, Trp 10 and a hydrophilic “tail” at Asp 9 and Asn 8; another type I β-turn between Leu 3, Tyr 4, Pro 5, and Trp 6 was also located. However, in 70 / 30 TFE-d 3 /HZO, loloatin C is shown to possess a dumbbell structure. The 3 D structure of loloatin C in 30 / 70 TFE-d 3 /H 2 O is shown to possess a dumbbell structure. The 3 D structure of loloation C in 30 / 70 TFE-d 3 /H 2 O is similar to that in DMSO. A simple although expeditious 'Sliding Window’ device has been applied to locate the pharmocophore of loloatin C. The device was used to identify three cyclic hexapeptide substructures of loloatin C, namely the 'Southern', the 'Central', and the 'Northern' cyclic hexapeptides. These were then synthesized. Whilst solid phase methods were successful for synthesis of the first two, a solution phase method has to be used for the 'Northern' peptide. The key of the solution phase synthesis was the development of an in situ cyclization method to conduct the final cyclization of the linear peptide. The solution phase methods were then used to synthesize the 'Central' and 'Southern' sequence cyclic peptides as well. The yields for the cyclization were very good, ranging between 70 to 85 %. Structures of the cyclic hexapeptides were confirmed by a combination of FAB-MS and NMR data. Antibiotic tests show that the ‘Northern’ cyclic hexapeptide possesses the highest activity amongst the peptide mimetics. Therefore the basic pharmacophore of loloatin C is suggested to be -Trp-D-Tyr-. Synthesis of other peptide mimics based on reverse turn mimetics and conformational restriction were not successful...|$|E
