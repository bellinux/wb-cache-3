5|$|Against the Houston Texans in Week 9, {{he became}} the first quarterback to pass for over 40,000 yards in a decade. He threw a career-high 25 passes in the first quarter (most in any opening quarter since 1991), and had a career-high 40 pass {{attempts}} in the first half. He set a franchise record for most 300-yard passing games in a season with his seventh 300-yard effort of the season (also an <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> through the first eight games of a season). Three weeks later, against Houston, Manning claimed his 34th comeback win in the fourth quarter, tying him with John Elway and Johnny Unitas for the second most in NFL history. On Week 15 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Manning won his 23rd consecutive regular season game breaking Jim McMahon's <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> of 22 straight wins with the Chicago Bears from 1984 to 1987.

5|$|Needing a win {{to clinch}} the 5th {{seed in the}} playoffs, Manning had {{one of his best}} career {{performances}} in Jacksonville on Thursday Night Football. He completed his first 17 passes of the game. In addition to completing his last 6 against Detroit, Manning's 23 straight completions fell one shy of the <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> (Donovan McNabb– 24). The Colts trailed 14–0 {{in the first half and}} 24–14 to start the fourth quarter. Manning led his seventh fourth quarter win of the season and the Colts put the game away with a defensive touchdown for a 31–24 victory to clinch a seventh consecutive playoff berth. Manning completed 29-of-34 passes (85.7%) for 364 yards and three touchdowns. It increased his <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> streak of seasons with 25 touchdown passes to 11. Manning and the Colts tied an <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> by winning three games in a season in which they trailed by at least 14 points. For his efforts Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in 2008. It was the 19th time he has won the award, passing Dan Marino for the most all-time since the award was originated in 1984. He also was selected as the FedEx Air Player of the Week. With the playoff seed secured, Manning only played the opening drive in a shutout against the division-leading Titans in Week 17. He completed all seven of his passes for 95 yards and a touchdown, extending his <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> to nine seasons with 4,000 yards passing, and also extended the record to a sixth straight season he led the Colts to at least 12 wins. At the end of the 2008 season, Manning was named NFL MVP for the 3rd time, tying Brett Favre for the most MVP awards in NFL history.|$|E
5|$|Two fumbles deep in New England Patriots {{territory}} overcame {{a stubborn}} Buccaneer effort. The Patriots’ 260 rushing yards stood {{for years as}} the most allowed in a game by the Buccaneers, while their total of four pass completions remains the least by a Tampa Bay opponent. New England came from behind twice on Andy Johnson touchdown runs, and took the lead for good on Sam Hunt’s 58-yard return of a Steve Spurrier interception. Johnson’s first touchdown run was a 69-yarder that set a club record. Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan set an <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> with four seconds left, rushing for his 12th touchdown of the year. The Buccaneers also set an <b>NFL</b> <b>record,</b> by becoming the only team to go winless in a 14-game season.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite his}} success and {{important}} AFL records, {{he is most}} prominently listed in the <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> book for less flattering accomplishments, including his place as a former record holder for most quarterback sacks in a game.

5|$|Under {{head coach}} Dennis Green, the Vikings were {{perennial}} playoff contenders throughout the 1990s, but they experienced little success once {{they reached the}} postseason. In {{the first round of}} the 1998 NFL Draft, the Vikings selected wide receiver Randy Moss, who, despite his talent, was passed by several teams, even those in need of a wide receiver, due to concerns surrounding Moss's misbehavior and multiple arrests during high school and college. Moss used this as motivation to make teams who passed on him regret their decision. That year, Moss set the <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> for most touchdown receptions by a rookie with 17, and combined with future Hall of Fame wide receiver Cris Carter and quarterback Randall Cunningham, he formed the centerpiece of the Vikings' offensive attack, which also set an <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> by scoring 556 points during the season. The Vikings' defense was led by future Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle and was ranked 6th overall in points allowed during the season.|$|E
5|$|For the Colts, Rhodes {{rushed for}} 113yards and a touchdown, while also {{catching}} an 8-yard reception. Addai rushed for 77yards and caught 10 passes for 66yards. Wilkins returned four kickoffs for 89yards and 3 punts for 42yards. Adam Vinatieri {{became the first}} kicker ever to play in five Super Bowls {{and the first to}} win four Super Bowl rings. Vinatieri's three field goals and two extra points gave him a total of 49 points for the entire 2006 post-season, an <b>NFL</b> <b>record.</b> The Colts' win was the first major professional championship for Indiana since the Indiana Pacers' ABA title in the 1972–73 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year in the league, Kolb was {{promoted}} to second-string quarterback ahead of A. J. Feeley. He played the entire {{second half of the}} Eagles game against the Baltimore Ravens on November 23 after an infamous benching of McNabb. Kolb threw an interception in the endzone to Ed Reed, who took it back 108yards for a touchdown, an <b>NFL</b> <b>record.</b> Kolb completed only 17 passes on 34 attempts for 144yards, throwing no touchdowns and four interceptions during the season.|$|E

He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} best return specialists in NFL history, and was the first person ever to return the opening kick of the Super Bowl back for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Van Buren {{retired as}} the <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> holder for career rushing yards and career rushing touchdowns. He {{was the first}} player to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season twice, and he held the top two single-season records in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. He was the first to rush for over ten touchdowns in a season, a feat he {{accomplished}} three times before any other player did so once.

5|$|Aided by Motley's {{swiftness}} and size, the Browns won the NFL {{championship in}} 1950, their first {{season in the}} league. In October 1950, Motley set an <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> that stood for more than 52 years when he averaged over 17 yards per rush against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with 188 yards on 11 carries. In December 2002, quarterback Michael Vick of the Atlanta Falcons rushed for 173 yards on 10 carries against the Minnesota Vikings, eclipsing Motley's average. Motley also had a 69-yard rushing and 33-yard receiving touchdowns in the game. While Motley did not factor in the Browns' championship game win against the Los Angeles Rams, he {{led the league in}} rushing with 810 yards in 1950 despite averaging fewer than 12 carries per game. He was a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection.|$|E
5|$|As he was {{preparing}} to begin post-graduate studies in orthodontics at Loyola University in Chicago, Cannon {{received a call from}} Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram. Stram signed Cannon to a one-year contract and he played in six games for the Chiefs in 1970, catching two touchdowns before a season-ending injury convinced him to retire. He ended his eleven-year professional career with 2,455 yards rushing, 3,656 receiving yards, and 64 touchdowns on offense. He also threw one touchdown pass and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon holds the <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> for the most yards from scrimmage in a non-overtime game (330 against the New York Titans in 1961) and is tied with four other players for the most touchdown receptions by a running back in a season (nine in 1961).|$|E
5|$|From Weeks 916, he {{recorded}} consecutive games with 125receiving yards or more, which broke the <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> previously held by Pat Studstill.

Johnson was also named a starter for the NFC in the Pro Bowl played in Honolulu, Hawaii. Johnson finished with 72yards against Chicago in week17, {{missing out on}} 2,000 by just 36yards. Johnson finished the season leading the league in receptions (122) and receiving yards (1,964). Johnson is the only player in the Super Bowl era (since 1967) to average 120 yards per game in a season when he averaged 122.8 yards per game in 2012.|$|E
50|$|On October 20, 2013, Boykin {{received}} his first career {{start in the}} <b>NFL,</b> <b>recording</b> 8 receptions for 103 {{yards and a touchdown}} in a victory over the Cleveland Browns.|$|R

50|$|The Chiefs' offense {{also set}} two new <b>NFL</b> <b>records</b> with the fewest fumbles {{in a season}} (7, broken in 2010) and fewest fumbles lost in a season (2), the latter of which still stands.|$|R
5|$|St. Louis Cardinals Pro Bowl rookie Vai Sikahema tied an <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> by {{returning}} two punts for touchdowns as the Buccaneers clinched the NFL's worst {{record for the}} second consecutive year. Frank Garcia, playing with a back injury, had a third punt blocked for a net gain of 1 yard. The Buccaneers scored first, on a 1-yard Bobby Howard run, but the Cardinals' 21 unanswered points gave them the lead for good before halftime. A 33-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young to Phil Freeman brought the Buccaneers to within 4 points in the third quarter. The game not only ended a futile season for the Buccaneers, but also concluded the Cardinals' worst season since moving to St. Louis 27 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Browns' {{debut in}} the NFL in the 1950 season was closely watched; while the team {{dominated}} the AAFC in its short existence, some sportswriters, NFL owners and coaches considered the league inferior. Cleveland put all doubts to rest in its first game against the two-time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles, winning 35–10. In {{a game against the}} Washington Redskins later in the season, Groza broke a 24-year-old <b>NFL</b> <b>record</b> by kicking his 13th field goal of the season. He also scored the only touchdown of his career in that game on a reception from Graham. The Browns ended the regular season with a 10–2 record in the American Conference, tied with the New York Giants. That forced a playoff against the Giants in which Groza kicked the winning field goal for the Browns with under a minute to play.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{acquired}} University of Michigan All-American quarterback Harry Newman {{and versatile}} free agent halfback Ken Strong before the 1933 season. New York finished 11–3, {{first in the}} new Eastern Division. Newman led the NFL in passes completed (53), passing yards (973), touchdown passes (11), and longest pass completion (78 yards), with his passing yardage total setting an <b>NFL</b> <b>record.</b> New York's resurgence was led {{by some of the}} league's best linemen, such as Ray Flaherty and future Hall of Famers Red Badgro, and Hein. They advanced to play in the league's first official championship game in Chicago's Wrigley Field versus the Bears, where they lost 23–21 in a game which had six lead changes.|$|E
50|$|Downs helped {{anchor the}} Cowboys {{secondary}} {{for most of}} the eighties decade. He played nine seasons in the <b>NFL,</b> <b>recorded</b> 8 sacks, 35 interceptions with 470 return yards and three touchdowns (one from int return and two from fumble returns).|$|R
50|$|Moore {{also played}} briefly for the New York Giants and {{finished}} his 12 NFL seasons with 670 receptions for 9,174 yards and 62 touchdowns. Herman Moore holds <b>NFL</b> <b>records</b> for both receptions (61) and receiving yards (965) on Thursday games.|$|R
