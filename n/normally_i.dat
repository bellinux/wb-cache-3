500|$|Andrew Keir as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Nigel Kneale {{had long}} been highly {{critical}} of Brian Donlevy's interpretation of Quatermass and lobbied for the role to be recast, arguing that enough time had passed that audiences would not resist a change of actor. A number of actors were considered for the part including André Morell who had played Quatermass in the television version of Quatermass and the Pit. However, Morell {{was not interested in}} revisiting a role he had already played. The producers eventually settled on Scottish actor Andrew Keir who had appeared in supporting roles in a number of Hammer productions including The Pirates of Blood River (1962), The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964) and [...] (1966). Keir found the shoot an unhappy experience: he later recalled, “The director – Roy Ward Baker – didn't want me for the role. He wanted Kenneth More... {{and it was a very}} unhappy shoot. [...] <b>Normally</b> <b>I</b> enjoy going to work every day. But for seven and a half weeks it was sheer hell.” Roy Ward Baker denied he had wanted Kenneth More, who he felt would be [...] "too nice" [...] for the role, saying, “I had no idea he [...] was unhappy while we were shooting. His performance was absolutely right in every detail and I was presenting him as the star of the picture. Perhaps I should have interfered more.” Keir went on to appear for Hammer in The Viking Queen (1967) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971). He reprised the role of Quatermass for BBC Radio 3 in The Quatermass Memoirs (1996), making him the only actor other than Donlevy to play the role more than once.|$|E

After {{taking a break from}} showbiz, Nina announced that she gave birth to a baby girl, Ysabella Louise, on December 24, 2015 after an eight-year relationship with her husband Coy Enriquez. She labored for 13 hours and decided to give a painful birth, without anaesthesia, to feel the sacrifices of being a mother. In an interview with Philippine Entertainment Portal, she expressed choosing to keep her personal life private, stating [...] "I chose to be quiet and just go on with my life <b>normally.</b> <b>I</b> have people in my life who are also into their privacy.
