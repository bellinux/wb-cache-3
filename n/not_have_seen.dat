The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down wide receiver Danny Oquendo, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters. Consequently, {{a much younger}} line-up started for Maryland, including, according to Friedgen, some who probably would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> playing time otherwise.|$|E

25|$|In 1912 the {{photographic}} motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey particularly interested {{artists of the}} Section d'Or, including Jean Metzinger, Marcel Duchamp and Albert Gleizes. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, chronophotography involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for {{the scientific study of}} movement. These chronophotographs included a series of dancers and women washing. Though Gleizes may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> these specific photographs he was likely interested in the same idea, as were the Futurists. The motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing too at the time.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s {{there were}} a spate of film dealing with various aspects of heavenly administration: Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Heaven Can Wait (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and It’s a Wonderful Life (1946). Beckett may or may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> any of these; {{at the very least}} he would have likely read about them. Significantly the opening camera shot of It’s a Wonderful Life dissolves slowly upward into the star-filled, dark night sky where two {{pulsating}} galaxies of light come into view. Two heavenly angels are conversing together in the film's otherworldly opening. In Rough for Theatre II, Bertrand and Morvan take time out to specifically discuss the starry night sky.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite these}} {{setbacks}} and the cooling of religious fervor, {{word of the}} Northampton revival and Edwards's leadership role had spread as far as England and Scotland. It was {{at this time that}} Edwards was acquainted with George Whitefield, who was traveling the Thirteen Colonies on a revival tour in 1739–40. The two men may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> eye to eye on every detail. Whitefield was far more comfortable with the strongly emotional elements of revival than Edwards was, but they were both passionate about preaching the Gospel. They worked together to orchestrate Whitefield's trip, first through Boston and then to Northampton. When Whitefield preached at Edwards's church in Northampton, he reminded them of the revival they had experienced just a few years before. This deeply touched Edwards, who wept throughout the entire service, and much of the congregation too was moved.|$|E

25|$|The countercultural artists {{movement}} of the post-Revolutionary period, beginning in the 1920s, was clearly political and aimed at allowing other voices {{in the development of}} a modern Mexico. In Guadalupe Marín's novel La Única (The Unique Woman) she speaks of violence against women, misogyny and lack of citizenship for women, but also feminine and homosexual desires. She presented publicly the understanding that sexuality has a political component. Frida Kahlo's work, blending both masculine and feminine gender perceptions, challenged false perceptions, as did Maria Izquierdo's insistence on her right to be independent of any state or cultural attempts to define her art. Tina Modotti's move away from portraiture and toward images of social change through the lens of realism and revolutionary action and Concha Michel’s dedication to the rights and status of Mexican women, without challenging sexual inequality, represented a more humanist rather than feminist approach to their art. Whereas Michel explored feminism and politics with Anita Brenner, Modotti did not. The women were bound by their questioning of women's place in Mexico and society with their art, but they did not formally join with the suffragettes or in feminist organizations. In retrospect these artists have become feminist icons because their actions and work questioned gender restrictions, but in their time, they may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> themselves in that way.|$|E
25|$|In November 1996, Mike Eidson, a Miami attorney, {{said in an}} {{interview}} that many of the passengers had survived the initial impact but had drowned afterward. Eidson represented 41 passengers and crew in a lawsuit contending that the aircraft's manufacturer, Boeing, bore responsibility for the disaster, as the company ought to have foreseen the misuse of its products. The suit was filed against Boeing in federal court in Miami in May 1997. According to the complaint, the flightdeck errors were caused by careless maintenance by Aeroperú and negligence and defective design by Boeing. Boeing argued that it was not at fault, and that responsibility for the accident lay with the employee who did not remove the tape from the static ports, and the aircraft's pilot for not noticing the tape still applied by visual check. Richard Rodriguez of the NTSB said that it was understandable that Schreiber did not find the tape because the maintenance worker had used duct tape instead of the brightly colored tape that he was supposed to use. In addition, Rodriguez said that the pitot-static ports were high above the ground. Therefore, Schreiber could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the tape against the fuselage. After extensive litigation, the parties agreed to transfer the case against Boeing and Aeroperú to an international arbitration in Santiago, Chile, for a determination of the damages. The defendants agreed not to contest liability in Chile.|$|E

500|$|When {{compared}} to the other contemporary Australian hospital ships, Centaur was the smallest, approximately a third of the size of Manunda or Wanganella. Centaur was also slightly shorter than I-177. The observation of Centaur was made through a periscope, and submarine officers attest that at , the optimum range of attack for World War II–era Japanese submarines, some officers {{would not be able to}} clearly identify a target ship's profile or hull markings. With Centaurs bow floodlights out, and with the observation of the target made through the periscope, there is a possibility Nakagawa would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the hospital ship's markings if he had been in the wrong position. Apart from the two bow floodlights, Centaur was lit up brilliantly. To attack, I-177 would have had to approach from [...] of Centaur, which was illuminated by both its own lights and a full moon.|$|E

She noted that if the video did not exist, she would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the tomboy side of Beyoncé.

500|$|Kurosawa {{decided to}} write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less {{expensive}} to produce. The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail, based on the Kabuki play Kanjinchō and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the occupation of Japan had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly [...] "feudal" [...] and banned the work. (It would not be released until 1952, the year another Kurosawa film, Ikiru, was also released.) Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and [...] "democratic" [...] (they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken), so the movie most probably would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> {{the light of day}} even if the war had continued beyond its completion.|$|E

500|$|Greed {{received}} mostly negative reviews. The {{trade paper}} Harrison's Report said that [...] "f a contest {{were to be}} held to determine {{which has been the}} filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture {{in the history of the}} motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win." [...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in." [...] A March 1925 review in Pictureplay magazine stated, [...] "perhaps an American director would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> greed as a vice." ...|$|E
