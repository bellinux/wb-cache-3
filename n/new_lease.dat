5|$|The {{next season}} {{started with the}} death of goalkeeper Aaron Flahavan and the {{departure}} of Primus' close friend Moore to West Bromwich Albion. Primus struggled to get a game under Rix but the appointment of Harry Redknapp in March 2002 gave him a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life and he ended that season with two league goals in games against Bradford City and Barnsley.|$|E
5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{company went}} {{bankrupt}} and {{was bought by}} the state in 1886. This briefly gave it a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life, but the canal had an obsolete gauge. By {{the start of the}} 20th century it was almost abandoned. The canal was neglected and parts were filled in. In the 1970s the A47 autoroute between Givors and Saint-Étienne covered almost all the sections that remained, apart from the site at Tartaras where the double lock and tunnel have been preserved as a heritage site.|$|E
50|$|One of Laverdure's major {{accomplishments in}} his various roles at Interior was {{shepherding}} <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> regulations through the regulatory reform process.

5|$|In {{this era}} Scotland {{followed}} {{the trend of}} Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V, {{as well as being}} a major patron of sacred music, was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.|$|E
5|$|She starred {{alongside}} Natalie Deselle Reid in the 1997 comedy film B*A*P*S. In 1998, Berry received {{praise for}} her role in Bulworth as an intelligent woman raised by activists who gives a politician (Warren Beatty) a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> on life. The same year, she played the singer Zola Taylor, one of the three wives of pop singer Frankie Lymon, in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love. In the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, she portrayed {{the first black woman to}} be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and it was to Berry a heart-felt project that she introduced, co-produced and fought intensely for it to come through. Berry's performance was recognized with several awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s saw the {{construction}} of the Employment Exchange and the planning of the new Council House, although this was not completed until 1956. As a centre of aircraft manufacturing, Bristol was a target for bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. Bristol's city centre was severely damaged, especially in November and December 1940, when the Broadmead area was flattened, and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city. The original central area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park featuring two bombed-out churches and fragments of the castle. A third bombed church has been given a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life as the St Nicholas' Church Museum. Slightly to the north, the Broadmead shopping centre was built over bomb-damaged areas. Clifton Cathedral, {{to the north of the}} city centre, was built during the early 1970s.|$|E

According to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), the market share of all <b>new</b> <b>leased</b> cars reached 4% in 2015, while a record 4.7% of all <b>new</b> <b>leased</b> cars registered during {{the last quarter of}} 2015was a plug-in.|$|R
5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her <b>new</b> <b>lease,</b> and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E
5|$|The {{alliance}} {{celebrated its}} first anniversary in August 2016 {{with a new}} joint operations center and continued growth in traffic, despite a drop in shipping caused by slower growth in Asia. Later that month, Hanjin Shipping, a major operator in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy and was barred from the Port of Seattle over fears of unpaid terminal fees. The bankruptcy sent the global shipping industry into a panic, with several Hanjin ships anchored off the Pacific coast awaiting approval to unload cargo. In December, Hanjin's Terminal 46 in Seattle was sold to an affiliate of Mediterranean Shipping Company for $78 million; the move was opposed by the Port of Seattle, who filed a request to block the sale over a lack of correspondence about the <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> and security deposit.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave it a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life, during {{a period in which}} many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing money to do so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that the work on the castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had to pay for it all directly. The porter's lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} James V's {{daughter}} Mary from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her {{position as a}} Catholic, gave a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. James VI was a major patron {{of the arts in}} general. He made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, attempting to revive burgh song schools from 1579. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When he went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. Beginning to fall into disrepair, the Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, leaving the court in Westminster as the only major source of royal musical patronage.|$|E

50|$|The {{issuance}} of <b>new</b> <b>leases</b> resumed in April 1829. However this only continued until 1832, when the Lieutenant Governor advised the Corporation to discontinue the {{issuance of}} leases after a bill was passed to combine the clergy reserves with Crown land. At this point, Markland was appointed Inspector General and a new Secretary Receiver, Thomas Baines, was appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in 1833. With no <b>new</b> <b>leases</b> being issued, {{the actions of the}} Corporation were confined to overseeing former leases, which had not yet become very lucrative. Baines undertook a plan to change this and appointed Clerks of the Peace as District Commissioners to undertake a survey of each individual lot in Upper Canada.|$|R
40|$|Background and Problem Discussion: Due to {{companies}} large off-balance sheet obligations, {{discussions of the}} current standard regarding leasing, IAS 17, have provided suggestions to a <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> standard, which is the foundation for this thesis. Purpose and Research Question: The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine if the implementation of a <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> standard could have an effect on the market value of firms. The research question is: Do investors find the replacement of IAS 17 value relevant? If so, is the value relevance more prominent in certain industries or related to the size of the company? Methodology: In order to fulfil the purpose, an Event Study is performed. Data collection is primarily performed through DataStream and analysis of the data is performed in Stata. Results and Conclusion: The empirical findings in this study suggest no general effect on value relevance regarding the new standard. No significant results are found within different industries. However, considering companies of different size, significant results are found. The general conclusion is therefore that size is probably a variable that is value relevant to investors considering the replacement of the <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> standard...|$|R

25|$|By a Charter of Elizabeth I in 1589 {{the bailiff}} was {{replaced}} by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the Georgian era, patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby Brighton) gave it a <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a County Borough, responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, in 1974, that status was abolished.|$|E
