We develop a simple overlapping generations model of a small open economy that is a net creditor in the initial equilibrium and that provides regular current transfers. We show that transfers have a 1 : 1 direct and a weaker indirect effect on the economy's export surplus. Applying this model to Germany, using macro data for the period from 1970 to 2000, we show that almost 87 % of the German trade balance's surplus {{is due to the}} provision of current transfers. Accordingly, the main part of Germany's well-known strong export position is determined by factors underlying political decisions and not economic factors...|$|E

The contingent of emigrant financial backers is formed by the seasonal emigrant, that is, the residents outside the country who periodically visit Valadares, those who return {{after a period of}} immigration, and relatives who host remittances of residents abroad. The dynamism of activities in the local health private sector seems to reinforce this hypothesis. Aiming at exploring the relations between the emigrant’s financing and the dynamics of opening private services in the city, we carried out the following procedures: sixteen interviews with health professionals who live and work in Valadares; queries in the National Register of Health Establishments and Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute databases; and a documental research, by means of data collection in the municipal health surveillance sector. Such data was compared to <b>net</b> <b>current</b> unilateral <b>transfers</b> for Brazil in the period of 1981 to 2007.

We also discuss the relation of <b>net</b> <b>current</b> to the observed eruptive events. The AR evolved from βγ to βγδ configuration over a period of 6 days. The AR had two sub-regions of activity with opposite chirality: one dominated by sunspot rotation producing a strong CME, the other showing large shear motions producing a strong flare. The <b>net</b> <b>current</b> in each polarity over the CME producing sub-region increased to a maximum and then decreased when the sunspots got separated. The time profile of <b>net</b> <b>current</b> in this sub-region followed the time profile of the rotation rate of the S-polarity sunspot of the same sub-region.

The systematic evolution of the observed <b>net</b> <b>current</b> is seen to follow the time evolution of total length of strongly sheared polarity inversion lines in both the sub-regions.

40|$|The real {{exchange}} rate is a macroeconomic variable of a crucial importance, since it determines relative price {{of goods and}} services home and abroad, and influences economic agents’ decisions. The real {{exchange rate}} needs to be on the right level, as it can result in wrong signals and economic distortions if it is not. In {{order to be able to}} say whether a currency is misaligned or not, one needs some measure of the just exchange rate – the equilibrium exchange rate. Many different concepts of equilibrium exchange rates exist. The one which is defined as the real effective exchange rate that is consistent with the economy being in internal and external equilibrium in the medium term is the subject of this thesis, and is known under the name of Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate concept. The first part of this study, thus, explains the concept of Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate and surveys the literature on the uses to which it has been put and on the ways in which it has been calculated. The second part of the dissertation illustrates how the Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate concept can be operationalised towards the end of assessing the right parity of the Macedonian denar. What we find is that the denar is neither overvalued nor overvalued in the period 1998 - 2005. That would imply that price competitiveness is not adversely affected, and that the exchange rate does not generate distortions in the economy. We also find that the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate tends to appreciate due to the increase in the <b>net</b> <b>current</b> <b>transfers</b> flows. In contrast, the real effective exchange rate tends to depreciate in the last three periods, and we are of the opinion that if these trends are maintained, in near future the denar might become undervalued. ...|$|E

We consider two simple double quantum dot configurations coupled to two external fermionic reservoirs and calculate the <b>net</b> <b>current</b> flowing between the two reservoirs. The <b>net</b> <b>current</b> is partitioned into currents carried by the eigenstates {{of the system and}} by the coherences induced between the states due to coupling with the leads. We find that current carried by populations is always positive whereas current carried by coherences may be negative. This results in a non-monotonic dependence of the <b>net</b> <b>current</b> on the coupling strength. We find that in certain cases, the <b>net</b> <b>current</b> can vanish at large couplings due to cancellation between currents carried by the states and the coherences.

The flux emergence rate is almost the same in both the polarities. We observe that along with an increase in magnetic flux, the <b>net</b> <b>current</b> in each polarity increases initially for about three days after which it decreases. This <b>net</b> <b>current</b> is characterized by having exactly opposite signs in each polarities while its magnitude remains almost the same most of the time. The decrease of <b>net</b> <b>current</b> in both the polarities is due to the increase of current having a sign opposite to that of the <b>net</b> <b>current.</b> The dominant current, with same sign as the <b>net</b> <b>current,</b> is seen to increase first and then decreases during the major X-class flares. Evolution of non-dominant current appears to be a necessary condition for a flare initiation. The above observations can have a plausible explanation in terms of the superposition of two different force-free states resulting in non-zero Lorentz force in the corona. This Lorentz force then push the coronal plasma and might facilitate the magnetic reconnection required for flares. Also, the evolution of the <b>net</b> <b>current</b> is found to follow the evolution of magnetic shear at the polarity inversion line.

40|$|The Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya {{is a small}} oil-producing {{developing}} {{economy in}} North Africa. Its economy depends heavily on oil revenue. Oil exports accounted for 92 - 97 percent of annual total Libyan exports and contributed 40 - 60 percent of annual GDP during the period 1963 - 2006. The Libyan economy, like other Middle Eastern oil producers, has been subject to several strong external shocks resulting from fluctuations in oil prices since September 1973. Economic conditions of the Libyan economy worsened in the 1990 ’s {{as a result of}} international sanctions. Since the ending of the UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been implementing measures to reform and open its economy. Libya needs strong and sustained economic growth {{to meet the demands of}} its rapidly growing labour force, which require high investment in physical and human capital and an efficient use of the country’s resources. However, the achievement of these objectives depends on oil prices. The aim of this thesis is to find out the impact of the fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy during the period of 1963 - 2004. The thesis tries to contribute to literature by examining the effects of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth; Libyan investment; the patterns of Libyan imports and trade relationship with its major trading partners. This thesis also attempts to assess the impact of fluctuation in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balance of payments. Many researchers devoted their time and skill in tackling problems related to trade and growth. However, the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing economies came to the interest of some researchers only recently and more precisely since the oil embargo in late 1973. Despite the growing literature on the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing countries in the Middle East, it appears that many gaps still exist in the current literature. In particular no attempt has been made to examine the impact of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy and in particular on Libyan economic growth, Libyan gross fixed capital formation, Libyan imports, the feedback effects in Libyan trade with its major importers and effects of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balances of payments. Sophisticated economic models and econometric techniques have been utilized in this thesis in order to achieve its objectives. These models and techniques include single equation models, simultaneous equations models, forecasting models and co-integration analysis. The fluctuations in oil prices had very important effects on the Libyan labor force, sectoral employment, Libyan social and development indicators, contribution of various economic activities, Libyan expenditure, Libyan composition of foreign trade and Libyan balance of payments. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth using the “export as an engine of growth model” and applying a “Koyck distributed lag scheme” suggest that there are spread effects from oil exports to the rest of the economy. However, when both the component and inflationary effects are excluded (but not the real gain from the rise in export prices) the results suggest no evidence of spread effects. This conclusion is supported by sectoral output analysis. The use of co-integration analysis to examine the long-term trade relationship between Libyan GDP and its oil exports suggest that there is no long-term relationship between Libyan oil exports and non-oil GDP. In other words, the two variables do drift too far apart from each other over time. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on investment in the Libyan economy was assessed using an accelerator model of investment to capture investment behavior in the Libyan economy. It was revealed that the Libyan capital formation is strongly influenced by spending on components of aggregate demand other than investment and the downturn in oil prices had a serious adverse effect on investment. There seems to be an existence of some bottlenecks Also, investment in the Libyan economy was mainly autonomous public investment in infrastructure. To find out if there is a long-term relationship between investment and other components of aggregate demand (private consumption + public consumption + net exports) in the Libyan economy, the co-integration technique was used. The long-run elasticity of investment expenditure in the Libyan economy, with respect to Libyan expenditure on other components of aggregate demand, was higher than the short-run elasticity during the period of boom of oil exports. However, there is no evidence of long-term relationships between investment and other components of aggregate demand in the Libyan economy. The analyses of the trade relationship between Libya and its major trading partners, using a simultaneous-equations model, suggest that an increase in Libyan’s exports to a major trading partner contributes to growth in Libyan GDP. The increase in Libyan income expands its imports from its major trading partners. This in turn contributed to growth in the income of the trade partners. The level of Libyan imports from its major trading partners does not seem to have any significant effect on the level of the GDP of its major trading partners except Greece, Turkey and Tunisia. The relationship between imports of various commodity groups and per capita income in the Libyan economy during variety periods of fluctuation in oil prices were evaluated using two-digit SIT classifications and five forms of import income function. It has been indicated that the reduction in oil revenue during the period of low oil prices has completely upset the import-income relationship, which was developed during the boom years, while the rise in oil revenue has recreated an improvement in the relationship. Single and simultaneous-equations models are developed and tested to examine the impact of the external and internal forces on Libyan balance of payments. The results are used in forecasting the future behavior of this balance under various scenarios. The analysis indicates that the ratio of trade balance to GDP has fluctuated sharply with changes in the world price of oil. The decline in oil exports combined with deficit in the services balance and <b>net</b> <b>current</b> <b>transfers</b> depleted the gains from trade surplus in the Libyan economy. This resulted in a continuous decline in the current account surplus...|$|E

40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> {{behaviour}} in anisotropic superconducting bodies is {{the central}} topic of this thesis and focuses on {{the effect that the}} nonlinearity of the electric field dependence upon the local current density value and anisotropy have on the nature of current transport. The main motivation for this work was the desire for {{a better understanding of the}} conceptually difficult behaviour of current transport in superconducting bodies and examines <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> quantitatively for a number of important problems on the macroscopic and microscopic scale. This behaviour is examined both experimentally and using computer models. The successful development of a powerful, robust and adaptable numerical model for analysing the complex <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> behaviour has been the primary aim of this work. The range of parameters appropriate to macroscopic models of the Bi- 2212 CRT system has been experimentally examined using a specifically constructed apparatus for the measurement of current transport characteristics. A study of the self-field properties of the Bi- 2212 CRT material using a new experimental technique and mathematical analysis is presented and has allowed the importance of the self-field effect in the numerical model to be assessed. An essential requirement for the practical application of high current superconducting devices is the development of low resistance current contacts.
