25|$|By 1680, Stradivari had {{acquired}} {{at least a}} small, yet growing, reputation. In 1682, a Venetian banker ordered {{a complete set of}} instruments, which he planned to present to King James II of England. The fate of these instruments is unknown. Cosimo de' Medici bought another five years later. Amati died in 1684, an event followed by a noticeable increase in Stradivari's production. The years 1684 and 1685 also marked an important development in his style – the dimensions he used generally increased, and his instruments were more in the style of Amati's work of the 1640s and 1650s. Stradivari's instruments underwent <b>no</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in the next five years, although in 1688 he began cutting a more distinct bevel and began outlining the heads of instruments in black, a quite original improvement.|$|E
500|$|The {{series of}} pennies worth [...] of a pound concludes with the pre-decimalisation issues for Queen Elizabeth II. <b>No</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> {{was made to}} the reverse designs of the penny or other bronze coins with the new reign, and her coins were made current by a {{proclamation}} of 25 November 1952, effective 1 January 1953. No pennies were struck for circulation in 1953, the only extant denomination between the farthing and half crown not to see a circulation issue. This {{was because of the}} large number of pennies in circulation. [...] Specimen sets were issued for the Queen's Coronation that year, with the obverse of each coin inscribed ELIZABETH II DEI GRA BRITT OMN REGINA F D around the right-facing bust of the Queen by Mary Gillick. These were not issued for circulation, but as the specimen sets were sold for only a slight advance on face value, many were later broken open and spent. In all subsequent mintings of the penny, the inscription was ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA F D. The deletion of the Latin for [...] "Queen of all the Britains" [...] in favour of designating her simply as [...] "Queen" [...] was due to the changing nature of the British Commonwealth, which by then included some republics.|$|E
