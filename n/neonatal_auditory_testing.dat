MÉTODOS: estudo de coorte transversal, realizado no período de 2004 a 2008, em maternidade localizada na zona sul da cidade de São Paulo, com 20. 615 recém-nascidos de ambos os sexos, sem indicadores de risco para deficiência auditiva e submetidos à triagem auditiva neonatal. O teste foi realizado por intermédio das Emissões Otoacústicas Evocadas Transientes (EOAET). Os pacientes que falharam nas EOAET nas duas fases foram encaminhados para a realização do Potencial Evocado Auditivo do Tronco Encefálico (PEATE) para a confirmação da deficiência auditiva neonatal. Empregou-se o Teste Exato de Fischer e o nível de significância adotado foi de 0, 05 oup OBJECTIVES: {{to determine}} the incidence of hearing impairment in newborns, at a private maternity hospital {{in the city of}} São Paulo. METHODS: a cross-sectional cohort study was carried out covering the period between 2004 and 2008, at a maternity hospital located in the southern zone of the city of São Paulo, including 20, 615 newborns of both sexes, with no risk factors for hearing impairment and who had undergone <b>neonatal</b> <b>auditory</b> screening.

40|$|Background and Aim: Hyperbilirubinemia {{during the}} {{neonatal}} period {{is known to}} be an important risk factor for <b>neonatal</b> <b>auditory</b> impairment, and may reveal as a permanent brain damage, if no proper therapeutic intervention is considered. In the present study some electroacoustic and electrophysiologic tests were used to evaluate function of auditory system in a group of children with severe neonatal Jaundice. Materials and Methods: Forty five children with mean age of 16. 1 14. 81 months and 17 mg/dl and higher bilirubin level were studied, and the transient evoked otoacoustic emission, acoustic reflex, auditory brainstem response and <b>auditory</b> steady-state response <b>tests</b> were performed for them. Results: The mean score of bilirubin was 29. 37 8. 95 mg/dl. It was lower than 20 mg/dl in 22. 2 %, between 20 - 30 mg/dl in 24. 4 % and more than 30 mg/dl in 48. 0 % of children. No therapeutic intervention in 26. 7 %, phototherapy in 44. 4 %, and blood exchange in 28. 9 % of children were reported. 48. 9 % hypoxia and 26. 6 % preterm birth history was shown too. TEOAEs was recordable in 71. 1 % of cases. The normal result in acoustic reflex, ABR and ASSR tests was shown just in 11. 1 % of cases. The clinical symptoms of auditory neuropathy were revealed in 57. 7 % of children. Conclusion: Conducting <b>auditory</b> <b>tests</b> sensitive to hyperbilirubinemia place of injury is necessary to inform from functional effect and severity of disorder. Because the auditory neuropathy/ dys-synchrony is common in neonates with hyperbilirubinemic, the OAEs and ABR are the minimum essential tests to identify this disorder...|$|R

A group of 20 children with normal cognitive and language development underwent several <b>auditory</b> <b>tests</b> at the ages of 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 years. At the age of 10 years, three subjects were lost to follow-up, as was one more subject {{at the age of}} 12 years. The auditory performance of the children was compared to the performance of a group of 20 adults. The <b>auditory</b> <b>test</b> battery consisted of a speech-in-noise test, a filtered speech test, a binaural fusion <b>test</b> and two <b>auditory</b> sequencing <b>tests.</b> At the ages of 6, 7 and 8 years, data on the performance on an <b>auditory</b> word discrimination <b>test,</b> an <b>auditory</b> synthesis <b>test,</b> an <b>auditory</b> closure <b>test</b> and a number recall test were also obtained.

2500|$|APD {{has been}} defined anatomically {{in terms of the}} {{integrity}} of the auditory areas of the nervous system. However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is {{made on the basis of}} performance on behavioral <b>auditory</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Auditory</b> processing is [...] "what we do with what we hear", and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of <b>auditory</b> <b>tests.</b> There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996. This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology. Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an <b>auditory</b> <b>test</b> for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.|$|R

A requirement for modality-specificity could potentially avoid including children whose poor auditory performance is due to general factors such as poor attention or memory.
