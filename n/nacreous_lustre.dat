5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by M. Schepman) The size of {{the shell}} varies between 10 mm and 50 mm. The small, white shell has a pyramidal shape. The spire consists of 11½ whorls of which nearly 2 form the nucleus. The first whorl is rather bulbous and smooth. The second whorls is radiately ribbed and also swollen. The remaining whorls increase regularly in size. They are slightly contracted above and below, nearly straight towards the middle, with two spiral rows of pointed nodules, connected by slight spirals and oblique radiating ribs. Moreover, the shell has a thin spiral, just above the linear suture. The rest of the surface is smooth and shining, with a slight <b>nacreous</b> <b>lustre</b> and with numerous fine growth striae. The body whorl is conspicuously keeled below the periphery and with a second keel at some distance on the smooth base. The aperture is subrhombic. The outer margin is thin, angulate {{at the end of}} the lower row of nodules. The columellar margin is rounded, slightly curved, ending in a point, where it joins the basal margin.|$|E
5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by M.M. Schepman) The size of {{the shell}} varies between 7 mm and 12 mm.The elevated-conical, imperforate shell has convex sides. It is yellowish-white, with a <b>nacreous</b> <b>lustre</b> and numerous yellowish-brown spots, which are darker near {{the upper part of}} each whorl and on the third whorl, the first and second being without markings. The nucleus is wanting, remaining five, slightly convex whorls with a narrow canaliculate suture. The first whorl has rather distant ribs. The next whorls have 3 spiral lirae (fine linear elevations) and radiating ribs. The last 3 whorls contain 5 spirals and thinner radiating ribs, which make the shell cancellated. These ribs become lamellose (with flared axial projections) on the lower whorls. The lirae are beaded where the ribs cross them, less obvious on the lower whorls, the uppermost of the lirae on each whorl with a series of small tubercles, giving a coronated appearance to the whorls. The body whorl is rounded, the peripheral spiral being only very little prominent. The base of the shell is convex, with 6 beaded lirae, cancellated by numerous, irregular, radiating ribs. The aperture is nearly rounded. The outer and basal margins are rounded, thin, thickened interiorly, with about 17 short lirae on the internal rib, of which that near the columella slightly tooth-like. The columella is cylindrical, rather straight, with a tooth-like fold at the base, bordering a rounded notch. The parietal wall is callous. The interior of the aperture has a few grooves.|$|E
5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by M. Schepman) The {{height of}} the umbilicate shell attains 3 mm. The shell is small and subglobose. The spire forms a short, subgradate cone. The shell is whitish-yellow, with a slight <b>nacreous</b> <b>lustre.</b> The spire contains about 6 whorls, of which about one forms the blunt, smooth nucleus. The next whorls, including the penultimate, have only one strong median keel. The space above and below this keel is slightly concave, with a few microscopic spiral threadlike striae. Two whorls next to the nucleus are crossed by conspicuous radiating riblets, straight but in an oblique direction above the keel, convex below it. These riblets then suddenly disappear, only very fine striae succeeding them, being scarcely perceptible on the body whorl, which is bicarinate. A third keel borders the flattened base;. The suture is rather conspicuous but shallow, with very slight traces of being margined, probably by the covered keel. The base of the shell shows 7 spirals of which the distal one, separated from the third keel by a slightly concave space, and one bordering the umbilicus are stronger. Moreover the whole base is covered with microscopic radiating striae, beautifully waved in an S-like manner. The umbilicus is moderately wide, pervious, and funnel-shaped. Its wall is wave-striated, with a shallow spiral groove terminated by a tooth on the columella. The aperture is irregularly subquadrate. Its outer margin is so much broken, that no sinus remains. It is strongly sinuous by the terminations of the keels, of which the upper one becomes double at a little distance from the mouth. The columellar margin {{is connected to the}} outer one, by a thin layer of enamel on the body whorl. It is first strongly excavated above by a rather deep sinus, reaching the columellar tooth. Below this tooth it is again concave and terminates in an angle when it joins the basal margin at the point terminating the umbilical keel.|$|E
40|$|The new mineral abellaite (IMA 2014 - 111), ideally NaPb 2 (CO 3) 2 (OH), is a {{supergene}} mineral {{that was}} found {{in one of the}} galleries of the long-disused Eureka mine, in the southern Pyrenees (Lleida province), Catalonia, Spain. Abellaite is found as sparse coatings {{on the surface of the}} primary mineralization, it forms subhedral crystals not larger than 10 mm as well as larger pseudohexagonal platelets up to ∼ 30 μm. Individual crystals commonly have a tabular to lamellar habit and form fairly disordered aggregates. The mineral is associated with a large number of primary minerals (roscoelite, pyrite, uraninite, coffinite, 'carbon', galena, sphalerite, nickeloan cobaltite, covellite, tennantite and chalcopyrite) and supergene minerals (hydrozincite, aragonite, gordaite, As-rich vanadinite andersonite, čejkaite, malachite and devilline). Abellaite is colourless to white, with a vitreous to <b>nacreous</b> <b>lustre.</b> The mineral is translucent, has a white streak and is non-fluorescent. The aggregates of microcrystals are highly friable. The calculated density using the ideal formula is 5. 93 g/cm 3. The chemical composition of the mineral (the mean of 10 electron microprobe analyses) is - Na 3. 88, Ca 0. 29, Pb 72. 03, C 4. 17, O 19. 47 and H 0. 17, total 100. 00 wt% (H, C and O by stoichiometry assuming the ideal formula). On the basis of 7 O atoms, the empirical formula of abellaite is Na 0. 96 Ca 0. 04 Pb 1. 98 (CO 3) 2 (OH). The simplified formula of the mineral is NaPb 2 (CO 3) 2 (OH). The mineral is hexagonal, space group P 63 mc, a = 5. 254 (2), c = 13. 450 (5) Å, V= 321. 5 (2) Å 3 and Z = 2. The strongest powder-diffraction lines [d in Å (I) (h k l) ] are: 3. 193 (100) (0 1 3), 2. 627 (84) (1 1 0), 2. 275 (29) (0 2 0), 2. 242 (65) (0 2 1, 0 0 6), 2. 029 (95) (0 2 3). Abellaite has a known synthetic analogue, and the crystal structure of the mineral was refined by using crystallographic data of the synthetic phase. The mineral is named in honour of the mineralogist and gemmologist Joan Abella i Creus (b. 1968), who has long studied the deposits of the Eureka mine and who collected the mineral. © 2017 E.
