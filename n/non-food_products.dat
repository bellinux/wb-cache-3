5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and <b>non-food</b> <b>products</b> were {{produced}} by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} commercial {{sector of the}} state is that of retail foodstuffs, especially those selling groceries, meat and poultry. This represented over 40% of the commercial sector in 1998. Just over 30% of commerce was dedicated to <b>non-food</b> <b>products</b> such as clothing and pharmaceuticals with the rest mostly dedicated to wholesale foods. From the latter 20th century, tourism has taken up much of the economic slack left behind by the demise of much of the state’s mining industry, with income from this sector surpassing that of the petroleum industry. The state has a variety of historic, cultural and natural attractions. Commerce and tourism employ about 44% of the population.|$|E

The results indicate that the number of brand mentions and sales correlate positively in relation to products from the food and beverages category while {{this is not the case}} with respect to the <b>non-food</b> <b>product</b> category.

The choice experiment was part of a survey of 1510 randomly selected consumers in Germany that was mailed in spring 2005. Attitudes towards gene technology, institutions and technical progress were measured using 22 items. A factor analysis revealed five factors describing consumer attitudes: support, risk, trust, attitude towards technical progress and attitude towards technical innovation. Based on these factors we identify four different classes of consumers in a latent class model for both products. Analysis of these classes shows strong differences between willingness to pay estimates for benefits compared to risk reduction as well as differences between the classes.
