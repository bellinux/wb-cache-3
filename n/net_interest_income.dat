40|$|This paper aims at {{analyzing}} {{credit quality}} characteristics of supervised Italian Mutual Guarantee Credit Institutions (MGCIs) supporting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The prevailing literature on this subject, mainly descriptive, highlights how informational asymmetries and geographical proximity {{are able to}} justify their double-intermediation effect. Our study instead focuses on supervised MGCIs and provides evidence on the determinants of impaired guarantees in the current deteriorated economic environment. Moreover, we compare the performance experienced by both MGCIs and Cooperative Banks (CBs) {{in order to assess}} whether there are differences in terms of product, risk and portfolio management variances. Furthermore, we analyze the geographical distribution within these intermediaries to control for territorial biases. We provide evidence that the impairments of MGCIs are positively related with the intermediaries’ size and negatively with the regulatory capital. On the other hand, the CBs’ non-performing loans of are highly dependent on <b>net</b> loan <b>interest</b> <b>income.</b> Our results show a difference in the credit portfolio quality between the two types of intermediaries operating in the same region but only for the year 2011.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the demand for}} commercial bank deposits in Lebanon, a regional financial center. With Lebanon''s high fiscal deficits financed largely by domestic commercial banks that rely on deposit funding, deposit growth is a key variable to assess government financing conditions. At the macro level, we find that domestic factors such as economic activity, prices, and the interest differential between the Lebanese pound and the U. S. dollar are significant in explaining deposit demand, as are external factors such as advanced economy economic and financial conditions and variables proxying the availability of funds from the Gulf. Impulse response functions and variance decomposition analyses underscore {{the relative importance of}} the external variables. At the micro level, we find that in addition, bank-specific variables, such as the perceived riskiness of individual banks, their liquidity buffers, loan exposure, and interest margins, bear a significant influence on the demand for deposits.

There are two advantages of repricing model. First, it is easily to be understood. And it works well with small changes in interest rates. One of its disadvantages is it ignores market value effects and off-balance sheet cash flows. Next, it is over-aggregative, which distribution of assets & liabilities within individual buckets is not considered. Mismatches within buckets can be substantial. Besides that, it ignores the effects of runoffs.|$|E
