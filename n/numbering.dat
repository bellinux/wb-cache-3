40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} (computational) verb <b>number</b> and arithmetical {{operations}} of verb <b>numbers</b> are presented. A verb <b>number</b> {{is a kind of}} special computational verb, which is derived from structures of (host) verb+(real, interval, fuzzy) <b>number.</b> From the linguistic point of view, a verb <b>number</b> is a computational verb with contexts defined by (real, interval, fuzzy) <b>numbers.</b> Verb <b>numbers</b> can be classified into three basic types based on the outer systems of host verbs. The arithmetic for verb <b>numbers</b> and its rules are presented and proved. If host computational verbs degrade to BE, then verb <b>numbers</b> collapse to real <b>numbers,</b> interval <b>numbers,</b> fuzzy <b>numbers</b> (sets) or other <b>numbers.</b> The set of all verb <b>numbers</b> can be a metric space. The distance between verb <b>numbers</b> can be defined based on the collapses of verb <b>numbers.</b> The cases when verb <b>numbers</b> collapse to triangular fuzzy <b>numbers,</b> trapezoidal fuzzy <b>numbers</b> and interval <b>numbers</b> are presented and proved. The method of constructing verb <b>numbers</b> from fuzzy <b>numbers</b> is presented. c Yang's Scientific Research Institute, LLC. All rights reserved...|$|R
