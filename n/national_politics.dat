5|$|Although {{reluctant}} {{to comment on}} the issue, Hareide was likely single during his first tenure in <b>national</b> <b>politics.</b> He has been confronted with rumours of homosexuality by segments of the media, but these have been dismissed.

5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and <b>national</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E

5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from <b>national</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{during the}} 1850s Smith gained {{prominence}} with African American readers and abolitionist readers of all ethnicities for his regularly published (often weekly) columns in Frederick Douglass Paper.

5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed.

After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Ohio's {{governor}} had {{relatively little}} power—for example, he could recommend legislation, but not veto it—but with Ohio a key swing state, its governor {{was a major}} figure in <b>national</b> <b>politics.</b> Although McKinley believed that {{the health of the}} nation depended on that of business, he was evenhanded in dealing with labor. He procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union.|$|E
