This study investigated whether patients showing misery perfusion on PET have a high risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke. METHODS [...] The relation between the regional haemodynamic status of cerebral circulation and the subsequent risk of recurrent stroke was prospectively evaluated in 40 patients with symptomatic internal carotid or middle cerebral arterial occlusive diseases who underwent PET. Patients were divided into two haemodynamic categories according to the mean hemispheric value of oxygen extraction fraction in the hemisphere supplied by the artery with symptomatic disease: patients with <b>normal</b> oxygen <b>extraction</b> fraction and those with increased oxygen extraction fraction (misery perfusion). All patients were followed up for at least 12 months.

A significantly higher incidence of ipsilateral strokes was found in patients with increased oxygen extraction fraction (Fisher's exact test; P = 0. 005). In patients with increased oxygen extraction fraction, three of four strokes were watershed infarctions and the location of the infarction corresponded with the area of increased oxygen extraction fraction.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{techniques for}} interpreting 3 D range images acquired in outdoor environments {{at a low}} resolution. It focuses {{on the task of}} robustly capturing the shapes that comprise objects, in order to classify them. With the recent development of 3 D sensors such as the Velodyne, it is now possible to capture range images at video frame rates, allowing mobile robots to observe dynamic scenes in 3 D. To classify objects in these scenes, features are extracted from the data, which allows different regions to be matched. However, range images acquired at this speed are of low resolution, and there are often significant changes in sensor viewpoint and occlusion. In this context, existing methods for feature extraction do not perform well. This thesis contributes algorithms for the robust abstraction from 3 D points to object classes. Efficient region-of-interest and surface <b>normal</b> <b>extraction</b> are evaluated, resulting in a keypoint algorithm that provides stable orientations. These build towards a novel feature, called the ‘line image,’ that is designed to consistently capture local shape, regardless of sensor viewpoint. It does this by explicitly reasoning about the difference between known empty space, and space that has not been measured due to occlusion or sparse sensing. A dataset of urban objects scanned with a Velodyne was collected and hand labelled, in order to compare this feature with several others on the task of classification. First, a simple k-nearest neighbours approach was used, where the line image showed improvements. Second, more complex classifiers were applied, requiring the features to be clustered.

40|$|In {{the near}} future {{robotics}} will become a much larger part of our society, and more robots will be developed to execute a range of gen- eral tasks, {{so that they are}} able to assist human operators in their day to day work. At the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e), the AMIGO robot is designed to perform such general service tasks, with a special focus on health care applications. A general purpose service robot, such as AMIGO, needs a certain skill set to perform tasks autonomously. One of these skills, is being able to perceive ob- jects in the world. Using this information AMIGO can act accordingly, e. g., by bringing the required object back to its operator. This thesis describes a system for detecting household objects in domestic environments. The object detection system has been devel- oped for AMIGO, and is based on the object detection method, LINE- MOD, presented by hinterstoisser et al. [1]. To make the system appli- cable for both the general service tasks performed by AMIGO and the RoboCup competition, an annual event encouraging robotic research, LINE-MOD is extended by adding extra color modalities to the detec- tion system, testing different <b>normal</b> <b>extraction</b> routines and enabling the use of additional features. The detection module is subsequently included in a framework with a different set of tools, making it of practical use for the AMIGO project and its users, and is integrated with existing systems used currently used in the AMIGO project. The detection module is evaluated with household objects that AMIGO encounters while performing service related tasks and competing in the RoboCup competition. The system is discovered to be able to recognize most household objects with reasonable accuracy, the use of an added color modality results in the increased accuracy of the detection of household objects at a small performance penalty. However, it may still fail in situations where objects are highly textured, resulting in false positives inside object instances, and when object models are too similar in shape or color a problem which is primarily caused by the use of highly quantized feature types...|$|E

The effects of primary processing such as milling and pearling were also examined. The antioxidant capacity of wheat was evaluated using a number of in vitro assays based on scavenging of several free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and control of lipid and DNA oxidation. [...] The optimum conditions for the extraction of crude phenolics from whole grain and bran of soft and hard wheats were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). A face-centred cubic design (FCD) was used to investigate the effects of three independent variables, namely solvent composition (%), extraction temperature (°C) and time (min) on the response, that is the total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Although the optimum extraction conditions were established, in the interest of operational costs related to energy consumption, phenolics were generally extracted using 80 % aqueous ethanol for prolonged periods at low temperatures. Crude phenolics extracted with 80 % aqueous ethanol yielded 75 - 80 % antioxidant activity as compared to that under optimum conditions. The extractability of phenolics from wheat under simulated gastric pH conditions revealed that pH treatment facilitated the extraction of phenolics. In the latter study wheat phenolics of non-treated and treated samples were extracted into water. The antioxidant activity of treated samples was much higher than that of non-treated samples. Phenolics extracted belonged to the free, soluble esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted after alkaline hydrolysis of samples. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In the in vitro antioxidant assays, the bound phenolic fraction demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and esterified phenolics. In all experiments detailed above, two commercial samples of soft (70 % Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30 % Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90 % Canadian Western hard red spring and 10 % Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheat mixtures were used. The antioxidant potential of the milling fractions examined decreased in the order of bran > whole grain > flour. Most of the phenolics were concentrated in the bran and these were not available for analysis under <b>normal</b> <b>extraction</b> conditions. [...] The effects of primary processing, namely pearling and milling, on the phenolic content and antioxidant capacity were determined using two wheat cultivars, namely CWAD (Canadian Western Amber Durum; Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) and CWHRS (Canadian Western hard red spring; Triticum aestivum L.). After pearling the phenolic content and antioxidant capacity in the grains were significantly decreased. As the degree of pearling was increased there was a gradual decrease in the phenolic content and hence the corresponding antioxidant capacity in the resultant pearled product. The by-products resulting from 10 - 20 % pearling possessed the greatest antioxidant capacity. Among different milling fractions the bran had the highest phenolic contents while the endosperm possessed the lowest and this was also reflected in antioxidant capacity of different milling fractions in the two cultivars. [...] The HPLC analysis of commercial wheat mixtures revealed that ferulic acid was the predominant phenolic acid while in the pure cultivars examined sinapic acid was the major phenolic acid. This study demonstrated the importance of bran in the antioxidant activity of wheat, hence consumption of wheat as whole grains may render beneficial health effects...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} few years, osseoperception has {{received}} more and more attention since the introduction of osseointegrated implants. However, the histomorphometric evidence on the mechanoreceptors around dental implants is still insufficient and the fundamental mechanism of osseoperception remains unclear. Therefore, {{the primary goal of}} this doctoral thesis was to explore the innervation of peri-implant tissues in a split-mouth designed animal study, with a special focus on the impacts of various implant placement and loading protocols. Subsequently, the accuracy and applicability of CBCT for the assessment of trabecular microstructures were analyzed by comparing to histomorphology and &# 956;CT, respectively. Finally, an attempt was made to evaluate the changes of trabecular bone structures around dental implants which received immediate and delayed loadings by using the validated CBCT imaging technique. The thesis started with a general description of the morphometric characterization of nerve fibres in periodontal ligament and peri-implant area, the history of osseoperception, as well as the application of current imaging modalities in bone morphometric quantification in Chapter 1. Next, the overall aims and hypotheses of the whole thesis were presented. In Chapter 2, we summarized and discussed the available literature concerning the influence of dental implant placement and loading protocols on peri-implant innervation by systematic review methods. Implant loading increases the density of nerve fibres in peri-implant tissues than those implants without loading or extraction sites without implantation. However, there was insufficient evidence to distinguish between the innervation patterns following immediate and delayed implant placement and loading protocols. The results revealed the need for more uniform reporting, randomized controlled trials, longer observation periods and standardization of protocols. In Chapter 3, a split-mouth designed animal study was performed to provide comprehensive histomorphometric evidence of osseoperception at the site of implant placements subjected to different implant placement and loading protocols, as well as the information of origin and distribution of peri-implant innervation. Myelinated nerve fibres were mostly found in peri-implant crestal gingival and apical regions. The results also suggested that immediate implant placement and immediate loading was preferred to allow optimized peri-implant reinnervation. This exploration based on the histomorphology of peri-implant neuroreceptors could contribute to understand the osseoperception and, as a result, improve the success rate of osseointegration. In the following Chapter 4, we turned to determine the accuracy of the new imaging modality, named CBCT, in peri-implant bone structure analyses in comparison with histomorphometry. Both measurements on the trabecular bone structure showed moderate to high correlation and strong agreements regardless of the presence of implants. However, CBCT showed tendency to overestimate Tb. Th and Tb. Sp; on the other hand, BV. TV and Tb. N were lower than those assessed from histomorphometry. The current findings indicated a potential clinical application of CBCT on bone morphometric quantification. The further evaluation in Chapter 5 was to validate the scanning protocol of CBCT for measuring trabecular bone microstructure by comparing to &# 956;CT. Under different setting of tube voltage and current, we did not find any significant difference between two kinds of measurements except for Tb. Sp. And those measurements showed high positive correlation except for Tb. Th. Nevertheless, CBCT analyses tended to slightly overestimate BV/TV, Tb. Sp and Tb. Th comparing with µCT. The soft tissue effect on the bone structure analyses was not observed. In addition to the previous chapter, this study showed the potential value of high-resolution CBCT imaging, as an accurate and low-dose alternative to MSCT, for in vivo bone morphometry assessment. Based on the former two chapters, we evaluated 3 D morphology of peri-implant trabecular bone in a dog model under immediate and delayed implant protocols by means of high-resolution CBCT in Chapter 6. Coronal and middle regions around implants showed more compact, plate-like and thicker trabeculae. Immediately placed and loaded implants might have an improved bone structural integration than <b>normal</b> <b>extraction</b> healing. Nevertheless, a different bone remodeling pattern was not observed when using a delayed vs. an immediate implant protocol. Finally, the general discussion and conclusions of the above-mentioned studies and recommendations for future research were presented in Chapter 7. To further uncover osseoperception phenomenon, this doctoral thesis was in an endeavor to elaborate the effects of delayed and immediate implant placement and loading protocols on the healing of nerve fibres and bone structures around dental implants.

The protocol has been used by many and results in very high yields of nucleic acids, typically much more than commercial kits. For buffers and solutions used in this protocol, please see accompanying document Buffers and Solutions for TNA Extractions. pdf. ### Introduction This protocol is a general procedure for the co-extraction of DNA and RNA from soils. The procedure results in very high yields of nucleic acids and is suitable for all downstream enzymatic reactions. The protocol has been published in: [Angel et al. 2012]([URL] **NA extraction considerations** - **RNA handling**: as RNA is very sensitive to both chemical and enzymatic degradation meticulous measures of precaution must be taken. The use of DEPC and DEPC-treated water is not recommended since the substance is toxic and its application was found to be nearly unnecessary (see: [URL] Instead, I recommend to simply work with clean, preferably baked, glassware (3 h at 180 °C), to clean surfaces and spatulas with RNase eliminating solutions (such as RNaseZap®), and to use fresh and clean reagents for the preparation of the different buffers and solutions. As a general rule, work with RNA should be quick, precise, and tubes should be kept on ice. In my experience, this is much more important than any attempt to eliminate all RNases from apparatus and solutions. One should also bear in mind that soil samples contain infinitely more RNases than any contamination which might exist in the buffers or the apparatus. The only exceptions to this are the PEG Precipitation Solution, the Low TE Buffer, and the RNA storage solution. Since these are used to store RNA for relatively long periods of incubation extra care must be taken during their preparation to ensure highest degree of purity. For the preparation of the PEG Precipitation Solution I simply weigh everything into a Schott Bottle and add approximately the right amount of water as I prefer to be somewhat inaccurate in the concentrations than to have to transfer the solution between vessels and risk contamination. - **Selection of extraction buffer**: The TNS buffer used in this protocol is based on The TNS extraction buffer is based on the one used by [Henckel et al]([URL] 1999 TNS buffer results in higher RNA yields and more intact rRNA (more intact 23 S band). However, TNS tends to carry much more humic substances into the nucleic acids phase compared to TNC buffer which could make it ineffective for soils with high organic matter content. - **Use of phenol in the bead beating process**: the use of phenol increases the yield up to 4 times compared with the phenol free option, but also increases the carryover of humic substances. If you choose not to add phenol simply double the amount of extraction buffer added (1. 0 ml in total) - **RNAlater®**: if samples were stored in an RNAlater® solution or similar substance it is necessary to remove it before proceeding with RNA extraction. Centrifuge the sample at 10, 000 rpm for 1 min and pipette the supernatant. Add 1 ml of PB pH 8. 0, vortex the sample for 10 s to make sure the soil is washed by the buffer, and centrifuge it again at 10, 000 rpm for 1 min Remove the supernatant completely and proceed with <b>normal</b> <b>extraction.</b> - **Extra dry soil**: for extra dry soil (< 5 % WC) it is recommended to add some (up to 250 µl) PB pH 8. 0 in addition to the usual amount of 375 µl during the first bead beating processing. The reason is that in dry soils some of the extraction buffer is inevitably absorbed in the soil and cannot be recovered afterwards. This can lead to low recovery volumes from the bead beating process which could make it hard to separate the aqueous phase from the phenolic phase and eventually result in reduced yields. After the first processing the soil is wet enough and no further additions are required. - **pH of the extraction buffers**: The phenol and the extraction buffers used in this protocol are all at pH 8. 0. It has been shown that performing the extraction at pH 5. 5 yields significantly fewer humic substances in the extractant and is recommended for soils rich in organic material. Using such low pH, however, will also significantly decrease the amount of DNA yield (while not affecting RNA yield). Low pH extraction might therefore not be suitable if DNA is also to be analysed. For more information see [Mettel et al]([URL] 2010. - **Number of bead beating processing**: for most soil types (especially if they’re not too clayish), one time processing should be sufficient to obtain enough NA for further applications. The following two repetitions are meant not only to increase yields but also to reduce the bias associated with the susceptibility of different cell types to lysis. [Feinstein et al. 2009]([URL] found that DNA extraction yields kept increasing even after the 6 th bead beating repetition, and that community structure differed somewhat in each repetition. - **Amount of crude extract to use for RNA purification**: this depends mostly on the colour of the crude extract, and its quantity and purity as measured spectrophotometrically. In addition, the decision should take into account the final volume of the RNA. Between 20 - 100 µl may be used depending on colour, purity and amount of NA. - **Quantification**: it’s not possible to precisely quantify total NA using a spectrophotometer because DNA and RNA require different multiplication factors, but this should nevertheless give a sensible estimation. More precise quantifications of DNA and RNA can be obtained using Invitrogen’s PicoGreen™ and RiboGreen™, respectively. Impurities, especially humic substances, greatly interfere with spectrophotometeric quantification, though PicoGreen™ and RiboGreen™ tend to be less sensitive. - **Three steps purification procedure**: purification with phenol/chloroform and then chloroform should yield pure enough samples for most applications. Adding an additional purification step with only phenol prior to the phenol/chloroform purification (step 8) will ensure high TNA purity while only minimally compromising the yield. ### Reagents For recipes of the solutions which need to be prepared see: Buffers and Solutions for TNA Extractions. pdf under ‘Figures’. 1. TNS or TNC extraction buffer. - Phosphate buffer (PB) pH 8. 0 or pH 5. 5. - PEG precipitation solution. - Phenol for molecular biology, TE saturated (pH ~ 7. 8). - Phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25 : 24 : 1 for molecular biology. - Chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24 : 1 for molecular biology. - Glycogen (20 mg/ml). - 75 % ethanol made with RNase free water, stored at - 20 °C. ### Equipment 1. Bead beater suitable for screw-top 2 mL tubes. - Ice box. - Standard 2 ml polypropylene tubes. - 2 ml Non-Stick tubes (e. g. from Ambion). - 2 ml screw top tubes. - Optional: Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime). - 0. 1 mm glass beads or Lysing Matrix E (MP bio). - Optional: MicroSpin S- 200 HR (GE). ### Procedure **Before you begin** 1. Prepare all solutions, filter and autoclave them. - Clean all surfaces and centrifuges with an RNase eliminating solution. - Prepare beads tubes by pouring 0. 7 g (one full PCR tube) of 0. 1 mm glass beads to the screw top tube. - For each sample prepare in a rack: 1 beads tube, 4 standard 2 ml tubes and 2 Ambion’s Non-Stick 2 ml tubes. Label the beads tube and the Non-Stick tubes with stickers and the standard 2 ml tubes with a marker. **Procedure** 1. Weigh 0. 5 g (0. 3 - 0. 7 g) soil to a silica beads tube and place tube on ice. - Add 375 µl of PB, 125 µl of TNS or TNC and 500 µl of TE saturated phenol. - Immediately place tubes in a bead beater and process for 30 s at 6. 5 m s- 1. - Chill on ice for 10 s. - Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer the supernatant (extraction buffer and the phenolic phase) to a fresh 2 ml tube (or to a Phase Lock Gel tube), retain the silica beads tubes. - Repeat steps 2 - 6 using the same silica beads tubes. If there is not enough space in the tube for all the reagents, decrease the phenol volume (down to 200 µl) to avoid overflow. For the second extraction use fresh 2 ml tubes to collect the supernatant in step 6 while for the third extraction transfer only the aqueous phase and divide it between the tubes from the previous extractions to have equal volumes. - Add approximately 800 µl phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25 : 24 : 1 to each of the tubes containing the extractant, 2 ml total volume. - Mix phases by hand or using a vortex. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer the supernatant from each tube to fresh 2 ml tubes, and add 1 vol. chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24 : 1. Mix phases by hand or using a vortex. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 3 min. - Transfer supernatant from each tube to fresh 2 ml non-stick silicon tubes. - Add to each tube 1 µl of glycogen and 1 ml PEG Precipitation Solution (twice the extractant’s volume). - Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 60 min at 4 o C. - Remove as much as possible from the supernatant. Be careful not to pipette the pellet with the liquid. - Wash once with 1 ml of ice cold 75 % EtOH, invert the tube several times. Centrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 20 min. - Remove as much as possible from the supernatant first using a 1 ml tip, spin down the remaining drops in the tube, and remove them with a 100 µl tip. Once again, be careful not to pipette the pellet with the liquid. - Leave tubes open at room temperature for no more than 5 min (preferably under flame or a biological hood) in order to evaporate the remaining ethanol (note: pellets might not be completely dry at this point). Alternatively, pellets can be dried under a filtered stream of N 2. - Resuspend the pellets in 100 µl Low TE Buffer and combine both subsamples from each sample into one of the non-stick tubes. - Optional: to remove colour and some humic substances purify the extract using MicroSpin S- 200 HR (GE Healthcare) the following way: - a. Resuspend the resin in a column by vortexing. - b. Loosen the cap by a quarter twist, place column in a collection tube and centrifuge 1 min at 735 × g. - c. Place column in a fresh 1. 5 ml tube, apply 25 - 100 µl of sample to the resin. - d. Centrifuge 2 min at 735 × g. - Run 5 - 10 µl on agarose gel to evaluate NA quality. - Quantify total NA spectrophotometrically (dilute 1 : 10 in Low TE buffer before measuring) or DNA using PicoGreen™ (Invitrogen). - Depending on quality and quantity, aliquot 10 - 100 µl for RNA purification. - Optional: aliquot 10 - 100 µl for DNA purification. ### Anticipated Results High yields of high quality DNA and RNA for downstream enzymatic reactions. ### References 1.

40|$|Change in {{catalase}} activity was examined in leaves of rice plant exposed to salinity.

Inclusion of sorbitol or mannitol or sucrose in the extraction and enzyme assay medium enhanced the enzyme activity in salt-stressed samples by nearly 1. 5 - 1. 8 fold, compared to the activity found in un- stressed plants, which otherwise showed a 50 % declined activity in leaf extract prepared in buffer solution and assayed in a medium depleted of these sugars. In view of the accumulation of osmolytes under saline condition, these observations suggest that the {{catalase activity}} is modulated by the osmolytes and maintains a high rate of hydrogen peroxide scavenging property in vivo and serves as the major antioxidant enzyme to scavenge the salt-induced formation of peroxide.

In the wounds of 50 extractions with apical foci experimentally made, capillary networks were dense in the wound opening, while they were loosened in the apical areas with a distinct difference between them in the early postexodontic stage.

METHODS: Forty-five patients ≥ 60 (74 ± 7) years of age undergoing cataract surgery at Tampere University Hospital were randomly selected for the prospective study. The exclusion criterion was the use of oral antihypertensive medicine acting via renin-angiotensin system. Aqueous humor samples were taken at the beginning of <b>normal</b> cataract <b>extraction.</b> The samples were frozen and stored at - 80 °C. The concentrations of intraocular endogenous RAS components Ang(1 - 7), ACE 2, and ACE 1 were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: Concentration medians of Ang(1 - 7), ACE 2, and ACE 1 in the aqueous humor were: Ang(1 - 7) 4. 08 ng/ml, ACE 2 2. 32 ng/ml and ACE 1 0. 35 ng/ml. The concentrations were significantly higher in glaucomatous than in non-glaucomatous eyes, ACE 1 (p= 0. 014) and Ang(1 - 7) (p= 0. 026) vs non-glaucomatous eyes.

Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the best ionic liquid (IL) which gives the highest yield of rotenone. The <b>normal</b> soaking <b>extraction</b> (NSE) method was carried out for 24 [*]hrs using five different types of binary solvent systems comprising a combination of acetone and five respective ionic liquids (ILs) of (1) [BMIM] Cl; (2) [BMIM] OAc; (3) [BMIM] NTf 2; (4) [BMIM] OTf; and (5) [BMPy] Cl. Next, the yield of rotenone, % (w/w), and its concentration (mg/mL) in dried roots were quantitatively determined by means of RP-HPLC and TLC. The results showed that a binary solvent system of [BMIM] OTf + acetone was the best solvent system combination as compared to other solvent systems (P< 0. 05). It contributed to the highest rotenone content of 2. 69 ± 0. 21 % (w/w) (4. 04 ± 0. 34 mg/mL) at 14 [*]hrs of exhaustive extraction time.
