Schottky photodiode topology is selected to implement PbS quantum dots as photodetector {{because of its}} fast response and moderate sensitivity. The device is formed from Indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, the photosensitive PbS layer and a schottky contact formed of both aluminum or titanium and gold stack. Ligand exchange processes optimized in order to replace long capping ligands of PbS QDs with shorter ones. Layer by layer deposition method is applied to form pinhole free PbS CQD films.

40|$|Centrifugal casting of {{composites}} and ceramics {{has been}} widely employed to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of functional materials. This powerful method {{has yet to be}} deployed in the context of nanoparticles [...] yet size-effect tuning of quantum dots is among their most distinctive and application-relevant features. Here we report the first gradient nanoparticle films to be constructed in a single step. By creating a stable colloid of nanoparticles that are capped with electronic-conduction-compatible ligands we were able to leverage centrifugal casting for thin-films devices. This new method, termed centrifugal colloidal casting, is demonstrated to form films in a bandgap-ordered manner with efficient carrier funnelling towards the lowest energy layer.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In this thesis a tunable bandwidth quantum well photo-detector (TB-QWIP) is fabricated and experimentally characterized. The designed detector {{is based on}} the Stark effect with two quantum step wells arranged opposite to each other to simultaneously achieve both blue- and red-shift of the absorption peak for either direction of the bias. The characterization of the TB-QWIP is based on absorption measurement with Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, current versus applied voltage (I-V) measurement with a semiconductor parameter analyzer, and photocurrent spectroscopy. The measured IR absorption peaks found at room temperature 8. 8 m and 10. 0 m are in good agreement with designed values. The dark current of the test detector was found to be 10 - 9 A and a background photocurrent was found to be 700 x 10 - 9 A at - 4 V bias at 10 K. The background-limited performance of the device was found to be at 60 K. The peak responsivity of the detector was 0. 39 A/W at 8. 2 Ã¦m. The maximum <b>normalized</b> <b>detectivity</b> under background limited conditions D*BLIP, was calculated to be 3. 5 x 1011 cm Hz /W. The bandwidth of the detector tuned with bias from 1. 8 Ã¦m at - 1 V to 2. 7 Ã¦m at - 4 V, which amounts to 50 % higher than the original width. Further tuning of TB-QWIP parameters based on the analysis of this thesis hold promise for 100 % increase of peak width by an applied bias. Lieutenant Colonel, Hellenic Air Forc...|$|E
