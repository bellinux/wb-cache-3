Furthermore, a technical approach for the deviation controller using DSP processor chip TMS 320 F 2812 is presented. The system is applied in the intermediate guide roll system, and the application result indicates {{that the system is}} characterized by fast response and steady operation and it is a good solution for the motor vibration. ...|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{yourself}} {{without a}} sewing machine, broad fabric, simple paper patterns, a tape measure, {{or even a}} sharp pair of scissors. These are the beginning of folkloric clothes. The clothes {{for the most part}} are made from square and oblong pieces, put together like a jigsaw puzzle with <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> lengths from hand looms. They are made of curving circles, curves and tapered seams, with no waste of materials. It all sounds very primitive, but on a closer inspection, traditional clothes are everything that most modern fashions are not. They are practical, versatile, comfortable, durable and flattering; in short, masterpieces of style. Style always begins with a simple shape, and above all, simple shapes are functional and practical. But what has function to do with fashion? Only the fact that the best known names in fashion design have established their reputations by turning their backs on functionality, concentrating on style. And where do they seek inspiration?

To avoid this undesirable result, several options are available. Therefore, the studies on this area are about the investigation of the influences of some material types and machine parameters on the abrasion resistance of chenille yarns and fabrics produced with these yarns.

40|$|Like {{any other}} {{industry}}, apparel industry too tries to minimize their product cost by reducing production waste. Voltage fluctuations and power failures {{are two of}} the most concerning factors affecting the production. Even though these voltage fluctuations & voltage failures affect different kinds of looms at different degrees, its effect on the weaving looms which manufacture elastics is severe. As a <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> elastic manufacturer it has been faced difficulties in minimizing the number of joints in the fabric (tape), which is a direct consequence of the same. There are no research papers or commercial devices found to minimize the fabric joints in case of voltage dips or short period voltage interruptions.

These amine groups provide excellent electrostatic and hydrogen bonding sites and are the main factors contributing to the substantively of the dye molecules. Acid dyes have very little affinity for cotton, but cationic cotton can be dyed readily with acid dyes. The ammonium groups act as dye sites (Run-ling 2010).|$|R

50|$|Along {{with that}} of tapes, fringes, and other smallwares, the {{manufacture}} of cloth ribbons forms a special department of the textile industries. The essential feature of a ribbon loom is the simultaneous weaving in one loom frame {{of two or more}} webs, going up to as many as forty <b>narrow</b> <b>fabrics</b> in modern looms. To affect the conjoined throwing of all the shuttles and the various other movements of the loom, the automatic action of the power-loom is necessary, and it is a remarkable fact that the self-acting ribbon loom was known and extensively used more than a century before the famous invention of Cartwright. A loom in which several narrow webs could be woven at one time is mentioned as having been working in Dantzig {{towards the end of the}} 16th century. Similar looms were at work in Leiden in 1620, where their use gave rise to so much discontent and rioting on the part of the weavers that the states-general had to prohibit their use. The prohibition was renewed at various intervals throughout the century, and in the same interval the use of the ribbon loom was interdicted in most of the principal industrial centres of Europe. In 1676, under the name of the Dutch loom or engine loom, it was brought to London, and although its introduction there caused some disturbance, it does not appear to have been prohibited. In 1745, John Kay, the inventor of the fly-shuttle, obtained, conjointly with Joseph Stell, a patent for improvements in the ribbon loom. Since that period, it has benefited by the inventions applied to weaving machinery generally.|$|R
