30|$|Tuna fishes, Scombridae family, {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important marine resources for industrial fishing activities in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea (Kamrani et al. 2010). The Scombridae is a family of 15 genera and about 50 species of epipelagic marine fishes (Block and Stevens 2001). The main tuna species caught in the Iranian waters of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea are: longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol Bleeker, 1851), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares Bonnaterre, 1788), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis Linnaeus, 1758), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis Cantor, 1849), frigate tuna (Auxis thazard Lacepede, 1800), <b>Narrow-barred</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus commerson Lacepede, 1800) and Indo-Pacific king mackerel (Scomberomorus guttatus Bloch & Schneider, 1801). Tuna fishes constitute around 50 % of total landings of the Hormozgan province and total annual commercial landings of tuna fishes in Iranian waters of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea were around 175, 000 tonnes. Longtail tuna represented 46 % of total catch (Iran Fishery Organization 2013).|$|E

40|$|Ciguatera {{is a type}} of food {{poisoning}} that results from eating certain tropical fish which have become toxic. It is common in Australia: 175 outbreaks, which involved 527 people, were reported in Queensland between 1965 and 1984. It seems restricted to certain areas around the Australian coastline. Most reports have involved the <b>narrow-barred</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomberomorus commersoni, most of which were caught in southern Queensland waters. Up to 2100 cases may have occurred in north Queensland between 1965 and 1984, which were not recorded by the writers. The symptoms of ciguatera in Australia are similar to those reported elsewhere in the South Pacific. Ciguatoxin acts by increasing the permeability of excitable membranes to sodium ions. This type of membrane is found throughout the body in nerve tissue as well as in heart and skeletal muscle. The treatment of ciguatera remains symptomatic and supportive only. Major advances in treatment for ciguatera and detection of ciguatoxin await the means of producing additional ciguatoxin...|$|E
40|$|Small juveniles of {{the nine}} species of scombrids in Australian waters are morphologically similar to one another and, consequently, {{difficult}} to identify to species level. We show that the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene region is {{a powerful tool for}} identification of these young fish. Using this method, we identified 50 juvenile scombrids collected from Exmouth Bay, Western Australia. Six species of scombrids were apparent in this sample of fish: <b>narrow-barred</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus commerson), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta), frigate tuna (Auxis thazard), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), leaping bonito (Cybiosarda elegans), and kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis). The presence of Indian mackerel, frigate tuna, leaping bonito, and kawakawa is the first indication that coastal waters may be an important spawning habitat for these species, although offshore spawning may also occur. The occurrence of small juvenile S. commerson was predicted from the known spawning patterns of that species, but other mackerel species (Scomberomorus munroi, Scomberomorus queenslandicus, Scomberomorus semifasiciatus) likely to be spawning during the sampling period were not detected among the 50 small juveniles analyzed here...|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Narrow-barred</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomberomorus commerson, is an epipelagic and {{migratory species}} of family Scombridae {{which have a}} {{significant}} role in terms of ecology and fishery. 100 samples were collected from the Persian Gulf, Oman Sea and Arabian Sea. Part of their dorsal fins was snipped and transferred to micro-tubes containing ethanol; then, DNAs were extracted and HRM-Real Time PCR was performed to designate representative specimens for sequencing. Phylogenetic relationships of S. commerson from Persian Gulf, Oman Sea and Arabian Sea were investigated using sequence data of mitochondrial DNA D-loop region. None clustered Neighbor Joining tree indicated the proximity amid S. commerson in four sites. As numbers demonstrated in sequence analyses of mitochondrial DNA D-Loop region a sublimely high degree of genetic similarity among S. commerson from the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea were perceived, thereafter, having one stock structure of S. commerson in four regions were proved, and this approximation can be merely justified by their migration process along the coasts of Oman Sea and Persian Gulf. Therefore, the assessment of distribution patterns of 20 haplotypes in the constructed phylogenetic tree using mtDNA D-Loop sequences ascertained that no significant clustering according to the sampling sites was concluded...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} interest and growth potential has emerged for Norwegian salmon in Iran’s seafood market. Willingness to pay (WTP) for Norwegian salmon, Iranian rainbow trout, and Iranian <b>narrow-barred</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> is estimated for seafood consumers in Iran. Marginal effects of taste, convenience, nutrition, and demographic factors on WTP, are also estimated. A survey among 359 food shoppers {{was conducted in}} Tehran province, employing a Multiple Price List (MPL) and a stated preferences method. Based on this survey, estimated WTP for Norwegian salmon is $ 12. 54, which is almost half of its current price in the market. The results indicate that WTP for Norwegian salmon is higher among high-income groups; and also taste, nutrition, and consumption frequency can increase this WTP up to $ 17. 45. This implies that businesses {{can take advantage of}} the existing opportunities for Norwegian salmon among Iranian seafood consumers by increasing their WTP and balancing the prices accordingly. Differentiating Norwegian salmon with respect to its attributes, and using local seafood stores in wealthy regions as the distribution channel, are the suggested strategies for development of the consumption of Norwegian salmon among Iranian seafood consumers...|$|E
40|$|Estimates {{of genetic}} {{effective}} population size (Ne) using molecular markers are a potentially useful {{tool for the}} management of endangered through to commercial species. However, pitfalls are predicted when the effective size is large because estimates require large numbers of samples from wild populations for statistical validity. Our simulations showed that linkage disequilibrium estimates of Ne up to 10, 000 with finite confidence limits can be achieved with sample sizes of approximately 5000. This number was deduced from empirical allele frequencies of seven polymorphic microsatellite loci in a commercially harvested fisheries species, the <b>narrow-barred</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus commerson). As expected, the smallest SD of Ne estimates occurred when low-frequency alleles were excluded. Additional simulations indicated that the linkage disequilibrium method was sensitive to small numbers of genotypes from cryptic species or conspecific immigrants. A correspondence analysis algorithm was developed to detect and remove outlier genotypes that could possibly be inadvertently sampled from cryptic species or nonbreeding immigrants from genetically separate populations. Simulations demonstrated the value of this approach in Spanish mackerel data. When putative immigrants were removed from the empirical data, 95 % of the Ne estimates from jacknife resampling were greater than 24, 000...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} <b>narrow-barred</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus commerson) was {{examined}} over a broad spatial scale encompassing {{the east coast}} of Queensland, Australia. Our aim was to use back-calculation to identify potential biases in growth estimation, and to provide a more recent estimate of growth for Spanish mackerel on {{the east coast of}} Queensland. Growth trends were determined using the body proportional hypothesis (BPH) back-calculation model and compared between back-calculated and observed length-at-age data. The back-calculated von Bertalanffy growth function parameters estimated for males and females, respectively, were L∞ = 1047 mm, K = 0. 75, t 0 = – 0. 18 and L∞ = 1248 mm, K = 0. 51 and t 0 = – 0. 39. Significant differences in growth of Spanish mackerel sampled among different regions along the east coast were observed. A comparison of back-calculated and observed length-at-age data revealed significant biases in the observed length-at-age data for younger aged fish. Our findings contrast with previous estimates of growth for Spanish mackerel from the east coast of Queensland and highlight the use of back-calculation for the first few annuli as a means of avoiding biases in growth estimation arising from gear selectivity associated with fishery-dependent samples of fast-growing fish...|$|E
