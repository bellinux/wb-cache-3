500|$|By early 2014, {{the lack}} of a clear {{mainstream}} Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election led some supporters, donors, and pollsters to suggest Romney stage a third run. Regarding such a possibility, Romney at first responded, [...] "Oh, <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no.</b> <b>No,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no.</b> <b>No,</b> <b>no,</b> no." [...] Nevertheless, speculation continued: the continuing unpopularity of Obama led to buyer's remorse among some voters; the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine made Romney's [...] "No. 1 geopolitical foe" [...] remark look prescient; and an August 2014 poll of Iowan Republicans showed Romney with a large lead there over other potential 2016 candidates. A poll conducted in July 2014 by CNN showed Romney with a 53 to 44 lead over Obama in a hypothetical election [...] "redo." [...] By early 2015, Romney was actively considering the idea and contacting his network of supporters. [...] In doing so he was positioning himself in the invisible primary – the preliminary jockeying for the backing of party leaders, donors, and political operatives – against former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who had already set a likely campaign in motion and would be a rival to Romney for establishment Republican support. Despite support in some quarters for a third bid for the presidency, there was a backlash against him from conservatives who wanted a fresher face without a history of presidential losses, and many of Romney's past donors were not willing to commit to him again. Romney announced on January 30, 2015 that he would not run for president in 2016, saying that while he thought he could win the nomination, [...] "one of our next generation of Republican leaders" [...] would be better positioned to win the general election.|$|E

2500|$|Calling {{the uproar}} messy, Caroline Framke of Vox said killing off Lexa [...] "may have alienated part of [...] for good[...]" [...] She argued that [...] "on the one hand, [...] death was gut wrenching, and it {{unexpectedly}} brought together several disparate story strands in The 100 's floundering third season. On the other, Lexa was an openly queer woman leading 12 armies, a rare sight for LGBTQ representation on television. Less rare, unfortunately, is the trope {{of television and}} movies killing gay women off for shock value." [...] Framke was especially critical of the show having Lexa die immediately after having sex and pillow talk with Clarke, which were long-awaited scenes; to Framke, this signaled [...] "sex, love, death", particularly for lesbian couples. Eric Goldman of IGN argued similarly, stating, [...] "No, <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no.</b> [...] If there's one thing I truly hate about how Lexa's death was handled, it's this." [...] Feeling that this setup was [...] "really trite and cliché", and made worse by the dead lesbian trope, he commented, [...] "While I don't think The 100 writers ever intended to imply 'sex = death,' it ended up coming off that way." [...] He felt fans of the couple [...] "were truly manipulated and treated poorly" [...] and that, given how important the couple was to people, they deserved more time to see them happy. [...] "To the LGBTQ fandom who looked at Lexa as important, I can sympathize," [...] he said, [...] "but as a straight white male, I wouldn't dream of saying 'I totally get it.'" [...] Goldman, like Framke, however, felt Lexa's death was {{a good opportunity to}} propel the show's story of artificial intelligence (AI) with respect to Lexa forward. [...] "If The 100 is smart—and it usually is—Lexa's death will be the defining moment of the season," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|The role of Mopsa was {{originally}} {{performed by a}} soprano; however, a later revision by Purcell stated that {{it was to be}} performed by [...] "Mr. Pate in woman's habit", presumably to have a grotesque effect and highlight the refrain [...] "No, <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> no; <b>no</b> kissing at all" [...] in the dialogue between Corydon and Mopsa. Also, it is not entirely clear what the word [...] "countertenor" [...] means in this context. The record is ambivalent as to whether Purcell (himself a countertenor) used a tenor with a particularly high range (though lighter at the top) and tessitura (known sometimes as a haute-contre, the descendants of the contratenors alti of medieval polyphony) or a falsettist. It seems that throughout his career he used both. [...] However, purely for reasons of dramatic verisimilitude, it is more likely than not that the travesty role of Mopsa was taken by a falsettist, and the presence of a duet for two male altos ("Let the fifes and the clarions") makes it seem more probable that for this work falsettists were employed.|$|R
