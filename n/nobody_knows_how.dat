At midnight, he watches as {{everyone}} except himself falls asleep as the Strangers stop time and physically rearrange the city as well as changing people's identities and memories. Murdoch learns that {{he comes from a}} coastal town called Shell Beach, a town familiar to everyone, though <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to leave the city to travel there, and all of his attempts to do so are unsuccessful for varying reasons. Meanwhile, the Strangers inject one of their men, Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien), with memories intended for Murdoch in an attempt to predict his movements and track him down.|$|E
25|$|The {{casualties}} {{on both sides}} were high. There are about 15,000 Germans buried in the cemetery at Halbe, making it the largest war cemetery in Germany from World War II. About 10,000 are unidentified soldiers killed {{during the first half}} of 1945. The Red army claimed to have killed 60,000 German soldiers and taken 120,000 as prisoners. The number of prisoners is confirmed by German official sources, while other sources consider it to be exaggerated. Thousands of Red Army soldiers died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth–Zossen road (Bundesstraße 96). These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total will never be known. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> many civilians died, but it could have been as high as 10,000.|$|E

Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort.

25|$|On January 28, 2007 a {{woman named}} Roberta Shalaby was found badly beaten on the {{sidewalk}} outside the Hells Angels' clubhouse at 77 East Third Street in the East Village, Manhattan. The resulting investigation by the NYPD has been criticized by the group for its intensity. The police were refused access to the Hells Angels clubhouse and responded by closing off the area, setting up sniper positions, and sending in an armored personnel carrier. After obtaining a warrant, the police searched the clubhouse and arrested one Hells Angel who was later released. The group claims to have no connection with the beating of Shalaby. Five security cameras cover {{the entrance to the}} New York chapter's East 3rd Street club house, but the NY HAMC maintains <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> Shalaby was beaten nearly to death at their front door. A club lawyer said they intended to sue the city of New York for false arrest and possible civil rights violations.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, George Roca {{produced}} and directed a concert {{film about the}} band titled <b>Nobody</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>How</b> to Talk to Children. It chronicles The White Stripes' four-night stand at New York City's Bowery Ballroom in 2002, and contains live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Its 2004 release was suppressed by the band's management, however, after they discovered that Roca had been showing it at the Seattle Film Festival without permission. According to the band, the film was [...] "not up to the standards our fans have come to expect"; even so, it remains a highly prized bootleg.|$|E

500|$|In August, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{the recording of}} its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K. At the start of 2013, Megadeth left Roadrunner Records for Mustaine's newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. The album, Super Collider, was released in June and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position since 1994's Youthanasia. Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative. Shortly {{after the release of}} Super Collider, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which gave him a sense of mortality. Mustaine elaborated: [...] "You know, time is short. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> long they're gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can." ...|$|E
500|$|At dawn on 28 April, {{the youth}} {{divisions}} Clausewitz, Scharnhorst, and Theodor Körner, attacked from the south-west toward {{the direction of}} Berlin. They were part of Wenck's XX Corps and were made up of men from the officer training schools, making them {{some of the best}} units the Germans had in reserve. They covered a distance of about , before being halted at the tip of Lake Schwielow, south-west of Potsdam and still [...] from Berlin. During the night, General Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his XII Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible. At that point, support from the IX Army could no longer be expected. In the meantime, about 25,000 German soldiers of the IX Army, along with several thousand civilians, succeeded in reaching the lines of the XII Army after breaking out of the Halbe pocket. The casualties on both sides were very high. Nearly 30,000 Germans were buried after the battle in the cemetery at Halbe. About 20,000 soldiers of the Red Army also died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth-Zossen road. These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total of those who died will never be known. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> many civilians died {{but it could have been}} as high as 10,000.|$|E
500|$|Server Sundaram {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Tamil cinema, and is believed by many critics to be Nagesh's breakthrough {{role as an}} actor and Balachander's first success in Tamil cinema. Actor Kamal Haasan compared his 2015 film Uttama Villain (which also starred Balachander) to Server Sundaram, finding it to be [...] "both emotional and humorous" [...] like the latter. The success of Server Sundaram led to many collaborations between Nagesh and Balachander, notable of which include Neerkumizhi (1965), Major Chandrakanth (1966), Ethir Neechal (1968) and Apoorva Raagangal (1975). Film historian Mohan V. Raman noted, [...] "By casting [...] in Server Sundaram, ... made the comedian a serious actor." [...] The film also became noted for introducing the anti-hero to Tamil cinema {{as well as the}} style of delivering short and fast-paced dialogues. A dialogue spoken by Nagesh's character, [...] "Long, long ago... so long ago, <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> long ago" [...] became popular. Balachander mentions the dialogue in Uttama Villain as a build-up to the film his character directs. Actor Appukutty worked in several hotels and restaurants as a cleaner and server before making his debut as the lead actor with Azhagarsamiyin Kuthirai (2011) which won him the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor; Kumar Chellappan of Daily News and Analysis compared this to the plot of Server Sundaram. Bharatiya Janata Party member L. Ganesan considered Server Sundaram to be an example [...] "of good Tamil cinema globally." [...] Following Nagesh's death in 2009, Sify ranked Server Sundaram fourth in its list, [...] "10 Best Films of late Nagesh", commenting, [...] "A hotel waiter becomes a superstar and the transformation is shown brilliantly by the actor." [...] Sri Lankan historian Sachi Sri Kantha included Server Sundaram in his list compiling [...] "the ten landmark Tamil movies, spanning all genres, which delighted the multitude of fans immensely". The sequence where Sundaram balances several vessels in one hand, referred to by the Hindustan Times Gautaman Bhaskaran as the [...] "dumara-tumbler" [...] sequence, attained popularity, as did the scene where Sundaram's mother realises that he is not a hotel manager but a waiter.|$|E
