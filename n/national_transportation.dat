5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error. The NTSB was unable to determine which person was flying the aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E

5|$|<b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) and Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.|$|E
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's improper execution of an instrument approach, combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E
5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E

5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system.|$|E
5|$|Malaysian {{investigators}} set up {{an international}} working group—the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)—consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 and the ground station, especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's Inmarsat, Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E
5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E
25|$|Worried {{about the}} criticism, Congress passed the <b>National</b> Capital <b>Transportation</b> Act of 1960, which {{established}} the <b>National</b> Capital <b>Transportation</b> Agency (NCTA) {{to plan for}} both mass transit and new highways in the District of Columbia. The legislation also placed a moratorium on any highway or bridge construction west of 12th Street NW until July 1, 1965.|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of December 9, 2016, Sherman died when his Zenair CH 601 Zodiac crashed outside of Marengo, Illinois. He was 63. He was flying {{from his home in}} Poplar Grove to Schaumburg Regional Airport to attend a holiday party. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{determined}} that Sherman's plane lost control soon after taking off, and that it crashed around 6:19 p.m. on December 9. Federal Aviation Administration records also showed that Sherman had a sport pilot certificate, meaning that by flying at night, he was violating the restrictions on his license.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington {{at the behest of the}} State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
