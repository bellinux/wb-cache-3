5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Erin {{tries to}} break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their {{relationship}} can work out if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{simplicity}} of the above proof, it is rather difficult for an automated theorem prover to produce it. The main difficulty lies in an automated discovery of the Cantor diagonal set.

25|$|The primary Scottish {{objective}} of ending the Union was now possible {{and they wanted}} to consolidate their position; although willing to assist an English rising or French invasion, they would <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on their own. For the Irish, only a Stuart on the British throne could provide the autonomous, Catholic Ireland promised them by James II. Charles argued only removing the Hanoverians could guarantee an independent Scotland and thousands of supporters would join once they entered England, while the Marquis d'Eguilles provided assurances a French landing was imminent.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{was accused}} of impiety by Meletus, Anytus and Lycon. His trial took place in 399 BC and the jury found him guilty with 280 votes to 220. His death {{sentence}} was decided in {{a second round of}} voting, which was even worse for the philosopher. Nonetheless, Socrates did not lose his calm demeanor and, although during the trial he could propose to the jury his self-exile, he did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> when his friends offered to help him flee afterward, since life away from his beloved city was pointless for him.|$|E
25|$|Stringham {{opposed the}} plan to block the inlets from the beginning. He {{believed}} that the tidal currents would either sweep the impediments away or would rapidly scour new channels. As he saw it, the Rebels could not be denied access to the sounds unless the inlets were actually held by the Union. In other words, {{in order to establish}} an effective blockade in this part of North Carolina, the forts that the state had set up would have to be captured. Since the Navy could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> alone, the cooperation of the Army would be needed.|$|E

25|$|The decrees of {{the council}} were {{acknowledged}} in Italy, Portugal, Poland and by the Catholic princes of Germany at the Diet of Augsburg in 1566. Philip II of Spain accepted them for Spain, the Netherlands and Sicily inasmuch as they did not infringe the royal prerogative. In France they were officially recognised by the king only in their doctrinal parts. The disciplinary sections received official recognition at provincial synods and were enforced by the bishops. No {{attempt was made to}} introduce it into England. Pius IV sent the decrees to Mary, Queen of Scots, with a letter dated 13 June 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but she dared <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in the face of John Knox and the Reformation.|$|E
25|$|Korolev {{proposed}} communications {{satellites and}} a modified Vostok useful for photographic reconnaissance to quiet Soviet military objections {{about the cost}} of planetary and manned programs of no perceived value for national defense. Korolev planned to move forward with Soyuz craft able to dock with other craft in orbit and exchange crews. He was directed by Khrushchev to cheaply produce more 'firsts' for the piloted program, including a multi-manned flight. Korolev was reported to have resisted the idea as the Vostok was a one-man spacecraft and the three-man Soyuz was several years away from being able to fly. Khrushchev was not interested in technical excuses and {{let it be known that}} if Korolev could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> he would give the work to his rival, Vladimir Chelomei.|$|E
25|$|François Coignet was a French {{industrialist}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a pioneer in the}} development of structural, prefabricated and reinforced concrete. Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a technique for constructing building structures. In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four story house at 72 rue Charles Michels in the suburbs of Paris. Coignet's descriptions of reinforcing concrete suggests that he did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for means of adding strength to the concrete but for keeping walls in monolithic construction from overturning. In 1854, English builder William B. Wilkinson reinforced the concrete roof and floors in the two-storey house he was constructing. His positioning of the reinforcement demonstrated that, unlike his predecessors, he had knowledge of tensile stresses.|$|E

25|$|One {{night after}} a party, Peggy decides {{to sleep with}} Charlie. He then flips out and reminds {{her that she had}} rebuffed him the weekend before and {{therefore}} believes she is playing games, then drives her home. Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends up at an all-night cafe. As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him. After finding out they have more in common than originally thought, they ride off on his motorcycle. In a field, they smoke weed and find out more about one another. When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she already did that and will <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.|$|E
25|$|Carla is in {{the frame}} for Tina's murder but after {{evidence}} and his outburst at Tina's funeral, Peter is {{arrested and charged with}} the murder. While in Highfield Prison, Peter meets Jim McDonald, who supplies him with booze while making Peter get son Steve McDonald and Liz to visit. After Peter fails to Jim's command, Jim stops Peter's provision so Peter finds the booze supply and drinks it all, resulting in him being taken to hospital with internal bleeding. Peter later tells Carla he knew she killed Tina even though he did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> he will take her secret to the grave. Carla considers going to the police but Rob is adamant she does not. Peter tells Tracy about Jim after he is beaten by Jim's lackeys, so she tells Steve to stop visiting and Jim turns nasty. A terrified Deirdre Barlow asks Jim's ex-wife Liz McDonald to talk to Jim, so she does and Jim leaves Peter alone.|$|E
25|$|Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters was {{established}} under General Douglas Macarthur's South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command on 20April 1942. All Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flying {{units in the}} theatre, except training squadrons, {{were assigned to the}} control of the AAF commander, Lieutenant General George Brett, along with all United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (NEI) units. The RAAF's operational headquarters, including all geographically based area commands, fighter sectors, and combat air bases, were also subordinate to AAF Headquarters. On 3September 1942, the new AAF commander, Major General George Kenney, formed the bulk of his USAAF squadrons into the Fifth Air Force. He then formed the majority of RAAF units, as well as the 49th Fighter Group USAAF, into another organisation, initially known as Coastal Defence Command, with his chief of staff, Air Vice Marshal William (Bill) Bostock, as air officer commanding. The establishment of Coastal Defence Command was officially announced on 8September 1942; the new formation was renamed RAAF Command three days later, as Bostock felt that the previous name did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> justice. The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under RAAF Command were those based in New Guinea as No.9 Operational Group RAAF, which was controlled by Fifth Air Force.|$|E

25|$|On April 20, 1865, George Atzerodt, a {{co-conspirator}} in {{the assassination}} of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, was captured in Germantown. He had been assigned by John Wilkes Booth to assassinate U.S. Vice President Andrew Johnson, but did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and instead fled Washington, D.C., {{on the night of}} the Lincoln assassination. He was captured at the farm of his cousin Hartman Richter, on Schaeffer Road near Clopper Road. Atzerodt was hanged on July 7, 1865, along with Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, and David Herold at Washington, D.C.'s Fort McNair. George Atzerodt had come to the town with his family from Prussia when he was about nine years old. When he was about 14 his father moved the family to Virginia, but George still had many friends and relatives in Germantown. He was living in Port Tobacco during the Civil War, and supplementing his meager income as a carriage painter by smuggling people across the Potomac River in a row boat. This clandestine occupation brought him into contact with John Surratt and John Wilkes Booth and he was drawn into a plot to kidnap President Lincoln. On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth gave George Atzerodt a gun and told him that he was to kill the vice president, Andrew Johnson, which he refused to do. George panicked when he found out that Booth had shot President Lincoln and made his way to his cousin's, Hartman Richter's, house in Germantown to hide. He was discovered there by soldiers three days after the assassination and was hanged with other conspirators on July 7.|$|E

Furthermore, the game's soundtrack has been selected to include more dance and pop tracks taken from European artists to make the game more Euro-friendly.|$|E

Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series, Bell said, [...] "I have now decided I will <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. I have had enough of the BBC's attitude." [...] The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one-off special.

500|$|In Stage one (obedience and {{punishment}} driven), individuals {{focus on the}} direct {{consequences of their actions}} on themselves.

[...] The worse the punishment for the act is, the more [...] "bad" [...] the act is perceived to be.

He added that the leaked version was an early, unmixed demo recording and, moreover, denied leaking the song, arguing that, {{despite the fact that he}} has been asked to leak the full song, he did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The musical style of the demo was compared with Spears' 2007 single [...] "Piece of Me", and the song itself generated comparisons with Spears' sound in her fifth studio album Blackout.
