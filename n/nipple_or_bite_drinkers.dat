50|$|The other {{goal of a}} {{hose clamp}} is to provide {{mechanical}} attachment keeping the hose attached to a barb, hose <b>nipple,</b> <b>or</b> tube. To do this the clamp is typically placed on the hose behind the first ramp of the barb or behind the raised area {{near the end of}} and completely around the circumference of the hose <b>nipple</b> <b>or</b> tube called a bead. If the hose were to slide the clamp would have to expand to fit over the barb or raised bead. This keeps the hose attached to the barb, hose <b>nipple,</b> <b>or</b> beaded tube.|$|R

50|$|Nipple {{discharge}} that is NOT normal is bloody, {{comes from}} only one <b>nipple,</b> <b>or</b> {{comes out on}} its own without squeezing <b>or</b> touching the <b>nipple.</b> Nipple discharge {{is more likely to}} be normal if it comes out of both <b>nipples</b> <b>or</b> happens when the nipple is squeezed your nipples. Squeezing the nipple to check for discharge can make it worse. Leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop.|$|R

40|$|Molluscum contagiosum is {{a common}} {{cutaneous}} infection caused by a double-stranded DNA poxvirus. Skin lesions classically present as small, flesh-colored papules with central umbilication. Lesions are frequently seen on the face, trunk, and extremities of children, or on the genitals of young adults as a sexually transmitted infection. Molluscum contagiosum on the <b>nipple</b> <b>or</b> areola has only been previously described in 4 women.

50|$|To {{ensure a}} good seal, the barb, hose <b>nipple,</b> <b>or</b> beaded tube must be smooth {{and free of}} nicks, scratches, or contamination. Stuck hoses should never be removed by {{slitting}} them, as this can leave a scratch on the fitting which will cause a leak.|$|R
50|$|The name Dedan comes {{possibly}} {{from the}} Hebrew noun (dd), meaning breast <b>or</b> <b>nipple,</b> <b>or</b> the Hebrew verb (dada), meaning move slowly, lead slowly (Psalm 42:5, Isaiah 38:15).

50|$|Challenges in {{selecting}} the least favourite date ranges from licking food off {{each of the}} date's bodies, sniffing {{various parts of the}} date's bodies e.g. belly button, toes, bum crack, being spanked or kissed by each date and deciding which date has the best <b>nipples</b> <b>or</b> penis.|$|R

50|$|Other {{strategies}} for protracting inverted nipples include regularly stimulating the nipples to a protruding state, {{in an attempt}} to gradually loosen the nipple tissue. Some sex toys designed for nipple stimulation, such as suction cups or clamps may also cause inverted <b>nipples</b> to protract <b>or</b> stay protracted longer. There are special devices specifically designed to draw out inverted <b>nipples,</b> <b>or</b> a home-made <b>nipple</b> protractor can be constructed out of a 10 ml disposable syringe. These methods are often used in preparation for breast-feeding, which can sometimes cause inverted nipples to become protracted permanently.|$|R

Signs {{of breast cancer}} may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the <b>nipple,</b> <b>or</b> a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.|$|R
50|$|Mohs surgery {{should not}} be used on the trunk or {{extremities}} for uncomplicated, non-melanoma skin cancer of less than one centimeter in size. On these parts of the body, the risks exceed the benefits of the procedure. Due to high risk of recurrence among other reasons, Mohs surgery could be considered for skin cancers on hands, feet, ankles, shins, <b>nipples,</b> <b>or</b> genitals.|$|R

40|$|Weaning {{is one of}} the {{important}} aspects of mother-infant relationships. Studies reporting maternal investment or mother-infant relationships often take suckling frequency as a proxy for breastfeeding and active rejection by the mother as weaning. In non-human primates and mammals, this active rejection is marked by mother punishing, <b>biting</b> <b>or</b> threatening infant on initiating <b>nipple</b> contact <b>or</b> while breastfeeding. Here, the researcher reports a non-punishing strategy employed by mothers in a group of bonnet macaque inhabiting a relatively safe area...|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{eruption}} normally {{starts from}} 6 months of age. Teeth that appear at birth are called natal teeth, whereas, teeth that erupt {{during the first}} month of life are called neonatal teeth. Both are uncommon, with the ratio of natal to neonatal is 3 : 1. Presence of neonatal teeth may lead to complication in mother like painful <b>bitten</b> <b>or</b> bleeding <b>nipples</b> <b>or</b> it may cause complications in babies like difficulty in feeding, pain/distress due to erupting tooth, swallowing of the tooth, repeated trauma to the tip or undersurface of the tongue resulting in Riga-Fede ulceration and rarely aspiration. We are presenting a 15 -day-old male baby who admitted in our hospital primarily with excessive crying and poor feeding and on a thorough physical examination revealed an erupting neonatal tooth. Other causes of excessive crying have been excluded...|$|R
25|$|Within days to {{weeks after}} the onset of local infection, the Borrelia {{bacteria}} may begin to spread through the bloodstream. EM may develop at sites across the body that bear {{no relation to the}} original tick bite.
