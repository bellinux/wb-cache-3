5|$|Shortly {{after this}} turmoil, Jamal was rehired by WWE, {{and he and}} Rosey were {{scheduled}} to reunite 3-Minute Warning. The duo wrestled as a tag team during a dark match before the January 9, 2006, episode of Raw. However, on March 21, 2006, Rosey was released from his WWE contract, and the hinted return of 3-Minute Warning <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> television.|$|E
5|$|After Knight's granddaughter {{forwarded}} him {{a copy of}} Knight's autobiographical manuscript, Ottaviani made Knight's role more prominent. Ottaviani's {{interest in}} Knight eventually led to his company G.T. Labs publishing Knight's autobiography, with notes by Ottaviani and forewords by Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen. Other character relationships were fictionalized as well; editor James Gordon Bennet, Jr. never lobbied with Cope, and never exposed Marsh's will. Cope's bones also <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> New York.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a handful}} of men reached Illinois Country, help <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the fort. Most of the {{remaining}} members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region {{as part of the}} Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Brown {{traveled}} to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan {{in search of}} desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get along well, and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> America. Following that trip, Brown wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered {{to be one of}} the best works written about the Arabian horse.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the Rosetta Stone. It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Louvre Museum. It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801. It is now on display at the British Museum.|$|E
50|$|Rabb {{was signed}} as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys in 2007. He was {{released}} {{before the end}} of the season and <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> on <b>to</b> the active roster.|$|R

50|$|On April 30, 1969 he {{was traded}} by the Orioles along with pitcher John O'Donoghue to the Seattle Pilots, and <b>never</b> again <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the major league}} level. His {{lifetime}} ERA for 3.1 innings stands at 0.00.|$|R
5|$|The Fragile Yellow Arc of Fragrance was {{the first}} script sent by Moris Farhi. It was one episode long and was a calling card piece never seriously pitched for {{production}}. This story <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the production stage, and {{was included in the}} 2009 publication of Farhi's script for Farewell Great Macedon. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{her house}} that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police {{the next day and}} began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{reshuffle}} in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion became the Austrian foreign minister, freeing Metternich {{to assume the}} post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. He <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806. He enjoyed being in demand and was happy {{to be sent to}} France on a generous salary of 90,000 gulden a year. After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von Floret, whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Saint-Cloud; soon, the War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards. Metternich's wife and children joined him in October, and he went into society, using his charm to win great eminence there. The presence of Eleonore did not prevent him from a series of affairs that certainly included Napoleon's sister Caroline Murat, Laure Junot, and perhaps many besides.|$|E
50|$|After {{his return}} from Vietnam, he again played in the Dodgers' farm system, but his war {{injuries}} had impaired his baseball skills, and he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> the major leagues. He became a car salesman, married twice, and had two sons.|$|R

5|$|Jagger {{has also}} had an {{intermittent}} acting career, most well-known {{for his role in}} Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. Jagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry the original performer from its run on London's West End. The same year he was approached by director Alejandro Jodorowsky {{to play the role of}} Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, but the movie <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978 and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, in the late 1970s. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2002).|$|E
5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E
5|$|Street & Smith, one of {{the longest}} {{established}} and most respected publishers, shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, partially {{as a result of the}} success of paperbacks. Standard continued with Startling and Thrilling, but the end came only a few years later. In 1954, Fredric Wertham published Seduction of the Innocent, a book in which he asserted that comics were inciting children to violence. A subsequent Senate subcommittee hearing led to a backlash against comics, and the publishers dropped titles in response. The financial impact spread to pulp magazines, since often a publisher would publish both. A 1955 strike by American News Corporation, the main distributor in the U.S., meant that magazines remained in warehouses and <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the newsstands; the unsold copies represented a significant financial blow and contributed to publishers' decisions to cancel magazines. Startling was {{one of the}} casualties. The schedule had already returned from monthly to bimonthly in 1953, and it became a quarterly in early 1954. Thrilling Wonder published its last issue in early 1955, and was then merged with Startling, as was Fantastic Story Magazine, another companion publication, but the combined magazine lasted only three more issues. Mines left the magazine at the end of 1954; he was succeeded for two issues by Theron Raines, who was followed by Herbert D. Kastle for the last two. The final issue was dated Fall 1955.|$|E
50|$|Ilsley {{was on the}} Cubs 1994 Opening day roster and {{appeared}} in 10 games that season. After being demoted to the minor leagues on July 7, 1994, Ilsley played {{four more years of}} professional baseball but <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> the Major Leagues.|$|R

50|$|On June 8, 1940, he hit for {{the cycle}} in a 23-2 {{win over the}} Brooklyn Dodgers. Craft joined the Navy in 1942. By the time he {{returned}} to baseball his skills had deteriorated and he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> the major leagues as a player.|$|R
50|$|In {{a career}} {{total of three}} games he was 2-for-5 (.400) with one run scored. On November 5, 1946 he was drafted by the New York Yankees from the Pirates in the 1946 minor league draft, but <b>never</b> again <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the major leagues.|$|R
