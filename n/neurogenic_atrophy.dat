50|$|<b>Neurogenic</b> <b>atrophy,</b> {{which has}} a similar effect, is muscle atrophy {{resulting}} from damage to the nerve which stimulates the muscle, causing a shriveling around otherwise healthy limbs. Also, time in a circa zero g environment without exercise will lead to atrophy.

In a similar effect, patients with a broken leg joint undergoing as little as three weeks of traction can lose enough back and buttocks muscle mass and strength as to have difficulty sitting without assistance, and experience pain, stress and burning even after a very short ten-minute exposure, when such positioning is contrived during recovery.|$|E

40|$|Background] The {{diagnosis}} of neuromuscular diseases is strongly {{based on the}} histological characterization of muscle biopsies. However, this morphological analysis is mostly a subjective process and difficult to quantify. We have tested if network science can provide a novel framework to extract useful information from muscle biopsies, developing a novel method that analyzes muscle samples in an objective, automated, fast and precise manner. [Methods] Our database consisted of 102 muscle biopsy images from 70 individuals (including controls, patients with <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophies</b> and patients with muscular dystrophies). We used this {{to develop a new}} method, Neuromuscular DIseases Computerized Image Analysis (NDICIA), that uses network science analysis to capture the defining signature of muscle biopsy images. NDICIA characterizes muscle tissues by representing each image as a network, with fibers serving as nodes and fiber contacts as links. [Results] After a ‘training’ phase with control and pathological biopsies, NDICIA was able to quantify the degree of pathology of each sample. We validated our method by comparing NDICIA quantification of the severity of muscular dystrophies with a pathologist’s evaluation of the degree of pathology, resulting in a strong correlation (R[*]=[*] 0. 900, P < 0. 00001). Importantly, our approach can be used to quantify new images without the need for prior ‘training’. Therefore, we show that network science analysis captures the useful information contained in muscle biopsies, helping the {{diagnosis of}} muscular dystrophies and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophies.</b> [Conclusions] Our novel network analysis approach will serve as a valuable tool for assessing the etiology of muscular dystrophies or <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophies,</b> and has the potential to quantify treatment outcomes in preclinical and clinical trials.

40|$|Maintenance of {{skeletal}} muscle {{structure and function}} requires innervation by motor neurons, such that denervation causes muscle atrophy. We show that myogenin, an essential regulator of muscle development, controls <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Myogenin is upregulated in {{skeletal muscle}} following denervation and regulates expression of the E 3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF 1 and atrogin- 1, which promote muscle proteolysis and atrophy. Deletion of myogenin from adult mice diminishes expression of MuRF 1 and atrogin- 1 in denervated muscle and confers resistance to atrophy. Mice lacking histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4 and 5 in skeletal muscle fail to upregulate myogenin and also preserve muscle mass following denervation. Conversely, forced expression of myogenin in skeletal muscle of HDAC mutant mice restores muscle atrophy following denervation. Thus, myogenin plays a dual role as both a regulator of muscle development and an inducer of <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophy.</b> These findings reveal a specific pathway for muscle wasting and potential therapeutic targets for this disorder...|$|E

40|$|A large {{study on}} 121 {{patients}} with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) that examined muscle biopsy samples for enterovirus by means of polymerase chain reaction analysis was carried out. The results were compared with those obtained from 101 muscle biopsy specimens from patients {{with a variety of}} other neuromuscular disorders (OND), including <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophies,</b> dystro-phies, and mitochondrial, metabolic, and endocrine myopathies. Thirty-two (26. 4 %) of the biopsy specimens from the group of patients with CFS were positive, compared with 20 (19. 8 %) from the group of patients with OND, a difference that was not significant. This finding is in contrast to those of our previous smaller study in which significantly more patients with CFS than control subjects (53 % [32 of 60] vs. 15 % [6 of 41]) had enterovirus RNA sequences in their muscle.

40|$|Spinal and bulbar {{muscular atrophy}} (SBMA) is a neuromuscular {{disorder}} caused by polyglutamine {{expansion in the}} androgen receptor (AR) and characterized {{by the loss of}} lower motor neurons. Here we investigated pathological processes occurring in muscle biopsy specimens derived from SBMA patients and, as controls, age-matched healthy subjects and patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophy.</b> We detected atrophic fibers in the muscle of SBMA, ALS and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>atrophy</b> patients. In addition, SBMA muscle was characterized by the presence {{of a large number of}} hypertrophic fibers, with oxidative fibers having a larger size compared to glycolytic fibers. Polyglutamine-expanded AR expression was decreased in whole muscle, yet enriched in the nucleus, and localized to mitochondria. Ultrastructural analysis revealed myofibrillar disorganization and streaming in zones lacking mitochondria and degenerating mitochondria. Using molecular (mtDNA copy number), biochemical (citrate synthase and respiratory chain enzymes) and morphological (dark blue area in NADH-stained muscle cross sections) analyses, we found a depletion of the mitochondria associated with enhanced mitophagy. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed an increase of phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylserines in mitochondria isolated from SBMA muscles, as well as a 50 % depletion of cardiolipin associated with decreased expression of the cardiolipin synthase gene. These observations suggest a causative link between nuclear polyglutamine-expanded AR accumulation, depletion of mitochondrial mass, increased mitophagy and altered mitochondrial membrane composition in SBMA muscle patients. Given the central role of mitochondria in cell bioenergetics, therapeutic approaches towards improving the mitochondrial network are worth considering to support SBMA patients...|$|E

40|$|Diagnosis of neuromuscular {{diseases}} {{is based}} on subjective visual assessment of biopsies from patients by the pathologist specialist.

The procedure starts with an accurate segmentation of the muscle fibers using mathematical morphology and a watershed transform. A feature extraction step is carried out in two parts: 24 features that pathologists take into account to diagnose the diseases and 58 structural features that the human eye cannot see, {{based on the assumption}} that the biopsy is considered as a graph, where the nodes are represented by each fiber, and two nodes are connected if two fibers are adjacent. A feature selection using sequential forward selection and sequential backward selection methods, a classification using a Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network, and a study of grading the severity are performed on these two sets of features. A database consisting of 91 images was used: 71 images for the training step and 20 as the test. A classification error of 0 % was obtained.

These features reproduce those seen in models of Kennedy disease, a polyglutamine expansion disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the AR gene. These findings demonstrate that toxicity in skeletal muscles is sufficient to cause motoneuron disease and indicate that overexpression of the WT AR can exert toxicity comparable with the polyglutamine expanded protein.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of inflammatory autoimmune {{diseases of}} the peripheral nervous system, leading to demyelination and/or axonal damage, remains incompletely understood. In particular, it is controversial regarding {{the extent to which}} (i) autoimmune-mediated destruction of peripheral nerves results in secondary damage of the central nervous system, and (ii) CD 4 and CD 8 T cells contribute to disease. To address these issues, we applied the murine model of P 0106 – 125 -induced experimental autoimmune neuritis. Immunization of C 57 BL/ 6 mice with P 0106 – 125 resulted in severe axonal damage and mild demyelination. Importantly, these mice developed a “dying-back” axonopathy with apoptosis of a large fraction of neurons in the anterior horn of the lumbar and thoracic spinal cord and a progressive <b>neurogenic</b> muscular <b>atrophy.</b> T cell-depletion experiments identified CD 4, but not CD 8, T cells as important mediators of experimental autoimmune neuritis. CD 4 T cells represented the major cellular source of antigen-specific interferon-γ and interleukin- 17 production, regulated the number of tumor necrosis factor-positive and inducible nitric oxide synthase-positive macrophages in the diseased sciatic nerve, and mediated axonal damage and subsequent neuronal apoptosis and <b>neurogenic</b> muscular <b>atrophy.</b> In contrast, the demyelination of peripheral nerves was only slightly ameliorated in CD 4 T cell-depleted mice.
