Assuming {{that the}} {{identity}} of a particular community is constructed by the interaction with other communities, this work analyses the construction of {{the identity of}} the Bunjevci population in the munciplaity of Lovinac (southern Lika) on three levels, local, regional and ethnic/national. Besides of the levels of identity, analysed here are the identification means where the main starting point is the presumption of how a community is defining itself towards some other community emphasising the differing characteristics. On the local level where there exists no great cultural, 2 ̆ 7 objective 2 ̆ 7, differences between individual places, in constructing borders between us-them, the 2 ̆ 7 subjective 2 ̆ 7 value-based identification or stereotypes were used. On the regional level, objective factors reach out {{that are part of the}} traditional cultural inventory and are considered characteristic of the entire region of Lika, and have a peculiar meaning as symbols. Regional determination is also partly shaped with the economic contact with Dalmatians where the basis of identification is also 2 ̆ 7 objective 2 ̆ 7, determined by economic context. On the third level there are two categories of identification, sub-ethnical (Bunjevci origins) and <b>nationality</b> (<b>Croatian).</b> Processes and the variability of identity is very visible at this level since the construction of identity comes by merging several distinguishing features, religion, ethnicity and national origin which are not always distinguished. The method of defining us and them can be seen from the name which they use to call each other, as well as their placement in a temporal/historical context. The awareness of belonging to Bunjevci is shaped by the interaction with another group; the ethnonym Bunjevci assumes significance especially in contrast with the ethnonym Vlach. Bunjevci is an identifiable sign which is determined as the others and it is understood as pejorative, as a negative attribute. According to the perceptions and understanding of most interviewees, they are not 2 ̆ 7 real 2 ̆ 7 Bunjevci. The reasoning behind this can perhaps be read in the regional political situation: the ethnonym Bunjevci in opposition with Vlach ethnonyms functions as an identification code till the Second World War when the political situation starts to change, and when other identification framework was activated i. e. nationality, which became a powerful incentive in the Homeland War where the Bunjevci-Vlachs opposition was replaced with some sort of identification shift where nationality becomes more important...|$|E

However, this logic was rather shortsighted. While many Croatian settlers as well as Croatian returnees came to Knin with enthusiasm, they became frustrated by the limited access to social and material benefits in the post-war, postsocialist situation and the diminishing power of national rights from 1998 on. The region of Knin became marginalized and 'de-modernised' and many 'national winners' became social losers. With the fragmentation of national solidarity, people in the Knin region started to construct a (fragile) local society, giving hope for the emergence of civil processes...|$|R

The Austrian government asked only for a few ten thousands of Russian troops under imperial leadership, but tzar Nicholas I of Russia decided to send 200 000 soldiers and put other 80 000 to preparedness to enter in Hungary if needed. This meant that he prepared to send 1/4th of Russia's military power in Hungary. This huge army, together with the 170 000 soldiers of the Habsburgs, together with the several tens of thousands of Serbian, Romanian and <b>Croatian</b> <b>nationality</b> troops fighting against the only 170 000 Hungarian soldiers, represented an invincible force for them.

The Pope {{referred to the}} country as to the [...] "Remnants of {{the remnants of the}} Croatian kingdom" [...] (Reliquiae reliquiarum regni Croatiae) and this description became a battle cry of the affected nobles. This loss was a death warrant for most Croatian noble families which only in 1526 voted that Habsburgs become kings of Croatia. Without any {{territory to}} control they have become only pages in history. Only the Zrinski and Frangipani Frankopan families stayed powerful because their possessions were in the unconquered, western part of Croatia. In the time of the conspiracy, they were controlling around 35% of civilian Croatia (1/3 of Croatian territory was under the emperor's direct control as the Military Frontier). After the conspiracy failed, these lands were confiscated by the emperor, who could grant them upon his discretion. Nothing is better showing situation in Croatia after conspiracy than the fact that between 1527 - 1670 there were 13 bans (viceroys) of Croatia of Croatian origin. But between 1670 and the revolution of 1848, there would be only 2 bans of <b>Croatian</b> <b>nationality.</b> The period from 1670 to the Croatian cultural revival in the 19th century was Croatia's political dark age.

40|$|Na temelju izvornih podataka autor u ovom radu ukratko prikazuje životopise nekolicine Dalmatinaca koji su se dovinuli do generalskog čina u stranim vojskama, jer vlastite nisu imali. Kako je naime Dalmacija stalno mijenjala vladare, to su i njeni sinovi služili strane vojske. Potaknut tvrdnjama da Hrvati nisu nikad marili za vojnu službu, autor ovdje donosi niz primjera koji pokazuju upravo suprotno; iako pod tuđinskom vlašću, neki su Dalmatinci, najviše hrvatske narodnosti, postigli generalsku čast u mletačkoj, francuskoj, austrijskoj, pa i ruskoj vojsci. The {{military}} history of Dalmatia being {{in large part}} a neglected subject of study the author makes an attempt to at least partly fill in the void. He does this by calling attention to those men of Dalmatian descent who managed to reach the rank of general in foreign armies. Using original material the article gives short biographies {{of a number of}} Dalmatians who attained the highest officer ranking. Because Dalmatia during the last couple of centuries has constantly had foriegn rulers, its inhabitants have served in foreign armies. Although living in these conditions, many Dalmatians, mostly of <b>Croatian</b> <b>nationality,</b> became generals. They succeeded in doing this because of extraordinary abilities and bravery in battle, but also because of skills in military tactics. Most of them, for understandable reasons, made their careers in the Venetian army but also in the French, Austrian and Russian armies. Regretably some of them participated in unjust military campaigns and wars. These examples show that Croats deserve a distinguished position within the {{military history}} of the European peoples. If these men had served in their own, national army they would have surely shown even greater heroism and military skill...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research has been to compare the levels of and to establish the connection between results of psychology {{students and their parents}} in relation to nationalism and cosmopolitanism and collectivism, and to horizontal and vertical individualism. In addition, an attempt has been made to define the contribution of socio-demographic variables, the importance of religion and the ideological orientation of the respondents along with collectivism/individualism in explaining the pronounced nature of nationalism and/or cosmopolitanism among the students and their parents. The research was carried out on a group of 200 students (26 male and 174 female) and 296 parents (143 male and 153 female), all of <b>Croatian</b> <b>nationality.</b> Three questionnaires were applied: the Nationalism and Cosmopolitanism Scale (Čorkalo and Kamenov, 1999), the HVIC questionnaire on horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism (Singelis et al., 1995) and a socio-demographic questionnaire. The results showed that parents of students express more marked nationalism and collectivism than their (adult) children, while students express more marked cosmopolitanism and horizontal individualism than their parents. However, as far as vertical individualism is concerned, there is no difference between the average results of students and parents. The correlation between the collectivism and individualism of students and their mothers and fathers is lower than that between nationalism and cosmopolitanism. The set of socio-demographic predictors, the importance of religion, ideological orientations and collectivism/individualism more reliably foresee nationalism rather than cosmopolitanism, both in the parental and student sample. The type and contribution of the individual predictors are similar in both samples, with the exception of certain socio-demographic predictors that were shown to be significant in the parental, but not in the student sample. Apart from socio-demographic predictors nationalism on the part of parents and students can also be foreseen {{on the basis of a}} more distinct right-wing political orientation, pronounced vertical individualism and a greater attachment of importance to religion, while cosmopolitanism can be foreseen on the basis of a more conspicuous left-wing political orientation on the part of the respondents...|$|R

Between 1670 and the revolution of 1848, there would be only 2 bans of <b>Croatian</b> <b>nationality.</b> The period from 1670 to the Croatian cultural revival in the 19th century was Croatia's political dark age. Meanwhile, with the victories over Turks, Habsburgs all the more insistent they spent centralization and germanization, new regained lands in liberated Slavonia started giving to foreign families as feudal goods, {{at the expense of}} domestic element. Because of this the Croatian Sabor was losing its significance, and the nobility less attended it, yet went only to the one in Hungary.In the 18th century, Croatia was one of the crown lands that supported Emperor Charles's Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and supported Empress Maria Theresa in the War of the Austrian Succession of 1741-48. Subsequently, the empress made significant contributions to Croatian matters, by making several changes in the feudal and tax system, administrative control of the Military Frontier, in 1745 administratively united Slavonia with Croatia and in 1767 organized Croatian royal council with the ban on head, however, she ignored and eventually disbanded it in 1779, and Croatia was relegated to just one seat in the governing council of Hungary, held by the ban of Croatia. To fight the Austrian centralization and absolutism, Croats passed their rights to the united government in Hungary, thus to together resist the intentions from Vienna. But the connection with Hungary soon adversely affected the position of Croats, because Magyars in the spring of their nationalism tried to Magyarize Croats, and make Croatia a part of a united Hungary. Because of this pretensions, the constant struggles between Croats and Magyars emerged, and lasted until 1918. Croats were fighting in unfavorable conditions, against both Vienna and Budapest, while divided on Banska Hrvatska, Dalmatia and Military Frontier. In such a time, with the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, its possessions in eastern Adriatic mostly came under the authority of France which passed its rights to Austria the same year. Eight years later they were restored to France as the Illyrian Provinces, but won back to the Austrian crown 1815. Though now part of the same empire, Dalmatia and Istria were part of Cisleithania while Croatia and Slavonia were in Hungarian part of the Monarchy.In the 19th century Croatian romantic nationalism emerged to counteract the non-violent but apparent Germanization and Magyarization. The Croatian national revival began in the 1830s with the Illyrian movement. The movement attracted a number of influential figures and produced some important advances in the Croatian language and culture. The champion of the Illyrian movement was Ljudevit Gaj who also reformed and standardized the Croatian literary language. Official language in Croatia has been Latin until 1847 when it became Croatian. The movement relied on a South Slavic and Panslavistic conception, and its national, political and social ideas were advanced at the time.|$|R

The paper {{presents the}} short-lived {{activities and the}} ideological profile of the first journal of Croatian National Youth in Vukovar, Gvozd. The journal was, first of all, a means of assembly of the Croatian youth from Vukovar and its surrounding area and a means of elevation of the Croatian spirit among the Croatian youth. It was {{under the influence of}} the so-called Croatian Block (consisting of the Croatian Republican Peasants’ Party [HRSS], Croatian Union [HZ], and the Croatian Party of Rights [HSP]) and it served as a transparent newspaper of these parties, who wanted the Croatian youth to become involved in the political events in Srijem and eastern Slavonija, as well as the principal newspaper of the new organization of the Croatian National Youth in indicating the directions of the cultural and political standpoints of the Croatian Youth, especially in relation to rival organizations ORJUNA (The Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists) and SRNAO (Serbian National Youth). Even though this paper presents just a small segment of the activities of the Croatian National Youth (HANAO) and its journal Gvozd in eastern Slavonija and Srijem, both in terms of time and in terms of contents, it is very important to emphasize the initial stage of the development of ideology of the Croatian youth, which had not been completely defined at the time, and which was manifested through their journal Gvozd, especially because HANAO is very quickly going to expand to all Croatian regions and become a force that the top echelons of the government are going to have to take into consideration. During its short period of activity, the journal Gvozd from Vukovar was focused mainly on solving the problem of the difficult position of the Croatian nation in eastern Slavonija and Srijem, especially in the town of Vukovar. In their striving to introduce a centralist regime into the new state and to establish a political and demographic control of the County of Srijem, the ruling radical-democratic structures populated Srijem with volunteers from the Saloniki Front (who were predominantly of Serbian <b>nationality),</b> persecuted the <b>Croatian</b> intelligence, and formed paramilitary troops (ORJUNA and SRNAO) that terrorized the Croats in the region, thus forcing Croatian national political parties to found and organize the Croatian National Youth (HANAO) as a youth organization that would respond to the regime’s terror in an adequate way – by counter-terror. The principal ideological source from which most of the articles in Gvozd stemmed was the definition of the Yugoslav state, which Gvozd considered a state of the Serbs, believing that the Serbian political factors would never allow Croats to become an equal factor in this state. With its short-lived activity Gvozd proved to be a good medium for transferring HANAO’s ideas from Vukovar by organizing many HANAO subsidies in surrounding villages, and it showed to the Croatian national parties that such an organization of Croatian youth served their narrow-partisan and also national interests as a means to exert pressure on the regime, showing also that the Croats were never going to accept such a condition in the country that was dictated by Serbian political and court circles...|$|R

Ever {{since its}} establishment, the chetnik association, {{as well as}} the greatserbian politics at large, included Osijek and the Osijek district within the sphere of their interest. This was not so surprising given that Osijek and its district, as well as all of Slavonia, had always been deemed a part of their myth of Great Serbia. Their attempts to make the myth a reality met with unfailing support of the ruling Serbian expansionist circles, primarily of those from the Radical and the Democratic Party camp, who were the founders of the first chetnik associations in the first place. The administrative partitioning of the Osijek district (extraction of the western areas and foundation of the special Valpovo district) was orchestrated to produce a relative Serbian majority in the newly founded district area. Moreover, after subsequently taking over the government over the new district, they also maneuvered themselves into positions of power in the city of Osijek, which they gradually had to abandon following the 1938 elections and the creation of the Banovina of Croatia. These changes were best reflected in the political trends, and especially in the election results of the time. The chetniks also had a special mission to complete in the Osijek area, given its <b>nationality</b> structure (<b>Croatian</b> and other non-Serb peoples’ majority) and geographical position (along the rivers Drava and Danube, a point of convergence of North-South and East-West traffic routes, but also a link between the Serbs in the East in Vojvodina and Serbia, via the Danube border and the Danube bridge close to Erdut, with those in west Slavonia); the mission was to help the Serbian expansionist authorities first, to suppress the communist movement which had a majority non-Serb membership, especially in Osijek (1920 / 21), and then, in particular, to suppress the Croatian national movement gathered around the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), while simultaneously performing a serbisation of the area. As a result of this agenda, eight colonies were established which were populated with about 3. 000 mostly Serbian volunteers and where a government was established over which the greatserbian parties had a firm hold until they were forced to relinquish the power following the 1938 elections and the establishment of the Banovina of Croatia. The mission had other effects as well. Namely, immediately following the establishment of the Association of Serbian Chetniks Petar Mrkonjić – For King and Fatherland (the so-called Račić chetniks) in 1924, in the same year the Belgrade chetnik authorities established their first board in Slavonia and Baranja in Osijek – Regional Chetnik Board for the Osijek Region and Baranja and launched its publication The Voice of Serbian Chetniks. At the same time the Local Chetnik Board in Osijek was established (which had the competence of a district board), and then the Local Chetnik Boards in Čepin and Dalj which numbered over 100 chetniks at the time. Ever since their inception, all these associations were most intimately integrated into the structures of the local government and of the police force, whose key figures were nonetheless members or heads of such associations. As this chetnik association had a marked Serbian flavor and as it most manifestly represented the greatserbian expansionist politics, its emergence and active presence sparked off strong and decisive resistance of the inhabitants of Osijek and of Osijek county, especially of Croats, but also of Germans and Hungarians, mostly those associated with the HSS. The resistance was even reinforced by a small, though politically significant, portion of Serbs gathered around Pribičević’s Independent Democratic Party (SDS) after 1927, when the party joined with the HSS to form a Peasant-Democratic Coalition (SDK). Thus even those Serbs became targets of chetnik attacks. Following the imposition of dictatorship in July 6, 1929 and the proclamation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, these overly zealous Serb sentiments led to the prohibition of activities of this chetnik association. Their activities were stopped in general, and so too in Osijek and Osijek district area. Most its members then joined the unique chetnik organization – Association of Chetniks for the Freedom and Honor of Fatherland, headed by Voivode Kosta Pećanac. As the chetniks gave their full support to King Alexander’s dictatorship (mostly under the credo: “For King and Fatherland”, and “One King, One People, One Country”) they were given free rein to pursue their activities. This had led to the launching of boards of this chetnik association in Osijek (since 1930), Čepin and Dalj (since the beginning of 1934), in Hrastin (since the end of 1934), Tenja, Bijelo Brdo, Erdut and Petrova Slatina (from 1935) and in the Stepar farms, in the vicinity of Dalj (since 1938). Some of these boards were only active at intervals, however, they gathered around 500 chetniks. These boards worked in unison with around 20 chetnik boards from the surrounding districts, some of which also had members from the Osijek area (such as e. g. in Silaš, Palača, Ada, Šodolovci from the then Vukovar district and Čepinski Martinci from the Valpovo district, which later came to be annexed to the Osijek district). In the mid- 1930 s their membership started to grow gradually and the network of their organizations started to spread throughout the entire Kingdom of Yugoslavia (to 450 chetnik subboards numbering 213. 000 members), and through the Osijek district. The chetniks took special impetus from the assassination of King Alexander in Marseilles (October 1934) and from the 1935 elections, when a host of new subboards of chetnik associations was established in the surrounding districts (especially in those in its closest proximity: the Vukovar, Vinkovci, Đakovo, Valpovo, and Sombor district), with whom those from the Osijek district worked in liaison. Such activities were also encouraged {{by the president of the}} chetnik association, Voivode Kosta Pećanac, who visited the chetnik manifestations staged in Osijek, Čepin and Dalj, but also in the surrounding towns and places e. g. Vukovar, Borovo and Đakovo. Around that time most serious clashes occurred at several places in Slavonia, between the authorities and some hetniks on the one side, and Croatian peasants on the other side, which at times ended in bloodshed (for example in Sibinj and Slavonski Brod in February 1935 when 15 villagers were killed, several were wounded and several dozens were arrested, tortured and some sentenced to 8 months up to 3 years of imprisonment). Such clashes were many, mostly brawls arising during celebrations of different kinds, ending in people being wounded or even killed, e. g. in Osijek, Čepin and Erdut. This had led the officials to temporarily dissolve the chetnik boards. However, that did not stop the brutal terrorism of the government and the chetniks in Osijek’s region and surrounding areas of Slavonia from happening over the course of several months, usually resulting in new 399 scrinia slavonica 6 (2006), 342 - 401. Croatian casualties. Nevertheless, these events also backfired, producing a converse effect – the homogenization of Croatian people around the HSS in the Osijek area (which particularly showed in its landslide victory in the May elections in 1935), but also the emergence of a group of members of the Ustasha movement, whose aim was to establish an independent Croatian state outside the bounds of Yugoslavia. At the same time the worker’s movement gained momentum {{as well as the}} activities of the illegal Communist Party of Yugoslavia, notwithstanding occasional raids (such as the one in 1936), arrests and convictions of individuals or groups of communists. That is why, given the altered political scene after 1935, not only in this region but also nation-wide and internationally, the authorities had to let up. Towards the end of 1935 this led to an official ban of chetnik associations’ public activities in many surrounding Slavonian areas, and later in Savska banovina. However, this ban did not apply to the chetnik organisations in Osijek and in the Osijek district. Thus, not only did they not stop their activities until the beginning of the Second World War in 1941, but they even formed new such organizations. The same was the case in the surrounding districts (Vukovar, Vinkovci, Valpovo), and in those across the Drava and Danube (Darda and Sombor) in the Dunavska banovina. There is no doubt that this could not have happened had it not been for the wholehearted support of Grand Serbian political authorities in Belgrade and the network of connections to the key figures of authority in these areas. However, there came to one key moment in the area of Osijek – namely, the 1938 election victory of HSS and SDS, who gradually came to take over the government, a process which was further reinforced by the establishment of the autonomous Banovina of Croatia (August 1939) within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which encompassed Osijek and the whole of Slavonia together with a part of western Srijem. The establishment of the Banovina of Croatia was opposed by all Serbian parties, except the SDS, by the nationalist and greatserbian organizations and associations, the military and the Serbian Orthodox Church, who deemed the Banovina of Hrvatska a thread to Serbs and to the future of the country. To prevent the constitution and operation of the Banovina of Croatia, they launched the movement «Serbs, unite!» aiming to join the other 6 banovinas east of Banovina of Croatia, into a single administrative unit under the name «Serbian lands», i. e. « The Great Serbia ». This unit was also to include all those portions of the Banovina of Croatia where there was a Serb majority, as well as hose areas which leaders of the «Serbs, unite!» movement deemed geo-strategically and politically important, i. e. theirs, including the Osijek area. They set about implementing this agenda by supporting field activities of their members and their like-minded followers. This program involved concerted action of all the chetnik organizations from the Osijek area and the surrounding areas of eastern Croatia. This became most evident following the establishment of the «Serbs, unite!» movement in those areas, and transpired from their common requests that portions of the Osijek and Vinkovci districts, as well as the whole of Vukovar, Šid and Ilok district be severed from the Banovina of Croatia and annexed to the Dunavska banovina, and ultimately to the socalled “Great Serbia”. The authorities of Banovina of Croatia banned further public activities of this movement (in the Osijek district as well) and in the municipal elections in the Banovina in May 1940, HSS and SDS overwhelmingly won over the greatserbian political forces in the Osijek region (namely, the Yugoslav Radical Community (JRZ) only won in Tenje, and SDS in Bijelo Brdo and Dalj, with HSS winning elsewhere). This was of immense importance given that the War was approaching at an ever faster pace. Still, public activities of the chetniks in the Osijek area, whose organizations numbered around 1000 people, mostly Serbs, years of power enjoyed by pursuers of the greatserbian expansionist politics, the colonization of around 3000 mostly Serbian volunteers and posting Serbs at important positions within administrative and government bodies, who then implemented the measures of such politics, had led to a significant deterioration of the inter-national relations at the time. The repercussions of their politics had left a permanent mark on the Croatian and other non-Serb people. This interwar period was thus just a preface to the events that ensued after the War. Namely, after the War the sentiments became extremely radical, which, given the wartime conditions, had tragic consequences for the Serbs who suffered under the Ustasha regime, but also for Croatians and other non-Serbs under the impact of pursuers of the Chetnik agenda during the Second World War (1941 - 1945). It is no coincidence that chetnik terrorist groups were again formed after the war in 1946, in Dalj, Tenje and Čepin, but they were banned by the communist authorities, and their members were mostly sanctioned. Still, the chetnik ideology persisted, and 45 years later reared its ugly head again, in an even fiercer shape and form and with even more tragic consequences around the city of Osijek...|$|R
