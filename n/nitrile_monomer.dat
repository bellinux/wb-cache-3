30|$|Therefore {{chemical}} modification, through graft co-polymerization, of <b>nitrile</b> <b>monomer</b> on to jute fibres, {{has been}} receiving considerable interest in recent years. The grafting was determined {{on the basis}} of the increased weight of the fibre treated. In the present work, attempts have been made to modify the jute fibre with acrylonitrile (AN) and methacrylonitrile (MAN) monomers, initiated under a potassium persulphate (K 2 S 2 O 8) and ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4) redox system. The study attempted to determine the optimum grafting conditions for such modification. Some physico-chemical characteristics of the grafted fibre were investigated.|$|E
30|$|Three N-containing monomers, 6, 16 and 17, {{as well as}} <b>nitrile</b> <b>monomer</b> 5, did not {{generate}} any polymer using G 2 or {{the more}} reactive G 3. In all cases, the reaction mixture turned a brown color within a few minutes, suggesting deactivation of the Ru catalyst. The failure of 5 or 6 was not surprising, as compounds containing nitrile groups or primary amines are known to deactivate the Ru catalysts [33, 36, 37, 61, 62]. However, the monomers bearing acetamide (16) and urea (17) functional groups did not polymerize either. Some studies suggested that amides and ureas were compatible with the Ru catalysts in both polymerizations [49, 50, 51] and small molecule reactions [63]. The reason for the inactivity in our trials is unknown.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} work, we have {{presented}} the graft copolymerization of nitrile monomers on to bleached jute fibre {{was carried out}} {{in the presence of a}} redox system, in an aqueous medium. The effect of the graft yield of the nitrile monomers on the jute fibre depends on the parameter variables and on the jute fibre as well. The chemical attachment between the <b>nitrile</b> <b>monomer</b> and hydroxyl group of cotton fibres was evaluated by FTIR. The grafted fibre showed improved physicochemical properties like tensile strength, moisture absorption and thermal stability. Thus a new type of jute fibre was obtained through graft polymerization. Such a process can make jute more suitable, as an input, in the manufacture of garments, home textiles etc.|$|E

30|$|Various {{chemical}} treatments {{have been}} used to improve the physico-chemical performance of natural fibres in the past (Ouajai et al. 2007; Mohanty et al. 2000; Dong et al. 2015). Although a lot of work has been reported on graft co-polymerization of vinyl monomers onto cellulosic and other textile fibre (Mondal 2013; Bakr et al. 2015), much less has been reported on grafting of <b>nitrile</b> <b>monomers</b> onto jute fibre. Yet jute is an important lignocellulose fibre.|$|R

30|$|Modification of {{bleached}} jute fibre {{was carried}} out by graft co-polymerization with the vinyl monomers, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile. A K 2 S 2 O 8 /FeSO 4 redox system was used in the presence of air. The graft yield and grafting efficiency increased with the increase of monomer, initiator and reaction time up to certain values, thereafter it decreased. This is due to the increasing rate of homopolymerization, rather than grafting, at the higher monomer concentration. The maximum graft yield with acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, under optimized conditions, was 19.78 and 43.15 %, respectively. The graft yield of methacrylonitrile is greater than that of acrylonitrile. This is due to the –CH 3 group present in methacrylonitrile. The inclusion of <b>nitrile</b> <b>monomer</b> onto the treated fibre was identified by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The surface morphology and thermal behavior of the modified fibre was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Thermogravimetric Analysis. Modification of jute fibre improved the thermal stability, breaking strength as well as dyeability of the fiber.|$|E
40|$|Side chain {{liquid crystal}} polypyrroles have been {{synthesised}} and investigated {{in order to}} study their liquid crystallinity and its possible effect on their electronic conductivity. The synthesis ofN-substituted dithienylpyrrole was studied using a number of methods. Firstly, there was the synthesis of a side chain which consisted of a mesogenic group and nine units of methylene as a spacer. This synthesis {{was followed by the}} preparation of the N-substituted monomer, its polymerisation and the characterisation of both the low molecular weight compounds and the polymer. The next stage was the hydrolysis of the cyanobiphenyl (the mesogenic group) and esterification with a chiral alcohol. The purpose was to synthesise N-substituted polypyrrole with a chiral liquid crystalline moiety in order to produce new liquid crystalline conductive polymers which could exhibit a chiral smectic Cmesophase. A larger monomer (dithienylpyrrole) was synthesised. The substitution of the monomer was carried out using several methods, and the production of the N-substituted monomer was attempted using the Gabriel Synthesis and alternative Suzuki Coupling methods. The polymers were studied electrochemically, and the conductivity of the chemically polymerised compounds was measured (2. 8 x 10 - 8 S cm- 1 for the nitrile polymer). The effect of heat treatment on a film of the electrochemically polymerised product was studied, and the energy gap before and after the annealing was measured (2. 7 to 2. 6 eV for the nitrile polymer and the acid polyer). The liquid crystalline properties were studied 'using differential scanning calorimetry and polarised hot-stage optical microscopy. The acid intermediate (product 3) showed two liquid crystal mesophases. Nematic and smectic C mesophases were observed to be stable over a wide range of temperature (144. 8 to 241. 4 [degrees]C). The nitrile polymer showed a highly organised phase which was probably a smectic B or crystal. B phase. The nitrile polymer and the acid polymer were studied electrochemically showing that doping and dedoping potentials for the acid polymer were higher than those of the nitrile polymer, and the energy gap of the acid polymer was lower. The energy gap of the nitrile polymer was higher than that of polymer with shorter spacer (6 units of methylene), and that was consistent with the results obtained from the conductivity measurement, as the longer spacer polymer is less conductive (higher energy gap and lower conductivity). Annealing the polymers decreases the energy gap due to self-organisation of the liquid crystal phase. : Modelling the monomer using Quantum Cache indicated molecular dimensions (the length of the <b>nitrile</b> <b>monomer</b> with an LC group attached is 27. 8 AO) consistent with the repeat distances indicated by X-ray diffractometry (27. 6 AO for the nitrile polymer). The result was proposed that there was inter-layer of the smectic LC phase indicated by hot¬stage polarised optical microscopy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The work {{detailed}} {{in this thesis}} concerns organic thin films synthesised either using R. F. inductively coupled plasmas excited in unsaturated monomers containing either fluorine or a nitrile group, or else irradiating the said monomers in vacuo using ultraviolet light. The effect of the following parameters on the composition {{and structure of the}} resultant films was determined using ESCA/XPS : a) power input to the R. F. plasma system, b) photon flux during UV irradiation, c) monomer type (including structural isomerism), and d) monomer flow rate. Relative system deposition rates were rationalised in terms of Yasuda's parameter, W/FM, which was found to hold true qualitatively, if not quantitatively. Introduction of halogen vapour to the plasma system in the presence of <b>nitrile</b> <b>monomers</b> physically decreased the glow volume. Analysis by ESCA and UV absorption spectroscopy revealed the presence of ionic halogen species in the resultant films. An overall decrease in deposition rate of the system was also observed. A similar result for the latter was seen for UV irradiation in the presence of iodine. The results were rationalised by assigning a free radical mechanism for both plasma and photochemical film deposition which is inhibited by halogens. Films formed by irradiation at > 200 nm were found to have differing chemical compositions compared to those obtained in the vacuum ultraviolet (< 200 nm). This result was attributed to the differing photochemistries occurring in the two wavelength regions. Reference to the gas-phase photochemical literature enabled identification of the likely intermediates and term states involved, including 1, 1 and 1, 2 molecular elimination from ethylenic monomers in the vacuum UV to give the respective ethynes, together with secondary photolysis products. Consequently a mechanism for surface photopolymerisation was outlined which was compared with that proposed for plasma polymerisation, both of which involve vibrationally excited ground states for the monomers studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} chain extension and crosslinking of perfluoroalkylethers which yields a thermally stable perfluoroalkylether oxadiazole elastomer crosslinked by trifunctional perfluoroalkylether- 1, 3, 5 -triazine is reported. In the preparation, hydroxylamine crystals prepared from hydroxylamine hydrochloride to which sodium butoxide {{had been added}} is mixed with perfluoroalkylether dinitrile to obtain the <b>monomer,</b> as the <b>nitrile</b> is converted to amidoxime. Monomers are heated at 140 to 200 C to form poly(perfluoroalkylether oxadiazole) with a 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole structure by a step-growth polymerization reaction. Simultaneous chain extension and crosslinking are observed to occur when the purified monomer is heated directly and when the remaining <b>nitrile</b> in the <b>monomer</b> is allowed to react with excess ammonia to form the corresponding amidine, which is then heated. Weight loss studies show the thermal stability of the perfluoroalkylether elastomer to be generally better than fluorosilicone or polyester elastomers, especially in air, indicating its potential usefulness for high-performance elastomeric applications...|$|R
40|$|Continuous wave (CW) and pulsed {{acetonitrile}} and acrylonitrile plasmas {{have been}} used to deposit thin nitrogen-containing films. Changes in film composition with applied CW power and pulse duty cycle have been monitored using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and deposition rates have been measured for both systems. A detailed description of FTIR peak assignments is presented and shows that the composition of films deposited from acetonitrile are insensitive to CW input power and duty cycle. In contrast, acrylonitrile films exhibit a strong compositional dependence on CW input power and duty cycle with the growth of highly conjugated imine and <b>nitrile</b> species. These <b>monomer</b> dependent compositional changes are discussed in terms of their structure, pulse off time durations, and equivalent pulsed and CW applied rf powers. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and deposition rate data afford further insight into film formation processes with the two monomers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A multi-stage scheme was developed for the separation of vinyl chloride (VC) oligomers. A low molecular weight fraction was isolated from poly(vinyl chloride) by Soxhlet extraction. The presence of VC oligomers up to decamer was demonstrated by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Removal of polar impurities was accomplished by preparative adsorption liquid chromatography of the low molecular weight fraction. Recycle HPSEC with repeated injections permitted the accumulation of fractions of VC pentamer oligomers which were resolved into their isomers by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) offline. These results were duplicated utilising a coupled column system comprising of recycle HPSEC connected on-line to HPLC. This coupled technique was then applied to the hexamer and heptamer oligomers which were resolved into their constituent isomers. Multi-stage schemes were then developed for the extraction, characterisation and quantification of low molecular weight compounds from <b>nitrile</b> (NBR), ethylene-propylene-diene <b>monomer</b> (EPDM) and silicone elastomers. Low molecular weight fractions were isolated from these elastomers by Soxhlet extraction. HPLC and SEC analysis was performed on these extracts followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Extracts from these elastomers were shown to contain various phthalates, diamines, phenols, hydrocarbons and thiazoles. In addition, analysis of the low molecular weight extract from the silicone elastomer disclosed {{the presence of a}} number of cyclic and linear silicone oligomers...|$|R
