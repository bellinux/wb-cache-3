40|$|Historical {{and recent}} {{earthquakes}} often remind the <b>need</b> for <b>taking</b> <b>precautions</b> against earthquake-induced liquefaction damage that structures on shallow foundations can suffer. Air injection technique {{has the potential}} to improve the soil supporting new and existing structures. There is, however, little research on its application and performance beneath existing shallow foundations. The aim of this research was to provide a comprehensive view of the air injection technique by conducting well-controlled dynamic centrifuge and 1 -g shaking table tests, along with static soil column experiments in the laboratory. Detailed analysis of the test results highlighted that air injection was an effective way of minimising the soil-softening and loss of shear stiffness associated with earthquake-induced liquefaction. A decreasing trend in the magnitude of excess pore pressures and foundation settlements was observed with decreasing degree of saturation. Air injection technique was also found to perform better under increased confining stresses. Injecting air in a controlled manner (e. g. applying low air injection rate and pressure) was shown to be crucial for the safety of foundations. A wider and more uniformly desaturated zone was achieved with increasing air injection pressure, but which concurrently increased the settlements that shallow foundations experienced. It was also found that most of the air could remain entrapped in partially saturated soil under different simulated field conditions {{for a long period of}} time, which indicated the long-term reliability of the mitigation accomplished. Particle image velocimetry was utilised to identify deformation mechanisms that develop underneath and in the ground surrounding shallow foundations. It was shown that foundations resting on saturated soil settled excessively. Foundation settlements were predominantly driven by deviatoric strains, and a bearing capacity failure mechanism did form. When air was injected into saturated soil, air reduced the build-up of excess pore pressures as it contracted during dynamic loading but increased soil compressibility. Deviatoric strain-induced deformations significantly reduced, which resulted in much smaller settlements. The observed settlements were principally caused by volumetric strains that arose from increased soil compressibility. Given the depth of liquefaction reduced significantly for air-injected partially saturated soil, a complete bearing capacity failure mechanism could not occur. The lower the degree of saturation, the shallower and more localised the deformations were observed. Ministry of National Education (M. E. B.) of Turke...|$|R

Although there is considerable controversy over how to articulate or define a precautionary 2 ̆ 2 principle 2 ̆ 2 of law, {{the goal is to}} ensure that the mere lack of scientific knowledge about risks cannot justify a failure to take appropriate precautions. Where we have sufficient evidence of risk, we often take precautions, despite a lack of certainty about those risks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Landslide is a high-danger {{geological}} disaster, {{which often}} causes casualties and equipments destroyed. How {{to find out}} the existence of landslide and the feature of its deformation field is very important for <b>taking</b> <b>precautions</b> against the disaster. Generally, landslide appears tiny deformation in the early stage, large deformation in the later stage, and accompanying fracture and swelling in the surface of the ground. Thus in different stage, the landslide monitoring method would be different due to the different deformation feature. In this paper, a landslide located on West Open-pit Mine in Liaoning province of China is as an example to monitor the deformation field. We used the D-InNSAR in the early stage to monitor the tiny deformation, and used the high spatial resolution imagery to monitor the large deformation in later stage. Meanwhile, we used the thermal imaging technology to detect the temperature field to identify the geological structure of the landslide. The detection result indicated that in different stage of landslide development the monitoring methods of deformation field would be different, and the combined detection of multi-source remote sensing technology would be effective to monitor the landslide development for <b>taking</b> <b>precautions</b> against the disaster...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{pace and}} impact of technological change in the world underline the growing <b>need</b> for <b>taking</b> due <b>precautions.</b> In this essay the author reviews {{a number of cases}} over the past 2 centuries where new technologies have been introduced too rapidly with too little attention to possible consequences and avoidable damage to health or the environment has been caused. The author goes on to discuss the precautionary approach to new technology, and urges more widespread use of it. He underlines the importance of 4 key points: (1) technology must not be demonised as the enemy - wise use of technology and technological solutions are themselves part of a precautionary approach; (2) a concern for social and environmental justice must be part of a broad precautionary approach - innovations which may potentially benefit one group while putting other groups at risk are very problematic; (3) we must safeguard the public realm and its ability to weigh up proposed innovations and new processes dispassionately - the privatisation of regulation and management of safeguards is very dangerous; (4) innovation and the management of precautionary safeguards are too important to be left to experts or governments alone - there must be sufficient public understanding and support for the introduction of new technologies with all the risks they may involve if public confidence is not to be eroded and greater restrictions imposed. The precautionary approach does not claim to be the answer to all issues concerning the wise use of new technologies. But it does point the way to how we can use public policy frameworks and processes to guide and constrain technological developments in the most appropriate way, and avoid some of the worst possible outcomes. At a time of accelerating technological change and overwhelming human dominance of the natural environment it is vital that we make wise use of this approach...|$|R
