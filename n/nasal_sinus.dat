40|$|INTRODUCTION Malignancies (M) of the Nose (N) and Para <b>nasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> (PNS) are {{uncommon}} {{to find in}} ENT practice. They pose {{a challenge to the}} surgeon in terms of early diagnosis and management that includes multiple treatment modalities. Such malignancies are presented from our institute out of other diseases of the Para <b>nasal</b> <b>sinuses,</b> their clinical, radiological and Histo-pathological features with a special emphasis on their management. All the patients were followed up for recurrence. AIM To make a clinical study of malignant neoplasms of nose and Para <b>nasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> with regard to their, clinical presentation, radiological assessment, Histopathological studies and treatment modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients attending the ENT outpatient department of a Tertiary Level Teaching Hospital of Government Ear, Nose & Throat Hospital, Koti/Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad, Telangana State from January 2014 to June 2015 with various diseases of nose and Para <b>Nasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> were screened and malignant tumors were identified, investigated and treated appropriately. Among these few cases are included in the present study. The patients are kept on a follow-up period of 6 to 9 months. INCLUSION CRITERIA All patients with Histopathological confirmation of malignant neoplasms of nose and Para <b>nasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> irrespective of sex were considered for study. All patients who were immunologically competent only were included in the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Pediatric malignancies are excluded. All immune-compromised patients are excluded from the study. CONCLUSION The Sino-nasal malignancies are not uncommon in ENT practice. Elderly males are commonly affected. Exact aetiology is obscure There is no evidence that chronic sinusitis predisposes to cancer. The incidence of chronic sinusitis in patients with Sino-nasal malignancies is the same as that in the general population. The challenge lies in diagnosing the malignancy as early as possible followed by selecting an appropriate treatment option and adequate follow up. ...|$|R

5000|$|Sheep are the {{principal}} hosts. The presence of the fly with its distinctive buzzing can alert mature animals who may attempt to run away, walk with their noses near the ground or have been recorded forming a circle with their noses {{in the middle and}} near the ground. If the fly successfully places eggs in the nostril of sheep the animal may feel the larvae after a few days and attempt to remove them by tapping their muzzles on the ground. They will also snort and stamp their front feet in annoyance. Once the larvae have infested the nasal passage and sinuses, usually up to 15 larvae but can be up to 80, they cause irritation to the mucosa, which causes mucous discharge, swelling of the internal membranes of the nose, possibly impairment of breathing but largely discomfort and distraction to the sheep who may reduce or stop grazing and subsequently lose weight and condition.

5000|$|Two known monsters of {{the deep}} who could easily have {{swallowed}} Jonah: Balaenoptera musculus or sulphur-bottom whale, and the Rhinodon typicus or whale shark. Neither of these monsters {{of the deep}} have any teeth. They feed in an interesting way by opening their enormous mouths, submerging their lower jaw, and rushing through the water at terrific speed. After straining out the water, they swallow whatever is left. A sulphur-bottom whale, one hundred feet long, was captured off Cape Cod in 1933. His mouth was ten or twelve feet wide - so big he could easily have swallowed a horse. These whales have four to six compartments in their stomachs, in anyone of which a small colony of men could find free lodging.

50|$|Sheep bot flies {{commence}} life as eggs {{within the}} female which are fertilised and hatch to larvae of 1 mm {{within the body}} of the female. The female then deposits a few larvae, while on the wing, within a tiny mucous drop, directly into a nostril of the host animal. The larvae then make their way up the nasal passage in the mucosa and enter a <b>nasal</b> <b>sinus.</b> During this time it will develop, grow and moult into a second larval stage or instar. It then continues to develop up to 20mm (apprx. 4/5 inch) in length with a dark stripe across each segment. When the larva is fully developed it moves down the nasal passage and drops to the ground where it buries itself and pupates. The length of time the larva takes to mature depends on the ambient temperature. This may be 25-35 days in warm weather but up to 10 months in colder climates. The pupa takes from 3-9 weeks to mature, again dependent on climatic conditions, after which the adult burrows up to the surface, takes to the wing and commences mating. The adults do not feed during their 2-4 weeks of adult life though they may take water.|$|E
40|$|An {{adenovirus}} 5 vector encoding for mouse interferon alpha, subtype 5 (mDEF 201) {{was evaluated}} for efficacy against lethal cowpox (Brighton strain) and vaccinia (WR strain) virus respiratory and systemic infections in mice. Two routes of mDEF 201 administration were used, <b>nasal</b> <b>sinus</b> (5 -µl) and pulmonary (50 -µl), to compare differences in efficacy, since the preferred treatment of humans {{would be in}} a relatively small volume delivered intranasally. Lower respiratory infections (LRI), upper respiratory infections (URI), and systemic infections were induced by 50 -µl intranasal, 10 -µl intranasal, and 100 -µl intraperitoneal virus challenges, respectively. mDEF 201 treatments were given prophylactically either 24 h (short term) or 56 d (long-term) prior to virus challenge. Single <b>nasal</b> <b>sinus</b> treatments of 10 (6) and 10 (7) PFU/mouse of mDEF 201 protected all mice from vaccinia-induced LRI mortality (comparable to published studies with pulmonary delivered mDEF 201). Systemic vaccinia infections responded significantly better to <b>nasal</b> <b>sinus</b> delivered mDEF 201 than to pulmonary treatments. Cowpox LRI infections responded to 10 (7) mDEF 201 treatments, but a 10 (6) dose was only weakly protective.

Dose-responsive prophylaxis with mDEF 201, given one time only 56 d prior to initiating a vaccinia virus LRI infection, was 100 % protective from 10 (5) to 10 (7) PFU/mouse. Improvements in lung hemorrhage score and lung weight were evident, as were decreases in liver, lung, and spleen virus titers.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{case-control study}} of {{squamous}} cell cancer of the maxillary sinus was performed in Hokkaido with 106 cases and 212 controls matched for sex, age (within five years), and residence (same health centre region). Univariate analyses showed that a history of chronic sinusitis (relative risk, RR = 3 - 2), nasal polyps (RR = 5 - 0), an occupational history of being a carpenter, joiner, furniture worker, or other woodworker (RR = 2 9), and current or past smoking habits (RR = 3 - 0) were statistically significant risk factors for men. No single item was a significant risk factor for women. Cancer of the <b>nasal</b> <b>sinus</b> (International Classification of Diseases, ICD 160) is relatively uncommon but a history of chronic sinusitis, smoking, and an occupational history of work such as nickel refining, chrome manufacturing, mustard gas manufacturing, and furniture and other woodworking are suspected of being risk factors {{for the development of}} this tumour.

However, for unclear reasons, vaccines introduced into the <b>nasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> often have lower efficacy than vaccines administered by the more frequently used parenteral routes. We examined i. n. vaccination in a mouse immune-re-sponse model with a commonly usedHaemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (Hibv) composed of the polyribosylribitol phos-phate (PRP) capsule antigen conjugated to tetanus toxoid. Intranasal vaccination with Hibv using a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) agonist as an adjuvant significantly increased the levels of IgA specific for the PRP capsule antigen in blood serum, saliva, and mucosal secretion specimens. In contrast, control mice vaccinated transdermally (t. d.) with Hibv did not produce significant levels of PRP-specific IgA in the blood serum and saliva, and anti-PRP IgG was increased only in serum. The i. n. and t. d. vaccina-tions resulted in equivalent bactericidal antibody responses in blood serum, suggesting that vaccine-derived IgG is protective against infection. Elevated levels of IgG specific for the tetanus toxoid carrier protein were measured in <b>nasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> and vaginal secretions in mice vaccinated by either the t. d. or i. n. route.
