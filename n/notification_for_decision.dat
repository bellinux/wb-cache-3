40|$|The {{management}} of supply chains {{is a very}} comprehensive task. Predictability and response to incidents in process executions are challenging. With Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM), researchers propose an approach for overcoming these problems through proactive monitoring and notification of crucial process activities across the supply chain. The identification and definition of such crucial activities and information needs are necessary to handle possible abnormalities although they are challenging task which have not been solved in SCEM research so far. Hence, we propose a modeling approach which allows the conceptual specification of an adequate information exchange along the supply chain. With our approach {{we focus on the}} specification of relevant logistical objects, the definition of possible events, and the design of <b>notifications</b> <b>for</b> <b>decision</b> makers in the supply chain...|$|R
