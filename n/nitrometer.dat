40|$|Erythrocyte and {{leukocyte}} suspensions {{were prepared}} from 28 {{patients with chronic}} cerebrovascular disease and 30 age- and concomitant disease-matched control subjects. Cell filterability was studied with the new St. George's <b>nitrometer,</b> which can discriminate between initial nitration rate as an erythrocyte parameter and filter clogging as a leukocyte parameter. Compared with control subjects, a significant increase of filter clogging {{was found in the}} patients, suggesting decreased deformability or increased adhesiveness of leukocytes or both in chronic cerebrovascular disease. (Stroke 1988; 19 : 631 - 633) It is generally accepted that hemorheologic alter-ations are present in about 50 % of patients withcerebrovascular disease (CVD). 1 " 3 In addition to vascular components, increased blood viscosity {{plays an important role in}} the impairment of cerebral blood flow in these patients. 4 " * Several factors, such as changes of the qualitative and quantitative behavior of erythrocytes and platelets as well as changes in plasma composition,'- 2 have been identified as being respon-sible for the deterioration of blood fluidity.
