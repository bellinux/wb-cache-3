5|$|Silencing systemin did {{not affect}} the ability of black <b>nightshade</b> to resist {{herbivory}} and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black <b>nightshade</b> in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory. By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors. The down-regulation of systemin was associated with increased root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends. Overexpressing AtPEP1 also increased root and shoot biomass in A. thaliana.|$|E

In addition, <b>Nightshade</b> features an enhanced {{version of the}} Ultimate Play the Game's Filmation game engine, branded Filmation II. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised its gameplay traits, graphics and colours, however one critic was divided over its perceived similarities to its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet with {{fruit and vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry.

5|$|<b>Nightshade</b> is {{an action}} video game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game. It was first released for the ZX Spectrum in 1985, and was then ported to the Amstrad CPC and BBC Micro later that year. It was also ported to the MSX exclusively in Japan in 1986. In the game, the player assumes {{the role of a}} knight who sets out to destroy four demons in a plague-infested village.|$|E

Despite the victory, her husband and country are destroyed due to her violation of Monarch's rule against attempting to escape.|$|R
5|$|The case of Claudius' {{poisoning}} is more complex. Claudius {{was known}} to have been very fond of eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of <b>nightshade)</b> being administered later during his illness.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format. The player assumes {{the role of a}} knight who enters the plague-infested village of <b>Nightshade</b> to vanquish four demons who reside within. Additionally, all residents from the village have been transformed into vampires and other supernatural creatures. Contact with these monsters infects the knight, with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green, which will lead to the character's death. The knight may be hit up to three times by an enemy, however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with the isometric projection game engine known as Filmation II, {{which was used}} previously in Ultimate's 1985 ZX Spectrum game <b>Nightshade.</b> The Filmation engine {{was created by the}} Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an image masking technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.|$|E

Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, {{roughness}} of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume.

5|$|Gunfright was {{initially}} released for the ZX Spectrum in 1985 {{and was the}} last game to be developed under the direct involvement of the Stamper brothers. Realising that the graphical limits of platforms such as the ZX Spectrum had been pushed, future projects such as Blackwyche and Dragon Skulle were handed over to designer brothers Dave and Bob Thomas, who were often uncredited for their work. Gunfright, along with Knight Lore, Alien 8 and <b>Nightshade,</b> were re-released for the MSX in 1986, with Gunfright and Sabre Wulf being ported to the Amstrad CPC later that year. Gunfright was later included in an August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Rare titles, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black <b>nightshade.</b> In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E

5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly <b>nightshade</b> (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as <b>nightshade,</b> tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
