25|$|Furfural is an {{important}} renewable, non-petroleum based, chemical feedstock. Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA) which is a useful chemical intermediate in for example the manufacture of furan resin prepolymers exploited in thermoset polymer matrix composites, cements, adhesives, casting resins and coatings. Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) which {{is used as a}} <b>nonhazardous</b> solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure. Furfural is used to make other furan chemicals, such as furoic acid, via oxidation, and furan itself via palladium catalyzed vapor phase decarbonylation. Furfural is also {{an important}} chemical solvent.|$|E
2500|$|SWANCC, a {{consortium}} of Chicago-area cities and villages, sought to develop [...] landfill for baled <b>nonhazardous</b> solid waste on a [...] parcel in Illinois. The parcel had been used for sand and gravel mining until about 1960.

50|$|The {{provision}} prohibiting {{distribution of}} nonprescription contraceptives to persons sixteen years or over except through licensed pharmacists clearly burdens {{the right of}} such individuals to use nonprescription contraceptives if they so desire. Moreover, the provision serves no convincing state interests. It cannot be justified by an interest in protecting health insofar {{as it applies to}} <b>nonhazardous</b> contraceptives or in protecting potential life. Nor can it be justified by a concern that young people not sell contraceptives. It cannot be categorized to serve as a quality control device or as enabling enforcement of the other provisions of the Education Law.|$|E
50|$|Toxicity {{or other}} hazards do not imply an {{environmental}} hazard, because elimination by sunlight (photolysis), water (hydrolysis) or organisms (biological elimination) neutralizes many reactive or poisonous substances. Persistence towards these elimination mechanisms combined with toxicity gives the substance {{the ability to}} do damage in the long term. Also, the lack of immediate human toxicity does not mean the substance is environmentally <b>nonhazardous.</b> For example, tanker truck-sized spills of substances such as milk can cause a lot of damage in the local aquatic ecosystems: the added biological oxygen demand causes rapid eutrophication, leading to anoxic conditions in the water body.|$|E

50|$|Root rot of papaya seedlings, {{caused by}} P. palmivora, in replant fields can be {{controlled}} with the virgin soil technique. Virgin soil (soil in which papaya has never been grown in before) is placed in planting holes about 30 cm in diameter and 10 cm deep with a mound about 4 cm high. Roots of papaya plants are protected by the virgin soil during the susceptible stage, and become resistant to the pathogen when they extend to the infested soil. Trees established with the virgin soil method in the replant fields produce fruit as abundantly as those growing in the first planting fields. The virgin soil method has the advantages of being relatively inexpensive, very effective and <b>nonhazardous.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Site 8 was a {{landfill}} is located approximately 300 feet north of Building CAD 14 and {{is estimated to}} be less than ¼ acre in size. The disposal area reportedly consisted of a series of trenches with typical surface areas of 2,000 feet and depths of 10 feet. The site was used at various times since the early 1940s. The site was most active prior to the opening of the Landfill near the Incinerator (Site 1). It was reported that the site was used for waste disposal as recently as 1980. Specific information documenting disposal practices is not available. Reportedly, only <b>nonhazardous</b> materials such as spoiled meat, spoiled candy, and clothing have been disposed at the site.|$|E
50|$|Fires occur naturally, ignited by {{lightning}} strikes or by volcanic products. Combustion (fire) {{was the first}} controlled chemical reaction discovered by humans, {{in the form of}} campfires and bonfires, and continues to be the main method to produce energy for humanity. Usually, the fuel is carbon, hydrocarbons or more complicated mixtures such as wood that contains partially oxidized hydrocarbons. The thermal energy produced from combustion of either fossil fuels such as coal or oil, or from renewable fuels such as firewood, is harvested for diverse uses such as cooking, production of electricity or industrial or domestic heating. Combustion is also currently the only reaction used to power rockets. Combustion is also used to destroy (incinerate) waste, both <b>nonhazardous</b> and hazardous.|$|E
50|$|Solid waste {{policy in}} the United States is aimed at {{developing}} and implementing proper mechanisms to effectively manage solid waste. For solid waste policy to be effective, inputs should come from stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, community based-organizations, non governmental organizations, government agencies, universities, and other research organizations. These inputs {{form the basis of}} policy frameworks that influence solid waste management decisions. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates household, industrial, manufacturing and commercial solid and hazardous wastes under the 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Effective solid waste management is a cooperative effort involving federal, state, regional, and local entities. Thus the RCRA’s Solid Waste program section D encourages the environmental departments of each state to develop comprehensive plans to manage <b>nonhazardous</b> industrial and municipal solid waste.|$|E
