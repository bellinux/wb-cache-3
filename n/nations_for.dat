5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other <b>nations</b> <b>for</b> aid.

5|$|On June26, 2005, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave well-inland over Africa. The feature was tracked via radiosonde observations from various <b>nations</b> <b>for</b> {{two days before}} being analyzed as a surface feature on June28 over western Senegal. Accompanied by scattered convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—the westward moving system featured some cyclonic flow; it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early on June29. Conflicting observations from Dakar, Senegal, made tracking the wave difficult, with surface observations revealing a clear shift in wind direction and upper-level soundings showing no change. Regardless of the exact position of the system, accompanying convection soon diminished and the system became ill-defined. By June30, the system grew significantly and multiple low-level circulations developed within the broader cyclonic envelope. Weather models at the time depicted a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis in the subsequent days. Gradual development ensued over the following days, though the broad circulation initially remained largely devoid of convection due to dry air associated with the Saharan Air Layer.|$|E
