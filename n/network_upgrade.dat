40|$|Abstract. In {{contrast}} with the traditional distribution expansion planning approach, significant giants can be realized in terms of outage loss, supply quality, and load carrying capacity from the distribution expansion with a suitable size and siting of distributed generation (DG). However, {{in order to achieve}} these planning goals, it often requires <b>network</b> <b>upgrades</b> to accommodate the anticipated power flows in the distribution system with DG. To improve utilization and expansion of distribution system, this paper proposes a methodology to derive the optimal strategy of generation expansion and <b>network</b> <b>upgrades</b> including line capacity upgrade, line switches, and network reconfiguration for multiobjective distribution expansion planning by minimizing network investment cost, feeder losses, customer interruption cost, and voltage drop. A multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is employed to quantify the effects of DG and <b>network</b> <b>upgrades</b> placements on distribution network under load increases and during distribution outages. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an IEEE feeder test system is selected for computer simulation to explore the benefits of DG placement for distribution system utilization and expansion...|$|R

50|$|The country’s three mobile {{operators}} - Cable and Wireless (once {{marketed as}} LIME - Landline, Internet, Mobile and Entertainment now named FLOW), Digicel, {{and at one}} point Oceanic Digital (operating as MiPhone and now known as Claro since late 2008) until the carrier was acquired and the relevant spectrum sold to Digicel - have spent millions in <b>network</b> <b>upgrade</b> and expansion. Both Digicel and Oceanic Digital were granted licences in 2001 to operate mobile services in the newly liberalised telecom market that had once been the sole domain of the incumbent Cable and Wireless monopoly. Digicel opted for the more widely used GSM wireless system, while Oceanic opted for the CDMA standard. Cable and Wireless, which had begun with TDMA standard, subsequently upgraded to GSM, and currently utilises both standards on its network.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} wind {{generation}} in distribution networks {{is leading to}} the development of Active Network Management (ANM) strategies. ANM systems aim to increase the capacity of renewable and distributed generation (DG) that can connect to the network. In addition to DG, ANM schemes can also include storage devices and Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies. Currently ANM schemes are mainly part of network research and development programmes, funded through network innovation schemes. In future, ANM schemes will need to cover the costs of establishing such a scheme through payments from the network owners and the users of the network. This paper discusses the current charging arrangements which account for <b>network</b> <b>upgrades</b> and the access arrangements for wind farms connecting to networks which are close to capacity. The Orkney ANM scheme is used as a case study, where the costs of the implemented ANM scheme are compared to conventional <b>network</b> <b>upgrades.</b> In order to run ANM as a ‘business as usual’ case, there must be a way in which to recover the costs incurred in implementing and operating an ANM scheme on the network. These costs could be recovered through Use of System (UoS) charging, and there is an opportunity for domestic customers participating in an ANM scheme (through Demand Side Management, for example) to further reduce electricity bills by providing ancillary services to the network. ANM may increase the cost of electricity for domestic customers, however this increase can be considered substantially less than the cost incurred for significant <b>network</b> <b>upgrades...</b>|$|R

50|$|ICQ 6, {{released}} on April 17, 2007, {{was the first}} major update since ICQ 4. The user interface has been redesigned using Boxely, the same rendering engine used in AIM Triton. This change adds new features such as the ability to send IMs directly from the clients contact list. ICQ has recently started forcing users of v5.1 to upgrade to version 6 (and XP). Those who do not upgrade will find their older version of ICQ does not start up. Although the upgrade to version 6 should be seen as a positive thing, some users may find that useful features such as sending multiple files at one time is no longer supported in the new version. At the beginning of July 2008, a <b>network</b> <b>upgrade</b> forced users to stop using ICQ 5.1 - applications that identified themselves as ICQ 5, such as Pidgin, were forced to identify themselves as ICQ 6. There seems to be no alternative for users other than using a different IM program or patching ICQ 5.1 with a special application.|$|E
