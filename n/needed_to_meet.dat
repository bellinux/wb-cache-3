5|$|Scientists are {{investigating}} ways {{to harness the}} wind energy within the jet stream. According to one estimate, of the potential wind energy in the jet stream, only 1 percent would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the world's current energy needs. The required technology would reportedly take 10–20 years to develop.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} NFF awarded an annual license to clubs which {{permitted}} {{them to play}} in the top two divisions. This included a series of criteria that the home venue <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet.</b> As Briskeby was severely substandard to the criteria, Ham-Kam was required to apply for annual exemptions. These were only awarded to clubs who were actively working on upgrading or building new venues. If an exception was not granted, the club would either be relegated to the Second Division (the third tier), or would have to play their home games at an approved stadium in another town.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously {{tested in a}} laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln {{called for}} a total of 75,000 volunteers to join the Union army. On the same day, Governor Morton telegraphed the {{president}} offering 10,000 Indiana volunteers. The state's initial quota was set at six regiments (a total of 4,683 men) for three months of service. Orders were issued on April 16 to form the state's first regiments and to gather at Indianapolis. On the first day, five hundred men were encamped in the city; within a week more than 12,000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up to fight for the Union, nearly three times as many <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the state's initial quota.|$|E
5|$|Seymour Cray {{began the}} design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines did not always meet this goal, this was a useful technique in defining the project and clarifying what sort of process improvements would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> it. For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln {{responded to}} the {{surrender}} of the federal fort after the Battle of Fort Sumter by calling for 75,000 volunteers to join the Union army and restore order. Governor Morton telegraphed Lincoln offering 10,000 Hoosier men to defend the country, but the state's initial quota was set at six regiments (a total of 4,683 men) for three months of service. Orders were issued on April 16 to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis a gathering point for volunteers to enlist. On the first day, 500 men were encamped in the city. Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits had signed up {{to fight for the}} Union, nearly three times as many <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the state's initial quota.|$|E

25|$|To {{the north}} of Höfen lay a paved main road that led through the Monschau Forest, at whose eastern edge it forked. A second road ran {{parallel}} to the division center and right wing, leaving the Höfen road at the small hamlet of Wahlerscheid, and continued south through two very small villages, the twin towns of Rocherath and Krinkelt. It then intersected a main east-west road at Bullingen. This was the road network the Germans <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their objectives. If the Germans penetrated Höfen, the U.S. soldiers would have to withdraw several miles to the next defensible position.|$|E
25|$|Sea turtles spend {{almost all}} their lives submerged, but must breathe air for the oxygen <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the demands of {{vigorous}} activity. With a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation, sea turtles can quickly replace the air in their lungs. The lungs permit a rapid exchange of oxygen and prevent gases from being trapped during deep dives. Sea turtle blood can deliver oxygen efficiently to body tissues even at the pressures encountered during diving. During routine activity, green and loggerhead turtles dive for about four to five minutes, and surface to breathe for one to three seconds.|$|E

25|$|Within {{a year of}} Operation Morris Dance, the Army {{determined}} that a capability to move at least a company group from ship to shore in a single helicopter lift was <b>needed.</b> <b>To</b> <b>meet</b> this requirement the Navy {{would need to be}} able to launch six helicopters, each carrying 20 soldiers, simultaneously from one or more ships. In the mid-1990s, two Kanimbla-class landing platform amphibious were acquired, but each of these ships can only move a platoon per lift. In June 2007, the Australian Government approved the purchase of two Canberra-class landing helicopter docks, each of which will be able to simultaneously operate six helicopters.|$|E
25|$|In June 1966, she was {{chartered}} by the Department of Shipping and Transport {{to transport}} {{equipment and supplies}} from Australia to South Vietnam for the 1st Australian Task Force. This became an open-ended charter in August as the ship was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the supply needs of the Australian forces in South Vietnam, which were greater than had been anticipated by Army planners. The ship's cargo usually consisted of vehicles (including Centurion tanks), ammunition, civil aid program stores, and supplies for the Australian Services Canteen Organisation. The ANL coastal cargo ship Boonaroo was also chartered to carry similar cargoes to South Vietnam, {{but was unable to}} embark tanks.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Pioneers were {{established}} on 10 March 1916, at Tel-el-Kebir in Egypt, and were subsequently {{assigned to the}} 4th Division. The battalion was formed {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Gallipoli campaign when the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was expanded as part of plans to transfer it from the Middle East to Europe for service in the trenches along the Western Front. This expansion saw several new infantry divisions raised in Egypt and Australia, as well as specialist support units such as machine gun companies, engineer companies, artillery batteries and pioneer battalions, which were <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the conditions prevalent on the Western Front.|$|E
