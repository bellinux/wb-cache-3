40|$|Recent in situ {{measurements}} of surface mass balance and improved calculation techniques {{are used to}} produce an updated assessment of <b>net</b> surface <b>mass</b> balance over Antarctica. A new elevation model of Antarctica derived from ERS- 1 satellite altimetry supplemented with conventional data was used to delineate the ice flow drainage basins across Antarctica. The areas of these basins were calculated using the recent digital descriptions of coastlines and grounding lines. The delineation of drainage basins was achieved using an automatic procedure, which gave similar results to earlier hand-drawn catchment basins. More than 1800 published and unpublished in situ {{measurements of}} <b>net</b> surface <b>mass</b> balance from Antarctica were collated and then interpolated. A <b>net</b> surface <b>mass</b> balance map was derived from passive microwave satellite data, being employed as a forcing field to control the interpolation of the sparse in situ observations. Basinwide integrals of <b>net</b> surface <b>mass</b> balance were calculated using tools available within a geographic information system. It is found that the integrated <b>net</b> surface <b>mass</b> balance over the conterminous grounded ice sheet is 1811 Gton yr− 1 (149 kg m− 2 yr− 1), and over the entire continent (including ice shelves and their embedded ice rises) it is 2288 Gton yr− 1 (166 kg m− 2 yr− 1). These values are around 18 % and 7 % higher than the estimates widely adopted at present. The uncertainty in these values is hard to estimate from the methodology alone, but the progression of estimates from early studies to the present suggests that around ± 5 % uncertainty remains in the overall values. The results serve to confirm the great uncertainty in the overall contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to recent and future global sea level rise even without a substantial collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Delamination of the lower crust and lithospheric mantle has occurred in several orogens during convergence, most notably the Alps and Pyrenees. The factors responsible for initiating the delamination are not clear. Some workers suggest this process to be mechanically similar to tectonic wedging and triangle-zone development, well known at the scale of kilometers in fold and thrust belts. In a search for controlling factors, > 35 convergent orogens explored by deep geophysical techniques were examined. No correlation between crustal composition and a propensity for delamination is evident. Delamination of subducting passive margins is more common than tectonically and/or volcanically active over-riding margins. Estimates of lithospheric density show that the lithospheric mantle of a cool passive margin may contain greater <b>net</b> negatively buoyant <b>mass</b> than a warmer active margin. The top of the lower lithospheric layer with the greatest <b>net</b> negatively buoyant <b>mass</b> is aligned with a weak zone in the lithosphere near the Moho. A greater <b>net</b> negatively buoyant <b>mass</b> indicates a propensity for delamination to initiate in a passive margin versus an active margin during a subsequent collisional event. For delamination to initiate above the Moho, the lower crust must be subducted or depressed to eclogite grade conditions. Transformation of the mafic lower crust to mafic eclogite also generates a lower lithospheric layer containing <b>net</b> negatively buoyant <b>mass</b> aligned with a weak zone in the lithosphere. Scaled physical models with a model continental crust weakly coupled to a lithospheric mantle containing <b>net</b> negatively buoyant <b>mass</b> delaminate during shortening. In contrast, weakly coupled models containing <b>net</b> positively buoyant <b>mass</b> within the model lithospheric mantle exhibit no tendency for delamination or wedging, despite a weak horizon {{at the base of the}} model crust. This contrast in behavior indicates that the mass distribution within the model lithosphere is a primary control on the process of syn-collisional delamination. Syn-collisional delamination is likely to occur in response to an increase in the lateral tectonic stress on a weak horizon already stressed by <b>net</b> negatively buoyant <b>mass</b> in the lower lithosphere. Thus, delamination and tectonic wedging is not a similar mechanical process at all scales...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} of silver metal oxide contacts on a purposed built apparatus to investigate the extent of erosion under opening (break) operations. The investigation focused on opening the contacts under AC loading of up to 30 A rms and opening these contacts at particular points in the current duty cycle (or Point-On-Wave, POW). A number of erosion and deposition mechanisms have been observed to dominate at particular current loading which were also dependent on the point-on-wave opening.

40|$|The correct {{representation}} of convection in {{numerical weather prediction}} (NWP) models is essential for quantitative precipitation forecasts. Due to its small horizontal scale convection usually has to be parameterized, e. g. by mass flux convection schemes. Classical schemes originally developed for use in coarse grid NWP models assume zero <b>net</b> convective <b>mass</b> flux, because the whole circulation of a convective cell is confined to the local grid column and all convective mass fluxes cancel out. However, in contemporary NWP models with grid sizes of a few kilometers this assumption becomes questionable, because here convection is partially resolved on the grid. To overcome this conceptual problem we propose a hybrid mass flux convection scheme (HYMACS) in which only the convective updrafts and downdrafts are parameterized. The generation of the larger scale environmental subsidence, which may cover several grid columns, is transferred to the grid scale equations. This means that the convection scheme now has to generate a <b>net</b> convective <b>mass</b> flux exerting a direct dynamical forcing to the grid scale model via pressure gradient forces. The hybrid convection scheme implemented into the COSMO model of Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) is tested in an idealized simulation of a sea breeze circulation initiating convection in a realistic manner.
