5|$|Although the Congress of Tucumán {{had already}} formalized {{the flag of}} Argentina, the Army of the Andes did not use it, {{choosing}} a banner with two columns, light blue and white, and a coat of arms roughly similar to the Coat of arms of Argentina. The army {{did not use the}} flag of Argentina because it was <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> an Argentine army.|$|E

5|$|The thrushes are a {{group of}} {{passerine}} birds that are mainly but <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> in the Old World. They are plump, soft plumaged, small- to medium-sized insectivores or sometimes omnivores, often feeding on the ground. Ten species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Although Gillis was <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> used on Post covers, the Willie Gillis {{series of}} covers was a {{hallmark}} of Rockwell's wartime work. In Rockwell's prime and {{at the peak of}} its popularity, the Post had a subscribership of 4 million, and many of these subscribers believed Gillis was a real person. Rockwell's wartime art, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter, contributed {{to the success of the}} wartime bond sales efforts.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the results}} of Horner and colleagues, Prieto-Márquez, and McDonald and colleagues, which {{consider}} the North American Protohadros to be the closest relative of Eolambia, contradict this hypothesis. This alternative interpretation suggests that the common ancestor of Eolambia, Protohadros, and more derived hadrosauroids was <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> Asian, but instead distributed across Asia and North America. McDonald and colleagues further suggested that Eolambia and Protohadros represent a localized group of hadrosauroids endemic to North America, much like other groups of styracosternans throughout the Cretaceous. Such contemporary groups included a central Asian group of Shuangmiaosaurus, Zhanghenglong, and Plesiohadros.|$|E

5|$|The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has {{lectures and}} video shows about {{wildlife}} and guided {{tours of the}} park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but <b>not</b> <b>exclusively,</b> to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.|$|E
5|$|The same {{elements}} from {{the myth that}} appear in the Pyramid Texts recur in funerary texts written in later times, such as the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and the Book of the Dead from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE). Most of these writings were made for the general populace, so unlike the Pyramid Texts, they link Osiris with all deceased souls, <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> with royalty.|$|E
5|$|The word Allah {{has been}} used by Arabic people of {{different}} religions since pre-Islamic times. More specifically, it {{has been used}} as a term for God by Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) and Arab Christians. It is also often, albeit <b>not</b> <b>exclusively,</b> used in this way by Bábists, Bahá'ís, Indonesian and Maltese Christians, and Mizrahi Jews. Similar usage by Christians and Sikhs in West Malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies.|$|E

5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a {{pterosaur}} neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth {{embedded in}} it {{confirmed that the}} latter were <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> piscivorous. A 2007 finite element analysis of CT scanned snouts indicated that the biomechanics of Baryonyx were most {{similar to those of}} the gharial and unlike those of the American alligator and more-conventional theropods, supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids. Their secondary palate helped them resist bending and torsion of their tubular snouts. A 2013 beam-theory study compared the biomechanics of CT-scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians, and found the snouts of Baryonyx and Spinosaurus similar in their resistance to bending and torsion. Baryonyx was found to have relatively high resistance in the snout to dorsoventral bending compared with Spinosaurus and the gharial. The authors concluded (in contrast to the 2007 study) that Baryonyx performed differently than the gharial; spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores, and their diet was determined by their individual size.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While {{this is a major}} advancement relative to other religions in India, it is still not a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia. Most likely, {{the majority of}} citizen recruits to auxiliary regiments were the sons of auxiliary veterans who were enfranchised on their fathers' discharge. Many such may have preferred to join their fathers' old regiments, which were a kind of extended family to them, rather than join a much larger, unfamiliar legion. There are also instances of legionaries transferring to the auxilia (to a higher rank). The incidence of citizens in the auxilia would thus have grown steadily over time until, after the grant of citizenship to all peregrini in 212, auxiliary regiments became predominantly, if <b>not</b> <b>exclusively,</b> citizen units.|$|E
5|$|Juniperus communis berries {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm). Unlike the {{separated}} and woody scales of a typical pine cone, those in a juniper berry remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The berries are green when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea). The mature, dark berries are usually but <b>not</b> <b>exclusively</b> used in cuisine, while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green berries.|$|E
