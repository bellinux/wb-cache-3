2500|$|The {{two main}} {{therapeutic}} uses of NLP are: (1) {{as an adjunct}} by therapists practicing in other therapeutic disciplines; (2) as a specific therapy called Neurolinguistic Psychotherapy which is recognized by the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy with accreditation governed at first by the Association for Neuro Linguistic Programming and more recently by its daughter organization the Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy and Counselling Association.

2500|$|The names NLP and <b>Neuro-linguistic</b> <b>Programming</b> are not {{owned by}} any person or organisation, {{they are not}} trademarked {{intellectual}} property {{and there is no}} central regulating authority for NLP instruction and certification.

2500|$|However, in 1981, Faulkner {{discovered}} {{a book about}} <b>neuro-linguistic</b> <b>programming</b> called The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. The book's methodology described ways of affecting immediate and positive life changes by reprogramming speech, movement and thought patterns. That moment was a major turning point for Faulkner, as he understood that [...] "if you {{could get to the}} root of the crucial relationship between language and beliefs, then you could change everything." [...] Upon the realization that Bandler and Grinder were developing innovations in areas where Northwestern University had not yet [...] "cracked the code," [...] Faulkner decided to forgo the pursuit of his degree and, instead, dive headfirst into NLP training. By 1987, he was a certified NLP trainer. Today, Faulkner describes Grinder and Bandler as having been at least 10 years ahead of their time.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Neuro-linguistic</b> <b>programming</b> (NLP) is an {{approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell us about that. RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where we set up a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started. Now I cannot prove that but I've seen it enough times that I'm impressed with it.}} allergy, common cold, and learning disorders.|$|E
