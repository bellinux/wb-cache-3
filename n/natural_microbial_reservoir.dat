In this study, we utilized genetic variation in natural communities to test and refine the secondary and tertiary structural model for the bacterial tmRNA. The variability of proposed tmRNA secondary structures in different organisms {{and the lack of}} any predicted tertiary structure suggested that further refinement of the tmRNA could be useful. To increase the phylogenetic representation of tmRNA sequences, and thereby provide additional data for statistical comparative analysis, we amplified, sequenced, and compared tmRNA sequences from <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> communities. Using primers designed from gamma proteobacterial sequences, we determined 44 new tmRNA sequences from a variety of environmental DNA samples.

40|$|Fluorescently stained viruses {{were used}} as probes to label, identify, and enumerate {{specific}} strains of bacteria and cyanobacteria in mixed microbial assemblages. Several marine virus isolates were fluorescently stained with YOYO- 1 or POPO- 1 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and added to seawater samples that contained <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> communities. Cells to which the stained viruses adsorbed were easily distinguished from nonhost cells; typically, there was undetectable binding of stained viruses to <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> assemblages containing > 10 (sup 6) bacteria ml(sup- 1) but to which host cells were not added. Host cells that were added to natural seawater were quantified with 99 % (plusmn) 2 % (mean (plusmn) range) efficiency with fluorescently labeled virus probes (FLVPs). A marine bacterial isolate (strain PWH 3 a), tentatively identified as Vibrio natriegens, was introduced into <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> communities that were either supplemented with nutrients or untreated, {{and changes in the}} abundance of the isolate were monitored with FLVPs. Simultaneously, the concentrations of viruses that infected strain PWH 3 a were monitored by plaque assay. Following the addition of PWH 3 a, the concentration of viruses infecting this strain increased from undetectable levels (< 1 ml(sup- 1)) to 2. 9 x 10 (sup 7) and 8. 3 x 10 (sup 8) ml(sup- 1) for the untreated and nutrient-enriched samples, respectively. The increase in viruses was associated with a collapse in populations of strain PWH 3 a from ca. 30 to 2 % and 43 to 0. 01 % of the microbial communities in untreated and nutrient-enriched samples, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that FLVPs can be used to identify and quantify specific groups of bacteria in mixed microbial communities.

Only {{a minority of}} even terrestrial organisms that are observed in mixed, naturally-occurring microbial populations can be cultivated in the laboratory. Consequently, methods are being developed for analyzing the phylogenetic affiliations of the constituents of <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> populations {{without the need for}} their cultivation. This is more than an exercise in taxonomy, for the extent of phylogenetic relatedness between unknown and known organisms is some measure of the extent of their biochemical commonalities. In one approach, total DNA is isolated from <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> populations and 16 S rRNA genes are shotgun cloned for rapid sequence determinations and phylogenetic analyses. A second approach employs oligodeoxynucleotide hybridization probes that bind to phylogenetic group-specific sequences in 16 S rRNA. Since each actively growing cell contains about 104 ribosomes, the binding of the diagnostic probes to single cells can be visualized by radioactivity or fluorescence. The application of these methods and the use of in situ cultivation techniques is illustrated using submarine hydrothermal vent communities.

40|$|Bacterial {{degradation}} of organic pollutants in soil {{has been studied}} extensively but {{little is known about}} the availability and {{degradation of}} pollutants by bacterial resident on leaf surfaces. Here, we examined availability and degradation of phenol on leaves by introduced cells of a known phenol degrader and by <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> communities. Phenol-responsive gfp-expressing Pseudomonas fluorescens A 506 bioreporter cells detected airborne phenol as well as phenol that had been adsorbed by leaf surfaces. The degradation of airborne 14 C-phenol by leaf-associated bacteria showed that Pseudomonas sp. strain CF 600 released eight times more 14 CO 2 than a non-degrading mutant after introduction onto leaves. This study provided the first direct evidence of degradation of an organic air pollutant by leaf-associated bacteria. We evaluated phenol degradation by <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> communities on green ash leaves that were collected from a field site rich in airborne organic pollutants. We found that significantly more phenol was mineralized by these leaves when the communities were present than by these leaves following surface sterilization. Thus, phenol-degrading organisms were present in these natural communities and were metabolically capable of phenol degradation. We isolated and identified phenol-degrading bacterial isolates within these <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> communities. Ten phenol-degrading bacterial isolates were obtained that were most closely related to the genera Alcaligenes, Acinetobacter and Rhodococcus. The genetic characterization of these isolates revealed little diversity as phenol hydroxylase (PH) enzymes of all of the Gram-negative isolates were type II PHs, which have a moderate affinity for phenol, and these isolates harbored the ortho pathway of phenol degradation. Lastly, we attempted to understand the mechanism of phenol toxicity and tolerance in bacteria by comparing the transcriptional profiles of cells exposed to phenol and cells exposed to agents causing membrane and oxidative stress using the leaf-associated bacterial species, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Phenol resulted in the induction of heat shock genes that were not induced by the other stresses tested.

However, {{little is known about the}} in situ functions of the microbial communities. Results This study describes the application of proteomic approaches (metaproteomics) to observe expressed protein profiles of <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> communities (metaproteomes). The technique was validated using a constructed community and subsequently used to analyze Chesapeake Bay microbial community (0. 2 to 3. 0 μm) metaproteomes. Chesapeake Bay metaproteomes contained proteins from pI 4 – 8 with apparent molecular masses between 10 – 80 kDa. Replicated middle Bay metaproteomes shared ~ 92 % of all detected spots, but only shared 30 % and 70 % of common protein spots with upper and lower Bay metaproteomes. MALDI-TOF analysis of highly expressed proteins produced no significant matches to known proteins. Three Chesapeake Bay proteins were tentatively identified by LC-MS/MS sequencing coupled with MS-BLAST searching. The proteins identified were of marine microbial origin and correlated with abundant Chesapeake Bay microbial lineages, Bacteroides and α-proteobacteria.

40|$|Local {{adaptation}} is {{an outcome}} of divergent selection on microbial populations and {{has been linked to}} the immense genetic diversity of microbes observed in nature. Because it is difficult to study microbes in their natural habitats, most tests of microbial local adaptation have been performed in model laboratory systems; as a result, microbiologists have limited understanding of local adaptation among <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> populations. In this review, we summarize the evidence for microbial local adaptation in nature. Local adaptation has been most frequently studied, and most frequently found, in host–pathogen systems. We argue that {{more research is needed to}} understand the prevalence of local adaptation in free-living microbial populations. However, researchers will need to overcome a variety of logistical and conceptual challenges when studying <b>natural</b> <b>microbial</b> local adaptation, including a lack of solid understanding of many microbes’ natural histories. We propose strategies to facilitate future natural history research on divergent selection. We also summarize laboratory experimental work investigating the ecological and evolutionary processes leading to local adaptation. Microbiologists’ ongoing challenge is to integrate the valuable knowledge gained from laboratory experiments into well-designed field experiments. Such integration will help us understand the prevalence of, and circumstances leading to, local adaptation among microorganisms. © 2016 John Wiley Sons Lt...|$|R
