5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts {{also point out that}} the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} {{a strong and}} varied reaction from reviewers. Most heaped praise on the scenes featuring Karofsky, both the {{events leading up to}} his suicide attempt and when Kurt (Chris Colfer) visited him in the hospital. However, many felt the strength of this storyline unbalanced the episode, {{and the rest of the}} episode, particularly the Regionals competition and the Rachel and Finn wedding storyline, did <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> up. The final scene, which ended with Quinn (Dianna Agron) being in a potentially fatal car crash, was controversial.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{technology}} was not flawless. It struggled to gauge heights of incoming formations above 25,000 feet and could <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> their numerical strength. It could also take several minutes {{to assess the}} line of advance for aircraft on a zigzag course. Moreover, the radar looked out to sea {{and was unable to}} track aircraft overland. That was the job of the Royal Observer Corps. Tens of thousands of volunteers, the length and breadth of Britain tracked the German formations over land. They were connected to Sector airfields by landline and could communicate intelligence in real time.|$|E

The majority (63%) of foreign workers were based in Jakarta, working mainly as professionals, technicians, and managers.|$|E

25|$|After Pantera's breakup, Darrell and Vinnie {{formed a}} new band, Damageplan, with vocalist Pat Lachman and bassist Bob Zilla. The group {{released}} their first album, New Found Power, on February 10, 2004. The album was a commercial success; over 44,000 copies {{were sold in}} its first week alone and within a year over 100,000 copies were sold. However, some fans felt that Damageplan's material did <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> up to that of Pantera.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} who are at high likelihood of having OSA, a randomized controlled trial found that home oximetry (a non-invasive method of monitoring blood oxygenation) may be adequate and easier to obtain than formal polysomnography. High probability patients were identified by an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater and a Sleep Apnea Clinical Score (SACS) of 15 or greater. Home oximetry, however, does <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> apneic events or respiratory event-related arousals and thus does not produce an AHI value.|$|E

25|$|The {{result of}} the bombing was mixed. The German towns being hit {{suffered}} from severe destruction. German communications after the bombing were heavily impaired, {{and there was a}} considerable effect on the morale, especially on units consisting of more younger and inexperienced troops. However, the direct damage dealt to the German frontline troops was low, and casualties were few. Allied air commanders admitted that the bombing did <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> up to expectations. About 12 aircraft were shot down during the initial bombing by meager anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
25|$|Potassium bromide {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able {{as a matter of}} routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> bromide as a routine test.|$|E
25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install power factor correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> apparent power but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured by the meter can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E

25|$|The most {{frequently}} cited indicator of gender inequality is the United Nation's Gender Inequality Index, or GII. It was adopted in 2010 because the Gender Development Index did <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> gender inequality directly. It measured female development. The Gender Empowerment Measurement was replaced as well due to its overemphasis of income. As a consequence of this methodological construction, the GEM over estimated gender inequality in poor countries. Consequently, the GII was adopted to address these flaws {{and to be a}} true measure of inequality and not a proxy indicator. Income is not a component of the GII and the three categories are weighed equally to present a balance assessment of gender equality. The GII covers three broad categories of female disadvantage: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market status.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometry {{can be used}} {{to model}} the (complex) {{refractive}} index of a surface of a bulk material. It is also very useful in determining parameters of one or more thin film layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their reflection properties, not only are the predicted magnitude of the p and s polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the p and s reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used in situ to control production processes for instance.|$|E
25|$|Singaporean {{officials}} {{protested that}} the report did not present a full account of the incident and was incomplete, as responsibility for the accident {{appeared to have been}} placed mainly on the flight crew of SQ006, while other equally valid contributing factors had been played down. The team from Singapore that participated in the investigation felt that the lighting and signage at the airport did <b>not</b> <b>measure</b> up to international standards. Some critical lights were missing or not working. No barriers or markings were put up {{at the start of the}} closed runway, which would have alerted the flight crew that they were on the wrong runway. The Singapore team felt that these two factors were given less weight than was proper, as another flight crew had almost made the same mistake of using runway 05R to take off days before the accident.|$|E
