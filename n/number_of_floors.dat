5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, {{and the majority of}} the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters. Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to a pillar of light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the dungeon over at the beginning. When not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the dungeon itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position may be different, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors</b> can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item {{from the end of the}} dungeon.|$|E

25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, a shophouse often {{contains}} a shop with separate residential spaces. More generally, space {{occupied by the}} former contains a semi-public function. While this usually is, and historically usually was, a shop, it {{could just as easily}} be a food and beverage outlet (e.g. coffeeshop or bar), a service provider (e.g. clinic or barber), an industrial activity (e.g. cottage industry or auto workshop) or a community space (e.g. a school or clan association). Residential spaces are meant to accommodate one or more families, or serve as a dormitory for single workers. Popular belief holds that shophouses were initially occupied by single families, with their private living areas in one space and the more public family business in another. However, {{it is possible that the}} two spaces were always usually used by unrelated persons or groups, who may be tenants or resident owners. The position of the shop and residential space depends on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors</b> of the shophouse: A single storey shophouse tends to include residential space behind the shop, while residential spaces in shophouses of two or more storeys are typically located above the shop.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{numbering scheme}} is to assign cardinal numbers to entities.

500|$|E.Due {{to common}} {{practice}} of [...] skipping floors {{with the number}} 4 (e.g. 4, 14, 24, 34, ... and so on) and 13 in Hong Kong, floors may not be labelled sequentially. Thus a building's total count of actual floors may not be equal {{to the number of}} the top floor. As an example, one residential tower has a top floor labelled [...] "88", but contains only 42 actual floors. Sources that state the number of the top floor for a building's floor count may overstate the actual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors</b> for the building in question. See numbers in Chinese culture, unlucky 13 and thirteenth floor for more background information.|$|E
500|$|B. Building {{height and}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors</b> varies {{depending}} on the measuring location and whether the five underground levels, the lobby and the topmost two mechanical levels {{are included in the}} measurement. Sources like the corresponding SkyscraperPage thread list the tower at [...] tall with 60 floors, leaving out the topmost two levels. [...] However, the San Francisco project rundown thread on the same site lists the tower at [...] with only 55 floors, omitting the five underground and topmost two non-residential levels. [...] Emporis lists the building at 605 feet (184 m) and omits the lobby level in addition to the seven nonresidential levels from the floor count, leading to a count of 54 floors. [...] Another site gives no height figure but mentions the tower has 62 levels. [...] At least one San Francisco Chronicle article states the building is [...] tall with 62 levels, which includes the seven nonresidential levels. [...] However, another Chronicle article uses a different measuring location, stating that the south tower has [...] and 60 floors.|$|E
500|$|There was {{criticism}} {{concerning the}} limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors</b> that were designated for office space and other amenities {{in an early}} plan. Only 82 floors would have been habitable, and the total office space of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex would have been reduced by more than [...] {{in comparison with the}} original complex. The floor limit was imposed by Silverstein, who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability {{in the event of a}} future terrorist attack or other incident. Much of the building's height would have consisted of a large, open-air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower, containing wind turbines and [...] "sky gardens". In a subsequent design, the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original World Trade Center, and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans. In 2002, former New York Governor George Pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect's design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor, Ron Lauder.|$|E

6000|$|A common housemaid {{showed us}} through the building, but, unfortunately, to her it was a house whose {{interest}} depended altogether on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors</b> {{there were to be}} scrubbed, and windows to be cleaned. This labour-saving sentiment destroys a great deal of excellent poetry and wholesome feeling, reducing all that is venerable and romantic to the level of soap and house-cloths. I dare say one could find many more comfortable residences than this, within a league of Vévey; perhaps [...] "Mon Repos" [...] has the advantage of it, in this respect: but there must be a constant, quiet, and enduring satisfaction, with one whose mind is properly trained, in reflecting that he is moving, daily and hourly, through halls that have been trodden by his fathers for near a thousand years! Hope is a livelier, and, on the whole, a more useful, because a more stimulating, feeling, than that connected with memory; but there is a solemn and pleasing interest clinging about the latter, that no buoyancy of the first can ever equal. Europe is fertile of recollections; America is pregnant with hope. I have tried hard, aided by the love which is quickened by distance, {{as well as by the}} observations that are naturally the offspring of comparison, to draw such pictures of the latter for the future, as may supplant the pictures of the past that so constantly rise before the mind in this quarter of the world; but, though reasonably ingenious in castle-building, I have never been able to make it out. I believe laziness lies at the bottom of the difficulty. In our moments of enjoyment we prefer being led, to racking the brain for invention. The past is a fact; while, at the best, the future is only conjecture. In this case the positive prevails over the assumed, and the imagination finds both and easier duty, and all it wants, in throwing around the stores of memory, the tints and embellishments that are wanting to complete the charm. I know little of the history of Blonay, beyond the fact of its great antiquity, nor is it a chateau of remarkable interest as a specimen of the architecture and usages of its time; and yet, I never visited a modern palace, with half the intense pleasure with which I went through this modest abode. Fancy had a text, in a few unquestionable facts, and it preached copiously on their authority. At Caserta, or St. Cloud, we admire the staircases, friezes, salons, and marbles, but I never could do anything with your kings, who are so much mixed up with history, as to leave little to the fancy; while here, one might imagine not only time, but all the various domestic and retired usages that time brings forth.|$|E

3000|$|Although {{the basic}} {{definition}} of substantive representation provided by Pitkin in her seminal work, “acting {{in the interest}} of the represented in a manner responsive to them” (Pitkin, 1967, p. 209), leaves us with plenty of room for interpretation, it is generally accepted that substantive representation goes beyond mere policy responsiveness (i.e. the enactment of laws) (Schwindt-Bayer, 2010). In fact, scholars working on the representation of minorities have measured the work conducted by minority representatives in many different ways. Eulau and Karps (1977), for instance, argued that the concept also entailed service, allocation and symbolic responsiveness. Fenno (1977) shifted the focus from the work conducted in the legislatures to the work carried out in the districts of origin, what he defined as ‘home style’ representation. In this paper, I use two indicators of substantive emigrant representation. Firstly, I consider the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floor</b> speeches given by EMPs and NEMPs. This variable allows me to analyze if EMPs are marginalized within the legislatures in comparison to NEMPs. Secondly, I use the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>floor</b> speeches related explicitly to the emigrant agenda. I analyze floor sessions for two reasons. Firstly, it could be said that they represent the moment of the legislative process with more visibility. Secondly, they are a good indicator of the priorities of the representatives’ agendas, since opportunities for a representative to participate in floor sessions are scarce. 6 [...]...|$|R

40|$|During {{previous}} fire {{events such}} as the World Trade Centre Towers (WTC) 1, 2 & 7 in New York (2001), the Windsor Tower in Madrid (2005), and the Plasco building in Iran (2017), flames were observed to travel horizontally across the floor plate and vertically to different floors. Such fires are not considered as part of the traditional prescriptive structural design for fire. Recently, the Travelling Fires Methodology (TFM) has been developed to account for such horizontally travelling nature of fires. A dozen of studies have investigated the structural response of steel, concrete, and composite structures to a single-floor travelling fire. 5 out of 6 of the vertically travelling fire studies have been limited to the structures with a long span composite truss system as in the WTC Towers. The aim of this work is to investigate the response of a substantially different structural system, i. e. a generic multi-storey steel frame, subjected to travelling fires in multiple floors, and varying the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>floors,</b> including horizontal and vertical fire spread. A two-dimensional 10 -storey 5 -bay steel frame is modelled in the finite element software LS-DYNA. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> multiple fire <b>floors</b> is varied between 1 and 10, and for each of these scenarios, 5 different fire types are investigated. They include four travelling fire scenarios and the standard fire. In total, 51 fire simulations are considered. The development of deflections, axial forces, bending moments and frame utilization are analysed. Results show that the largest stresses develop in the fire floors adjacent to cool floors, and their behaviour is independent <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>floors.</b> Results indicate that both the fire type and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>floors</b> {{have a significant effect on}} the failure time (i. e. exceeded element load carrying capacity) and the type of collapse mechanism. In the cases with a low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>floors</b> (1 – 3) failure is dominated by the loss of material strength, while in the cases with larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>floors</b> (5 – 10) failure is dominated by thermal expansion. Collapse is mainly initiated by the pull-in of external columns (1 – 3 -floor fires; 1 – 9 -floor fires for 2. 5 % TFM) or swaying of the frame to the side of fire origin (5 – 10 -floor fires). This study has assessed a different structural form compared to previous literature under an extensive range <b>of</b> multiple <b>floor</b> travelling fire scenarios. We find that although vertically travelling fires result in larger beam axial forces and initial deflections, simultaneous travelling fires result in shorter failure times and represent a more onerous scenario for the steel frame investigated...|$|R
