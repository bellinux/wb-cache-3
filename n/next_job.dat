5|$|Although {{there were}} {{conflicting}} reports {{on whether he}} retired from the Army in 1947, 1949 or 1950, he left the army only shortly before the Buffalo Soldiers were disbanded as part of President Harry S. Truman's initiative to integrate the Army. His <b>next</b> <b>job</b> was at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda where he worked as a security guard. By the time he retired for a second time, in 1970, he had become the chief of the guards at the institution. He spent much of his spare time fishing, reading the Bible, and recounting tales of his extensive military experiences, which made him a popular and respected figure within the community. His wife of 57 years, Genevieve Hill Matthews, died in 1986 and one of his daughters, Shirley Ann, died two years later.|$|E

Next Watson opened a butcher shop in Buffalo, which soon failed, leaving Watson with no money, no investment, and no job.|$|E
25|$|He was {{employed}} {{in less than}} a fortnight: from 1 September 1690, he was a musician-organist in the Württemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. That job was better, but, unfortunately, he lived there only two years before fleeing the French attacks of the War of the Grand Alliance. His <b>next</b> <b>job</b> was in Gotha as the town organist, a post he occupied for two years, starting on 8 November 1692; there he published his first, and only, liturgical music collection: Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren in 1693 (Erster Theil etlicher Choräle).|$|E

50|$|Redistricting {{after the}} 2000 census {{combined}} with Ohio's term limits laws had Republican officeholders {{at the federal}} and state levels struggling with each other to draw federal congressional districts to create safe seats, with the interests of incumbent US representatives clashing with the interests of state legislators facing term limits looking to Congress for their <b>next</b> <b>jobs.</b> About 43 percent of the voters voted for Democrats in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Joe Hallett {{wrote in}} the Columbus Dispatch (January 13, 2002):Redistricting should be a happy process for Republicans.... But the task has hardly been gleeful. Contrarily, it has turned into an embarrassment for Republicans.... Eight-year term limits, more than the state budget, are to blame. These days, state lawmakers {{constantly}} are scouting their <b>next</b> <b>jobs....</b> Visions of Congress dance in their heads. They want districts ready-made for their ascensions. Meanwhile, congressional incumbents constantly angle for districts they can't possibly lose.|$|R
25|$|While Wert {{endured the}} humiliating {{situation}} in Mantua {{through the late}} 1560s, he kept his job: he was to remain at least nominally maestro di cappella in Mantua until 1592. The 1560s were productive years for Wert musically, as he produced his first four books of five-voice madrigals during this time, and his first book for four voices. The dedications are significant: one is to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Duke of Sessa, and in the dedicatory preface Wert thanks him {{for the opportunity to}} lead his choir. (Fernández de Córdoba was Governor of Milan from 1558 to 1560.) During the late 1560s Wert had several offers of employment elsewhere, but turned them down. The most significant came in Augsburg in 1566, where Wert's spectacular ability to improvise counterpoint engendered an offer to join the imperial court in Prague, serving Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The <b>next</b> <b>job</b> offer he refused came from Parma the next year, the home of the Farnese family. However he became increasingly close to the Este court in Ferrara during the 1570s and 1580s, without actually becoming employed there. While the two courts were closely connected by marriage and mutual interchange of musicians, Ferrara was a place with a profoundly different outlook from Mantua: Ferrara was progressive, while Mantua was supportive of the Counter-Reformation; the progressive tendencies of Ferrara better fitted Wert's musical inclinations. Wert had a good time there; so much so that his employer in Mantua sent a strongly worded letter on 22 December 1584 demanding his immediate return to his post. Wert, however, {{had fallen in love with}} the widowed Tarquinia Molza, the most famous female singer and poet in Italy, who was a lady-in-waiting at the Este court, so he endeavored to spend as much time as possible in Ferrara. This was the same year that Lucrezia, Wert's wife, died in prison in Novellara.|$|E
500|$|Needing a new job, Naomi {{decided to}} start her own events business, and took {{on the role of}} organising the local Christmas carols at the Lassiter's Complex. Naomi faced {{difficulties}} with the event when the [...] "Santa Union" [...] refused to provide a Father Christmas or Snowman, forcing Naomi to ask her mother and neighbour Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) for help. The event then came under threat from a councillor, who informed Naomi that she did not have the correct insurance. Once the issue was sorted, the carols went ahead as planned. Naomi's <b>next</b> <b>job</b> was to plan the Erinsborough Festival. Local businessman Dennis Dimato (David Serafin) approached Paul and Naomi about sponsoring the event, but when Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) informed them that Dimatio had [...] "a dodgy past", Paul and Naomi turned down his offer.|$|E

In their discussions on 17 May, both Law and Lloyd George had agreed that Lord Kitchener should not remain in the War Office, and removing him became top priority. Unfortunately the press began a campaign supporting Kitchener on 21 May, and the popular feeling that this raised convinced Law, Lloyd George and Asquith that Kitchener could not be removed. To keep him {{and at the same}} time remove the munitions supply from his grasp to prevent a repeat of the [...] "shells crisis" [...] the Ministry of Munitions was created, with Lloyd George becoming Minister of Munitions.|$|E
2500|$|Accepting Caitanya as {{the final}} goal of his {{intellectual}} and spiritual quest, Kedarnath soon started delivering public lectures on his teachings, culminating in his famous speech [...] – his first public announcement of the newly found religious allegiance. In The Bhagavat, delivered in masterful English but directed at both the Western cultural conquest and the bhadralok it influenced, [...] Kedarantha attempted to reconcile modern thought and Vaishnava orthodoxy and to restore the Bhagavata to its preeminent position in Hindu philosophy. His newly found inspiration in the teachings of Caitanya and Bhagavata made Kedarnath receive his <b>next</b> <b>job</b> transfer to Jagannath Puri as a blessing – Puri was Caitanya's residence {{for most of his}} life, and the shelter of the principal Vaishnava shrine, the Temple of Jagannath.|$|E

2500|$|Hertfordshire {{showed that}} Young {{wanted to be}} a chief police officer who made things happen. Ever ambitious, he applied unsuccessfully to be chief constable of Kent in 1946, but his <b>next</b> <b>job</b> was offered to him. So {{impressed}} was Home Secretary James Chuter Ede with the young Chief Constable of Hertfordshire that in 1947 he appointed Young to the vacant post of Assistant Commissioner [...] "D" [...] of the Metropolitan Police in London, in charge of organisation, recruitment, training and communications. To bring in an outsider to such a rank in the Met was unprecedented. [...] The Home Secretary realised that the nation's police forces were wedded to obsolete methods and needed the invigorating shake-up that the young chief constable had already delivered in Hertfordshire; Scotland Yard must not be left out. Things, however, did not go well. The Commissioner, Sir Harold Scott, tolerated him (although he was an outsider too), but senior colleagues cold-shouldered him. Within [...] "D" [...] Department, Young delivered all the Home Secretary had hoped for, a success that only alienated the hierarchy even further.|$|E
2500|$|Ruby toured with Mildred {{during the}} summers of 1916 and 1917, and practiced her sister's {{routines}} backstage. Watching the movies of Pearl White, whom Ruby idolized, also influenced her drive to be a performer.

Ruby never attended high school, [...] "although early biographical thumbnail sketches had her attending Brooklyn's famous Erasmus Hall High School." [...] Soon afterward, she took a job filing cards at the Brooklyn telephone office for $14 a week, which allowed her to become financially independent. She disliked both jobs; her real goal was to enter show business, even as her sister Mildred discouraged the idea. She then took a job cutting dress patterns for Vogue magazine, but because customers complained about her work, she was fired. Her <b>next</b> <b>job</b> was as a typist for the Jerome H.

Stern was {{cautious}} about the offer at first {{as the general}} manager [...] "was not really aware of what I did", but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to [...] "kill my competition. I {{was going to say}} whatever the fuck I was going to say ... The first step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host {{with a sense of humor}} to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she [...] "would come in and do the news ... but it wasn't that way". Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern [...] "kept chipping away at management's archaic approach and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned", which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife's miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.|$|E
