In the specimen without pre-aging, hardness increased with <b>natural</b> <b>aging</b> time {{due to the}} formation of nanoscale cluster (nanocluster; Cluster(1)). The suppression of Cluster(1) during <b>natural</b> <b>aging</b> is clearly seen in the pre-aged specimens though the formation of Cluster(2). It was found that tensile properties were not so affected by the types of clusters. Bending test clearly showed that the pre-aging improves the bendability of this alloy. This effectiveness of pre-aging means Cluster(2) well contributes the deformability of this alloy compared with Cluster(1). Such an improvement of bendability is considered to be derived from the structure of nanoclusters and its interactions with the factor of plastically deformation of alloys...|$|R

5000|$|On {{the surface}} of the qin there may be cracks or patternations called duanwen 〔斷紋/断纹〕. These cracks appear after {{a long period of time}} due to ageing. The wood's water content slowly evaporates, so the wood retracts; the lacquer, however, does not, so it cracks. It should be {{distinguished}} from cracking or warping from the wood, which creates structural cracks. Duanwen are highly prized by the qin connoisseur because they not only prove the qin's antiquity (to a certain degree of error), but are also pleasant to look at. There are many names for different cracks, such as [...] "snake-skin cracks" [...] 『蛇腹斷』, [...] "ice-crack markings" [...] 『冰裂紋』, [...] "cow-hair cracks" [...] 『牛毛斷』, [...] "flowing-water markings" [...] 『流水紋』, [...] "running-cloud markings" [...] 『行雲紋』, [...] "tortoise-back markings" [...] 『龜背紋/龟背纹』, [...] "plum-blossom cracks" [...] 『梅花斷』, etc. Modern qin makers can artificially create cracks by first heating the lacquered qin for a few hours until it is hot, then immersing it in a bath of ice cubes, thus the wood retracts quickly causing cracks on {{the surface of}} the qin (this is not a new method). Of course, this method does not create the best of cracks. Although a qin may have duanwen, one can still play it, providing the duanwen is not flaking off or lifting off the surface. Otherwise, it would have to be re-lacquered, partially if the flaking is not too severe, entirely if it is literally unplayable. Qin makers tend to avoid removing the old lacquer when re-lacquering and maintain as much of the duanwen as possible since real duanwen cannot be created overnight but through centuries of <b>natural</b> <b>ageing.</b> Some makers when re-lacquering would use a different hue or colour of lacquer so that the lacquer underneath can contrast with the new, and thus be seen more clearly. The colour of the lacquer used can range from extreme black to brown to purple to red (in the rarest cases). Colour is achieved by using minerals or chemicals added to the processed lacquer. [...] The most beautiful duanwen are, understandably, from old antique qins.|$|E
40|$|Quench {{sensitivity}} in Al-Mg-Si alloys {{has been}} largely attributed to the solute loss at the heterogeneous nucleation sites, primarily dispersoids, during slow cooling after extrusion. As such, the number density of dispersoids, the solute type and concentration {{are considered to be}} the key variables for the quench sensitivity. In this study, quench sensitivity and the influence of <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> in a lean Al-Mg-Si alloy, AA 6060, which contains few dispersoids, have been investigated by hardness measurement, thermal analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). It is shown that the quench sensitivity in this alloy is associated with the degree of supersaturation of vacancies after cooling. Due to vacancy annihilation and clustering during <b>natural</b> <b>ageing,</b> the quench sensitivity is more pronounced after a short <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time (30 min) compared to a longer <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time (24 h).

The heat treatments consisted of either <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> or pre-ageing at 353 K followed by a paint-bake treatment at 453 K. <b>Natural</b> <b>ageing</b> was seen to increase the hardness, and hence reduce formability compared to pre-ageing.

40|$|Quench sensitivity, the {{dependence}} of strength and hardness on the cooling rate after extrusion or solution treatment, limits the applications of extrusions of heat treatable aluminium alloys. Reduced properties in slow cooled samples have long been attributed {{to the loss of}} solute on heterogeneous nucleation sites during cooling. While minimum cooling rates to avoid precipitation of Mg-Si-containing phases and reduced properties have been mapped out for a broad range of commercial alloys, little is understood about the physical mechanisms leading to quench sensitivity. In this investigation the difference in hardness evolution between slow cooled and fast quenched samples of various commercial and model Al-Mg-Si alloys has been determined for a broad range of natural and artificial ageing times. This has demonstrated that the artificial ageing response of fast quenched samples differs greatly from the artificial ageing response of slow cooled samples. In contrast to fast cooled samples, where <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> has a negative effect, the artificial ageing response of slow cooled samples is less dependent on <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time. As a result, hardness differences between fast and slow cooled samples is large during artificial ageing after short <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> times, but small after long <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> times, such that quench sensitivity strongly varies. In order to explain this phenomenon, the cooling rate dependent microstructural development has been investigated using hardness measurements, electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). From TEM investigations and theoretical considerations of the diffusion range it has been determined that solute is only lost from a limited region around the non-hardening precipitates forming during cooling on secondary dispersoids. The increased age hardening rate in fast cooled samples after short <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> times is therefore the result of a high vacancy supersaturation rather than a high solute supersaturation compared to slow cooled samples. Non-equilibrium vacancies appear to act as precipitation sites for the precursor of the strengthening β”-precipitates. In slow cooled samples the formation of β”-precipitates seems to be suppressed. In lean alloys with a low solute content, such as the investigated AA 6060, the age hardening response is almost independent of the cooling rate. Small additions of Cu or changes in the Mg:Si-ratio in alloys with a combined Mg+Si-content greater than 1 wt. % have little effect on precipitation of non-hardening phases during cooling, but affect natural and artificial ageing behaviour. The cooling rate after extrusion or solution treatment was also found to affect whether <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> has a negative effect or not. In fast cooled samples of Al-Mg-Si alloys with combined Mg+Si-contents greater than 1 wt. % the decrease in ageing kinetics due to the decrease of non-equilibrium vacancies with increasing <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time contributes to the negative effect. In slow cooled samples the initial number of quenched-in vacancies is low, such that ageing kinetics are independent of the <b>natural</b> <b>ageing</b> time...|$|E
