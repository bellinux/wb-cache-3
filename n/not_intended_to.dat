5|$|Australian philosopher Douglas Gasking (1911–1994) {{developed}} {{a version of}} the ontological argument meant to prove God's non-existence. It was <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be serious; rather, its purpose was to illustrate the problems Gasking saw in the ontological argument.|$|E

5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} in May 2016 {{that the free}} upgrade offer would be extended to users of assistive technologies; however, Microsoft did not implement any means of certifying eligibility for this offer, which some outlets thereby promoted as being a loophole to fraudulently obtain a free Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft said that the loophole is <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be used in this manner. In November 2017, Microsoft stated that this program would end December 31, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The {{emphasis}} on liberal {{arts in the}} revised degree titles (for both the A.L.B. and A.L.M. degrees) was <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> signify {{a difference in the}} degree itself versus the University's other offerings, but instead to serve as a response to concerns expressed by some that programs catering to non-traditional students were overly vocational in nature. The purpose of the name was to reaffirm adherence to the University's historic focus on the liberal arts, and distinguish it from other, more vocational, institutions.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorial}} {{is located}} {{in front of the}} main entrance to Government House, {{one of the most prominent}} buildings in Adelaide, on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street. It was constructed with a budget of £2500 raised through public donations, and was designed by the London-based sculptor Adrian Jones. While the statue itself was <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> represent any particular soldier, there is evidence suggesting that the head of the rider was based on that of George Henry Goodall.|$|E
5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a through route and was <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> have any {{stations}} of its own, but in 1904 {{it was decided}} to build two stations on it. A new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece was <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> {{be associated with}} the Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> stand {{in the line of}} battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> mislead.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
