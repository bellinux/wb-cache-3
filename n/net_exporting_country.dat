40|$|This paper {{examines}} optimal {{cooperative and}} non-cooperative environmental {{taxes for the}} {{case in which a}} polluting input is used to produce an internationally-traded finished product. The model allows for terms-of-trade effects under oligopoly and employs a general specification of the environmental damage function that encompasses special cases of local, global, and transboundary externalities. The model has several implications for public finance. For example, inefficiently high environmental taxes may be optimal for a <b>net</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> in non-cooperative circumstances, as the motive to shift rent by selecting an inefficiently low tax rate is countervailed by the incentive to shift the burden of the tax to foreign consumers. The findings identify the important role of asymmetric trade flows (denominated in both goods and pollution exchange) in determining optimal cooperative and non-cooperative tax policy under oligopoly.

40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of the Commission's July 2004 proposal for sugar policy reforms on developing countries. The study uses three approaches that complement each other: model simulations, literature review and country case studies. Model simulations indicate that {{the consequences of the}} EU policy reform on EU imports are rather modest: imports from LDCs increase but to a lesser extent than the Commission and other studies indicate. Important trigger points in the evaluation of the impact on trade flows are the degree of substitutability between domestic EU sugar and imported sugar, and potential 'swap' or trade diversion effects. Welfare effects are minor to ACP countries as a group, but country effects may differ strongly. The study includes three case studies - Ethiopia, Mauritius and Brazil, representing an EBA, an ACP and a <b>net</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> with no preferences to the EU market - to show how EU policy changes may affect the sugar industry in each of these countries.

40|$|One of {{the central}} issues in {{international}} macroeconomics is relative price movements and their sources. One such price {{is the price of}} crude oil. An increase in oil price leads to a transfer of income from importing to exporting countries through a shift in terms of trade.

However, the dynamics of these effects – especially the adjustment to the terms of trade – are uncertain.

The relationship between oil price and world business cycle as well as the relationship between oil price, GWP and Saudi Arabia’s export is also examined in this paper.

As a nation we shifted from a long-held tradition as a <b>net</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> of goods and became a net importer (Rachal, 1991). The agricultural industry contributed to improving the balance of trade by exporting billions {{of dollars worth of}} goods. During this time, more than 20 million Americans employed in the food and fiber industry worked to satisfy the need for agricultural products both at home and abroad. While this is happening, American farmers face the complexity of trying to compete in a dynamic global marketing arena. In addition, there are fewer opportunities for farmers to receive systematic and organized instruction regarding new technologies in agriculture (Birkenholz and Maricle. 1991). The attitude for increased capitalization of education during this era did not keep pace with the total federal budget.

40|$|On the {{one hand}} {{the high price of}} oil is a unique {{opportunity}} for African oil producers to use the windfall gains to speed up their development. On the other hand, it is having adverse effects on net-oil importing countries, in particular those which cannot access international capital markets to smooth out the shock. We construct a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, which is tailored to reflect the characteristics of African economies, to quantify the effect of the increase in the price of oil on the main macro economic aggregates. The model is general enough that it imbeds both oil producing and oil importing countries. Our results indicate that a doubling of the price of oil on world markets with complete pass through to oil consumers would lead to a 6 per cent contraction of the median net-oil importing African country in the first year. If that country were to adopt a no-pass through strategy, output would not be significantly affected but its budget deficit would increase by 6 per cent. As for the median <b>net</b> oil <b>exporting</b> <b>country,</b> a doubling in the price of oil would mean that its gross domestic product would increase by 4 percent under managed-float and by 9 percent under a fixed exchange rate regime.

Research Design & Methods: It was decided to explain why Poland’s bilateral trade balances in gross terms and value added terms differ. The calculations were made using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), based on the input-output approach. Findings: In the years 1995 - 2011, Poland’s trade with the majority of the countries was characterised by widening gaps between balances in gross terms and those in VA terms. The decomposition of bilateral trade balances by VA content demonstrated that the differences in the value of trade balances in gross terms and in VA terms had been mostly determined by two components: ‘multilateral VA <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> to third <b>countries</b> via partner’ and ‘foreign VA in <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> from other <b>countries</b> than partner’. Implications & Recommendations: To appraise benefits from Poland’s bilateral trade better it is recommended to use the decomposition of trade balances by value added content. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in the decomposition of Poland’s bilateral trade balances by value added content.

40|$|Decoupled payment program, {{deemed to}} have less or no {{distortion}} on domestic production and trade, is largely implemented to support the farmers’ revenue in the EU agrofood sector. However it is analyzed by Moschini and Sckokai (1994) that when lump-sum transfer is not available, decoupled payment is more efficient than coupled subsidies only when the income target for the farmers is high. Based on this idea, this paper analyzes the efficiency of decoupled payment in an imperfect competitive agrofood sector where raising public funds to finance decoupled payment is costly. It is shown in a close economy that the likelihood of using decoupled payment to substitute the output subsidy increases with the market power of the processor in the agrofood sector. In an open economy where trade policy instruments are available, an implementation of decoupled payment leads to a reduction of the domestic output subsidy. From a domestic welfare point of view it will induce {{an increase in the}} tariff in a net import country and in some condition, an increase in the export subsidy in a <b>net</b> <b>export</b> <b>country.</b> However, for the global welfare care authority, such as the WTO, the change of the trade policy are just the reverse.

Simulations using a global general equilibrium model show that a more balanced global economy would tend to improve the current account balance in LICs with limited impact on domestic output.

On the other hand, such prices increases could provide an impetus to export diversification in many LICs, raising growth in the long run. The output and terms of trade effects would be significantly amplified if structural adjustment is impeded by factor immobility and other rigidities.

No evidence is found to support the pollution hypothesis that industries facing above-average abatement costs with environmental regulations would prefer pollution havens and relocate their activities.

In contrast to earlier studies, this paper focuses on how the impact of IRS varies over time and across industries. We test {{the hypothesis that the}} impact of scale economies is determined by the relative market size of the trading countries, using data on production and trade in 17 OECD countries over the period 1970 - 93. We find support in favour of the hypothesis that economies of scale have significant effects on trade patterns, specifically a positive effect on <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> from large <b>countries</b> and a negative effect in small countries. Furthermore, the results indicate that the role of scale economies is declining over time. Finally, the importance of IRS as a determinant of trade differs widely across industries and the results suggest that scale economies, to some extent, have a larger effect on trade in industries at a medium technology level.

40|$|We {{envisage}} {{a logical}} framework {{to explain why}} some trade negotiations are delayed because parties differ on who should 2 ̆ 018 go first 2 ̆ 019. In our model, there are substantive welfare implications depending on which party sets tariff rates (or subsidies) first in a strategic optimization exercise. When knowledge about cost levels are incomplete or missing, and hence must be guessed with a probability, the chances of conflict regarding who goes first are extremely high in the situation modeled in this paper. As an institution with some power to set the rules of negotiations, the WTO {{should be able to}} anticipate such conflicts in upcoming negotiations. It can then set the rule (in this case, dictate who should go first) depending on whose interest it wants to protect. There is a wide range of choices for the WTO in this regard: OECD consumer 2 ̆ 019 s surplus, OECD producers 2 ̆ 019 loss, <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> of developing <b>countries,</b> firm profits, or even, world welfare as the sum of all these components...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{domestic}} policy regulations and standards on trade {{has been at}} the forefront of global policy during the past decade. Every country develops their own policies and standards that differ from country to country. These differences create problems for manufacturing industries, especially in major <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> This study overviews the policy context driving standards in the manufacturing industries. The study consists of three different articles that attempt to examine the role of technical regulations and standards and their relationship with trade using different econometric models In the first article, the standard factor endowment approach is employed to explain the effects of environmental regulatory policy on <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> in different manufacturing industries. The study hypothesizes that a country’s comparative advantage depends on its factor abundance. The regulatory policy increases production costs and, thus, reduces the output level of an industry. The results indicate that each industry is unique in the factors determining <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> and in many instances environmental regulations are important...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 the world’s {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the global food crisis and, as consequence, on the global food security. By mid- 2009, commodity prices have dropped sensitively, nevertheless most of them still remain at or above past trend levels. Fluctuations in prices are not rare in agricultural markets where volatility is a common characteristic. Among cereals rice has a strategic importance. It is source of nutrition for more than a half of the world population and of income for about two million of farmers. Even if it is produced and consumed everywhere, production and consumption are concentrated in Asia. Because of its strategic importance, rice is and has been subject to a host of policy interventions that have made it feature among the most distorted of all agricultural commodities. Export policies have typically been applied by <b>net</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> {{and one of the most}} commonly applied policy measures, adopted by net importing countries, is the removal or reduction of import duties and taxes on food commodities. Various forms of producer support measures were introduced, including input subsidies, output price support and an easing of cropland set-aside requirements. Policies to support consumers and vulnerable groups have included: direct consumer subsidies, tax reductions, distribution from public stocks, price subsidies, public-sector salary increases and social safety net programmes. Self-targeting food-for-work programmes have been put in place by some countries. Although the EU rice trade represents only 0. 4 per cent of world trade a common organisation market (COM) for rice was set-up. It is a complex system aiming at maintaining European rice production destined for domestic and external markets. This paper aims to expand the above statements. The objective is to review and compare the policies adopted in Asia and in the EU and assess their impact form the point of sustainability (in a broad sense) with the ultimate aim to advance some interpretations and suggestions in the short and long run, having in mind the variables that affect the supply, the demand and the trade. As a background, the paper first outlines the characteristics of the rice market. Through a regression analysis that could help to understand how the rice price changes. It also considers the policies adopted in Asia and in the EU, highlighting their results on prices from an economic and social point of view. This paper concludes with a number of issues to be borne in mind when interpreting the volatility or rice prices (according to the regression analysis results), the expected policy impact and distortions, and, finally, the “relatively” new strategy: move from food security to self-sufficient food security, one of the long terms goals of the Treaty of Rome (to secure availability of supplies). food security, rice market, public policies, regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|Trends {{for major}} {{fisheries}} products are evaluated {{for the past}} two decades, using aggregate annual data. Major changes have been propelled by income growth, changes in preferences and health concerns about meat in developed countries, leading to increased consumption of high-valued fisheries items such as shell and filet fish. Developing countries, especially East Asia, are rapidly increasing consumption of lower valued fishery items, and fish-culture is becoming an increasingly important source of food and <b>exports.</b> Developed <b>countries</b> accounted for 85 percent of net world fish imports in 1994, mostly at {{the high end of the}} value spectrum, from about twenty countries. In the ten years preceding 1993, the net value of fisheries <b>exports</b> from developing <b>countries</b> went from less than a third of <b>net</b> developing <b>country</b> <b>exports</b> of sugar, beverage crops and tropical specialty products combined, to a level exceeding that total. While real fish prices have remained relatively stable since 1970, real beef prices have declined by 300 percent, suggesting that a rally in meat prices would further accentuate the shift to fish. Current evidence suggests a 15 percent relative strengthening of fish prices to beef through 2020. Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1 MSS...|$|R
