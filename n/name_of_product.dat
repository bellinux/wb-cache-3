40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine how}} changes in {{outcomes}} {{are reported in}} drug advertisements in medical journals. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Advertisements from {{a convenience sample of}} 38 issues of Canadian Family Physician, Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, Canadian Medical Association Journal, and the New England Journal of Medicine. MAIN MESSAGE: Method of reporting changes in clinical outcomes (relative risk reduction [RRR], absolute risk reduction [ARR], number needed to treat [NNT]), <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>product,</b> and company marketing product were sought. In the 22 advertisements included in the analysis, 11 reported results as RRRs; two reported results as RRRs, but readers could calculate ARRs or NNTs from figures given in the advertisement; and nine gave no measure of results, but readers could calculate RRRs, ARRs, or NNTs from figures given. CONCLUSIONS: Most companies report changes in outcomes as RRRs, and this bias could influence the way physicians prescribe. Changes to the rules governing journal advertising and increased emphasis on critical appraisal skills would help mitigate this bias...|$|E
40|$|Applying Building Information Modeling (BIM) {{is a hot}} issue. The Building {{industry}} {{feels the}} urge to use it, {{but at the same}} time companies see huge risks, since the ownership and control of information becomes unclear when all building information is put together in one model. Also the cost and the benefits do not always land at the same place. To that account three Dutch firms operating in multi- disciplinary building 2 ̆ 6 amp; construction projects asked the authors to execute a research and design project how to solve this problem. As a result a framework for assessing risks was developed for setting up a successful BIM process. It seems the manufacturing industry is much ahead of the Building industry in using these concepts and technology, be it under the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Product</b> Lifecycle Management. However, comparing the approaches in the Building industry and manufacturing industry shows that, while construction is primarily interested in the risks, manufacturing is primarily focussed on the benefits. The paper tries to explain this difference and concludes with some suggestions to reduce risk and enhance the benefits of BIM for construction companies. Keywords:, Data collection, Product Lifecycle management, Building Information Modeling and Data storage...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} work {{was carried out}} during 2012 in district Bannu to study the use of medicinal plants in Unani medicine. A total of 35 Unani medicines were reported and arranged systematically along with <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>product,</b> available form, company name, name of the plants/parts used in the drugs, family name and purpose of uses. During the research {{it was found that}} most of the members of Lamiaceae, Asteraceae and Rhamnaceae are used in these medicines. Plants which were used commonly in these medicines in one form or the other are Ziziphus jujuba, Foeniculum vulgare, Solanum nigrum, Ocimum cannum and Zingber officinale. It was noted that these products are mostly available in syrup form, rarely in tablets form (Hab –khoom Safa, Mensorine, Scony Tablets) and one only one product in dry powder (Supari Pak). It is generally believed that these medicines have no side effect. Interestingly one medicine is suggested for many diseases as per the given instructions in the medicine pack. It was also noted that the manufacturers of these medicines are mostly not registered that’s why incomplete addresses along with the wrongly spellings plant name given on the medicine packs. The main purpose of the research was to identify and enlist the plants systematically used in these medicines...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study are as follows: 1). to analyze factors influencing respondents' considerations in selecting bank and saving product.; 2). to analyze the respondent perceptions on Simaskot and Simpedes Saving product; 3) to analyze the respondent perceptions on the prospect of transfering Simaskot into Simpedes saving product. Based on the quadrant analyzes result, bank location and bank safety has become the main BRI attributes associated with the customers main satisfaction. Hospitality or friendliness, employee professionalism and government ownership status are not the main influencing factor for the customer' choice. Therefore, {{there should be some}} efforts to develop the Bank's attribute performance. The result of Thurstone analysis shows that in selecting saving product attributes such as ATM facilities and, transaction conveniency, multypurpose and administration fee have become the main priorites. Administration fee has satisfied the customer while other attributes such as; ATM facility, transaction convenience, multipurpose have not yet satisfied customer. Prize and <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> considered as not very important by customers and given a very low priority. Simaskot, taken {{from the point of view}} of product life cycle, has already in the maturity phase, while Simpedes has already in growth phase close to maturity. Therefore, in order to increase sales, BRI should develop its product quality, add more new product features and increase distribution channel. The performance of Simaskot growth h maturity phase is one of the bases for 6 / 31 in transferring it into Simpedes. Other considerations are: management effectiveness and cost effectiveness. The survey shows that, all respondents will remain as BRI customer using Simpedes as their saving product. This reflects that Simaskot customers are loyal to BRI. However, BRI should take a very serious attention related to what is recommended by customers such as: better services, increase the number of ATM, more features on ATM, better passbook and a better real on line system. ...|$|E
