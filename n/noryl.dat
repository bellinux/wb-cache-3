2500|$|The 1982 {{recession}} in Mexico weakened {{the economy and}} hit the automotive market and industry, with VAM being no exception. The dire situation, coupled with a government decree banning the importation of automotive accessories took its toll in both standard and optional equipment of all car lines and marques sold in Mexico. All high-trim Americans for 1982 were no longer available with power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, tilt steering column, quartz digital clock, and rear defroster. Items that were standard for 1981 such as the remote controls for the door mirrors, the intermittent wipers, the reading dome light, and vanity mirror were put on the option list. The rest of the equipment was virtually unchanged from 1981. Despite this, {{there was a new}} optional accessory for the year, an AM/FM/stereo tape player radio. All three high-trim editions featured a new VAM-designed luxurious grille with a rectangular pattern, while the three base models used AMC's square-pattern design borrowed from U.S. market Eagle models. The GFS, ECD and DL models also got a set of plain VAM-designed bumper end caps with a chrome molding on the top side edge. Along with these, AMC's Eagle nerfing strip design was also used in both bumpers. The headlight bezels changed to blacked out units in their internal sections keeping the chromed surrounding areas. All-new aluminum road wheels also replaced the previously-imported <b>Noryl</b> wheel covers.

50|$|Allan Stuart Hay FRS1929-2017(born July 23, 1929 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian chemist, and Tomlinson Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at McGill University.

50|$|While {{it was one}} of the {{cheapest}} high-temperature resistant plastics, processing was difficult and the impact and heat resistance decreased with time. Mixing it with polystyrene in any ratio could compensate for the disadvantages. In the 1960s, modified PPE came into the market under the trademark <b>Noryl.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>NORYL</b> {{family of}} {{modified}} PPE resins consists of amorphous blends of PPO polyphenylene ether (PPE) resin and polystyrene. They combine the inherent benefits of PPE resin (affordable high heat resistance, good electrical insulation properties, excellent hydrolytic stability {{and the ability}} to use non-halogen fire retardant packages), with excellent dimensional stability, good processibility and low density.|$|E
5000|$|Polyphenylene oxide (PPO), {{which is}} {{obtained}} from the free-radical, step-growth oxidative coupling polymerization of 2,6-xylenol, has many attractive properties such as high heat distortion and impact strength, chemical stability to mineral and organic acids, and low water absorption. PPO is difficult to process, and hence the commercial resin (<b>Noryl)</b> is made by blending PPO with high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) which serves to reduce the processing temperature.|$|E
50|$|These {{polymers}} {{are made}} through oxidative coupling of substituted phenol {{in the presence}} of oxygen and copper and amine containing catalysts, such as cuprous bromide and pyridine. See Figure 2 for the PPO structure. PPO polymers can be classified as plastic resins. They and their composites with polystyrene, glass, and nylon are used as high-strength, moisture-resistant engineering plastics in a number of industries, including computer, telecommunication, and automotive parts. PPOs are marketed by SABIC Innovative Plastics under the trademarked name of <b>Noryl.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of polystyrene to PPE increases the {{glass transition temperature}} above 100 °C, owing to the high Tg of PPE, so <b>NORYL</b> resin is stable in boiling water. The precise value of the transition depends on the exact composition of the grade used. There is a smooth linear relation between weight content of polystyrene and the Tg of the blend. Due to its good electrical resistance, it is widely used in switch boxes. However, product design is important in maximising {{the strength of the}} product, especially in eliminating sharp corners and other stress concentrations. Injection molding must ensure that moldings are stress-free.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantages}} of a propeller with cosine response have been widely recognized. Weller and Davis designed the propeller sensors and their location within the pressure cage {{in order to obtain}} a response {{as close as possible to}} an ideal cosinusoidal angular response. After having fabricated and testes several families of propellers, they found the best response in a dual propeller (two propellers fixed on an axle) sensor with two five-bladed, 30-degree pitch propellers with diameter of 22 cm. The propellers are hard anodized, epoxy coated on the exterior, and protected by zinc anodes. They have been made from polycarbonate plastic (LEXAN) and, more recently, from <b>Noryl.</b> Propeller sensors make use of Cartesian coordinate system and provide orthogonal velocity components in the horizontal plane. The measured coordinates need only be rotated in the conventional directions east-west and north-south.|$|E

50|$|The main {{components}} of a VMCM are its two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors, that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate compass, which permits to evaluate the direction of flux, providing {{the angle of the}} Y axis with respect to the magnetic North.A microprocessor rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, {{at the end of the}} record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette magnetic tape. Other components of the system are a bearing retainer, an end cap, an outer bearing race, a ball retainer and bearing balls, an encoder and an epoxy or <b>Noryl</b> plastic disk with four magnets, pressure window, an aluminum disk, two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically on a printed circuit ring, a hub, and a shaft with inner races machined in it. The function of the magnetodiodes is detecting the rotation of the propeller sensors.|$|E
5000|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{are interesting}} {{because they can}} [...] "microphase separate" [...] to form periodic nanostructures, as in the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right. The polymer is known as Kraton and is used for shoe soles and adhesives. Owing to the microfine structure, the transmission electron microscope or TEM was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with osmium tetroxide to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by living polymerization so that the blocks are almost monodisperse, so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains. The spacing between domains has been confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering, a technique which gives information about microstructure.Since most polymers are incompatible with one another, forming a block polymer will usually result in phase separation, and the principle has been widely exploited since {{the introduction of the}} SBS block polymers, especially where one of the block is highly crystalline. One exception to the rule of incompatibility is the material <b>Noryl,</b> where polystyrene and polyphenylene oxide or PPO form a continuous blend with one another.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reveals that}} the already known {{improved}} properties of the thermoplastic-liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) blends can be further improved substantially over the corre-sponding noncompatibilized counterparts by using a reactive in situ type compatibilizer, the styrene-glycidyl methacrylate (SG) copolymer. This SG copolymer has been demon-strated in this article {{to be an effective}} reactive compatibilizer to improve the processability, heat deflection temperature, and mechanical properties of Noryl/LCP blends. The epoxy functional groups of the SG copolymer can react with the end groups of PPO (in <b>Noryl)</b> and LCP. The in situ-formed SG-g-LCP copolymer tends to reside along the interface of Noryl-LCP and reduces the interfacial tension during melt processing. The resultant LCP fibers in the <b>Noryl</b> matrix of the compatibilized blends have a higher aspect ratio because the fibers become finer, longer, and tend to form lamellate domains with a greater interphase contact area than those from the noncompatibilized blends.

40|$|Polymers and ceramic {{materials}} {{are used as}} substrates in the fabrication of electroless copper plated components for electronic devices. These substrates must be pretreated prior to electroplating to facilitate good adhesion between the substrate and the metal coating. There {{are a variety of}} established pre-treatment methods. Most of the industrial methods utilize hazardous chemistry (toxic acids), require long process times, use large amounts of waste water to remove chemicals, and require high temperatures. The aim of this project was to investigate the ability of power ultrasound to pre-treat these materials by utilizing non-hazardous chemistry, lower temperatures and short process times. In this project four different substrates were investigated; Epoxy resin, ABS, <b>Noryl</b> and Ceramic. The materials were treated with ultrasound under four different conditions (40 °C, 0 °C, freezing before pre-treatment, and the addition of solvent to the bath). The changes on the surfaces were monitored with several analysis techniques including: Weight loss, Contact angle measurement, Roughness measurement, Gloss meter determination, SEM surface analysis and adhesion testing. The optimum power setting for the epoxy material was found to be between 50 W and 80 W. In addition the most effective surface modification conditions for the Epoxy material was found to be achieved by lowering the temperature to 0 °C during the sonication processes and utilizing a power setting of 50 W. The most effective parameter to employ to surface-modify ABS material was found to be utilizing 5 % gamma-caprolactone solution with a power setting of 50 W at 0 °C. The most effective parameters to employ to surface modify <b>Noryl</b> material was found to be by utilizing 5 % ethylene glycol solution with a power setting of 50 W at 0 °C. Of the four tested materials, the ceramic material was least effected by sonication. The best results for this material were obtained with the frozen samples which were then treated with 50 W power at 0 °C. Solvents results did not shown significant results as those obtained with frozen samples.

40|$|Many polymer {{materials}} compositions consist of blends of polymers and copolymers 1 to obtain optimal properties. Some {{of them are}} non-miscible, some have limited miscibility, some are miscible at the molecular level, and some are grafted co-polymers, such as high impact polystyrene and ABS. <b>Noryl</b> 2, 3, the blend of polystyrene and 2, 6 dimethylphenylene oxide and the blends of poly(vinyl chloride) [PVC] with poly(methyl methacrylate) 4 [PMMA] are typical examples {{of some of the}} commercially used blends. Important in polymer compositions are limited miscibilities in polymers like the carboxylate groups in carboxyl substituted olefin polymers, commercially known as ionomers 5. The miscibility depends substantially on the efficient interaction of the functional groups of the polymers. At the molecular level the interaction of polymer molecule A with polymer molecule B, the most efficient miscibility in blends seems to be achieved by direct hydrogen bonding or acid/base interaction 6.

40|$|Purpose – To {{build on}} the results {{detailed}} in the previous paper where it was shown that sonochemical surface modification could be achieved in water. This paper aims to {{look at one of}} the factors affecting sonochemical surface modification, namely the ultrasonic source to sample distance. Design/methodology/approach – Ultrasound was applied through deionized water for the surface modification of three materials: a high Tg PCB laminate (Isola 370 HR), a polyphenylene ether – polystyrene polymer (<b>Noryl</b> HM 4025) and an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene/polycarbonate (Cycolac S 705). The efficacy of the treatment was determined by weight loss, scanning electron microscopy, contact angle, roughness and tape testing after electroless copper plating. Findings – The study confirmed, and extended the previous findings, that a range of substrates could be sonochemically surface modified in water, even though in this work the ultrasonic horn had a larger tip size and produced a different ultrasonic intensity. Although the results were material dependent, the ultrasonic source to sample distance was found to be critical. Employing a spacing of 5 ?mm produced samples which generally exhibited higher weight loss, roughness and significant changes in surface morphology than when a distance of 25 ?mm was utilized. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates that sonochemical surface modification has the potential to be a much more sustainable surface modification process than those currently employed in the electronics industry. However, to achieve this outcome acoustic cavitation and factors affecting it (such as source to sample distance) must be understood so that suitable equipment can be built...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{materials}} have large use in many components acting as impact energy absorbers. These components {{have to be}} designed {{on the basis of}} the kind of impact, of the involved energy amount and of the maximum admissible load. The choice of the most suitable density for the selected type of foam is based on stress-strain behaviour, obtained by means of experimental tests and/or models. Only a few micro-mechanical models, as the Gibson model, take into account the density effects. These models could result quite complex to manage because of the need of, at least, a rough analysis of the actual foam structure. Conversely, most of the models used for numerical simulations are phenomenological models and have simple parameter identification based on fitting of experimental data, but they do not account for density effect. Experimental uniaxial compression tests performed for several types of foams, namely EPP, PUR (Bayfill EA), EPS and PPO/PS (<b>Noryl</b> GTX), at different density levels are used in order to identify, with an optimisation procedure devoted to the minimisation of the fitting residual evaluated by the least square method, the parameters of four cellular solid models. The considered models are four: the Gibson model [Gibson LJ, Ashby MF. Cellular solids. Structure and properties. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1997], the Rusch model [Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of flexible foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1969; 13 : 2297 - 311; Rusch KC. Energy-absorbing characteristics of foamed polymers. J Appl Polym Sci 1969; 14 : 1133 - 47; Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of brittle foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1970; 14 : 1263 - 73], a modified version of the Gibson model and a new empirical model. The third and fourth models have been developed in order to better fit the experimental stress-strain curve. The obtained improvements in terms of weighted sum of the squared errors are shown. The experimental data are a good representation of the typical behaviour of these kinds of foams and can be useful for the validation of models and the comparison of their performance. Moreover the large basis of experimental data for different types of foams at different densities could be used for the analysis of the influence of the density on the model parameters. Explicit empirical formulations are proposed to express the dependency of the phenomenological model parameters on the foam density. These relationships permit the identification of whatever density foam derived from the same solid material and with the same micro-structure by means of a minimum set of experimental tests. At the same time the availability of a large quantity of experimental data is helpful to reach a higher level of confidence in the model parameter values. Finally the identified parameters vs. density laws for the considered types of foam could be used in order to assist the design of a given absorber and to find the optimum density for the specific application. Closed form expression for the specific energy W and the efficiency E can be obtained, based on the resulting identified phenomenological model...|$|E
