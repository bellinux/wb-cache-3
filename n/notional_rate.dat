40|$|The {{non-financial}} defined contribution or notional model combines pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financing with {{a pension}} formula {{that depends on}} the amount contributed and the return on it which is determined by the <b>notional</b> <b>rate.</b> The account is called notional because no pot of pension fund money exists as the system is PAYG financed. When the individual reaches the retirement age the accumulated capital is converted into an annuity that takes into account the life expectancy of the individual, the indexation of pensions and the technical interest rate, as in classical Financial Defined Contribution Systems (FDC). However, NDC systems cannot provide automatic financial equilibrium, as compared to the FDC systems, which are in equilibrium by construction. The aim of this paper is twofold: to show to what extent the liquidity and solvency indicators of NDC systems are affected by fluctuations in the economic, financial and demographic conditions; and to explore the issue of introducing an optimal automatic balancing mechanism into the notional model to re-establish the financial equilibrium. We present a 4 overlapping generations model with dynamic evolution of the main parameters affecting the pension equilibrium. New entrants and salary trajectories are stochastic processes. Under this framework we study the liquidity and solvency ratios. The liquidity ratio compares the income from contributions with the expenditure on pensions (cash-flow point of view). The solvency ratio compares the current liabilities of the system with the Contribution Asset, a measure that is used in Sweden in order to calculate the PAYG assets. We show that, in the steady state, the pension system is both balanced and solvent. However, under a dynamic framework the pension system is not balanced or solvent in general. With this in mind, automatic balance mechanisms (ABM) are introduced, through a correction of the <b>notional</b> <b>rate,</b> in order to re-establish the liquidity and/or solvency of the system. The <b>notional</b> <b>rate</b> of the system, which affects both pensioners and contributors, is altered by some time-dependent variable which is derived in order to attain a particular liquidity or solvency level. The goodness of the ABM is assessed by means of the variance of the new <b>notional</b> <b>rate,</b> as participants in a public pension system would prefer a less volatile return on their accumulated fund or less variation in the indexation of pensions. The study of the variance uses Monte Carlo simulation. The main conclusion is that the sum of the variance of the <b>notional</b> <b>rate</b> affected by the ABM based on the solvency ratio is lower than the sum of the variance of the <b>notional</b> <b>rate</b> affected by the ABM based on the liquidity ratio in all different scenarios...|$|E

The volatility of this return may introduce a pension adequacy problem in the system and therefore guarantees may be needed.

40|$|Notional Defined Contribution {{pension schemes}} are defined {{contribution}} plans which are pay-as-you-go financed. From a design viewpoint, the countries where NDCs {{have been implemented}} cannot guarantee sustainability due to the choice of notional return paid to the contributions and the indexation rate paid to pensions. We study how the scheme should be designed to achieve liquidity and solvency with a limited set of assumptions in a continuous overlapping generations model that increases traceability of the results. The adequacy and actuarial fairness are also jointly studied in the numerical example for the population of Belgium.

An interesting attempt to solve this problem is to maintain the pay as you go mechanism but moving to a defined contribution system (notional accounts or NDC schemes).

40|$|The public pension {{world has}} seen two {{innovations}} in recent years. One is {{the emergence of}} notional defined contribution (NDC) plans. The other is the introduction of automatic adjustment mechanisms to help keep pension systems solvent when the economy weakens. This brief looks at the Swedish system to demonstrate how NDCs work and evaluates the work­ings of the automatic adjustment mechanism {{in the wake of the}} 2008 financial crisis. Sweden passed reform legislation in 1994 that in­troduced a partially-funded NDC plan. 1 The arrange­ment is conceptually similar to a defined contribution plan in that contributions are accumulated in indi­vidual accounts, but different in that the accounts are not fully funded and may be financed entirely on a pay-as-you-go basis. In this setting, the rate of return credited on the account assets is based on a rule rath­er than on actual returns. The Swedish system uses a <b>notional</b> interest <b>rate</b> equal to the rate of growth of average earnings. However, if a calculation suggests a potential deficit, the <b>notional</b> interest <b>rate</b> is auto­matically reduced through a “brake” mechanism. The recent financial crisis has highlighted ways in which the brake mechanism could be improved. This brief proceeds as follows. The first section describes Sweden’s NDC plan. The second describes the Swedish brake mechanism. The third describes two problems with the current adjustment procedure: 1) it creates the likelihood of large shocks for retir­ees; and 2) while disadvantaging retirees, it tends to advantage workers. The fourth section presents pos­sible fixes for the current problems. The final section concludes that the Swedish NDC plan could function more effectively with modest changes to the brake mechanism. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the partial {{equilibrium}} {{functioning of the}} shortterm credit market in the Eighteenth-century Lisbon and its response to three major events: massive gold inflows from Brazil, a catastrophic destruction of capital caused by the 1755 earthquake and the enactment of a 5 % legal ceiling on interest rates 1757. We build a time series for the market interest rate, and a regression shows money stock and real estates as two significant variables. Interest rates were affected negatively by the former and positively by the latter. We conclude that changes in the money stock tended to operate through the supply of loanable funds. The wealth effect, measured by the stock of real estate, operated over demand and tended {{to be the most}} significant effect among several other possible countervailing effects (e. g., the impact of wealth effects on supply, the informational effects of collaterals). The inflow of gold clearly generated a liquidity which by itself explained the downward trend in interest rates up until around 1780. However, the huge variations experienced by the stock of capital after the earthquake also explains the steadiness of interest rates in a period when the inflow of money started to recede. For the whole period during which the 5 % ceiling on interest rates was in force we do not find any evidence to confirm the existence of disequilibrium credit rationing: the <b>notional</b> interest <b>rate</b> predicted by our model was very close to the 5 % legal ceiling...|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{reassess}} QT interval rate correction.  BACKGROUND—The QT interval {{is strongly}} and {{inversely related to}} heart rate. To compare QT intervals between different subjects with different heart rates requires {{the application of a}} QT interval rate correction formula. To date these formulae have inappropriately assumed a fixed relation between QT interval and heart rate. An alternative method of QT interval rate correction that makes no assumptions about the QT interval-heart rate relation is needed.  PROPOSAL—A QT heart rate correction method should maintain or accentuate biological QT interval variability, should totally remove the dependence of the rate corrected QT interval on heart rate, and should be applicable over a wide range of conditions {{with a wide range of}} differing autonomic states.  METHODS—QT intervals were obtained at rest and during exercise from subjects expected to have different QT intervals and different QT interval-heart rate relations. A linear regression line was obtained from the exercise test data, and the QT interval at a <b>notional</b> heart <b>rate</b> of 60  and 0  beats/min, termed the QT 60 interval, and the QT y intercept obtained by back calculation.  RESULTS—QT 60 and QT y intercept values were prolonged in heart failure compared with either left ventricular hypertrophy or controls. There was no relation between heart rate and either QT 60 or QT y intercept CONCLUSIONS—This new physiologically based method of correcting QT interval for heart rate removes the dependence of the corrected QT interval on heart rate, and maintains biological differences.    Keywords: QT interval; heart rate correctio...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study was}} conducted with the objective of determining cross-sectional and strength and stiffness properties of I-shaped joists subjected to charring under ISO 834 standard fire exposure. The outcome of this work should be design parameters in terms of Eurocode 5 (EN 1995 - 1 - 2) for I-joists in bending where the tension flange is on the fire exposed side of the joist; these are the time of start of charring, charring depths and modification factors for strength. The I-joists are assumed to be integrated in floor assemblies consisting of joists, linings made of gypsum plasterboard or wood-based panels, cavities completely filled with batt-type rock or glass fibre insulation, and a decking. Heat transfer analyses were performed using SAFIR. This software permits us to study the effect of the lining falling off at specified times that are known from full-scale testing or using the criterion of insufficient penetration length of fasteners into unburnt wood. For the determination of the notional charring depth in the flange and the modification factors of the whole cross-section, a computer program CSTFire, written as a Visual Basic macro embedded in Excel, was developed, using the temperature output from the heat transfer calculations and relative strength and stiffness values given by EN 1995 - 1 - 2, i. e. compressive strength, tensile strength and moduli of elasticity in compression and tension. The notional charring depth is determined such that the notional residual cross-section of the flange remains rectangular and the section modulus of the I-section is unchanged. The effect of various parameters on the <b>notional</b> charring <b>rate</b> is shown, such as charring phases (i. e. a distinction is made regarding whether the I-section is initially unprotected, protected by a lining, or unprotected after failure of the lining), flange dimensions and depth of cross-section. Modification factors for bending and shear strength are shown as functions of the notional charring depth for different charring phases. In order to simplify these relationships, simple expressions are given for increased user-friendliness and code specification. The effect of the state of stress on the fire-exposed side is demonstrated, however, it remains unclear to what extent bending moment resistance at intermediate supports can be utilized.

40|$|The stomatal {{response}} to air humidity has been recently reinterpreted {{in the sense}} that stomata seem to respond to the rate of transpiration rather to air humidity per se. Monteith suggested that the relation between canopy stomatal resistance r(s) and canopy transpiration E can be written as r(s) /r(sn) = 1 /(1 -E/E(x)), where r(sn) is a notional minimum canopy resistance, obtained by extrapolation to zero transpiration, and E(x) is a <b>notional</b> maximum transpiration <b>rate,</b> obtained by extrapolation to infinite resistance. The exact significance and possible values of these parameters have not been specified yet. In this study we show that this apparently new relation can be inferred from the common Jarvis-type models, in which canopy stomatal resistance is expressed {{in the form of a}} minimal resistance multiplied by a product of independent stress functions (each one representing the influence of one factor). This is made possible by replacing leaf water potential in the corresponding stress function by its dependence on transpiration and soil water potential. The matching of the two formulations (Monteith and Jarvis) allows one to express the two parameters r(sn) and E(x) in terms of the functions and parameters making up the Jarvis-type models; r(sn) appears to depend upon solar radiation and soil water potential : it represents the canopy stomatal resistance when the leaf water potential is equal to the soil water potential, all other conditions being equal. E(x) depends upon soil water potential and represents the maximum flux of water which can be extracted from the soil by the canopy. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss some of the {{implications}} of policies, practices and new “non-equilibrium” management approaches in mobile grassland management. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – The author takes an actor-oriented perspective on the narrative of land-use practices, <b>notional</b> sustainable stocking <b>rates</b> and the problematic of state policy interventions in local context. The paper is based on two years in the field on a bilateral aid-funded grassland management project at Xing'an League, Inner Mongolia and follow-up among selected informants. FINDINGS – The constitution of grasslands “degradation” is in fact contested by resource users. Most grassland scientists, Party and Government officials in China have tended to associate ethnic “minority” mobile pastoralists with destructive cultural practices that, they argue, have led to ecological decline on the steppes. This argument is integral to the “degradation narrative” that underpins the discourse on grassland science. The conventional bio-ecology emphasis on species dominance (growth-form), in fact says little about the extent of anthropogenic impacts on above-ground biomass and whether these factors have been the cause of degradation. The paper suggests that greater consideration is given to specific changes in human activity, climatic and plant productivity over time and space, based on endogenous, flexible seasonal estimates. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – Although presenting challenges to conventional grassland science based on endogenous experiences and herder practices, it may have specific geopolitical limits to more general scaling-up in different contexts. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – The paper discusses new modalities of non-equilibrium grassland management, inverting normative top-down approaches to controlling environmental degradation, livestock distribution and stocking rates. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS – The paper suggests rethinking the use of customary practices, vernacular knowledge and the social organisation of herders in the design of sustainable grassland management. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – The paper may be valuable to practitioners, rural development planners, funders and researchers interested in the use of integrated, cross-disciplinary, new ecological knowledge in grassland management.
