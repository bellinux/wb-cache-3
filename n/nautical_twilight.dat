25|$|Stockholm's {{location}} {{just south}} of the 60th latitude means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter— about six hours, while in June and the first half of July, the nights are relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Around the Summer solstice the sun never reaches further below the horizon than 7.3 degrees. This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set, because it does not get any darker than <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight.</b> Also, when looking straight up towards the zenith, few stars are visible after the sun has gone down. This is {{not to be confused with}} the midnight sun, which occurs north of the Arctic Circle, around 7 degrees farther north.|$|E
2500|$|At about 04:30, {{just before}} <b>Nautical</b> <b>Twilight,</b> the {{flotilla}} broke into two; {{one group of}} three LCAs continued on the same bearing toward Vasterival (Orange One Beach) and four LCAs followed MGB 312 to a new bearing starboard along the coast to Quiberville (Orange Two Beach). Approximately [...] separated the Orange beaches. Two Spitfires flew overhead and fired on the lighthouse which straight away doused its light. Anti-aircraft fire went aloft along the coast as additional planes strafed the Hess Battery, creating a distraction which covered {{the approach of the}} landing-craft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{climate is}} mild for its {{northern}} latitude, {{due to the}} North Atlantic Current which flows northwards from mainland Norway up {{the west coast of}} Spitsbergen. It also receives heat from the predominant high pressure fronts which bring warm air from the Atlantic to the Barents Sea. The town has its lowest temperatures during February, at an average [...] and a high average of [...] during July. The sun does not set from 18 April to 24 August (midnight sun) and does not rise from 25 October to 17 February (polar night). But there is no <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> between December 11 to December 30, it only has 24 hour of darkness called astronomical twilight. The site is sufficiently isolated that {{it can be used to}} measure the background pollution levels in the high Arctic troposphere.|$|E

2500|$|Aberdeen {{features}} an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb). Aberdeen has far milder winter temperatures {{than one might}} expect for its northern location, although statistically it is the coldest city in the UK. During the winter, especially throughout December, {{the length of the}} day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 41 minutes between sunrise and sunset at winter solstice. As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 55 minutes between sunrise and sunset. During {{this time of the year}} marginal <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> lasts the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year will be typically hovering around [...] during the day in most of the urban area, though nearer [...] directly on the coast, and around [...] in the westernmost suburbs, illustrating the cooling effect of the North Sea during summer. In addition, from June onward skies are more overcast than in April/May, as reflected in a lower percentage of possible sunshine (the percentage of daylight hours that are sunny). These factors render summer to be very temperate by European standards.|$|E
2500|$|In the Jubilee plan, the LCAs for 2nd Division were {{to touch}} down just before dawn. The {{lowering}} point for the landing ships was [...] from the shore. Here too was an added complication, because naval planners wished to avoid the danger of flotillas colliding, becoming mixed together and confused. Therefore, zero hour was to be {{half an hour later}} for the inner than the outer beaches. At about 03:00 the LCAs were to be lowered from their landing ships. Once the LCAs were away, the ships would then sail back to England. The LCAs would make the two-hour journey to the shore. On 19 August, <b>Nautical</b> <b>Twilight</b> was 04:31 and sunrise 05:50. The four outer landings would touch down at 04:50 and the two inner flotillas of LCAs would touch down half an hour later. After disembarking their troops the LCAs, along with other landing craft types, were to withdraw away from the coast a few miles to an area protected by a smoke screen designated as the [...] "boat pool." [...] Here the landing craft would wait until ordered to re-embark the assault force {{at the end of the}} operation. The LCAs were to make their own way back. Despite the plan, the raid soon began to go wrong.|$|E
2500|$|The LCA type {{was confronted}} with many {{challenges}} on D-Day; some presented by the Neptune plan, some by the enemy defences, and others by the weather. The initial seaborne assault on the Normandy coast broke with previous Allied practice, {{in that it was}} made in daylight. The invasion could occur 6 June because the date satisfied certain preliminary requirements. Of particular concern to landing craft, H-Hour was fixed forty minutes after <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight.</b> H-Hour was also fixed for three hours before high-water mark. The tide in the English Channel rises from west to east (high water in Utah area occurs approximately 40 minutes before it occurs in the Sword area), and so some difference in H-Hour were planned among the assault areas in order to provide the initial assault landing craft the full advantage of a rising tide. Among the many variable concerns to be considered by the planners was whether to land below, among, or above the line of Element 'C' obstacles. The sea conditions at many places along the coast (6' waves and [...] currents) were just at the outside operational limit of the LCA. The setting of the Transportation Area [...] from shore presented an additional complication for LCAs operating in the Western Task Force Area in these condition.|$|E
40|$|Artist Statement My {{craft work}} and {{paintings}} reflect my life experiences and personal curiosities, particularly {{those associated with}} the natural world. Every day, I am bombarded with a constant flow of visual impressions and ephemeral experiences. There are some that demand attention {{by virtue of their}} sheer power, such as the repetition of line in a plowed field, the color of <b>nautical</b> landscape at <b>twilight,</b> or the intelligent behavior of crows. Like a tourist who buys a souvenir to capture a moment, I try to capture instances of profound experiences. I interpret these moments through a process-oriented approach to media. Fiber, glass, and paint are the vehicles through which I explore the natural world. In these media, I layer materials. The first layer of media establishes a foundation, the next layer affects perceptions of the first, and additional layers add to the visual experience. As each piece reaches completion, the composition is the sum of all parts. Coupled with my understanding of layering as a creative process is my acknowledgment that life’s layered experiences shape me as a person...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> {{begins when}} there is enough {{illumination}} for sailors to distinguish the horizon at sea but the sky is too dark to perform outdoor activities (except with artificial light). Formally, <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> begins when the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning. The sky becomes light enough to clearly distinguish it from land and water. Nautical dawn marks the start of <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> which lasts until civil dawn.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> has {{military}} considerations as well. The initialisms BMNT (begin morning <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> i.e. nautical dawn) and EENT (end evening <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> i.e. nautical dusk) {{are used}} and considered when planning military operations. A military unit may treat BMNT and EENT with heightened security, e.g. by [...] "standing to", {{in which everyone}} assumes a defensive position. This is partially due to tactics {{dating back to the}} French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763), when combatants on both sides would launch attacks at nautical dawn or dusk.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{established}} and widely accepted subcategories of twilight: civil twilight (brightest), <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> and astronomical twilight (darkest).|$|E
5000|$|Morning <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> begins (nautical dawn) {{when the}} {{geometric}} {{center of the}} sun is 12° below the horizon {{in the morning and}} ends when the geometric center of the sun is 6° below the horizon in the morning.

50|$|At this {{latitude}} the sun {{is visible}} for 24 hours, 0 minutes during the summer solstice and <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> during the winter solstice.|$|E
5000|$|Morning civil {{twilight}} begins when the geometric {{center of the}} sun is 6° below the horizon and ends at sunrise. [...] Evening {{civil twilight}} begins at sunset and ends when the geometric center of the sun reaches 6° below the horizon. In the United States' military, the initialisms BMCT (begin morning civil twilight, i.e. civil dawn) and EECT (end evening civil twilight, i.e. civil dusk) are {{used to refer to}} the start of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil twilight, respectively. Civil dawn is preceded by morning <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> and civil dusk is followed by evening <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the sun {{has also}} set for these altitudes {{at the end of}} <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> the {{intensity}} of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.|$|E
50|$|At {{the winter}} {{solstice}} within the polar circle, twilight can extend through solar noon at latitudes below 72.561° (72°33′43″) for civil twilight, 78.561° (78°33′43″) for <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> and 84.561° (84°33′43″) for astronomical twilight.|$|E

5000|$|At {{nautical}} dusk, the Sun is 12 {{degrees below}} the horizon in the evening. It {{marks the end of}} <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> which begins at civil dusk. At this time, objects are less distinguishable, and stars and planets are becoming more brilliant.|$|E
50|$|During the {{nautical}} {{polar night}} period, {{there is no}} trace of daylight, except around midday. It happens {{when there is no}} <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> and only astronomical twilight occurs at the solar culmination. <b>Nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> happens when the Sun is between six and twelve degrees below the horizon. There is a location at the horizon around midday with more light than others because of refraction. During nautical night, the Sun is lower than 12° below the horizon, so nautical polar night is limited to latitudes above 78° 34', which is exactly 12° within the polar circle, or 11.5° from the pole. Alert, Nunavut, the northernmost settlement in Canada and the world, experiences this from late November to mid-January.|$|E
50|$|A civil {{twilight}} {{period of about}} two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset, a <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset.|$|E
50|$|Twilight {{is defined}} {{according}} to the solar elevation angle θs, which is {{the position of the}} geometric center of the sun relative to the horizon. There are three established and widely accepted subcategories of twilight: civil twilight (nearest the horizon), <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> and astronomical twilight (farthest from the horizon).|$|E
5000|$|Nautical dawn is {{the moment}} when the {{geometric}} center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning. It is preceded by morning astronomical twilight and followed by morning <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight.</b> Nautical dusk {{is the moment}} when the geometric center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the evening. It marks the beginning of evening astronomical twilight and the end of evening <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight.</b> Before nautical dawn and after nautical dusk, sailors cannot navigate via the horizon at sea. At nautical dawn and nautical dusk, the human eye finds it difficult, if not impossible, to discern traces of illumination near the sunset or sunrise point of the horizon ("first light” after nautical dawn but before civil dawn and [...] "nightfall" [...] after civil dusk but before nautical dusk).|$|E
50|$|After sunset, civil {{twilight}} sets in, and ends when the Sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This {{is followed by}} <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight,</b> when the Sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes astronomical twilight, defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the Sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.|$|E
50|$|Oslo's climate {{used to be}} {{described}} as a humid continental climate, but due to recent warming (epecially in winter), the climate is now almost exactly at the intersection of a humid continental and temperate oceanic climate. Because of the city's northern latitude, daylight varies greatly, from more than 18 hours in midsummer, when it never gets completely dark at night (no darker than <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight),</b> to around 6 hours in midwinter.|$|E
50|$|When the sun {{has just}} set, the {{brightness}} of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630 nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Star and planet sights are {{normally}} taken during <b>nautical</b> <b>twilight</b> at dawn or dusk, while both the heavenly bodies {{and the sea}} horizon are visible. There {{is no need to}} use shades or to distinguish the lower limb as the body appears as a mere point in the telescope. The moon can be sighted, but it appears to move very fast, appears to have different sizes at different times, and sometimes only the lower or upper limb can be distinguished due to its phase.|$|E

50|$|Twilight {{is divided}} into three {{segments}} according to how far the sun is below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°.
