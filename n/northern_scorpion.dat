50|$|Scorpions {{are found}} on all major land masses except Antarctica. Scorpions {{did not occur}} {{naturally}} in Great Britain, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand {{and some of the}} islands in Oceania, but now have been accidentally introduced in some of these places by human trade and commerce. The greatest diversity of scorpions in the Northern Hemisphere {{is to be found in}} regions between the latitudes 23째 N and 38째 N. Above these latitudes, the diversity decreases, with the northernmost natural occurrence of scorpions being the <b>northern</b> <b>scorpion</b> Paruroctonus boreus at Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada 50째 N. Five colonies of scorpions (Euscorpius flavicaudis) have established themselves in Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey in the United Kingdom. This small population has been resident since the 1860s, having probably arrived with imported fruit from Africa. This scorpion species is small and completely harmless to humans. At just over 51째 N, this marks the northernmost limit where scorpions live in the wild.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} in previous studies that Hemprich long-eared bats (Otonycteris hemprichii) are frequently stung during predation attacks on scorpions. Although a highly toxic and dangerous prey, the scorpion toxicity does not kill the bat. The sting, however, does seem to inflict {{a great amount of}} pain. Here, we examine the role of bat vision in predator-prey interactions between a similar bat species, pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) and <b>northern</b> <b>scorpions</b> (Paruroctonus boreus). We address the question: do bats use visual information provided by moonlight to plan attacks on dangerous prey? We predicted that under moonlit conditions, pallid bats would plan attacks on scorpion prey, therefore, being stung less often. Our experiments took place in a flight room in both simulated moonlight and complete darkness. The interactions were recorded live by three high-definition cameras mounted in three separate corners of the interaction arena...|$|R
