40|$|The oceanographical cruises of the R. S. MARION-DUFRESNE to Bouvet, Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, Heard Islands {{and on the}} seamounts Ob 2 ̆ 7, Lena, Kara Dag and Skiff, from 1974 to 1982,complemented by the {{observations}} made on board of several trawlers, have made possible to compare the different species of Nototheniidae and Channichthyidae which occur {{in this part of}} the Southern Ocean and draw some ecological conclusions : relations with the environment, abundance and geographical distribution. First of all, it is noteworthy to point out the absence of Channichthyidae around Marion and Crozet Islands and their presence around Bouvet, Kerguelen and Heard. The species <b>Notothenia</b> <b>squamifrons</b> is characterized by a noticeable ubiquity and a power of adaptation to various biotopes which is not reached by other species. Champsocephalus gunnari seems to be a tracer of lightly colder water masses and its abundance is directly related with the high productive areas of zooplankton...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA primary {{objective}} of the ICEFISH 2004 cruise was to collect and study notothenioid fishes from remote localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Nearly 1 month was devoted to bottom trawling for fishes on the shelf and upper slope (to 1, 000 m) areas around Shag Rocks, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvetøya. The focus was on the latter two locations, because their faunas are more poorly known. Eight species were collected at Shag Rocks with Patagonotothen guntheri most abundant; 17 at South Georgia with Lepidonotothen nudifrons, L. larseni and Gobionotothen gibberifrons most abundant; 13 at the South Sandwich Islands with L. larseni, L. nudifrons and G. gibberifrons most abundant; and 11 at Bouvetøya with L. larseni, Macrourus holotrachys and L. squamifrons most abundant. Ten new locality records were established: Shag Rocks (1), South Georgia (1), South Sandwich Islands (5), South Sandwich Trench at 5, 350 m (1) and Bouvetøya (2). Total known demersal fish diversity on the shelf and upper slope at Shag Rocks/South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvetøya is 42, 31 and 17 species, respectively. To examine population structure in the four most abundant notothenioids at Bouvetøya (L. larseni, L. <b>squamifrons,</b> <b>Notothenia</b> coriiceps and Chaenocephalus aceratus), we examined the ND 2 portion of mitochondrial DNA. Chaenocephalus aceratus, N. coriiceps and L. larseni exhibited no significant genetic differentiation in comparison with samples from localities in the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, L. squamifrons showed significant genetic differentiation between the South Shetlands and Bouvetøya populations (F ST = 0. 189, P = 0. 015). Thus, these data combined with previous studies of two other notothenioids suggest that {{five of the six}} notothenioid species at Bouvetøya are not genetically differentiated from other localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The location of Bouvetøya within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the long (1 – 2 years) pelagic stages of the notothenioids at Bouvetøya may be at least partly responsible for this genetic homogeneit...|$|R
