Previously, a 10 -nm-thick dry bi-layer dielectric based on aluminium oxide (AlOx) prepared by UV-ozone oxidation and <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8 PA) monolayer prepared by vacuum evaporation {{has been developed}} for organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) based on pentacene. Here we compare such OTFTs to similar transistors that incorporate ALD-AlOx/C 8 PA bi-layer. In addition, a 12. 9 -nm-thick ALD-AlOx exposed to UV-ozone for 60 minutes was incorporated into OTFTs based on dinaphtho[2, 3 -b: 2 ', 3 '-f]thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene (DNTT) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{deposition}} of <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> on aluminum oxide was studied. The substrate was pretreated {{in order to}} achieve a root-mean-square roughness of < 1 nm, a hydroxyl fraction of 30 %, and a thickness of approximately 170 nm. It was proven using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) that, rather than a monolayer, an organic multilayer was formed. The growth mechanism was identified as a Stranski-Krastanov one. It was also shown that the use of AFM, probing the surface topography, is essential for a reliable quantification and interpretation of data obtained with XPS. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTiO 2 {{nanoparticles}} with {{an average}} diameter of less than 10 nm were prepared via a non-hydrolytic sol-gel route in a TiCl 4 -diisopropyl ether-CH 2 Cl 2 system. After modification with <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (OPA) to increase their organophilic character, the TiO 2 nanoparticles were used for preparation of TiO 2 /epoxy hybrid films. Characterization by FT-IR, solid-state 13 C cross-polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) and 31 P MAS NMR techniques showed {{the preservation of the}} n-octyl groups and the presence of Ti-O-P bonds on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Hybrid films with various TiO 2 contents were prepared via a wet process and casting using CH 2 Cl 2 as a solvent. The resulting films were highly transparent. The refractive indices of TiO 2 /epoxy hybrid films at 633 nm increased monotonously from 1. 51 for the pure polymer to 1. 66 for the hybrid containing 62. 4 mass% of TiO 2 nanoparticles.

40|$|Alkyl phosphonic acids (CnPA) are {{becoming}} a material of choice for passivation of high-k oxides in organic thin-film transistors with ultra-thin gate dielectrics. A monolayer of phosphonic acid inserted between the inorganic oxide and the organic semiconductor provides two main benefits: (i) {{the density of the}} charge carrier traps associated with the surface –OH groups of the oxide is reduced because these groups act as binding sites for the organic molecules; and (ii) the low surface energy of the organic monolayer may reduce the density of defects in the subsequently deposited conjugated polymer. To date such monolayers have been assembled from solutions only. We have recently developed a vapour-phase self-assembly of <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8 PA) monolayer in vacuum that leads to a well chemisorbed monolayer of C 8 PA. When such a monolayer is attached to ~ 9 -nm thick aluminium oxide to form an ultra-thin dielectric implemented in low-voltage organic thin-film transistors based on pentacene, the transistor performance exhibits measurable changes upon alteration {{of the structure of the}} C 8 PA monolayer...|$|E
40|$|A self-assembled {{monolayer}} of <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8 PA) is prepared from vapor phase in vacuum. C 8 PA thickness corresponding to several monolayers is deposited on aluminum oxide (AlOx) and subsequently heated {{to leave a}} monolayer of chemisorbed molecules. The effect of C 8 PA deposition rate on a 15 -nm-thick, bilayer AlOx/C 8 PA dielectric and low-voltage p-channel organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) is studied. The increase in the deposition rate from 0. 1 to 7. 0 Å/s leads to increase in the field-effect mobility from 0. 039 to 0. 061 cm 2 /Vs, while the threshold voltage remains around − 1. 55 V. At the same time, the off-current is reduced from 2. 3 × 10 − 12 to 1. 3 × 10 − 12 A, the subthreshold slope is lowered from 100 to 89 mV/decade and the on/off current ratio is increased from ∼ 105 to ∼ 106. The leakage current density of AlOx is reduced from 1 × 10 − 7 to 4 × 10 − 8 A/cm 2 at 3 V when C 8 PA monolayer is added on top of it. In addition, pentacene grain size on AlOx/C 8 PA is larger than that on AlOx. The overall performance of AlOx/C 8 PA OTFTs is superior to that of AlOx OTFTs...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{the link between the}} {{structure}} of <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8 PA) monolayer implemented in low-voltage organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) based on aluminium oxide/C 8 PA/pentacene and the kinetics of the transistor bias-induced degradation. Structural changes in the vapour-deposited C 8 PA monolayer, studied by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, are induced by annealing. Changes in the threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, field-effect mobility, and the transistor on-current are measured as functions of the bias stress time and fitted with stretched exponential functions. The presence of C 8 PA molecules physisorbed to the monolayer and/or the increased disorder between the aliphatic tails results in substantial degradation of the subthreshold slope and faster reduction in normalized mobility, while slowing the degradation of the threshold voltage. The removal of all physisorbed molecules and improved order between aliphatic tails achieved via optimized post-deposition annealing leads to an improved, microscopically-less-varied interface between C 8 PA and pentacene. Consequently, the degradation of the subthreshold slope becomes negligible, the reduction in normalized mobility becomes smaller and the degradation of the threshold voltage dominates. The equilibrium value of the normalized on-current after prolonged bias stress is ~ 0. 16 regardless of the disorder in C 8 PA monolayer, indicating that even though the structure of the monolayer affects the kinetics of the transistor degradation process, the same bias stress condition ultimately leads to the same relative drop in the on-current...|$|E
40|$|Dry {{method for}} {{monolayer}} deposition of <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8 PA) {{on the surface}} of aluminium oxide (AlOx) is presented. Vacuum thermal evaporation is employed to deposit initial thickness corresponding to several C 8 PA monolayers, followed by a thermal desorption of the physisorbed C 8 PA molecules. AlOx functionalized with such C 8 PA monolayer exhibits leakage current density of ∼ 10 − 7  A/cm 2 at 3  V, electric breakdown field of ∼ 6  MV/cm, and a root-mean-square surface roughness of 0. 36  nm. The performance of low-voltage pentacene thin-film transistors that implement this dry AlOx/C 8 PA gate dielectric depends on C 8 PA desorption time. When the desorption time rises from 25 to 210  min, the field-effect mobility increases from ∼ 0. 02 to ∼ 0. 04  cm 2 /V s, threshold voltage rises from ∼− 1. 2 to ∼− 1. 4  V, sub-threshold slope decreases from ∼ 120 to ∼ 80  mV/decade, off-current decreases from ∼ 5  ×  10 − 12 to ∼ 1  ×  10 − 12  A, on/off current ratio rises from ∼ 3. 8  ×  104 to ∼ 2. 5  ×  105, and the transistor hysteresis decreases from 61 to 26  mV. These results collectively support a two stage model of the desorption process where the removal of the physisorbed C 8 PA molecules is followed by the annealing of the defect sites in the remaining C 8 PA monolayer...|$|E
40|$|<b>N-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8 PA) {{monolayer}} was self-assembled on {{aluminium oxide}} (AlOx) from vapour in vacuum, while the substrate temperature was varied between 25 and 150 °C. The capacitance, water contact angle measurement, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) confirmed the presence of C 8 PA on AlOx for all growth temperatures. However, the structural and electrical properties of such monolayers depend on their growth temperature. The minimum surface roughness of 0. 36 nm, the maximum water contact angle of 113. 5 °± 1. 4 °, the lowest leakage current density of ~ 10 - 7 A/cm 2 at 3 V, and the capacitance of 0. 43 µF/cm 2 were obtained for AlOx/C 8 PA bi-layers with C 8 PA deposited at 25 °C. The elevated temperature led to increased surface roughness, decreased water contact angle, increased leakage current, inferior molecular ordering, and lower molecular coverage; while {{the effect on the}} chemisorption of the phosphonate was minimal. Methyl and methylene FTIR vibrations associated with C 8 PA aliphatic tails exhibited similar centre-peak wavenumbers to those observed for C 8 PA monolayers assembled from solutions, presenting a viable ‘dry’ alternative to the existing solution process. The substrate temperature applied during C 8 PA self-assembly also affected the parameters of pentacene thin-film transistors with AlOx/C 8 PA gate dielectrics. The increase in the growth temperature from 25 to 150 °C decreased the field-effect mobility from 0. 060 to 0. 026 cm 2 /Vs and increased the threshold voltage from - 1. 19 to - 1. 38 V, while maintaining the off-current at or below 10 - 12 A and the subthreshold slope near 90 mV/decade...|$|E
40|$|The large-area, roll-to-roll (R 2 R) {{fabrication}} of organic thin-film circuits on plastic foils demands low-cost manufacturing and {{the integration of}} devices onto flexible plastic substrates. We have developed a fully dry process [1] to fabricate low-voltage organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) with 10 -nm thick dielectric amenable to R 2 R processing. Two commercially available polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic foils (DuPont Teijin [2]) were compared for use as possible flexible substrates. Teonex Q 65 FA features an adhesive layer on the bottom side to prevent its slippage during the R 2 R process, while Optfine PQA 1 includes a planarisation layer on the top (device) side. The PEN films were pre-annealed at 160 °C for 24 hours prior to OTFT fabrication. 160 °C is the maximum temperature used in our OTFT fabrication process and the pre-annealing should mitigate the layer-to-layer misalignment during the OTFT fabrication. Teonex Q 65 FA remained flat after the pre-annealing step, while the radius of curvature of Optfine PQA 1 changed from  17 cm to 1. 5 cm after the anneal. Consequently, we fabricated Al/AlOx/C 8 PA/DNTT/Au and Al/AlOx/DNTT/Au OTFTs on non-annealed Optfine and pre-annealed Teonex foils. Dinaphthothienothiophene (DNTT) was chosen due to its excellent air-stability {{and the addition of}} <b>n-octylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8 PA) improves its growth. 15 nm of DNTT was deposited at room temperature at rates of 0. 4 Å/s and 0. 6 Å/s on the Teonex and Optfine, respectively. The initial OTFT performance was evaluated by measuring the transfer characteristics between 0 and − 2 V and extracting the field-effect mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, etc. Bias stress was performed approximately one week after the initial measurements at a gate voltage of − 2 V while the source and drain were grounded. Referring to Table 1, one week of storage in vacuum between the initial and bias stress measurements, led to a reduction in OTFT threshold voltage and an increase in the mobility and the OFF-current. Figure 1 shows the as-fabricated OTFT parameters extracted from transfer characteristics measured at a drain voltage of − 2 V. For both PEN substrates tested, the inclusion of the C 8 PA monolayer increases field-effect mobility, ON-current and ON/OFF-current ratio and reduces subthreshold slope and OFF-current. The substrates affect OTFT performance in a mixed way. Comparing OTFTs with C 8 PA monolayer Teonex PEN has a slightly lower subthreshold slope and OFF-current than the Optfine PEN film. However, the Optfine film exhibits about a factor of three higher field-effect mobility (0. 14 cm 2 /Vs) and about an order of magnitude higher ON-current. The OTFTs on Optfine PEN substrate also appear to remain more stable after the application of bias stress in terms of mobility, even though their threshold voltage {{at the beginning of the}} bias stress was  − 0. 4 V lower than that of OTFTs fabricated on Teonex PEN. In conclusion, Teonex PEN was found to be easier to handle, since it remained flat upon heating at 160 °C. However, the AlOx/C 8 PA transistors exhibited about a factor of three lower field-effect mobility when compared to Optfine PEN OTFTs. The planarisation layer on Optfine PEN leads to improved OTFT mobility compared to Teonex PEN; however the Optfine PEN curved significantly upon heating and therefore presents a significant challenge if used as a free-standing substrate with our OTFT fabrication procedure...|$|E
