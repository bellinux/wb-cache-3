5|$|Henry Henniger, the {{president}} of Kennywood Entertainment Company, wanted a large steel coaster in the late 1980s. The park had only built wooden roller coasters in the past. The park also had a very tight layout and they were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fit it into the park. On July 27, 1990, Kennywood announced {{the name of their}} new roller coaster would be Steel Phantom and it would use the same station as Laser Loop, which it replaced. The ride opened on May 10, 1991 as the fastest and steepest steel roller coaster in the world. The inversions were a vertical loop, a Boomerang, and a corkscrew. As a result of the inversions, riders experienced more-than-usual head banging. Shortly after its debut, a trim brake was added because the coaster was going faster than it should through the inversions and riders were experiencing pain in their necks.|$|E
25|$|Yuma is {{the main}} protagonist of the story, and is in her second {{year of high school}} along with her best friend Hotaru. When she finds her first boyfriend (Takeda) she is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> react so she asks Hotaru for advice. Yuma is {{surprised}} though when it appears as if her friend is flirting with her. She cannot explain the good feeling she gets when she French kisses Hotaru or when she gets fondled, and worries that Takeda will catch her in the act. In the second volume he decides that the two should take some space apart, and Yuma comes to terms that she is in fact cheating with Hotaru. Her feelings still remain conflicted though as she does not want to hurt him so she remains as a friend. Yuma finally confesses to Hotaru in the fifth manga volume that she has feelings towards her but is rejected. She then turns to Takeda after feeling like she had been used the entire time by her.|$|E
25|$|Bette {{was now a}} very driven and {{somewhat}} spoiled Los Angeles debutante and tennis prodigy. After seeing Robin on the news, Bette vowed that she would gain his attention and favor by becoming a masked adventurer herself. Training to Olympic-levels in gymnastics and martial arts, she created the identity of Flamebird (and a costume that resembled her pre-Crisis Bat-Girl identity) and joined Titans West in hopes of catching Robin's eye. While flattered, the driven young hero was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with her obsession and avoided her, much to her dismay. After briefly giving up her heroic persona, Bette found that neither winning tennis tournaments nor achieving perfect grades in school matched the rooftop thrills of the hero biz. She attempted several times to reunite the Titans West team, most notably after a journey into the afterlife with Hawk and Dove, but was unsuccessful. Dove noted that Bette was essentially a very lonely person, basically desperate for company and contact with others. Bette again gave up her obsession with the Titans until malfunctioning former Titan Victor Stone collected her, along with all former Titans everywhere, {{in an attempt to}} protect his soul from the Justice League. Hoping this would lead to a formal invitation to rejoin the team, Bette was crushed to learn they did not need (or want) her assistance.|$|E

When asked which track they considered recording, Araya responded, [...] "Maybe 'When the Music's Over', 'Five to One', something like that." [...] A cover of Black Flag's [...] "Rise Above" [...] was suggested by Rubin, although was shelved after the band was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> arrange it musically.|$|E
500|$|In 1824, Beethoven {{redefined the}} symphony genre in his Ninth by {{introducing}} text and voice into a previously instrumental genre. His doing so sparked {{a debate on}} the future of the symphony itself. Beethoven's use of words, according to Richard Wagner, had shown [...] "the limits of purely instrumental music" [...] and marked [...] "the end of the symphony as a vital genre". Others were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> proceed—whether to emulate the Ninth by writing symphonies with choral finales, or to develop the symphony genre in a purely instrumental fashion. Eventually, musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, the symphony was seen [...] "as an all-embracing, cosmic drama that transcended the realm of sound alone".|$|E
500|$|When Tom Welling {{auditioned for}} the role he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> prepare. While waiting for his turn, he {{realized}} that the character is one thing above all else: [...] "... a high school kid ...." [...] To Welling, simply acting like he was a normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character. Welling realized that by doing that, the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen. For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk (the first actor to be cast for the show), and the network thought they had [...] "... great chemistry".|$|E

500|$|As a {{link between}} {{the end of the second}} verse, where Lennon sings [...] "I'd love to turn you on", and the start of McCartney's middle-eight, the band {{included}} a 24-bar bridge. At first, the Beatles were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fill this link section. At the conclusion of the session on 19 January, the transition consisted of a simple repeated piano chord and the voice of assistant Mal Evans counting out the bars. Evans' voice was treated with gradually increasing amounts of echo. The 24-bar bridge ended with the sound of an alarm clock triggered by Evans. Although the original intent was to edit out the ringing alarm clock when the section was filled in, it complemented McCartney's piece – which begins with the line [...] "Woke up, fell out of bed" [...] – so the decision was made to keep the sound.|$|E
500|$|... "Big Two-Hearted River", the {{concluding}} and climactic piece, details Nick's return from war. In it Nick {{knows he has}} left his needs behind; Debra Moddelmog highlights how all of the Nick storylines, {{and most of the}} others in the collection, are about a [...] "flight from pain". She believes that Gertrude Stein's definition of the Lost Generation applies to In Our Time as much, if not more so, as to The Sun Also Rises; that [...] "Nick seems to believe that the things most worth having and caring about– life, love, ideals, companions, peace, freedom– will be lost sooner or later, and he is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cope with this assurance, except through irony, bitterness, and, sometimes, wishful thinking."

[...] Billington praised Boyle, Devlin and Daldry, who had done a [...] "tremendous job in lending what might have been orthodox Olympic rituals a blast of theatrical vitality." [...] While Alexis Petridis writing for the same paper said that the lack of a [...] "gasp inducing moment" [...] spoilt the show. Jan Moir of the Daily Mail queried whether the ceremony truly reflected Britain's musical heritage and described the opening section as [...] "dull, dull, dull". [...] She asked [...] "how could anyone follow the Opening Ceremony for entertainment?", challenged [...] "the logic" [...] of clips of artists such as Bush and Bowie who had [...] "declined to appear", and said that the fashion section was [...] "dreary".|$|E

500|$|As the character's storyline progressed, {{he became}} [...] "one {{of the most}} devious {{characters}} on daytime" [...] {{as part of a}} Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge on his father. The story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> portray the blindness. He said, [...] "I didn't want to nail it on the head completely with the blindness, because I wasn't sure if the blindness was real. Signy [...] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, and I {{thought it would be a}} dishonor to that if I came too close to the mark." [...] Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers [...] "know what they're doing, and right now it would seem like Adam is instigating more...drama." [...] The actor worried whether the character's actions might lead to him becoming [...] "irredeemable", but also said he took it as a challenge to make what Adam does [...] "interesting and human".|$|E
500|$|The game's art {{director}} was Yusuke Naora, {{who had worked}} as a designer for Final Fantasy VI. With the switch into 3D, Naora realized that he needed to teach himself drawing all over again, as 3D visuals required a very different approach than 2D. With the scale and scope of the project, Naora requested and was granted a development team devoted entirely to the game's visual design. The department's duties included illustration, modeling of 3D characters, texturing, creation of environments, visual effects, and animation. Naora later defined the art style of Final Fantasy VII as [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "weird". The Shinra logo, which incorporated a kanji symbol, was drawn by Naora personally. Promotional artwork, in addition to the logo artwork, was created by Yoshitaka Amano, an artist whose association with the series went back to its inception. While he had taken a prominent role in earlier entries, Amano was unable to do so for Final Fantasy VII, due to commitments at overseas exhibitions. His logo artwork was based on Meteor: when he saw images of Meteor, he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> turn it into suitable artwork. In the end, he created multiple variations of the image, and asked staff to choose which they preferred. The green coloring represents the predominant lighting in Midgar and the color of the Lifestream, while the blue reflected the ecological themes present in the story. Its coloring directly influenced the general coloring of the game's environments.|$|E

"ven if {{the policy}} and {{rationale}} were clear and unambiguous, there is a deeper problem with motions of this sort that prevents them from attracting a broad base of support: they rely on the false (or limited) analogy implied by the word 'apartheid'. This {{is not to say}} that there are no points of comparison, for there are – just as there are in a host of other countries where minority ethnic and national groups are oppressed. Nor is it even to say that the suffering experienced by Palestinians is less than that endured by 'non-whites' in South Africa: it may or may not be (although I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do the sums). But as I have argued elsewhere: 'The validity of the analogy does not depend on a catalogue of atrocities, however appalling.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{departure}} of Farrell caused {{problems for the}} writers, as they initially were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> combine their original vision for the final episode of season six, and include a suitable tribute {{to the character of}} Jadzia Dax. The initial plan had Dukat stealing an orb of the prophets, intending to destroy it inside the wormhole. As with the final episode, Sisko and the Defiant were not at the station, but Jadzia had remained behind. She would have pursued Dukat into the wormhole and somehow died in the process. It was the manner of the death which caused problems for the writers as they wanted something suitably heroic but not clichéd. In the first draft script by Hans Beimler and Behr, which was entitled [...] "Tears of the Gods", Jadzia was killed by Dukat but managed to save the prophets in the process. Creative consultant Michael Piller felt that Jadzia's death was not a [...] "worthy send-off" [...] and felt rushed. The scene where Jadzia says goodbye to Worf was added, and Echevarria encouraged showing Jadzia dying on screen.|$|E
