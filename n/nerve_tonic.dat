40|$|We {{explain in}} detail how to expose and conduct {{electrophysiological}} recordings of synaptic responses for high (phasic) and low (tonic) output motor neurons innervating the extensor muscle in the walking leg of a crayfish. Distinct differences {{are present in the}} physiology and morphology of the phasic and <b>tonic</b> <b>nerve</b> terminals. The <b>tonic</b> axon contains many more mitochondria, enabling it to take a vital stain more intensely than the phasic axon. The tonic terminals have varicosities, and the phasic terminal is filiform. The tonic terminals are low in synaptic efficacy but show dramatic facilitated responses. In contrast, the phasic terminals are high in quantal efficacy but show synaptic depression with high frequency stimulation. The quantal output is measured with a focal macropatch electrode placed directly over the visualized nerve terminals. Both phasic and tonic terminals innervate the same muscle fibers, which suggests that inherent differences in the neurons, rather than differential retrograde feedback from the muscle, account for the morphological and physiological differentiation.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{histories}} of mild to moderate depression {{and the use of}} over the counter (OTC) St. John’s wort (St. John’s wort) during the 1990 s. In doing so it not only investigates the diagnosis and definition of mental illnesses, it also raises questions about the interface between conventional and alternative medicine. Using a variety of printed sources, including popular media articles, scientific and medical journal publications, and St. John’s wort self-help books, a number of historical themes are explored. This thesis takes issue with existing medical historical studies of depression. Firstly it is argued that they have presented progressive depression histories. Secondly, it is suggested that they have retrospectively diagnosed depression on the basis of similar symptoms. It is therefore argued that illness is specific to the time in which it exists and should be understood within its own historical timeframe. During the 1990 s standardised St. John’s wort was promoted as a natural and safe remedy. Adverts and media reports also highlighted the fact that it had a long medical history. Although this thesis establishes that the plant has been traditionally used to treat physical illnesses, it seems that a growing distrust of conventional antidepressants, combined with an established interest in alternative medicine, encouraged some lay people to use the remedy to treat mild mood disorders. It is further argued that lay people have a history of self-treating minor mental illnesses using preparatory and OTC remedies such as preparatory <b>nerve</b> <b>tonics.</b> Not only did lay people desire autonomous treatments, it also seems that standardised St. John’s wort provided a functional role as an OTC remedy. By the 1990 s the concepts of responsible self-care and self-treatment were being actively encouraged by medical authorities. Therefore this thesis reclassifies the passive mild to moderately depressed patient as an active consumer. Following an analysis of the popular media it is suggested that the 1990 s coverage of depression and its treatments was confusing. Indeed, depression and its treatment with conventional medicines and St. John’s wort were sometimes presented as part of a wider life style choice. Finally, it is argued that by the 1990 s standardised St. John’s wort received the same scientific and medical scrutiny as conventional medicines. It is therefore suggested that the remedy represents {{a situation in which the}} boundaries between conventional and alternative medicines have become increasingly indistinguishable.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{document}} the effects of recurrent inhibition on the firing times of human α-motoneurones during natural motor behaviour, a case study was performed on a deafferented patient. The fact that this subject had completely lost the large-diameter sensory afferents provided us with a unique opportunity of selectively stimulating the motor axons in the <b>nerves.</b> The <b>tonic</b> activity of single motor units (n = 21) was recorded in the extensor carpi radialis muscles while applying randomly timed antidromic electrical stimuli to the radial nerve. The peristimulus time histogram analysis showed the presence of biphasic inhibitory effects, including an early, short-lasting component followed by a longer-lasting component occurring 20 – 40 ms later. The interspike interval (ISI) during which the stimulation occurred was generally lengthened {{as compared to the}} previous ISIs. The stimulation was most effective when delivered early (20 – 30 ms) after a spike. It was also effective, although less so, when delivered {{at the end of the}} ISI (70 – 100 ms after a spike). The lengthening effect sometimes extended over one or two of the subsequent ISIs. The lengthening effect of the motor axon stimulation was followed by an excitatory-like effect, which took the form of a shortening that affected up to five ISIs after the stimulation. The biphasic inhibitory effects and the subsequent facilitatory effects are discussed in terms of the dual nature of the synaptic processes involved in the recurrent inhibitory network, the postactivation facilitation/depression processes and the mutual inhibition occurring between Renshaw cells...|$|R
40|$|Serendipity was {{recently}} voted {{the most popular}} word in the English language. From {{only a handful of}} references in the late 1950 s, a Google search today reveals nearly 8 million references (up from 3 million references a year ago).

It is typically used as synonymous with luck, chance or coincidence. Thus, nearly one in ten of the most cited scientific papers mention serendipity as contributing to breakthrough innovations (Campanario 1996). Aside from bringing us such powerful agents as aspirin, the contraceptive pill, penicillin, laughing gas, vaccination, vitamin K, amphetamine, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, quinine, insulin, sulfa drugs, valproic acid, propafenone, magainins, nitrogen mustard, nitroglycerin, warfarin, the smallpox vaccine and cloretazine, it produced Scotchgard, Teflon, Velcro, Nylon, the Post-it Note, Kodak’s Weekender camera, the technology behind the HP Inkjet printer (based on seeing a coffee percolator at work), electromagnetism, photography, dynamite, the phonograph, X-rays, radioactivity, and even Ivory Soap, liquorice allsorts and Coca Cola (patented, in 1886, as ‘Pemberton’s French Wine Coca’ for medicinal purposes, as a <b>nerve</b> and <b>tonic</b> stimulant and a possible cure for headaches). In sum, the proposition that the process of discovery has a distinct logic may have been vastly overstated (Simontan 2004 : 7). Yet, being what we are – fallible human beings with a penchant for predictability and control – we continue our vast investments into powerful statistical tools, automation, advances in molecular biology and novel technologies, so as to squeeze every last drop of success out of scientific discovery programmes.

60|$|The {{disturbing}} {{effect of}} Senor Corwin upon a mind thus gravely constituted may be easily imagined. Besides Ezekiel's inordinate capacity for useless or indiscreet information, it was undeniable that his patent medicines had effected a certain peaceful revolutionary movement in San Buenaventura. A simple and superstitious community that had steadily resisted the practical domestic and agricultural American improvements, {{succumbed to the}} occult healing influences of the Panacea and Jones's Bitters. The virtues of a mysterious balsam, more or less illuminated with a colored mythological label, deeply impressed them; and the exhibition of a circular, whereon a celestial visitant was represented as descending with a gross of Rogers' Pills to a suffering but admiring multitude, touched their religious sympathies {{to such an extent}} that the good Padre Jose was obliged to warn them from the pulpit of the diabolical character of their heresies of healing--with the natural result of yet more dangerously advertising Ezekiel. There were those too who spoke under their breath of the miraculous efficacy of these nostrums. Had not Don Victor Arguello, whose respectable digestion, exhausted by continuous pepper and garlic, failed him suddenly, received an unexpected and pleasurable stimulus from the New England rum, which was the basis of the Jones Bitters? Had not the baker, tremulous from excessive aguardiente, been soothed and sustained by the invisible morphia, judiciously hidden in Blogg's <b>Nerve</b> <b>Tonic?</b> Nor had the wily Ezekiel forgotten the weaker sex in their maiden and maternal requirements.

The success of Ezekiel was so marked as to justify his return at the end of three weeks with a fresh assortment and an undiminished audacity.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{noradrenaline}} (NA) and the α 2 agonists tizanidine and clonidine {{were tested}} on extracellularly recorded responses of γ-motoneurones in deeply anaesthetized cats. Two types of responses were used; firstly, short latency phasic responses evoked by electrical stimulation of group II afferents in a muscle <b>nerve</b> and, secondly, <b>tonic</b> background discharges. Responses evoked by group II muscle afferents were depressed when NA and tizanidine were applied ionophoretically {{close to a}} γ-motoneurone and when clonidine was applied systemically. The number of spike potentials evoked by stimulation of these afferents decreased and their latencies increased. Responses evoked by flexor or extensor afferents in γ-motoneurones innervating flexors or extensors were similarly depressed. Tonic discharges were inconsistently and/or insignificantly affected by locally applied NA and tizanidine but were depressed by systemically applied clonidine. Control tests indicate specific effects of NA and tizanidine application since similarly ionophoresed H+ ions did not change responses of γ-motoneurones to stimulation of group II afferents, or only weakly enhanced their background discharges. Furthermore, serotonin ejected from a solution with a similar pH facilitated rather than depressed responses of γ-motoneurones. The results indicate that some antispastic effects of clonidine and tizanidine {{may be due to}} the depression of group II-evoked responses of γ-motoneurones, resulting in weaker responses of muscle spindles to muscle stretches...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tonic</b> <b>nerve</b> {{activity}} in skate electroreceptors {{is thought to}} result from spontaneous activity of the lumenal membranes of the receptor cells which is modulated by applied stimuli. When physiological conditions are simulated in vitro, the receptor epithelium produces a current which flows inward across the lumenal surface. This epithelial current exhibits small spontaneous sinusoidal fluctuations about the mean {{that are associated with}} corresponding but delayed fluctuations in postsynaptic response. Small voltage stimuli produce damped oscillations in the epithelial current similar in time-course to the spontaneous fluctuations. For lumen-negative, excitatory stimuli, these responses are predominantly an increase over the mean inward current. For inhibitory stimuli they are predominantly a decrease. Increased inward current across the lumenal membranes of the receptor cells increases depolarization of the presynaptic membranes in the basal faces leading to increased release of transmitter and an excitatory postsynaptic response. Decreased inward current decreases depolarization of the presynaptic membranes leading to a reduction in transmitter release and an inhibitory postsynaptic response. Clear changes in postsynaptic response are detectable during stimuli as small as 5 microV with saturation occurring at +/- 400 microV. The evoked oscillations in epithelial current are damped and the postsynaptic responses decline during maintained stimuli with large off-responses occurring at stimulus termination. The initial peak of the off-response is similar to the response produced by onset of an oppositely directed stimulus. These observations substantiate the role of receptor cell excitability in the detection of small voltage changes...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{networks}} generating rhythmic {{activity as}} an emergent property are common throughout the nervous system. Some {{are responsible for}} rhythmic behaviours, {{as is the case}} for the spinal cord locomotor networks; however, for others the function is more subtle and usually involves information processing and/or transfer. An example of the latter is sympathetic nerve activity, which is synchronized into rhythmic bursts in vivo. This arrangement is postulated to offer improved control of target organ responses compared to <b>tonic</b> <b>nerve</b> activity. Traditionally, oscillogenic circuits in the brainstem are credited with generating these rhythms, despite evidence for the persistence of some frequencies in spinalized preparations. Here, we show that rhythmic population activity can be recorded from the intermediolateral cell column (IML) of thoracic spinal cord slices. Recorded in slices from 10 - to 12 -day-old rats, this activity was manifest as 8 – 22 Hz oscillations in the field potential and was spatially restricted to the IML. Oscillations often occurred spontaneously, but could also be induced by application of 5 -HT, α-methyl 5 -HT or MK 212. These agents also significantly increased the strength of spontaneous oscillations. Rhythmic activity was abolished by TTX and attenuated by application of gap junction blockers or by antagonists of GABAA receptors. Together these data indicate that this rhythm is an emergent feature of a population of spinal neurons coupled by gap junctions. This work questions the assumption that sympathetic rhythms are dependent on supraspinal pacemaker circuits, by highlighting a surprisingly strong rhythmogenic capability of the reduced sympathetic networks of the spinal cord slice...|$|R

40|$|Spinal cord transection {{produces}} a marked {{increase in the}} response of the isolated rat tail artery to sympathetic nerve stimulation, possibly {{as a result of a}} decrease in ongoing sympathetic activity. We have tested the effects of removing ongoing nerve activity on neurovascular transmission by cutting the preganglionic input to postganglionic neurones supplying the tail artery (decentralization). Isometric contractions to nerve stimulation were compared between decentralized arteries and those from age-matched and sham-operated controls. Nerve-evoked responses of decentralized arteries were much larger than those of control arteries at 2 and 7 weeks post operatively. The extent of blockade of nerve-evoked contraction by α-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (10 nm) or idazoxan (0. 1 μm) was reduced. Decentralized arteries were transiently supersensitive to the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine; the unchanged sensitivity to methoxamine and phenylephrine after 2 weeks indicated no effect on the neuronal noradrenaline uptake transporter. Decentralized arteries were hypersensitive to α,β methylene-ATP, but the P 2 -purinoceptor antagonist suramin (0. 1 mm) did not reduce nerve-evoked contractions. Enlarged responses to 60 mm K+ after both 2 and 7 weeks were correlated with {{the response of the}} arteries to nerve stimulation, suggesting that increased postjunctional reactivity contributes to the enhanced contraction. Comparison between data from decentralized arteries and our previous data from spinalized animals showed that the two lesions similarly potentiate nerve-evoked contractions and have similar but not identical postjunctional effects. The enhanced vascular responses following a reduction in <b>tonic</b> <b>nerve</b> activity may contribute to the hypertensive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia in spinally injured patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} {{organization of the}} ventral respiratory group (VRG) was examined with respect to generation of respiratory rhythm (breathing frequency) versus control of the respiratory motor pattern on individual nerves. In urethane-anaesthetized, neuromuscularly blocked and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and respiratory motor outputs (phrenic, pharyngeal branch of the vagus, or superior laryngeal nerves) were recorded. The VRG organization was mapped systematically using injections of the excitatory amino acid dl-homocysteic acid (DLH; 5 – 20 mm, 2 – 6 nl) from single- or double-barrel pipettes at 100 – 200 μm intervals between the facial nucleus and the calamus scriptorius. Recording of respiratory neurons through the injection pipette ensured that the pipette was located within the VRG. At {{the end of each}} experiment, the injection pipette was used to make an electrical lesion, thereby marking the electrode position for subsequent histological reconstruction of injection sites. Four rostrocaudal regions were identified: (1) a rostral bradypnoea area, {{at the level of the}} Bötzinger complex, in which respiratory rhythm slowed and ABP increased, (2) a tachypnoea/dysrhythmia area, at the level of the preBötzinger complex, in which breathing rate either increased or became irregular, with little or no change in ABP, (3) a caudal bradypnoea area at the level of the anterior part of the rostral VRG in which ABP decreased and (4) a caudal ‘no effect’ region in the posterior part of the rostral VRG. The peak amplitude of phrenic nerve activity decreased with injections into all three rostral regions. Changes in respiratory rhythm were associated with opposite changes in inspiratory (TI) and expiratory (TE) durations after injections into either the Bötzinger complex or anterior rostral VRG, while both TI and TE decreased after injections into the preBötzinger complex. Effects on selected cranial nerves were similar to those on the phrenic <b>nerve</b> except that <b>tonic</b> activity was elicited on the superior larygneal nerve ipsilateral to injections in the Bötzinger complex and on the pharyngeal branch of the vagus ipsilateral to injections in the preBötzinger complex. These data reinforce the subdivision of the VRG into functionally distinct compartments and suggest that a further subdivision of the rostral VRG is warranted. They also suggest that region-specific influences, especially on the pattern of cranial motor discharge, can be used to assist the identification of recording sites within the VRG. However, the postulated clear functional separation of rhythm- versus pattern-generating regions was not supported...|$|R

40|$|Asparagus racemosus Willd., one of {{the most}} {{important}} medicinal plants, is regarded as a &#x 2018;rasayana&#x 2019; in the Ayurvedic system of medicine and has been recommended for use as a galactagogue, aphrodisiac, anodyne, diuretic and <b>nerve</b> <b>tonic</b> since time immemorial, necessitating its incorporation into a number of important Ayurvedic formulations like Shatavarikalpa, Phalaghrita and Vishnutaila. However, data regarding safety or toxicity of Asparagus racemosus in animal systems is lacking. Hence, the present experiment envisaged acute and sub-acute toxicity of Asparagus racemosus root aqueous extract in adult Charles Foster rats following the guidelines of OECD including parameters like observational, hematological, biochemical and pathological studies. Except serum creatinine level in acute study and SGPT activity and serum creatinine level in sub-acute study, all the observational, hematological and biochemical parameters studied showed non-significant changes. Histopathological examination of hepatic sections of sub-acute samples showed mild inflammatory and fatty changes at higher doses...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Although {{the global}} {{prevalence}} of psychological disorders is&# 13; increasing continually, the efficacies of therapeutic strategies {{are still very}} limited. Oxidative stress has&# 13; been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and substance possessing antioxidant&# 13; activity can alleviate the mentioned conditions. Therefore, we hypothesized that Kaempferia&# 13; parviflora, a medicinal plant claimed for <b>nerve</b> <b>tonic,</b> also possessed the neuropharmacological&# 13; activities which provide the advantage for psychiatric disorders. Approach: Adult male Wistar rats,&# 13; weighing 180 - 220 grams, were orally given the ethanolic extract of K. parviflora at doses of 150, 200 &# 13; and 250 mg kg - 1 BW once daily for 2 weeks. Then, they were determined the neuropharmacological&# 13; activities including anxiolytic, anti-depression like behavior and cognitive enhancement after single&# 13; dose, 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. Results: K. parviflora possessed anti-depression like behavior and&# 13; cognitive enhancement at all treatment duration. Unfortunately, this substance failed to show&# 13; anxiolytic like activity. Conclusion: Our results suggested that K. parviflora might {{be used as a}} novel&# 13; therapeutic strategy for psychiatric disorder and cognitive enhancement. However, further&# 13; investigations about precise underlying mechanism are still required...|$|E
40|$|Heracleum candicans Wall. ex DC. (Apiaceae) {{is widely}} used in Indian system of {{medicines}} as an aphrodisiac, <b>nerve</b> <b>tonic</b> {{and also in the}} treatment of skin diseases with reports of being rich in furocoumarins which are extensively used in pharmaceutical industry for their photosensitizing activity on human skin. A simple high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of psoralen (1) and heraclenol (2) in the fruits of H. candicans. The analytes were separated on silica gel F 254 plates with toluene[*]:[*]diethy lether[*]:[*]acetic acid (6 [*]:[*] 4 [*]:[*] 1) and scanned densitometrically at 350 [*]nm. The method was validated in terms of precision, repeatability, and accuracy. The linear range for psoralen and heraclenol was found to be 1 – 5 [*]μg spot− 1 and 1 – 4 [*]μg spot− 1 with correlation coefficient of 0. 973 and 0. 964, respectively. The two compounds were quantified in fruits of H. candicans and were found to be present in the range of 0. 021 – 0. 036 % and 0. 029 – 0. 043 %[*]w/w. The method was found to be very simple, accurate, precise, and economical and can be used for routine quality control...|$|E
