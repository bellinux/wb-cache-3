40|$|Energy {{conservation}} proponents, {{often with}} an engineering background, {{claim that a}} range of measures exists which allow to save energy and CO 2 at negative net costs, but that these so-called <b>no-regret</b> <b>measures</b> are not being realised autonomously by market actors. This view is being challenged by traditional economic analysis, which argues that no-regret advocates neglect transaction costs and do not apply appropriate investment appraisal methods. Furthermore, the no-regret advocates' explanations for the non-exploitation of <b>no-regret</b> <b>measures</b> are often criticised as unsubstantiated or as inconsistent with the observation of profitability, e. g. when they refer to high information costs. This paper re-assesses the no-regret potential of high efficiency electric motors (HEM). It draws on a theoretical framework which defines criteria for identifying phenomena and causes for no-regret potentials and for distinguishing between "true" and "false" no-regret potentials. The framework combines investment theory (including real option theory), transactions cost economics, market failure theory and the theory of diffusion. The re-assessment procedure is illustrated using the example of HEM. A microeconomic re-revaluation of the profitability of HEM investments delivers the first component for determining a phenomenon of no-regret. It {{is followed by a}} discussion of causes, why HEM remain underrepresented despite their economic advantage. The existence of a no-regret potential related to HEM is confirmed, but its size in energetic and financial terms is modified. In the conclusions some implications for policy intervention are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Pursuant to the {{commitments}} under the Framework Convention of Climate Change (FCCC), all Annex I Parties of FCCC have compiled their National Communications on Climate Change. There, Parties have reported the national greenhouse gas inventories, policies, and measures to address climate change, the {{greenhouse gas emissions}} projections, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and education and public awareness. Implementation of policies and measures to address climate change in economies in transition (EIT) is very complicated due to the experienced deep economic crisis. It is important to outline the efforts of EIT countries to identify their climate change policy and to recognize the most effective policies and measures achieved under these countries' special circumstances. This paper compiles information from the policies and measures section of the National Communications of nine EIT countries. The analysis {{has been carried out}} in the framework of overall policy context and the national circumstances of EIT countries in terms of energy and economy development. In general, policies and measures in EIT countries tend to follow the trends observed in the other Annex I Parties to the FCCC. They address primarily carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion as the most important greenhouse gas and the energy transformation sector as the major greenhouse emissions source. The most effective mitigation measures [...] in terms of both greenhouse gas emission reduction and costs [...] were energy efficiency and the promotion of non-fossil energy sources. A prevailing part of policies and measures implemented or under implementation in EIT countries were cost-effective and <b>no-regret</b> <b>measures.</b> It was considered very difficult in these countries to go beyond <b>no-regret</b> <b>measures</b> in a situation of deep economic crisis and insufficient investments. ...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the major means of reducing CO 2 emissions resulting from industrial use of energy. Both from a societal as well as business perspective it is of great importance to reduce industrial energy end use (EEU). The implementation of energy-efficient technologies as well as increased focus on energy management practices has been stated by previous research to be the two most important methods of improved industrial energy efficiency. To date, however, there are few (if any) studies that have analyzed the proportion of industrial energy savings that derive from implementation of new technology versus from continuous energy management practices. By analyzing substantial data from the Swedish PFE program this paper aims to quantify what previously has been referred to as the extended energy efficiency gap. Results show that about 61 % of the analyzed 1254 energy efficiency measures are derived from the implementation of new technology, and the rest stems from management and operational measures. The results presented in this paper are of outmost importance for industrial energy managers and energy auditors as well as industrial associations and policy-makers in order to cost-effectively address these <b>no-regret</b> <b>measures.</b> Funding agencies: Swedish Energy Agency</p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the current}} main {{objective}} of international negotiations on climate change aims at enlarging the coordination regime to developing countries (DCs), and particularly to emerging countries. The international coordination system built at the Kyoto Conference relies on a coordination system based on a purely climate centric approach which shows irreconcilable contradictions between climate and development issues. This article aims at evaluating possible pathways implementing synergies between climate policies and development policies {{in order to create}} an incentive towards DCs to take part in climate mitigation. We focus on an illustrative example on India. When most reference scenarios postulate rapid energy decoupling of the GDP and rapid decarbonisation of DCs economies in the future, this article elaborates, with the IMACLIM-R model, a baseline taking into account weaknesses and current disequilibria of the Indian technico-economic system such as the high dependency on imported energy, or the structural shortage in electricity. We show why a purely climate centric approach (quota allocation), adopted to commit with a world objective of tabilization to 550 ppm, induce very high transition costs in spite of significant financial transfers. On the contrary, a strategy based on the research of synergies between the reduction of these disequilibria, and the mitigation of GHG emissions is investigated in the power sector, which presents the biggest potential of <b>no-regret</b> <b>measures.</b> This permits to drop down transition costs applied to the Indian economy by improving the overall energy efficiency. An economic and environmental evaluation of this alternative scenario is lead...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Projections {{of health}} risks {{of climate change}} are {{surrounded}} with uncertainties in knowledge. Understanding of these uncertainties will help the selection of appropriate adaptation policies. Methods We made an inventory of conceivable health impacts of climate change, explored the type and level of uncertainty for each impact, and discussed its implications for adaptation policy. A questionnaire-based expert elicitation was performed using an ordinal scoring scale. Experts {{were asked to indicate}} the level of precision with which health risks can be estimated, given the present state of knowledge. We assessed the individual scores, the expertise-weighted descriptive statistics, and the argumentation given for each score. Suggestions were made for how dealing with uncertainties could be taken into account in climate change adaptation policy strategies. Results The results showed that the direction of change could be indicated for most anticipated health effects. For several potential effects, too little knowledge exists to indicate whether any impact will occur, or whether the impact will be positive or negative. For several effects, rough ‘order-of-magnitude’ estimates were considered possible. Factors limiting health impact quantification include: lack of data, multi-causality, unknown impacts considering a high-quality health system, complex cause-effect relations leading to multi-directional impacts, possible changes of present-day response-relations, and difficulties in predicting local climate impacts. Participants considered heat-related mortality and non-endemic vector-borne diseases particularly relevant for climate change adaptation. Conclusions For possible climate related health impacts characterised by ignorance, adaptation policies that focus on enhancing the health system’s and society’s capability of dealing with possible future changes, uncertainties and surprises (e. g. through resilience, flexibility, and adaptive capacity) are most appropriate. For climate related health effects for which rough risk estimates are available, ‘robust decision-making’ is recommended. For health effects with limited societal and policy relevance, we recommend focusing on <b>no-regret</b> <b>measures.</b> For highly relevant health effects, precautionary measures can be considered. This study indicated that analysing and characterising uncertainty by means of a typology can be a very useful approach for selection and prioritization of preferred adaptation policies to reduce future climate related health risks. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResources are {{becoming}} scarce. Therefore, reuse of resources {{is becoming more}} and more attractive. Wastewater can be used as a resource, since it contains many resources like organic matter, phosphorus, nitrogen, heavy metals, thermal energy, etc. This study focused on the reuse of organic matter and phosphorus from Amsterdam’s wastewater. There is a wide variety of possible alternatives, and the technical options are growing. The problem is not the availability of technology for resource recovery, but the lack of a planning and design methodology to identify and deploy the most sustainable solutions in a given context. To explore alternative, coherent and viable strategies regarding resource recovery from Amsterdam’s wastewater chain, the development process of dynamic adaptive policy pathways was used. In the first phase a material flow analysis was made for Amsterdam’s wastewater chain and analyzed for water, organic matter and phosphorus. In the second phase measures were identified and characterized. The characterization was based on criteria focusing on changes in material flows, recovered products and implementation horizon. For the Amsterdam case recovered products concerned alginic acid, bioplastic, cellulose, phosphorus and biogas. In the third phase the measures were combined into strategies, which are combinations of measures that focus on a specific goal of resource recovery. For the Amsterdam case this resulted in four strategies: a strategy focusing on production of alginic acid, a strategy focusing on production of bioplastics, a strategy focusing on recovery of cellulose, and a strategy focusing on recovery of phosphorus. Adaptive policymaking showed to be a good approach to deal with the wide variety of possibilities and uncertainties. It resulted in a coherent policy as the resource recovery goals became clear, a flexible policy as the lock-in, <b>no-regret</b> and win–win <b>measures</b> could be identified, and an up-to-date policy as a periodic update is possible that will reveal new chances and risks...|$|R
40|$|For an {{understanding}} of climate change in the tidal area of knowledge is necessary around four themes. First, more detailed studies of regional, natural emissions of greenhouse gases, which show German data {{that they can be}} compared to the anthropogenic emissions of methane, for example, very significant. How the associated processes can be explained? For a full understanding of such studies should be linked to that of primary production and decomposition in the ecological system and the net transport by tidal flows into the North Sea. This should enable us to better assess how to influence. Managing rivers, the coastal zone and the Wadden Sea these emissions (unintentionally) In addition, the Wadden Sea area is a hotspot for future sustainable energy, the effect of which should keep the natural features of the area due consideration. Research in this area of tension is needed. Secondly, it is important, especially in collaboration with German climate research institutes, to achieve proper region-specific scenarios for climate change and sea level rise as a basis for 'impact studies and design of adaptive measures. For decades, the uncertainty in global climate scenarios is small enough to make. Translation into the Wadden Sea meaningful Design of <b>no-regret</b> adaptation <b>measures</b> based on a thorough exploration of extremes scenarios for the development of climate and sea level. The main questions are at the interface between the rate of sea level rise, the danger of drowning in the tidal flats, and the role of natural climate and sand replenishment in ensuring safety. Third, more knowledge is needed of the potential impact (impacts) of climate change on morphology, hydrology, and wet and dry ecology of the Wadden Sea and the robustness and resilience of existing natural and human systems. Reconstruction of changes in the distant past (last few millennia) and causal analysis of current trends, supplemented by comparative studies of warmer tidal flat systems should provide the necessary knowledge to indicate. The possibilities and impossibilities for adaptation Integral analysis of systems and processes are crucial. Correlative analysis to small subsystems or individual species are not enough. Finally there will need to be developed. On the basis of the above innovative and robust adaptive measures From a water safety perspective, attention to hard (eg delta levees) and soft options (dynamic coastal management). Provide climate change and sea level rise, besides that they are a threat, just too excellent opportunities for nature, agriculture, but also other sectors. Perhaps new feature combinations that measures {{have a positive effect on}} more than one sector. Creative ideas should be passed on overall impact on the future situation. Robustness and resilience are key words here. Comparability studies and opportunities for integrated quantification of impacts are necessary. In all this is a significant need to catch up from a socio-economic, planning and governance research disciplines...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} explores multiple {{facets of}} a green infrastructure planning framework for climate change adaptation in urban regions. The research is organized in three distinct, but related parts. The first develops an adaptation implementation model based on triggering conditions rather than time. The approach responds to policy makers 2 ̆ 7 reluctance to engage in adaptation planning due to uncertain future conditions. The model is based on planning and adaptation literature and applied to two case studies. Uncertainty during implementation may be reduced by incremental and flexible policy implementation, disbursing investments as needs arise, monitoring conditions, and organizing adaptation <b>measures</b> along <b>no-regrets</b> to transformational <b>measures.</b> The second part develops the green infrastructure transect as an organizational framework for mainstreaming adaptation planning policies. The framework integrates multi-scalar and context aspects of green infrastructure for vertical and horizontal integration of policy. The framework integrates literature from urban and landscape planning and tested on Boston. Prioritization of adaptation measures depends on location. Results suggest that green infrastructure adaptation policies should respond to configuration of zones. Cross jurisdiction coordination at regional and parcel scales supports mainstreaming. A secondary conclusion suggests that green infrastructure is space intensive and becomes {{the basis of the}} empirical study in part three. A spatial assessment method is introduced to formulate opportunities for green infrastructure network implementation within land-uses and across an urban-rural gradient. Spatial data in GIS for Boston is utilized to develop a percent pervious metric allowing the characterization of the study area into six zones of varying perviousness. Opportunities across land uses were assessed then maximum space opportunities were defined based on conservation, intensification, transformation and expansion. The opportunities for transformation of impervious surfaces to vegetal surfaces are highest in the urban center and its surrounding. Intensification of vegetation on pervious surfaces along all land uses is high across the gradient. Conservation of existing forested land is significant for future climate proofing. The concluding section argues for a green infrastructure planning framework for adaptation based on integration into existing infrastructural bodies, regional vision, incremental implementation, ecosystem benefits accounting, and conditions based planning rather than time based. ...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the {{greatest}} threats for the global environment today. Global mean temperature has risen by about 0. 6 degrees C during the 20 th century, greater than during any other century in the last 1000 years. Subsequently, climate change is likely to have detrimental effects on all global natural and anthropogenic systems. Climate change will have consequences for the structure and function of ecosystems and all the major global biomes. Also agricultural production and productivity will alter, and physical effects will take place on the environment affecting those that inhabit it. For example, sea level rise and climatic variations will have implications for human health, land use and coastal infrastructure. This report aims to identify the current and proposed research and assessments being undertaken by international organizations as well as the major national research groups regarding climate change and its effects on ecosystems, on agriculture (including fisheries and forestry) and on the economy and human society. The report also identifies possible gaps in this research. The IPCC, basing its assessment on peer reviewed and published scientific/ technical literature, plays a main role in summarizing climate change research and forming a worldwide consensus on future scenarios. The IPCC published its Third Assessment Report in 2001. Global research on the effects of climate change amongst the world's ecosystems is being undertaken and/or coordinated by organizations such as FAO, UNEP, UNDP, the World Conservation Union (IUCN), the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). They work on several crosscutting projects in climate change and terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. The World Bank is sponsoring numerous projects worldwide to promote research in the subject. Higher latitudes are covered by bodies such as the British Antarctic Survey, the Canadian Institute for Climate Studies and the Nordic Arctic Research Programme among others. In middle latitudes, many leading research groups in Western countries are working on this topic. Research on ecosystem impacts of climate change in lower tropical latitudes include effects of sea surface temperature warming on coral reefs by Coral Reef Degradation of the Indian Ocean (CORDIO) Programme. Gaps through the relative neglect of research into other tropical ecosystems is, however, noticeable. The impacts of climate change on agriculture are complex and uncertain. The FAO's Global Terrestrial Observation System Programme and START's Global Change program, takes a long-term predictive approach to its research. A large number of national and regional agencies fund or undertake work throughout the world, such as NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the WMO's Agricultural Meteorology Programme. National programs include the Canadian Climate Impact and Adaptation Research Network as well as work in New Zealand through the use of models and data sets to predict climate effects on agriculture and horticulture, by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. In the United Kingdom, the Climate Impact Programme (UKCIP) {{is one of}} the active players in the field. In the US, the Department of Agriculture has commissioned a number of studies on climate change impacts on US agriculture. Work on the effects on forestry appears to be split between large international agencies such as IUCN and the projects under the framework of the World Bank, and again extensive national projects by the Canadians and their CIARN Forest Sector programs among others. Global warming could have many impacts on fisheries and other aquatic and marine resources. The UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre is undertaking a Changing Oceans project and the UNESCO Global Oceans Observation System Programme, involving other bodies susch as UNEP WMO and FAO. The US Global Oceans Ecosystems Dynamics project is a multi-disciplinary program to examine the potential impacts of global climate change in marine ecosystems. Research on the impacts of climate change on the economy and human society is reasonably comprehensive. Several academic institutions such as the Centre for Marine and Climate Research in Germany and the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, and the Climatic Research Unit, both working from the University of East Anglia have regional research projects in various regions of the world such as developing African states and low-lying small island states. In Germany, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is also focusing on socio-economic issues while Norway has the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO). Finally, the Tyndall Centre and the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), both in the UK are actively involved in the economic and human dimension of climate change impacts. Based on the survey and on IPCC and UNFCCC Reports, several gaps were identified in climate change research regarding the motioned topics: [...] Much of the climate change predictions made are gradual, continuous changes. A science that focuses on discontinuities (tipping points, thresholds, etc.) rather than mean changes and gradual response curves is only developing slowly. [...] Much climate change research has focused on a one century time scale. Very little attention has been paid to the evolution of climatic risks over the next 20 years. Climate change scenarios are distinct from present risk (control runs are very poor surrogates for present climate experience) and a 3 - 10 year time scale of climate prediction remains difficult. Yet, this remains the relevant time scale for policy making, vulnerability assessment and the like. [...] Climate change impact research in developing countries is hindered by the virtual absence of good long-term data. Monitoring programs are needed in a variety of areas, such as land-use, ecosystem data, socio-economics, etc. [...] Most work in agriculture and fisheries focuses on middle latitude issues. However, in developing countries, the issue of food security should not be neglected. [...] Most research has been sectoral, yet there is a need to focus on the interactions between different sectors in society; [...] Most research has looked at impacts of one specific stressor, yet there is a need to further our understanding on the cumulative effects of multiple stresses and at different spatial scales; [...] Relatively little work has been carried out on vulnerability and integrated risk assessment; Enhanced risks from climate change need to be seen in the light of existing risks, e. g. flooding, hurricanes, environmental, health, political, social, etc. Relevant profiles of vulnerability should be provided and integrated risk management tools should be applied to identify and evaluate how best to cope with climate change related risks. This should also include economic risk assessment. [...] Economic impact research has often taken an engineering approach, i. e. the economic loss was calculated as the loss in physical terms times the price based on a marginal analysis. Yet, actual losses need to be based on the total economic changes in terms of quantity and price in the various sectors based on induced changes in demand and supply, and trade, etc. [...] Much research has focused on the impact of climate change on ecosystems and natural resources. Yet, the impacts on humans in their livelihood systems (e. g. human access to natural resources) and other socio-economic linkages as a result of these changes are largely unknown. The social/cultural complexity, especially in developing countries in the context of climate change needs to be studied in depth, as well as issues of induced possible demographic shifts and land-use changes. [...] Vulnerability and impact studies, especially in developing countries, need to focus more on impacts on poverty and on the poorest segments in society, given that so much of the aid flows focus on poverty alleviation. The research should address the question how climate change impacts poverty incidence, both rural and urban. [...] Disasters linked to climate change can lead to economic and political instability, e. g. related to water scarcity exacerbated by climate change. Hardly any research has been done in this area thus far. Though not the focus of the survey here, major gaps exist in our understanding of climate change adaptation. In fact, in this area, much more policy relevant research is needed, for instance in preventing mal-adaptation and encouraging <b>no-regret</b> policies and <b>measures.</b> Health impacts of climate change, e. g. malaria outbraeaks have only been studied in some areas in the world thus far...|$|R
