50|$|A {{minimum wage}} {{law was passed}} in Hong Kong in July 2010. It {{requires}} the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to propose a minimum wage level, which he will do {{for the first time}} in November 2010; the Legislative Council will either approve or reject the amount. The law does not give the Legislative Council the power to amend the amount, and it is not applicable to foreign domestic helpers, who, under legislation specifically governing the employment of foreign domestic helpers, earn a minimum of HK$3,580 per month. The wage level prevailing is essentially the result of interplay of supply and demand. Wages are usually calculated on hourly, daily, monthly, or piece rates. In September , the average monthly wage rate for the supervisory, technical, clerical and miscellaneous <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> was HK$11,712. Based on the wage indexes, the average wage rate for this group of workers rose by 1.8% per annum in 1995-2007, and by 1.5% per annum in real terms. The small difference is due to severe consumer price deflation. The overall average daily wage for the workers on public works construction projects was HK$565.60 at the end of 2007.|$|E

In terms of educational attainment, within the blue collar occupations we find clear evidence in support of skill upgrading toward more educated workers occurring along with increases in OF/K. While point estimates are not very precise, among white collar occupations we find that hours provided by the least and most educated workers increase with OF/K, while hours provided by those with high-school and some college education are adversely affected. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper extends {{existing}} {{literature on the}} effects of minimum wage changes on employment. By focusing on both production workers and <b>non-production</b> <b>workers,</b> this paper sheds light on issues of policy significance. There is a perception that <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> are unaffected by minimum wage changes because they are typically highly-skilled and highly paid workers, such as managers and researchers, whose wages are significantly above the minimum wage. For that reason, the impact of minimum wages on them receives little analysis. However, in reality, a significant portion of <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> in the manufacturing sector actually have low education and perform mainly basic tasks. Moreover, although <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> account for a smaller fraction of the manufacturing labor force, they do account for a much larger fraction in the service sector (and hence in the entire economy), thus making the findings from this paper relevant to the economy as a whole. Third, the analysis on employment of workers by educational attainment and gender informs policymakers who set minimum wage levels with the objective to benefit poorer, often low skilled workers.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies two topics. First, {{a thorough}} {{analysis of the}} investment strategies of multinational firms is conducted. Empirical relationships that govern the evolution of foreign equity participation at the firm level are provided, followed by a theoretical model to explain these relationships. Econometric estimations evidence how equity participation affects firm performance. Second, the role of trade in capital goods in international business cycles is investigated. Empirical facts that describe the relationship between key business cycle variables are documented {{for a group of}} emerging market economies. Existing models are revised to capture the empirical observations. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are often confronted with the question of what degree of ownership they should assume at subsidiaries. Chapter 1 uses detailed plant-level data from Turkey to show that MNEs typically engage in partial integration. It then lays out a theoretical model to capture the evidence presented and provides a consistent test of the theory using econometric models. The theory highlights the role of joint productivities between MNEs and domestic suppliers and predicts that MNEs will choose to hold a higher share of equity when revealed productivity is higher. Chapter 2 examines the relationship between foreign equity participation and average plant wages. An econometric result is presented to demonstrate the bias that arises when traditional practice in the literature is followed. Nonparametric methods are employed to show that the true relationship between foreign ownership and average wages is linear. A ten percent increase in foreign equity participation is found to increase the average wage of a <b>non-production</b> <b>worker</b> by four percent. Chapter 3, co-authored with Jing Zhang, documents the relation between key business cycle variables in a set of emerging and developed economies. The real exchange rate is found to be much more procyclical in emerging economies. Exports are highly procyclical in developed economies, but acyclical in emerging economies. A two-country stochastic growth model with a tradable investment goods sector is developed to explain the empirical findings. Home bias in capital plays {{a crucial role in the}} model, which replicates the business cycle characteristics in both sets of economies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic {{model of the}} industrial demands for structures, equipment, and blue- and white-collar labor. Our approach is consistent with producers holding rational expectations and optimizing dynamically {{in the presence of}} adjustment costs, yet it permits generality of functional form regarding the technology. We represent the technology by atranslog input requirement function that specifies the amount of blue-collar labor (a flexible factor) the firm must hire to produce a level of output given its quantities of three quasi-fixed factors that are subject to adjustment costs: <b>non-production</b> (white-collar) <b>workers,</b> equipment, and structures. A complete description of the production structure is obtained by simultaneously estimating the input requirement function and three stochastic Euler equations. We apply an instrumental variable technique to estimate these equations using aggregate data for U. S. manufacturing. We find that as a fraction of total expenditures, adjustment costs are small in total hut large on the margin,and that they differ considerably across quasi-fixed factors. We also present short- and long-run elasticities of factor demands. ...|$|R
40|$|Après avoir rappelé les assises juridiques du régime d'accréditation, l’auteur note les effets de l'accréditation à l'égard de certains salariés dans un premier temps et à l'égard du syndicat dans un second temps. Fernand MorinFrom {{the legal}} {{point of view}} the Quebec {{certification}} procedure is founded on four basic principles: 1. Exclusive representation for an established unit; 2. Majority representation; 3. Links to the firm; 4. Stability of the certified union. In {{spite of the fact}} that the labor code gives a very broad definition of "employee", the labour relations board has adopted the civil code approach, that is a rental of services. The board has refused to use the criterion of economic subordination. The contractual approach should be abandoned in favor of the very flexible definition of the labor code. If this were the case management unions (syndicat de cadre), though excluded from the code for certification, could nevertheless operate as homogeneous staff-only organizations. By virtue of certification a union can force the employer to negotiate, engage in strike action, and can be party to a collective agreement. The union must also ensure the application of the agreement in the collective interest of all employees in the unit. Certification replaces the individual work relationship in favor of a collective system. This system imposes on the union two fondamental obligations: that of accepting workers for membership, and that of representing them all equally and equitably. In closing, the certification mechanism should be made more supple in twoways:(1) by an enlargement of the definition of "employee*' to include management;(2) by the abandonnant of the strict "absolute majority" rule in favor of a more flexible formula. Claude D'AoustThe civil code's notion of an "employee" necessarily implies a legal subordination while in the labor code definition this criterion is absent. We should also ask ourselves if it is even advisable to carry over into the collective relationship the former concept of « employee ». The historical development of labor law reveals the legislator's preoccupation with the protectional the production worker. Indeed to include the <b>non-production</b> <b>worker</b> under the extended coverage of our labor law necessitates specific mention to that effect. While it is doubtless desirable to extend collective bargaining to non-manualworkers, this step requires the study of the type of organizations that could developthere. For many sectors (e. g., artisans, taxi drivers) traditional unionism could not be transplantedin toto. While these classifications are « employees » according to the civil code, they are excluded from the definition given by the labor code. Though this does not prohibit such workers from joining unions, they are deprived of the rights flowing from the labor code. In addition, these groups are also subject to criminal law and to civil law. Thus, their exclusion from the scope of the labor code is complete and not merely limited to the certification process. The historical analysis of labor law thus confirms this awkward situation as the apparent intention of the legislator. The use of economic criteria in delineating the bargaining unit should not be used except with great caution. Raymond LachapelleThe certification procedure is the result of state intervention in the collective bargaining process. This is a recent legal phenomenon not explicable through — on the warrant is — the use of civil law instruments. Also, the elements of juridical subordination are too narrow for the statutory notion of « worker ». In the past, the delineation of the bargain unit was often the product of the needs of the applicant union. This resulted in a multitude of inconveniences steming from, for example, the union's pattern of successful organization, other kinds of units proposed by rival unions, whether in that industry there was an established certification tendency ; (Le., plant, multi-plant), and also the exclusion of certain individuals by the law. It is also not clear whether a union is obliged to accept all workers into member-ship. No such duty is to be found in the law...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the occupational structures of 25 European Union countries {{during the period}} 2000 - 2004. Shift-share analyses {{have been used to}} decompose cross-country differences in occupational structure into within industry and between industry effects.

The differences in the shares of (high-skilled) <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> are dominated by the between (industrial) effect. In contrast, the dynamic analysis of 2000 - 2004 shows that changes in the share of high-skilled <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> are mostly driven by within industry changes, which are probably related to skill-biased technological change. The results indicate the weakening of this process, at least for <b>non-production</b> <b>workers.</b> The diffusion of the increased demand for skills within sectors is witnessed for the higher income EU 12 country group, but less strongly for the EU 25 country group. ...|$|E

The results of our econometric analysis, using data over 1997 - 2007, suggest that increasing import shares from low-income countries or investing in those countries significantly reduces demand for low-skilled labour, while it increases demand for skilled labour. An increase in exports generally raises the demand for production workers, while it reduces the demand for <b>non-production</b> <b>workers.</b> However, these effects are reversed in the case of exports to low-income countries. Considering the impact of FDI, our results tentatively suggest that the setting up of a new international investment project has a positive impact on demand for <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> one period before it is made.

The estimation results indicate the following implications. First, although ICT expenditure and investment have increased sharply since 1993, it appears that ICT investment has begun to be complementarily combined with skilled labor only since 1996. Second, our results support the 'limited substitution hypothesis'. ICT has substituted low-skilled <b>non-production</b> <b>workers,</b> whereas the increased demand for high-skilled workers is driven by ICT diffusion in the second sub-period. This asymmetric trend between high-skilled and low-skilled <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea reveals significant differences in comparison with the experiences of other OECD countries. Third, the existence of substitutability between ICT diffusion and low-skilled <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea may cast doubt on the appropriateness of the non-production workers' category, a category regarded as a proxy variable of high-skilled workers in most previous studies.

Using a Cobb Douglas stochastic production frontier the paper examines firm level technical efficiency in the time varying inefficiency effect model with technical inefficiency effects assumed as an independently distributed truncated normal variable. Estimates of the production frontier revealed significant but small elasticities of labour and capital for textile and clothing firms, respectively, and a negative (but insignificant) Hicks neutral technical change for both. Estimated coefficients of the explanatory variables for inefficiency effects indicated that technical efficiency varied significantly according to firms' age, size, capital intensity, proportion of <b>non-production</b> to total <b>workers</b> and type of legal status. Predicted firm specific efficiency varied from 16 per cent to 95 per cent and mean efficiency ranged between 30 to 70 per cent.

40|$|Using firm-level data, {{we study}} the {{differences}} in {{the quantity and quality of}} jobs offered by foreign-owned and domestic firms in Sub-Saharan Africa, and identify how country-level institutional factors determine these differences. After controlling for numerous firm-level characteristics in regressions, we find that foreign-owned firms, especially those whose main business purpose is to serve the home or foreign markets, offer more stable and secure jobs than domestic firms. Specifically, they have more permanent full-time workers, a lower probability of offering temporary work and employ less temporary workers. The job stability and security advantage of foreign-owned firms is smaller in countries with higher firing costs and governance quality, where domestic firms are induced to offer more stable and secure jobs. In addition, foreign-owned firms are less likely to offer unpaid work and have less of these workers. They also invest more in training, especially of managers, and pay higher wages to <b>non-production</b> and managerial <b>workers,</b> particularly those firms whose main business purpose is to serve the home or foreign markets.

40|$|With inter-country {{differences}} in comparative advantage {{and the resultant}} perceived significance for product specialization, trade-based development strategies have become the key to ascending the development ladder. The {{role played by the}} textHes and clothing industries during the embryonic stages of such a process is enormous, but was Hmited through protective measures, such as the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) adopted by the net importer developed economies. With the ongoing globalisation process {{under the auspices of the}} World Trade Organization (WTO), small players in the world market such as Australia and Bangladesh have been faced with severe policy questions. In view this, the impact of globalisation, microeconomic reform and firm-level responses have remained vastiy underinvestigated and this thesis is a novel attempt to bridge this knowledge-gap. Pubhc pohcy regimes and microeconomic reform in textiles industries have been examined and compared in the two economies with a third country, Thailand, chosen because of its intermediary development status, to facihtate comparative evaluation of performance of these industries. Dynamic comparative advantage and product hfe cycle hypothesis has been analysed with estimation of revealed comparative advantage (Balassa, 1965) for selected developed and developing economies. Subsectoral performance has been evaluated with productivity measured using both parametric and non-parametric techniques. Tornqvist 2 ̆ 7 s (1936) non parametric superlative index with underlying flexible form translog function, as popularised by Diewert (1976, 1978), has been used to index output, input and TFP growth for the three economies. Estimation of the Cobb-Douglas production function has revealed input elasticities, returns to scale and the rate of technical change. For firm level analysis of technical efficiency, a parametric measure of frontier function has been used based on the stochastic frontier approach developed by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977) with the parameterisation technique of the variances due to noise and inefficiency suggested by Battese and Corra (1977). Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production functions have been estimated in the error component model with alternative assumptions of half normal and truncated normal distributions of the inefficiency term for a cross section of Austrahan textiles and clothing firms in 1998 obtained from the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) benchmarking database. To analyse factors determining variation in technical efficiency across firms, conventional two stage analysis that suffers from a contradictory distributional assumption of technical inefficienq 2 ̆ 7, where technical efficiencies are predicted first and then regressed against various firm specific factors has been substituted for single stage estimation following Battese and CoeUi (1993, 1995) where the inefficiency components are the fijnctions of a vector of firm specific factors (explanatory variables). Panel data for Austrahan and Bangladeshi firms was accommodated in this inefficiency effect model measuring Hicks neutral technical change and time varying technical efficiency over 1995 to 1998. Among other firm-specific characteristics such as age, size and ownership pattern, that were common to both Bangladesh and Austraha, additional variables such as export orientation (or openness), proportion of <b>non-production</b> to total <b>workers,</b> effective rates of assistance (ERA) and research and development (R 2 ̆ 6 D) were included for Austrahan firms to capture the effects of recent microeconomic reforms. Based on predicted firm specific technical efficiency, measures of technical change, scale effects and technical efficiency was aggregated under non constant returns to scale to obtain TFP changes for each individual firm and for firms in various product categories. The major findings of this study are, (i) Developing economies have made great strides in achieving dynamic revealed comparative advantage in textiles trade over the last two decades. However, some developed economies also have made significant improvement in comparative advantage thereby engendering increased competitiveness among the trading nations. Bangladesh has a strong comparative advantage in clothing trade whereas Australia has improved but is yet to have a clear comparative advantage in clothing, (ii) Over rime, labour productivity growth has been strong in both the Thai and Austrahan industries while this has been only moderate in Bangladeshi clothing and low in its textiles industries. Evidence from factor proportions indicated that since the early 1970 s, Austrahan industries became predominanriy more capital intensive as did Thailand, to certain extent, as opposed to Bangladesh where rising employment especially in the clothing industry reduced the pace of absorption of higher capital proportions, (iii) Despite export performance and a good trend rate of growth over the period, productivity growth has been slow m Austrahan and Bangladeshi industries in recent years. For Austraha the process was found to be energized by faUing ERA, as this indicated poUcy shifts, especiaUy for the clothing industries; (iv) The analysis at the firm level suggested that larger and more profitable Austrahan firms are technically more efficient than smaU and medium enterprises that had considerably lower efficiency. In Bangladesh, clothmg firms were found to be more efficient than the textile firms. (v) Analysis of composition of TFP revealed that technical efficiency changes sigmficandy contributed to the overall TFP of Austrahan and Bangladeshi firms with some contribution from scale effects and a neghgible impact of technical change, (vi) Empirical esthnates of the inefficiency effect model showed that several firm specific variables such as Age and Size had significant positive influence on technical efficiency of Australian textile firms. Further, significant negative influences on efficiency from capital intensit 2 ̆ 7 were detected for Austrahan textile firms. Both textile and clothing firms in Austraha with higher proportion of non production to total workers were found to be significantiy less efficient and vice versa. Efficiency was found to be lower for older textile firms and higher for newer clothing firms in Bangladesh. Larger and privately owned textile firms in Bangladesh were found to be significantiy more technically efficient than the smaller firms and firms under government ownership. Several pohcy imphcations emanate from the findings of this study. It is evident that increased competitiveness has been the major consideration with the beginning of the Hberahzation process of the textiles trade and with there is considerable scope to reap the benefits of the fuUy integrated regime beyond 2005 if both Austraha and Bangladesh augment their comparative advantage based on high quahty and low cost processes, respectively. Adequate measures have to be taken to take care of the distressed productivity growth in both textiles and clothing industries in Austraha as evidenced from the mid 19802 ̆ 7 s and in textiles industry in Bangladesh in recent years. There is enough scope to improve efficiency level of textiles firms in Bangladesh and small and medium textiles and clothing firms in Austraha, which would help the productive performance of these firms and industries. For technological improvement, care has to be taken to use existing technology more efficientiy for Austrahan firms while for Bangladesh there it could be recommended that older and obsolete plants be replaced by the newer ones. To ensure effective microeconomic reform, it is necessary that benefits be appropriately channelled to the individual producers with a stronger institutional base and transparency of pohcies and the pohcy variables such as the ERA revaluated. New and small firms need to be assisted in Austraha and excess non production workers have to be identified and curtailed. For Bangladesh, adequate technical assistance to older textiles firms have to be accorded and to the new entrants in the clothing industry^ to keep pace with acquired efficiency and profitabihty. It could be feasible for both Austraha and Bangladesh to emphasize the clothing industry more given the ample potential to enhance efficiency, productivity and export and the need for a better performing sub sector beyond 2005...|$|R
30|$|We {{also show}} {{heterogeneous}} effects of minimum wage changes on employment: the employment effects of minimum wages are significant and negative in small firms and among less educated workers, but not in large firms and among workers with high school education and above. These {{findings are consistent with}} the theoretical predictions that small firms and less educated workers have little market power and are more responsive to minimum wage changes. We also find that when minimum wages are raised, job losses are more severe for <b>non-production</b> <b>workers.</b> Non-production employment is more adversely affected by increases in minimum wages perhaps because wages for <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> are closer to their MPL. This might be the case because firms tend have less market power in competing for low-skilled <b>non-production</b> <b>workers,</b> who can work in most industries. The analysis also yields clear gender differentiated effects of minimum wages: most of the non-production job losses are experienced by female workers. Lastly, the paper also finds that minimum wages are more correlated with average wages in small firms than in large firms. This indicates that wages in small firms are more binding, and an increase in minimum wages helps to increase the average wages in small firms.|$|E

The figures show that the wage densities for women are concentrated to the left of the line, but not for men with similarly low levels of education.

However, the complexity of measuring vibration along with other exposures such as force and posture has limited the number of workplace-based studies of upper extremity disorders that have included direct measurements of vibration. Data from this preliminary study was used to look at two issues: a comparison of vibration values between production and <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> when performing the same task, and a comparison of worker ratings of vibration comfort to direct measurement of tool vibration. Methods Eight experienced production workers used each of six metal fastening tools to install fasteners. Vibration was collected by 3 tri-axial accelerometers, one attached to the tool handle following ISO 5349 recommended locations, one attached to the hand dorsum on the 3 rd knuckle and one to the thumb side of the wrist. Data sampling rate was 10, 000 samples/second. Hand grip and feed forces were obtained using a Novel pressure sensing mat on the palm. Each trial consisted of installing 10 fasteners per tool {{for each of the}} 6 tools. The test set-up placed the wrist in the position typically used by the operator during production. Each worker documented subjective comfort and effort ratings on a seven point scale following each series of fastener installations. One series of testing was completed by three <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> inexperienced in fastener installation to simulate use of alternative employees for data gathering. Vibration data for each trial were acquired, digitized, and stored using Lab View. The X, Y, & Z axes were used to calculate the vector sum response for each tri-axial accelerometer. The tool data were digitally filtered following ISO recommendations. Calculated data consisted of the mean RMS over the tool 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s on- time, the starting and breaking peak impulses, and the peak of the frequency response. Results Production workers (n= 8) were right hand dominant males {{with a mean age of}} 55 years and normal hand strength (mean right grip = 106 lbs). <b>Non-production</b> <b>workers</b> (n= 3) had similar characteristics. We found large and statistically meaningful differences in hand force during tool use between production and <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> (mean production workers = 9. 77 lbs, mean <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> = 43. 30 lbs, p = 0. 0001). Vibration values obtained from the hand also showed a statistically meaningful difference (mean in production workers = 0. 67 Gs, mean in <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> = 1. 48 Gs, p = 0. 0014, figure 1). Experienced worker ratings of comfort during tool use demonstrated a moderate correlation with measured vibration (r= 0. 63). Worker ratings trended with direct recordings from the tool handle as shown in figure 2...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{literature}} on skill-biased technological change views both skilled and unskilled labour as variable inputs. In contrast, this study focuses on the role of skilled workers comprising overhead labour in the recent increase in skill demand. The first chapter focuses on the aggregate shift in skill demand, while succeeding chapters focus on the heterogeneity of this demand across firms. In the first chapter, I argue that the transition from Ford-style mass production toward mass customization in the 1980 s may be responsible for the increase in skill demand since introducing new goods requires fixed labour input, which is biased towards skilled workers. I present a dynamic general equilibrium model, which explains both the rapid growth in skill demand since the 1980 s and the recent puzzling slowdown since the late 1990 s. However, as the ratio of fixed to variable inputs cannot increase indefinfinitely, my model also predicts that the growth in skill demand will slow down in the long run. In the second chapter, using UK manufacturing data, I show that the employment share of <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> is positively correlated with firm size but negatively correlated with the latter over time. I argue that this serves as evidence for the existence of (partially) fixed skilled labour, with the premise being that firms with larger fixed input are both larger in size and have a higher share of <b>non-production</b> <b>workers.</b> However, short-run output expansion only increases variable labour, and therefore it decreases the employment share of <b>non-production</b> <b>workers.</b> In the third chapter, I present a second piece of evidence in support of the main thesis of this dissertation. I show that exiting firms as well as entering firms have a higher share of <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> in UK manufacturing industries. This phenomenon is rather puzzling as exiting firms have lower labour productivity, but nevertheless the finding presents itself as being consistent with the contention of this study that skilled workers constitute an overhead labour input...|$|E
30|$|To {{make sure}} the results are not driven by any {{critical}} economic events, we exclude the crisis years of 1997 and 1998. We show that for <b>non-production</b> <b>workers,</b> results are consistent for different time periods within our sample. In the case of production workers, {{we find that the}} effect of the minimum wage on employment varies in terms of cyclical economic activity.|$|E
30|$|Appendix {{presents}} {{the impacts of}} minimum wage on large firms. We do not observe any significant effects of the minimum wage on the employment of production workers (Appendix). This is probably for large firms, with more capital, the marginal productivity of each production worker is higher than that in small firms. Therefore, production workers in large firms are less affected by minimum wage changes. For <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> in large firms, the impacts of minimum wage changes are not as trivial. They reduce employment of <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> with junior- high and high school education and increase the employment of workers with less than primary education (Appendix). This result could indicate that large firms tend to substitute more educated workers (those {{more likely to be}} formal and earning the minimum wage) for less educated workers (who {{are more likely to be}} informal and paid under the minimum wage), while compliance may be going down and overall employment remained unchanged.|$|E
30|$|Results {{reveal that}} in general, the {{association}} between minimum wages and firms’ actual wages, for both production workers and <b>non-production</b> <b>workers,</b> is robust and significant. For production workers, a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages {{is associated with a}} 1.8 percent increase in wages in small firms, but only 0.8 percent increase in wages in large firms. For <b>non-production</b> <b>workers,</b> a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages is associated with a 1.65 percent increase in wages in small firms, but only 1.2 percent in larger firms. The association between minimum wages and actual wages is significant, of large magnitude in small firms, but less so in larger firms. This suggests that wages in small firms are more sensitive to changes in minimum wages, which is consistent with the fact that on average, wages in small firms are significantly lower. In other words, small firms are more likely to raise their wages in response to an increase in minimum wages because their wages are more binding.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the occupational structure of 25 European Union countries {{during the period}} 2000 – 2004. Shift-share analyses are used to decompose cross-country differences in occupational structure into within sector and between sectors effects. The static analysis for 2004 shows that the new member countries employ a lower share of skilled workers because their industry structure is biased towards less skill-intensive industries and because they use fewer skills within industries. The differences in the shares of (high-skilled) <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> are dominated by the between (industrial) effect. In contrast, the dynamic analysis of 2000 – 2004 showed that changes in the share of high-skilled <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> are mostly driven by within sector changes, which are probably related to skill-biased technological change. Similar trends in the countries’ within effects support the catch-up of the new member countries’ skills demand, while the structural developments that could equalize the industry mix of the new and old member countries are related to increased domestic demand and will probably take time. ...|$|E

I show that investment-specific technological change increases the relative demand of <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> to production workers, while TFP growth does not change labor composition. Moreover, I find that the demand of skilled labor is stronger in the durable goods sector whereas the deskilling effect is stronger in the non-durable goods sector. ...|$|E

The use of firm level data allows the inclusion of firm fixed effects, which significantly reduces the extent of endogeneity bias. The analysis focuses on understanding the effects in the manufacturing sector, which constitutes a significant formal component of the Indonesian labor force.|$|E

We exploit the firm panel data to estimate {{a set of}} firm fixed effects regressions. In addition, all regression specifications include year effects to capture time varying national macroeconomic factors, such as changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and financial crisis, which influence the economic environment in which all firms operate.|$|E

We allow for import and export effects to vary across plants and for plants to self-select into importing and exporting with some knowledge of their gains from such actions. Using an Indonesian manufacturing data set that contains the detailed plant-level information on workers ’ education levels, we apply the treatment effect framework developed by Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005, 2007 a,b) to identify the average effect of importing and exporting on skill demand across different sub-groups of plants, such as importers, non-importers, exporters, and non-exporters. We find {{that the effect of}} importing on skill demand among importers is substantially larger than among non-importers, providing evidence that the effect of importing on skill demand is heterogeneous and that plants self-selection into importing based on the gains from importing. The results also indicate a large positive effect of importing on skill demand both within production workers and within <b>non-production</b> <b>workers.</b> On the other hand, exporting leads to skill upgrading within <b>non-production</b> <b>workers</b> but it does not necessarily increase the skill demand for production workers. ...|$|E
