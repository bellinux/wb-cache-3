5|$|Although sea otters can be {{playful and}} sociable, they are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be truly social animals. They {{spend much time}} alone, and each adult can meet its own needs in terms of hunting, grooming, and defense.|$|E

5|$|A Viking funeral {{could be}} a {{considerable}} expense, but the barrow and the grave goods were <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have been wasted. In {{addition to being a}} homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships.|$|E
5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

5|$|Alexander H. Smith treated Gomphus as {{a section}} within Cantharellus in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America, {{as he felt}} there were no {{consistent}} characteristics that distinguished the two genera. In 1966 E.J.H. Corner described a small-spored variety, G.clavatus var. parvispora, from specimens collected in Uganda; it is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have independent taxonomic significance.|$|E
5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of}} the ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E

5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral ulceration is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces {{in addition to the}} mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.|$|E

5|$|From the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 onwards, the British built many pillboxes in Malta for defence {{in case of}} an Italian invasion. Many {{others were}} built during World War II. Many pillboxes still exist, {{especially}} on the north eastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have any architectural or historic value.|$|E
5|$|Saturn has 62 known moons, 53 {{of which}} have formal names. In addition, there is {{evidence}} of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40–500 meters in Saturn's rings, which are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings. Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Several {{varieties}} {{have been}} described. L. Ljubarskii published var. bulliardi and var. rubecens in 1975. Both of these varieties were published invalidly are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have independent taxonomic significance: variety rubescens is folded into synonymy {{with the main}} variety, while variety bulliardi is now considered synonymous with Trametes suaveolens. Variety tricolor, proposed by Appollinaris Semenovich Bondartsev and Rolf Singer in 1953, is now the independent species Daedaleopsis tricolor. Bondartsev described the form sibirica in 1953, but this is also no longer independent.|$|E

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|When young, it may {{be mistaken}} for the edible St George's {{mushroom}} (Calocybe gambosa) or the miller (Clitopilus prunulus). It {{has been responsible for}} many cases of mushroom poisoning in Europe. E.sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.|$|E
