50|$|The {{diameter}} of the opening in a <b>nest-box</b> {{has a very strong}} influence on the species of birds that will use the box. Many small birds select boxes with a hole only just large enough for an adult bird to pass through. This may be an adaptation to prevent other birds from raiding it. In European countries, an opening of 2.5 cm in diameter will attract Poecile palustris, Poecile montanus; an opening of 2.8 cm in diameter will attract Ficedula hypoleuca, and an opening of 3 cm in diameter will attract Parus major, Passer montanus, an opening of 3 cm in diameter will attract Passer domesticus.|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of <b>nest-boxes</b> {{is widely used}} as a conservation intervention to increase the availability of cavities for hole-nesting birds, particularly in managed forests, but it is uncertain whether <b>nest-boxes</b> are an appropriate substitute for tree cavities. Tree cavities and <b>nest-boxes</b> may differ in many aspects, including microclimate, but there are few data with which to examine this. We measured the air temperature and relative humidity in vacant tree cavities previously used by breeding marsh tits Poecile palustris (a non-excavating forest passerine) and in <b>nest-boxes</b> provided for this species that had similar dimensions to natural nest sites, and we compared values from both with ambient conditions. We examined how tree cavity characteristics influenced microclimate and if similar conditions were replicated in <b>nest-boxes.</b> Tree cavities, particularly those in thicker parts of trees, were more efficient thermal insulators, with temperature extremes dampened {{to a greater extent}} relative to ambient values. In contrast, the <b>nest-boxes</b> provided poor insulation with negligible buffering against ambient temperatures. Mean daily relative humidity was high (on average c. 90 %) in tree cavities, which all had walls of living wood, and this averaged 24 % higher than in <b>nest-boxes</b> at comparable ambient conditions (mean humidity 76 – 78 %). These results support previous studies that incorporated various types of tree cavities and <b>nest-boxes,</b> indicating that the environment within <b>nest-boxes</b> differs significantly from that of tree cavities. We conclude that providing <b>nest-boxes</b> may affect microclimatic conditions available for cavity-users, which may have ecological implications for nesting birds...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nest-boxes</b> {{have been}} used widely and for many decades in Europe and North America to {{increase}} avian reproductive success in species management and conservation programs and to increase the amenability and efficiency with which a species can be studied. Here we describe {{the establishment of a}} breeding population of Zebra Finches using <b>nest-boxes</b> in semi-arid, far-western New South Wales, over three breeding seasons (2005 – 07). The <b>nest-boxes</b> were used readily by Zebra Finches, with a total of 572 breeding attempts recorded in this study. After the introduction of <b>nest-boxes,</b> nearly all breeding attempts were made in these artificial cavities. Zebra Finches breeding in natural nests are prone to high levels of nest predation (> 60 % in previous studies), but such predation was almost completely eliminated with <b>nest-boxes,</b> with < 2 % of nests being depredated. Not surprisingly, the reproductive success of pairs breeding in <b>nest-boxes</b> (58 % of nests successfully fledged at least one young) was significantly higher than in the natural nests monitored at the same sites in a previous year, and by comparison with previous studies of the same species in other localities across Australia.

40|$|Context. Nest {{boxes are}} {{a useful tool}} in the reintroduction, {{conservation}} and monitoring of many hollow-using species. Aims. All forms of <b>nest-box</b> monitoring involve some form of invasion, often upsetting their continued use by occupants. We conducted a pilot study to investigate and validate the innovative use of temperature dataloggers (iButtons®) to remotely monitor <b>nest-box</b> use, leaving the <b>nest-box</b> occupants untouched. Methods. In captivity, iButton recordings revealed the duration and time of day when {{each of the three}} <b>nest-box</b> designs was occupied by Pseudocheirus occidentalis (western ringtail possums); the accuracy of occupancy data was validated by unobtrusive infrared video recording. In the field, where translocated P. occidentalis and naturally occurring Trichosurus vulpecula (common brushtail possum) populations are present, hair sampling at the <b>nest-box</b> entrances (in addition to iButton recording) was used to identify the mammal species present. Key results. <b>Nest-box</b> use by captive P. occidentalis validated iButtons as a useful remote-monitoring tool, with 10 h) periods of continuous occupancy (T. vulpecula only). In addition to the convenience (to researcher and animal) of continuous (24 -h) monitoring with minimal disturbance, a major advantage from using iButtons is that occupancy can be matched with environmental temperature or rainfall records, as well as other events (e. g. storms or frost). Conclusions. iButtons are a useful remote-monitoring tool of nest boxes, and it is possible that their use in this manner may be extended to tree-hollow occupation. Most importantly, this approach can inform us as to the conditions under which the nest boxes are used by fauna, as well as preferences for different <b>nest-box</b> designs. Implications. It {{is important to note that}} the criteria used for determining the presence or absence in the nest box (i. e. temperature difference, Tin - Tout, of 2 °C) in the present study will not be relevant for all <b>nest-box</b> designs and before using these methods, the thermal properties of the nest box or tree hollow will require investigation...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{noise levels}} are {{steadily}} increasing worldwide and may potentially affect many species. Short-term experimental noise exposure under field and lab conditions {{has revealed that}} noise can affect the behavior and physiology of birds. However, {{few studies have been}} able to link these short-term effects to longer-term consequences. Here, we report on 2 long-term noise exposure field experiments to assess the direct and indirect effects of noise on avian reproductive success. In one experiment, we provided 2 types of nesting sites in our study area, a <b>nest-box</b> with traffic noise broadcast inside, as well as a control <b>nest-box.</b> We found great tits (Parus major) to avoid breeding in noisy nest-boxes, in particular when they had both <b>nest-box</b> types available in their territory. Interestingly, we found blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) to breed more often in the noisy nest-boxes compared with the control nest-boxes. In another experiment, we randomly assigned <b>nest-box</b> treatments to breeding great tits after settlement and started noise exposure prior to egg laying or hatching. We found no significant effect of noise treatment on clutch size, number of fledglings, or any other life-history trait we measured. Our results show that great tits avoid breeding in noisy locations. Birds that are however forced to breed in noise, either through experimental manipulation or potentially through competitive exclusion, do not suffer from reduced reproductive success. Thus, anthropogenic noise can affect settlement behavior, but breeding inside a noisy <b>nest-box</b> has no reproductive consequences, at least not for great tits...|$|E
40|$|The use of nest-boxes {{to study}} bird {{breeding}} biology, as well their {{use as a}} management tool, is widespread. The exact placement of nest-boxes may affect individual preference for these breeding sites; however the influence of determinant factors (e. g., <b>nest-box</b> density) in occupation rates or breeding parameters has not been sufficiently covered. Here, we used the Eurasian Blue Tit as a model species to determine factors influencing nestbox selection in a transformed habitat: a pine plantation. Our study design consisted of 100 nest-boxes arranged at different heights (positioned >high> at 3. 0 - 5. 0 m, or positioned >low>at 1. 5 - 2. 0 m), andwith different degrees of clustering (clustered in groups of 6, or isolated by at least 80 mfrom the nearest <b>nest-box).</b> We calculated the potential territorial area for each <b>nest-box</b> and {{the distance to the}} nearest neighbour. We investigated the influence of <b>nest-box</b> position and breeding pair density on occupation rate and breeding success, controlling for habitat structure. Eurasian Blue Tits preferentially selected nestboxes located high on the tree and with fewest neighbours. Laying date was earlier in higher nest-boxes and in those with fewer neighbours and at a greater distance from the nearest neighbour. The number of nestlings was positively related to shrub cover andmedium tree height. Fledgling mass was higher when distance to the nearest neighbour was greater and fledgling tarsus length was positively related to oak-species abundance. Our results suggest that disentangling the important factors for <b>nest-box</b> placement and spatial dispersion in the landscape is important to adapt to species-specific requirements in each given habitat.

The wood mouse was recorded only 65 times (0. 395 %) using the artificial <b>nest-boxes</b> in nine sample areas, {{and based on}} this low frequency, the wood mouse {{can be considered as}} an occasional dweller of artificial <b>nest-boxes.</b> The resource selection index allowed checking the use respect to the availability of <b>nest-boxes</b> placed at different heights.

ANOVA results suggested that the box use was not related to any particular habitat or sample area feature, and it was slightly more pronounced from March to May.

To better target the conservation of the Barn Owl Tyto alba, we assessed the influence of the landscape structure on breeding performance in western Switzerland. The analyses considered a 23 -year data set of breeding parameters collected in an area dominated by intensive agriculture. Using a Geographic Information System approach, landscape characteristics were described around 194 nest sites. Our analyses showed that <b>nest-box</b> occupancy, laying date, clutch and brood size, egg volume and probability of producing a second annual clutch were not significantly associated with any of the eight principal landscape variables (agricultural land, woodland, urban area, hedgerows, cereals, sugar beet, maize and meadow). Nevertheless, the probability that a breeding pair occupied a <b>nest-box</b> decreased the more roads there were surrounding the <b>nest-box.</b> The absence of strong associations between habitat features and breeding parameters suggests that prey availability may be relatively similar between the different breeding sites.

40|$|Shortage of {{breeding}} sites {{is an important}} limiting factor of bird populations. Artificial breeding platforms, nest-boxes or man-made twig nests often present solutions with remarkable results, however long-term sustainability of these populations remains to be resolved. Furthermore, the question whether the inference of results of studies conducted on birds breeding in artificial breeding sites can be generalized to other populations, still remains open. Here we present the history, {{and the results of}} a 20 year old (1995 - 2015) <b>nest-box</b> programme initiated to increase potential breeding possibilities of Red-footed Falcons in an area, where nest-site shortage was a severe limiting factor. We show how various other species (Jackdaws, Kestrels and Long-eared Owls) have utilized these resources, and present descriptive statistics on their reproductive performance. Analysing the data of a total of 1432 breeding attempts, we show that Red-footed Falcons have similar clutch sizes, and nesting success (i. e. ratio of nests with at least on fledgling), however fledging success (ratio of the number of eggs/fledged nestlings) was different in artificial nest-boxes. When we excluded closed box types from artificial nests, this difference was not apparent. In case of Kestrels (n= 1626 breeding attempts) clutch size was significantly higher in artificial nests, while we found no difference in fledging or nesting success. When only comparing open boxes to natural nests, the difference in clutch size was no longer significant. We also analysed the effect of nest box design on reproductive parameters of the two species using regression trees. Inter annual effects were the most important in shaping clutch size and fledging rate of both falcon species, however we also found <b>nest-box</b> design effects, but only in Red-footed Falcons. In years when mean clutch size was high, these birds had lower clutch size in an older, darker <b>nest-box</b> type compared to an alternative design, and to open boxes. However, fledging rate in the same years was lower for both open boxes and older nest-boxes. We conclude that artificial colonies are an important and successful tool in Red-footed Falcon conservation, and that the breeding parameters measured in artificial colonies depend on <b>nest-box</b> design. We present correlative evidence that closed boxes have a significant positive species specific effect on reproduction, probably due to their protection against weather. We also show that birds may have a preference for a certain <b>nest-box</b> design, and that the breeding success in the less favoured box type may be similar to that in open nests. We recommend that future studies incorporate nest-type and <b>nest-box</b> design effects in all comparisons made on reproductive performance in case of Red-footed Falcons and Kestrels...|$|E

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{activity of}} the common dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius was studied in three different habitat types of central Italy: a deciduous beech wood dominated by Fagus sylvatica (Cimini Mountains), and a deciduous oak woodland with Quercus cerris and Q. pubescens and an evergreen wood dominated by holm oak Q. ilex, both along the central Tyrrhenic coast. In each site, 50 <b>nest-boxes</b> were fixed to trees and were monitored monthly for 2 years (May 1998 –April 2000). In the beech wood site, the species showed an annual biological cycle similar to that described for populations of central and northern Europe: dormancy in winter, from the first 10 days of November {{to the end of}} December; end of hibernation {{in the first half of}} April; reproduction between May and July. On the contrary, in the two coastal sites, <b>nest-boxes</b> were occupied from October to June, and the breeding period was in autumn, showing that a winter dormancy phase is absent, probably owing to the mild winter.

40|$|Ectoparasites {{are common}} in most bird species, but {{experimental}} evidence of their effects on life-history traits is scarce. We investigated experimentally {{the effects of the}} hematophagous hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) on timing of reproduction, nest-site choice, nest desertion, clutch size, and hatching success in the great tit (Parus major). When great tits were offered a choice on their territory between an infested and a parasite-free <b>nest-box,</b> they chose the one without parasites. When there was no choice, the great tits in a territory containing an infested <b>nest-box</b> delayed laying the clutch by 11 days as compared with the birds that were offered a parasite-free nesting opportunity. The finding that {{there was no difference in}} phenotypic traits related to dominance between the birds nesting in infested boxes and birds nesting in parasite-free boxes suggests that the delay is not imposed by social dominance. Nest desertion between laying and shortly after hatching was significandy higher in infested nests. There was no difference between infested and parasite-free nests in clutch size, but hatching success and hence brood size at hatching were significantly smaller in infested nests. <b>Nest-box</b> studies of great tits have been seminal in the development of evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral theory, but recently a polemic has arisen in the literature about the validity of the conclusions drawn from <b>nest-box</b> studies where the naturally occurring, detrimental ectoparasites are eliminated by the routine removal of old nests between breeding seasons.

From March to August in 2007, we monitored artificial nestbox use by secondary cavity-nesting birds, reproductive rates of birds in nestboxes, and breeding bird and plant communities in the two sample plots. Twenty of 50 boxes were used by secondary cavity-nesting birds, such as the songar tit (Parus songarus), yellow-rumped flycatcher (Ficedula zanthopygia), Eurasian nuthatch (Sitta europaea) and great tit (Parus major).

Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and PIE were higher in experimental plot while dominance index (λ) were lower. Indices of total breeding bird communities changed in the same way. Because secondary cavity-nesting bird and breeding bird communities are interrelated, these results may be attributed to the use of artificial <b>nest-boxes.</b> We conclude that nestboxes changed the distribution patterns of some secondary nesting birds and increased the population density and diversity of secondary nesting birds.

These results suggest that breeding-bird predation (the third trophic level) can be important in the regulation of interactions between oak and caterpillars (the first and second trophic levels, respectively).

40|$|Effects of sub-optimal housing on {{inactivity}} vary across {{species and}} experiments, probably because inactivity is heterogeneous, reflecting both positive states (e. g. relaxation) and negative ones (e. g. fear). We therefore aimed to identify specific subtypes of inactivity that could indicate poor welfare in mink, by comparing their behaviour in enriched and non-enriched conditions (the former having been previously demonstrated {{to be highly}} preferred by mink and to enhance their welfare). We assessed this in three groups of subjects, as well as after housing conditions were reversed for the last group. During live scans, inactive animals were scored for posture, location, and whether awake or apparently asleep. Data on temperament and physiological stress indicators were also collected for one group; these confirmed that non-enriched housing increased faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM; P = 0. 040). Non-enriched housing also increased locomotor stereotypy in females (sex × housing: P = 0. 004). Inactivity in the <b>nest-box</b> (vs. in the open cage) was higher among females in non-enriched housing (housing × sex: P 0. 05). This suggests that lying awake is not fear-related (e. g. not reflecting enhanced vigilance) but instead reflects some other negative state. Effects on inactivity subtypes as defined by posture were less consistent. For example, time spent lying belly down tended to decrease in mink moved from non-enriched to enriched cages (P = 0. 054), but enriched mink spent significantly less time belly down (in {{one of the three}} groups; P = 0. 002). Overall, two subtypes of inactivity, lying in the <b>nest-box</b> and lying awake seem likely to be valid indicators of housing-induced poor welfare in this species, being consistently increased by non-enriched cages. Lying in the <b>nest-box</b> may indicate fear or anxiety, and lying awake, a boredom-like state...|$|E

[...] et al. <b>Nest-box</b> {{installation}} {{to increase}} raptor numbers is an environmentally friendly technique to prevent vole plagues in agricultural systems {{that may help}} to reduce the dangerous use of anticoagulants. However, the high abundance of raptors may produce undesired effects on other non-target species of economic interest. Nest box installation on poles since 2009 increased population numbers of common kestrels Falco tinnunculus in our study agricultural areas, but also increased numbers of common buzzards Buteo buteo as they use poles as perches for hunting. We studied {{the effect of this}} raptor increase on the abundance of the red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa, a gamebird species of great socioeconomic interest in the Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose the abundance of kestrels, buzzards and partridges were monitored during five years by road surveys three times each year (April, July and November), in six agricultural areas of similar size (2000 ha each) and with (<b>nest-box</b> areas) and without (control areas) nest box installation. The three <b>nest-box</b> areas counted with 100 kestrel nest-boxes placed on poles. Our results showed that kestrel and buzzard number increases seems to have a negative effect during spring time on partridge abundances. However, a positive effect of raptor increase on partridge abundance was observed during summer time with no obvious effects on partridge abundances during winter. We suggest that partridges tend to avoid the high density of predators during the breeding season while just after breeding (July), higher densities of non partridge-specialist predators might provide protection to partridges against larger size raptors.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la 10 th European Vertebrate Pest Management Conference, celebrada en Sevilla (España) del 21 al 25 de septiembre de 2015. During last decades, {{the common}} vole (Microtus arvalis Pallas) colonized the {{agricultural}} {{lands of the}} Spanish northwestern plateau, where population outbreaks have occasionally caused significant crop damages. In these agroecosystems, there is an apparent imbalance {{in the relationship between}} avian predators and prey, probably influenced by a lack of adequate areas for the establishment, breeding and hunting of raptors. This is one of the causes that may be influencing common vole population dynamics, and causing crop damages. Thus, landscape modification to increase natural vole avian predators, could be an environmentally-friendly preventive tool to be considered into an integrated pest management strategy. An important question to be answered is the efficacy of this measure during a vole outbreak, when vole numbers would increase faster than those of their predators. Two different locations (Osorno la Mayor and Villarramiel) were provided with 100 <b>nest-boxes</b> (50 for barn owl and 50 for common kestrel) distributed in a 2000 ha surface. The effect of boxes in voles was studied considering the different habitats linked to these agricultural zones, including crops and vole reservoirs. During the campaign 2013 / 14, a common vole outbreak was detected in these areas. Considering the period between sowing and harvesting winter crops, data of distances, densities, raptor occupancy and breeding in <b>nest-boxes,</b> were used to generate informative covariates to be related with indexes of vole activity. In this contribution, preliminary results about the effect of the implementation of <b>nest-boxes</b> for raptors on the evolution of common vole abundance are reported. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|By {{providing}} nest boxes, {{previous studies}} have shown that nest sites are in short supply and limit the populations of several small passerines, including the Great Tit Parus major, the Blue Tit P. caeruleus, and the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. Can this influence their distribution over a range of small woodland patch sizes in a heterogeneous landscape? To investigate this, a study was conducted in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape, with a mixture of wooded patches and cropped fields, in southern Sweden. The descriptive part of the study involved mapping territories of the three species in 135 patches. These species avoided small (&lt; 1 ha, Pied Flycatcher) or very small (&lt; 0. 2 ha, the two tit species) forest patches in this landscape. In an experimental part, a subset of 34 patches, 0. 01 to 24 ha in size was used. Territories were mapped in a first year as a control. In a second year, patches were matched by size and vegetation and <b>nest-boxes</b> were provided in one patch of each pair. Territories were again mapped. Providing nestboxes increased the density of breeding Great Tits in patches of all sizes and expanded their use of very small patches. The <b>nest-boxes</b> increased the density of Pied Flycatchers in large patches but not in small patches. So, is the lack of territories in small patches due to shortage of nest sites? The outcome of the experiment suggests nest site limitation as a cause of the observed Great Tit discrimination against very small habitat patches. The lack of Pied Flycatchers in small patches must however have another basis than lack of nest sites. The effect of providing <b>nest-boxes</b> on Blue Tit distribution was inconclusive...|$|R
40|$|In a ringed {{population}} of Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) {{living in a}} Holm Oak (Quercus ilex) forest of Languedoc, Southern France, and provided with artificial <b>nest-boxes,</b> territorial behaviour {{plays a major role}} in limiting the number of breeding pairs. The experimental removal, or the spontaneous disappearance, of a breeding pair is followed by an increase in size of the territories of the neighbouring pairs, or by the arrivai of non-ringed juvenile individuals settling in the vacant territory. In a Holm Oak forest without artificial <b>nest-boxes,</b> territorial behaviour does not play such a role, as the major limiting factor in that case is the number of available tree-holes. Pairs of Blue Tits settled on territories where Downy Oaks (Quercus pubescens) are mixed with Holm Oaks, lay their eggs four days earlier on the average, than Blue Tits breeding in pure Holm Oak forest. However, the number of fledglings per brood, and their body weight at 15 days of age, tend to be smaller. The benefit of a la ter laying date in pure Holm Oak forest qui te likely lies in a better synchronization of the maximum nutritional requirements of the young, and of the period of maximum food availability in the environmen...|$|R
