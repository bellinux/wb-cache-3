40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} of glass waste generation rates from a sample of households distributed throughout the UK is presented. The effects of household size, age profile, and social class were evaluated in the study. The greatest explanatory value (r 2 = 0. 17) was obtained when households were classified into three categories: households with one person resident, <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> households {{with more than one}} person resident, and manual worker households with more than one person resident. At a mean of 28. 9 kg per household per annum, annualised glass waste generation rates were lowest among one-person households and highest (86. 7 kg per household per annum) among <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> households with more than one person resident. Coefficients arising from the analysis were used to predict household glass waste generation rates in 39 electoral wards in Birmingham. A model developed earlier by The Open University to predict the spatial distribution of glass recycled by households was also used to predict the quantity of glass taken to bottle bank sites by households in each of the 39 yards. Used in conjunction, the two models yielded estimates of the quantity of glass collected as waste in each of the 39 wards...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Type of work {{might be}} related to insulin {{resistance}} and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, scant data are available. We performed this study to investigate whether the prevalence of MetS and insulin resistance differed according to occupation in middle-aged men. Materials and Methods: In all, 2, 348 men in their 40 s∼ 50 s who had participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV were included and were classified into two groups according to the type of work (manual worker vs. <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker).</b> Diagnosis of MetS required satisfying three or more of the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Fasting insulin, the glucose/insulin ratio (G/I ratio), and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were used to estimate the insulin resistance. We used the Mann-Whitney test, χ 2 tests, multiple linear regression test, and logistic regression analyses to examine the relationships. Results: Age was significantly higher in the manual worker group. Body mass index was significantly lower in the manual worker group.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the prevalence of central obesity among adults with normal BMI and its association with metabolic diseases in Jilin Province, China. A population-based cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 2012 in Jilin Province of China. Information was collected by face to face interview. Descriptive data analysis and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of prevalence/frequency were conducted. Log-binomial regression analyses were used to find the independent factors associated with central obesity and to explore the adjusted association between central obesity and metabolic diseases among adults with normal BMI. Among the adult residents with normal BMI in Jilin Province, 55. 6 % of participants with central obesity self-assessed as normal weight and 27. 0 % thought their body weight were above normal. 12. 7 % of central obesity people took methods to lose weight, while 85. 3 % didn't. Female, older people and <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> had higher risk to be central obesity among adults with normal BMI. Hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia were significantly associated with central obesity among adults with normal BMI, the PRs were 1. 337 (1. 224 - 1. 461), 1. 323 (1. 193 - 1. 456) and 1. 261 (1. 152 - 1. 381) separately when adjusted for gender, age and BMI.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} of the French Cooperative PAARC (Pollution Atmosphérique et Affections Respiratoires Chroniques) survey, was to test whether occupational exposures to dusts, gases, or chemical fumes or to specific hazards, estimated by job exposure matrices, were related to a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). METHODS [...] The most recent occupation was recorded in adults, aged 25 - 59, from <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> households. Analysis was restricted to 10, 046 subjects whose occupation was encountered at least 10 times {{in the study and}} who performed good FEV 1 tracings. From occupational title, exposures to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and to specific hazards were classified in three categories (no, low, and high) with a British, a French, and an Italian job exposure matrix. Specific hazards were analysed for the British and French job exposure matrices for the same 42 specific dusts, gases, and chemical fumes. To limit spurious associations, a selection of seven hazard groups and 12 specific hazards was set {{before the start of the}} analysis. Based on the consistency of the relations according to sex and the British and French job exposure matrices, associations of age, height, city, and smoking adjusted FEV 1 score with occupational exposures were classified as very likely, possible, or unlikely. RESULTS [...] For the three job exposure matrices and both sexes clear exposure-response relations between the level of exposure to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and a decrease in FEV 1 were found. Associations with FEV 1 were classified as very likely for known hazards such as organic dusts and textile dusts, and not previously recognised hazards such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and detergents, and as possible for solvents, waxes and polishes, and diesel fumes. Associations found for PAHs and solvents were confirmed by the Italian job exposure matrix. Associations remained significant in women, but not in men, after adjustment for educational level. CONCLUSIONS [...] Hypotheses have been generated for exposure to detergents, PAHs, and solvents, but they need to be interpreted with caution before replication. Significant associations found for known risk factors with a decrease in FEV 1 are arguments for the validity of the matrices. Despite the expected limitations of job exposure matrices, these results encourage further work to improve exposure assessment by job exposure matrices...|$|E

The WAI is a complicated instrument and inconvenient for use in large-scale surveys. We investigated whether shortened versions of the WAI identify non-sicklisted workers {{at risk of}} LTSA. Methods: Prospective study including two samples of non-sicklisted workers participating in occupational health checks between 2010 and 2012. A heterogeneous development sample (N = 2899) was used to estimate logistic regression coefficients for the complete WAI, a shortened WAI version without the list of diseases, and single-item Work Ability Score (WAS). These three instruments were calibrated for predictions of different (a parts per thousand yen 2, a parts per thousand yen 4 and a parts per thousand yen 6 weeks) LTSA durations in a validation sample of non-sicklisted workers (N = 3049) employed at a steel mill, differentiating between manual (N = 1710) and non-manual (N = 1339) workers. The discriminative ability was investigated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: All three instruments under-predicted the LTSA risks in both manual and <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers.</b> The complete WAI discriminated between individuals at high and low risk of LTSA a parts per thousand yen 2, a parts per thousand yen 4 and a parts per thousand yen 6 weeks in manual and <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers.</b> Risk predictions and discrimination by the shortened WAI without the list of diseases were {{as good as the}} complete WAI.

We prospectively evaluated 1, 794 male workers aged 40 – 59, including 632 non-manual and 1, 162 manual workers, employed in a metal products factory in Japan. The hazard ratios of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular events (combined stroke, MI and sudden cardiac death) for manual workers were compared with <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> as estimated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Among the 1, 794 workers, there were 60 cardiovascular events (32 cases of stroke, 23 cases of MI and 5 cases of sudden cardiac death) with an incidence rate of 3. 14 per 1, 000 person-years for cardiovascular events; 1. 68 for stroke and 1. 20 for MI.

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} {{association}} between job strain (JS) and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in North Italian employed men, adopting a stratified analysis by occupational class (OC). Methods The study was conducted on 4103 working men, CHD-free at baseline, enrolled in population-based and factory-based cohorts. Risk factor measurements and follow-up procedures were carried out adopting the WHO MONICA standardised procedures. OCs were derived from the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero classification. JS categories were defined based on overall sample medians of psychological job demand (PJD) and decision latitude (DL) derived from items of the Job Content Questionnaire, satisfying construct validity criteria. Age-adjusted and risk factors-adjusted CHD HRs were estimated from Cox models, contrasting high-strain (high PJD and low DL) versus non-high-strain categories. Results In a median follow-up of 14. 6 years, 172 CHD events occurred, corresponding to a CHD incidence rate of 2. 78 / 1000 person-years. In the overall sample, high-strain compared with non-high-strain workers evidenced a 39 % excess CHD risk, not statistically significant. No association was found among managers and proprietors. Conversely, the HR of high strain versus non-high strain was 1. 78 (95 % CI 1. 20 to 2. 66) among <b>non-manual</b> and manual <b>workers,</b> with no substantial differences between them. The exclusion of the events occurring in the first 3 years of follow-up did not change the results.

40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that British workers {{have become more}} {{insecure}} over he last decade. This paper sets out to establish whether the popular assumption is correct. We examine changes in measures of workers' insecurity using direct measures of their unemployment expectations, using data colleted by the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative (SCELI) in 1986 and by the Skills Survey (SS) in 1997. The paper also investigates how closely subjective measures of insecurity are related to objective measures commonly used as proxies, and analyses how these expectations are determined. It finds that: i. In aggregate job insecurity, measured as the expected risk of job loss, has changed little, while the expected difficulty of regaining employment has fallen over the last decade. ii. Job insecurity has increased among <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers,</b> while it has fallen among <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers,</b> who were traditionally less secure in the first place. iii. Unemployment in the external labour market has a large impact onindividuals' expectations of unemployment and on their expectations of re-employment. vi.

40|$|Aims: A clear {{socioeconomic}} gradient in mortality emerged among diabetic {{people in}} Finland {{from the early}} 1980 s to the early 1990 s. The present study examines whether this development continued between 1991 and 2003. Methods: People with diabetes aged 30 – 79 in 1991 – 2002 were identified in the national registers, and followed up for mortality until 31 December 2003. The data comprised 1, 407, 025 person years and 59, 917 deaths. Results: From 1991 – 1994 to 1995 – 1999, the all-cause mortality among diabetic people decreased 20 % for men and 26 % for women among <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> compared with 14 % and 19 % respectively among manual workers. The socioeconomic differences increased particularly in mortality from coronary heart disease and causes related to smoking and excessive alcohol use. From 1995 – 1999 to 2000 – 2003 the socioeconomic mortality disparity remained stable except for emerging socioeconomic differences in neoplasm deaths among women. Persons with type 1 diabetes showed much larger socioeconomic differences in deaths from alcohol related diseases (RR: men 1. 97, women 2. 13) compared to persons with type 2 diabetes (RR: men 1. 20, women 1. 05). Conclusions: During the 1990 s disparities in mortality between socioeconomic groups among diabetic people increased due to a more favourable trend among <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> compared to manual workers in deaths from coronary heart disease and causes of death related to smoking and excessive alcohol use.

There is good evidence that changes in political and economic systems can lead to changing patterns of liver cirrhosis mortality. Socioeconomic inequalities in liver cirrhosis mortality have been periodically reported but there are few studies of changes in socioeconomic inequalities in liver cirrhosis mortality over time. This paper examines changes in socioeconomic inequalities in liver cirrhosis mortality in Australia for the period 1981 - 2002. Age standardised, liver cirrhosis mortality rates were calculated for occupational groupings for Australia 1981 - 2002. Occupations were grouped into non-manual and manual categories, and there was imputation for missing data. Despite decreasing overall liver cirrhosis mortality rates over time, liver cirrhosis mortality continues to account for about 3 % of all deaths. Manual workers have consistently experienced liver cirrhosis mortality rates which are twice or more the rate experienced by <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers.</b> These inequalities appear to have increased in recent years and currently appear to be at historic highs (manual workers have mortality rates of about 2. 5 times those of <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers).</b> Increasing socioeconomic inequalities in liver cirrhosis mortality in Australia suggest that lower SES groups have, over time, increased their level of harmful alcohol consumption relative to middle and higher SES groups. It is suggested that this might be attributed to a relative improvement in the affordability of alcohol over time. [Najman JM, Williams GM, Room R.

30|$|Böckerman et al. (2007) look at wage {{adjustment}} in Finland during {{the economic crisis}} suffered by that country in the early 1990 s. From 1990 – 1993 output in Finland fell by 14 %, and unemployment rose from 3 to 17 %. These indicators were much worse than those recorded during the American Great Depression, though similar to the economic collapse suffered by Ireland from 2008 – 2010. Böckerman et al. (2007) report that during the downturn, nominal wage cuts ranged from 17 - 36 % for manual workers in manufacturing. However, nominal cuts were almost completely absent for both service <b>workers</b> and <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> in the manufacturing sector, indicating significant wage rigidity.|$|R

The introduction of cartel laws in the UK in the late 1950 s caused an intensification of price competition in previously cartelised manufacturing industries, {{but it did not}} affect those industries which were not cartelised. The econometric results from a comparison of the two groups of industries provide strong evidence of a negative effect of collusion on labour productivity growth. There is no evidence of any effect of collusion on wages of manual or <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers.</b> These results are robust to controlling for the potential endogeneity of collusion...|$|R
