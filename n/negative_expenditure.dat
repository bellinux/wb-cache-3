40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effect of}} {{increasing}} labor (i. e. graduates’/ academics’) and student mobility on net tax revenues when revenuemaximizing governments compete for human capital by means of income tax rates and amenities offered to students (positive expenditure) or rather tuition fees (<b>negative</b> <b>expenditure).</b> We demonstrate that these instruments are strategic complements and that increasing labor mobility due to ongoing globalization not necessarily implies intensified tax competition and an erosion of revenues. On the contrary, the equilibrium tax rate even increases in mobility. Amenities offered to students (or rather tuition fees) may either increase or decrease, and, overall, net revenues increase. An increase in student mobility, however, erodes revenues due to intensified tax and amenity competition. labor mobility, student mobility, higher education, tax competition, public expenditure competition...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{comprehend}} food demand structure and its changes under rapid economic development theoretically and statistically. The recently developed Far East Asian countries, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were chosen to obtain implications for the food demand patterns in the future industrialized countries around the world. Food demands for nine food commodities, rice, bread/wheat, barley, beef, pork, chicken, fish, eggs, and milk were analyzed. The first three commodities are plant origin, the rest are animal origin. Study periods are from the early 1910 's to the end of 1980 's for Japan (the end of 1930 's to the early 1950 's were excluded because of the war period), and from the early 1960 's to the end of the 1980 's for both Korea and Taiwan. The importance of income growth on food demand changes in developing countries has been stressed. Many studies have been done based on a simple model using per capita income as the only explanatory variable, or at most including the prices of own and closely related commodities. This study employed a more versatile analytical framework, incorporating a wider range of cross price effects. This study has two main objectives; the first is to reconsider the effect of income growth on food demands, particularly to examine whether income elasticities change between various stages of economic development. The other is to evaluate non-economic factors that cause changes in food consumption patterns under economic development. Age-population composition and household size were two of the explanatory variables. A complete demand system by adding dynamic and demographic features to DEATON and MUELLBAUER's (1980 a, b) LA/AIDS model. Data were complied from various secondary sources. Price and quantity data sets passed nonparametric tests of stability of preferences. Two different estimation techniques; an iterative SUR (maximum likelihood) estimation and a single equation estimation using the homogeneity condition and first order autocorrelation were applied for the demand system. Assuming weak separability for the group of foods in the study, the expenditure elasticities calculated by the demand system were converted to the ones equivalent to income elasticities. Major findings were: 1) the impact of the "pure" income effect was not significant. However, effects of age-population composition changes and own and cross price effects were significant. The impacts from changes in own price level and/or age-population composition exceeded the impacts from changes in expenditure level most frequently for animal origin foods. Significant cross price effects between animal and plant origin foods were observed. 2) Various patterns of changes in income elasticities were observed. Unexpectedly, some animal origin foods such as beef, chicken, and eggs showed <b>negative</b> <b>expenditure</b> elasticities at low income level. This phenomenon was observed across countries and across time periods...|$|E

40|$|Tax {{expenditures}} are government indirect spending, {{hidden in the}} tax system, often used to support government’s social and economic objectives. Instead of directly allocating money for a particular objective, the government forgoes tax revenues from those who undertake activities that could achieve the objective. Therefore, tax expenditures should be analysed as government spending programs. Tax expenditure reporting and analysis has been a regular practice among many countries in the world, especially in developed countries, to ensure efficient and effective allocation of government resources and enhance government’s transparency. Unfortunately, despite having lavish tax incentives, the Malaysian government has not produced a tax expenditure report. As a result, tax {{expenditures are}} mistakenly analysed as aspects of the tax collection system rather than as part of spending programs. This thesis sets a foundation for tax expenditure reporting and analysis in Malaysia by identifying and analysing tax expenditures of Malaysia’s corporate income tax arising from all sources of tax law – tax legislation, case law and administrative practices. In addition, this thesis also identifies and analyses <b>negative</b> tax <b>expenditures</b> that provide disincentives to government-disfavoured activities. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether particular corporate income tax <b>expenditures</b> or corporate <b>negative</b> income tax <b>expenditures</b> should be removed, maintained or modified using the conventional tax expenditure analysis. Prior to identifying tax expenditures, elements of a benchmark tax structure are developed. This thesis contributes to new knowledge by proposing Malaysian accounting standards as the benchmark tax base to identify corporate tax expenditures. Any tax rules that deviate from the benchmark tax structure are analysed as tax expenditures (if they lower tax payable) or <b>negative</b> tax <b>expenditures</b> (if they increase tax payable). Conventional tax expenditure analysis commences with an assertion of (or speculation about) the apparent objective {{of each of the}} tax <b>expenditures</b> and <b>negative</b> tax <b>expenditures</b> being assessed, asking first whether there are justifiable reasons for the government to intervene in the market by offering subsidies or imposing penalties based on taxpayers’ behaviour. If government intervention can be justified, {{the next step is to}} propose the optimal vehicle to achieve the objective. The findings of this thesis reinforce doubts held by some about the effectiveness of tax expenditures as tools to promote government objectives. A number of the tax expenditures identified appear to be redundant, providing government support for companies to undertake actions that they would likely do even without the tax expenditures. Most tax expenditures in Malaysia are not accurately targeted; they only benefit profitable companies and thus miss many enterprises most in need of assistance. There are also tax expenditures that have lost their relevancy, including a few that were inherited from the British tax system. They have been forgotten or accepted as part of the normative tax system, and are left in the legislation with no revision. Most <b>negative</b> tax <b>expenditures</b> that are explicitly legislated have plausible reasons to stay in the tax system. However, implicit <b>negative</b> tax <b>expenditures</b> that stem from strict judicial interpretations have led to the denial of deductions for some normal business expenses. This is unfair to businesses. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the importance of tax expenditure reporting and analysis, particularly in Malaysia, to help the government in managing its resources and formulating better policies...|$|R

40|$|Mitochondrial {{respiratory}} {{capacity and}} oxidative stress have {{been implicated in}} the development of insulin resistance (IR) and type II diabetes. A causative role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the etiology of diet-induced IR has been suggested. Metabolic oversupply causes mitochondrial oxidative stress and leads to IR; however, how {{the other side of the}} metabolic balance equation, energy expenditure, may compensate for oversupply is less appreciated. Based on the principles of bioenergetics, in the condition of substrate oversupply without sufficient energy expenditure, the mitochondrial membrane potential ([delta psi subscript]m) is high and an exponential increase in superoxide generation occurs within a small range of [delta psi subscript]m exceeding about - 160 mV. The inverse occurs when the mitochondrial energy expenditure rises. In this context, it was hypothesized that a mild increase in energy expenditure can sufficiently attenuate the over-nutrition caused H[subscript] 2 O[subscript] 2 emission and IR.   To examine this hypothesis acutely, Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats received a lipid oral gavage with or without 1 h of subsequent low intensity exercise. Mitochondria of permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers were studied. The results show that, without a change in respiratory capacity, a single lipid loading quickly elevated [delta psi subscript]m, mitochondrial H[subscript] 2 O[subscript] 2 emitting potential ([subscript]mE[subscript]H 2 O 2) and reduced calcium retention capacity (an index of the resistance of mitochondrial permeability transition) in state IV and/or under "clamped" physiological state III respiration conditions. These effects can be quickly and sufficiently attenuated by a single bout of postprandial low intensity exercise. These findings provide evidence that mitochondrial H[subscript] 2 O[subscript] 2 production/emission and related effects, but not respiratory capacity, are acutely and dynamically regulated by the metabolic status of skeletal muscle.   Further, to examine this hypothesis chronically, S-D rats were high fat diet (HFD, 60 %) fed for 7 weeks with or without either low intensity exercise or [beta]-guanidinopropionic acid ([beta]-GPA), which chronically elevates mitochondrial energy turnover. The results show that HFD decreased insulin action and increased [subscript]mE[subscript]H 2 O 2, whereas both were preserved by either exercise or [beta]-GPA. The treatment effects of HFD, exercise or [beta]-GPA were mitochondrial respiratory function and fatty acid oxidation rate independent. However, 5 '-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, an energy sensing kinase that increases glucose uptake, was also increased by [beta]-GPA treatment. To determine whether AMPK mediated the [beta]-GPA-induced improvements in insulin action, skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific AMPK [alpha] 2 catalytic subunit dominant negative mutated (non-functional) mice and their wild-type littermates were fed a HFD with or without [beta]-GPA for 10 weeks. [Beta]-GPA treatment again prevented the increase in [subscript]mE[subscript]H 2 O 2 and IR in both wild-type and AMPK[alpha] 2 dominant negative mice fed a HFD. These findings indicate that AMPK[alpha] 2 does not mediate the effects of [beta]-GPA on insulin action, supporting the hypothesis that the reduction in mitochondrial H[subscript] 2 O[subscript] 2 emission is a primary mechanism by which exercise and [beta]-GPA attenuate HFD-induced IR.   In the context of both acute and chronic manipulation of positive (oversupply) and <b>negative</b> (<b>expenditure)</b> cellular energy balance, together these findings support the concept that the governance of mitochondrial oxidant production is a primary factor regulating insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Following the principles of bioenergetics, these data demonstrate that a mild increase in energy expenditure can sufficiently attenuate the HFD-induced H[subscript] 2 O[subscript] 2 emission and IR. On the mitochondrial level, the balance of substrate supply and energy expenditure on a daily basis is critical for maintaining a proper cellular redox environment, function and whole body metabolic status.   Ph.

40|$|This report lists 290 tax {{expenditures}} and, where possible, {{provides an}} estimate of the dollar value or order of magnitude of the benefit to taxpayers. Introduction A tax expenditure arises where the actual tax treatment of an activity or class of taxpayer differs from the benchmark tax treatment. 	Tax expenditures typically involve tax exemptions, deductions or offsets, concessional tax rates and deferrals of tax liability. 	 	A positive tax expenditure reduces tax payable relative to the benchmark. A <b>negative</b> tax <b>expenditure</b> increases tax payable relative to the benchmark. 	  Benchmarks represent a standard taxation treatment that applies to similar taxpayers or types of activity. 	 	Benchmarks may also incorporate structural elements of the tax system; for example, the progressive income tax rate scale for individual taxpayers. 	 Determining benchmarks involves judgment. Consequently, the choice of benchmark may be contentious and benchmarks may vary over time. The choice of benchmark should not be interpreted as indicating a view on how an activity or taxpayer ought to be taxed.   	To facilitate discussion and understanding of the impact of using different benchmarks, the 2013 TES included an illustrative case study which showed the differences in the estimates for superannuation tax expenditures if an expenditure tax benchmark was used rather than the usual income tax benchmark — see Appendix A, 2013 Tax Expenditures Statement. Although that exercise has not been repeated for this year’s TES, the conceptual points that were discussed in the 2013 TES remain.    ...|$|R

The integration of Belgian agricultural policies in the Common Agricultural Policy in 1968 coincided with an increase in protection, ceteris paribus.

Both direct and indirect effects are observed for mother’s education which directly reduces not just fertility but also increases mother’s potential wages or opportunity costs which would deter her from having a baby. Second, father’s education becomes increasingly important in reducing fertility in the last two rounds. Third, the <b>negative</b> effect of <b>expenditure</b> on fertility is found when it is treated as exogenous, but not once instrumented. Fourth, pseudo panel models for three rounds of NSS and NFHS are estimated to confirm the negative effects of parental education. Finally, state-wise regression results show that fertility determinants are different in different states. Our results suggest that national and state governments should improve social infrastructure, such as school at various levels, promote both male and female education, and facilitate female labour market participation to slow down population growth. These policies would be particularly important in backward states or for socially disadvantaged groups (e. g., scheduled castes) which still have higher fertility as well as poverty rates. ...|$|R

Several approaches used to examine this issue are summarized. Studies of economic impact are reviewed which estimate the effects of the expenditures of institutions, their students, employees and visitors upon local income, sales, employment and tax revenues and are contrasted with the present study. ^ The principle research question is whether the presence of institutions of higher education, examined by type and by control and by major object of expenditure, have an effect upon the economic welfare of the counties where they are located, as measured by the level of per capita income in those counties. Neoclassical regional economic theory is used to develop a model. In a cross-sectional analysis of U. S. counties, 1987 demographic and economic data are merged with 1987 higher education expenditure, employment and enrollment data in a national data base of county-level data. ^ Ordinary least squares regression analysis is used to determine if the presence of higher education institutions is a cause of higher mean levels of per capita income in counties where they are located. Parameters are estimated for a national model and for each of four U. S. economic regions. ^ The study finds that the presence of students depresses the reported level of per capita income in counties, especially those with four-year institutions. The effect of institutions upon economic welfare is positive, however, due to the positive effect of expenditures on research. The presence of private four-year institutions has the most positive impact upon county-level per capita income. ^ The Northeast region has the highest density of counties with higher education institutions and, when compared with other regions, experiences the greatest positive impact of higher education upon county-level per capita income. ^ Dichotomous variables representing urban and rural areas and public and private expenditures found that higher education in urban areas is a positive influence upon per capita income and that both public and private expenditures are positive and statistically significant in understanding inter county differences in per capita income. ^ Whereas research expenditures of four-year institutions positively impact the level of per capita income, while {{the impact of}} two-year institutions is <b>negative,</b> instruction <b>expenditures</b> of two-year colleges are positive and statistically significant in explaining inter county differences in the level of business volume as measured by the level of per capita sales. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective. This study aims {{to provide}} a better {{understanding}} of the amounts spent on different malaria prevention products and the determinants of these expenditures. Methods. 1, 601 households were interviewed about their expenditure on malaria mosquito nets in the past five years, net re-treatments in the past six months and other expenditures prevention in the past two weeks. Simple random sampling was used to select villages and streets while convenience sampling was used to select households. Expenditure was compared across bed nets, aerosols, coils, indoor spraying, using smoke, drinking herbs and cleaning outside environment. Findings. 68 % of households owned at least one bed net and 27 % had treated their nets in the past six months. 29 % were unable to afford a net. Every fortnight, households spent an average of US $ 0. 18 on nets and their treatment, constituting about 47 % of total prevention expenditure. Sprays, repellents and coils made up 50 % of total fortnightly expenditure (US$ 0. 21). Factors positively related to expenditure were household wealth, years of education of household head, household head being married and rainy season. Poor quality roads and living in a rural area had a <b>negative</b> impact on <b>expenditure.</b> Conclusion. Expenditure on bed nets and on alternative malaria prevention products was comparable. Poor households living in rural areas spend significantly less on all forms of malaria prevention compared to their richer counterparts. Breaking the cycle between malaria and poverty is one of the biggest challenges facing malaria control programmes in Africa...|$|R
40|$|Common to both {{acute and}} chronic disease are {{disturbances}} in energy homeostasis, which {{are evidenced by}} quantitative and qualitative changes in dietary intake and increased energy <b>expenditure.</b> <b>Negative</b> energy balance results in loss of fat and lean tissue. The management of patients with metabolically-active disease appears to be simple; it would involve the provision of sufficient energy to promote tissue accretion. However, two fundamental issues serve to prevent nutritional demands in disease being met. The determination of appropriate energy requirements relies on predictive formulae. While equations {{have been developed for}} critically-ill populations, accurate energy prescribing in the acute setting is uncommon. Only 25 – 32 % of the patients have energy intakes within 10 % of their requirements. Clearly, the variation in energy expenditure has led to difficulties in accurately defining the energy needs of the individual. Second, the acute inflammatory response initiated by the host can have profound effects on ingestive behaviour, but this area is poorly understood by practising clinicians. For example, nutritional targets have been set for specific disease states, i. e. pancreatitis 105 – 147 KJ (25 – 35 kcal) /kg; chronic liver disease 147 – 168 kj (35 – 40 kcl) /kg, but given the alterations in gut physiology that accompany the acute-phase response, targets are unlikely to be met. In cancer cachexia attenuation of the inflammatory response using eicosapentaenoic acid results in improved nutritional intake and status. This strategy poses an attractive proposition in the quest to define nutritional support as a clinically-effective treatment modality in other disorders...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{growth and}} {{necessity}} entrepreneurship are closely and positively linked (Frederick, 2004); and this study explores {{the phenomenon of}} the South African necessity entrepreneur. The necessity entrepreneur is someone who never considers starting or owning a business until there is no other option (Kroll, 2003). This paper examines South African necessity entrepreneurs (NE) in light of propositions cited in the literature that NE is associated with three factors: positively with economic growth (real GDP growth rate), positively with unemployment (unemployment rate), and negative with a generous welfare system (expenditures on social security). The study of these factors are cited in three propositions: P 1 : There is a positive association between unemployment and NE. P 2 : There is a <b>negative</b> association between <b>expenditures</b> on social security necessity entrepreneurship. P 3 : There is a positive association between NE and economic growth. South Africa's moderately high levels of NE (albeit low relative to other developed countries) coupled with high unemployment rates and low social security expenditure are complimentary to assumptions in proposals 1 and 2. There is also a distinct positive relationship between NE and economic growth. Research findings accept Proposals 1, 2 and 3 (in the South African context only). As a prior it is also proposed that many of these entrepreneurs have unique psychological needs, such as lack of self-esteem and fear of family's survival, due to never being prepared for entrepreneurship. The relationship between NE and education is also highlighted. Policy implications are recommended towards increasing entrepreneurial behaviour, particularly amongst young adults...|$|R
40|$|Sustaining {{a healthy}} body weight relies on {{maintaining}} energy balance. Energy balance describes the relative energy intake (dietary) {{to the energy}} expenditure (cellular energy and physical activity). In order to decrease adiposity, energy balance needs to be shifted <b>negative,</b> heightening energy <b>expenditure</b> so that it outweighs energy intake. The most malleable and cost effective method of energy balance manipulation is increasing physical activity. Diet and food intake can also be manipulated to reduce energy intake, however this can become quite costly and time consuming, particularly {{for those who are}} time poor and uneducated in healthy and low calorie foods. High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to increase fat loss more effectively than continuous moderate intensity training (Tremblay et al., 1994; Trapp et al., 2008; Macpherson et al., 2011; Gremeaux et al., 2012), which is optimal for fat oxidation rates and was once considered the best exercise type employed to lose body fat. A recent study attributed this enigma to the rapid burst of intense exercise with the slight restorative effect of interspersed work and passive rest. Although the aforementioned studies were training studies, this study used single bouts of workload matched HIIE and moderate intensity, continuous exercise (CON) and found similar levels of fat utilisation between the two trials as well as significantly greater plasma and urine purine nucleotides post HIIE compared to CON, potentially resulting in greater energy loss. This thesis aims to measure metabolic profiles for a range of HIIE models to understand the mechanism and determine which may be best at inducing an energy deficit that can lead to elevating energy expenditure, hence more rapid reductions in fat mass observed with HIIT...|$|R

40|$|In chapter 1, I {{estimate}} and decompose {{the welfare}} benefit of Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s {{universal health care}} policy, {{also known as the}} “ 30 Baht program”. The total welfare impact of the 30 Baht program is defined as the amount of consumption that an enrollee would need to give up so as to leave her with the same expected utility as without the 30 Baht program. I find that the total welfare benefit is approximately 75 cents per dollar of government spending. The main source of the welfare effect can be attributed to improved consumption smoothing rather than increases in the consumption level. Using the difference in differences method, I find that the effect of the 30 Baht program on income is significantly positive, while the effect on consumption is slightly negative but not significant. This implies that the 30 Baht program has a positive impact on savings and future consumption, rather than current consumption. In chapter 2, I investigate into the effect of the 30 Bath program on drinking and smoking behaviours. This effect is decomposed into the moral hazard component, the increased utilization component and the increased life expectancy component in the framework. Using Townsend Thai project monthly surveys, I estimate the average treatment effect of the program by difference in differences using households of government employees as the control group. I also use quantile regressions to study the treatment effect heterogeneity. Although the estimated average treatment effects of the 30 Baht program on smoking and drinking behaviours are not statistically significant, the quantile regression estimates suggest that (1) the effects of the program on smoking/drinking <b>expenditure</b> are <b>negative</b> at the 10 th percentile, and (2) the 30 Baht program <b>negative</b> affects smoking/drinking <b>expenditure</b> even though the moral hazard component and the increased utilization component are isolated. In chapter 3, with Tenzin Yindok, we investigate into the effect of Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s 2003 black market lottery crackdown on households 2 ̆ 7 gambling behaviours and consumption-saving behaviours. We estimate the average treatment effect by difference in differences technique using annual household spending on black market lottery as a continuous treatment variable. We find that the crackdown resulted in a statistically significant decrease in black market lottery activities, and an increase in participation and spending on government lotteries, although this increase is not commensurate with the reduction in black market gambling. Our main results on consumption and saving suggest that households responded to the policy by increasing their savings, without any statistically significant increase in non-gambling related consumption. We further find that the statistically significant and positive result on saving is driven by households in the poorest quintile and households in the richest quintile. The former effect is also the largest in terms of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} {{have raised}} concerns in consumer’s minds about food safety associated with meat world-wide. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) both exist in Canada and consumer markets for beef, bison, elk and deer {{may have been}} affected by the diseases. While numerous studies have examined Canadian consumer beef purchasing behavior in the presence of BSE (Lomeli (2005), John(2007)), no examination {{of the impact of the}} animal diseases on consumer behavior for households who consume bison, elk and venison as part of their protein intake has been undertaken. In this study, meat consumption behavior for these specific households is examined, in particular, examining meat substitution possibilities between the exotic meats and domestic meats such as beef, pork, chicken, turkey and seafood. CWD was discovered on a Canadian elk farm in 1996 (CFIA) and since has been found on deer and elk farms and in the wild in Saskatchewan and Alberta. While to date no bison have been found with BSE, many of the trade bans put in place at the time of BSE have affected the bison market and consumers may associate bison with BSE through media coverage of the disease and trade barriers. In addition to examining the possible links between food safety concerns and consumption, the demographic characteristics of the households who consume exotic meats, and their responses to relative prices and other economic variables are modelled. No other empirical study exists on Canadian revealed meat purchasing behavior focused on these specific meats. Hobbs et al (2006) examined the potential market for bison in Canada. There are a number of past studies investigating the impact of food safety information reported in the media and product recalls on food demand. For many recent studies of consumers’ behavior associated with meat demand and food safety concerns, the linear approximate almost-ideal demand system (AIDS) model has been popular and used. In this study, the behaviour of selected households that include bison, elk and venison meat as part of their total meat consumption will be examined. The revealed impact of BSE and CWD incidences on these household’s behavior will be examined using a linear approximate almost-ideal demand system (LA/AIDS) model. Using theoretical concepts, model development can be explained as follow. First the usual LA/AIDS budget share demand functions using a Stone price index to avoid non-linearity are developed. To represent a system of demand functions, a set of three theoretical restrictions – homogeneity, symmetry and adding-up – are imposed and tested. To capture the influence of demographic and food safety factors, like BSE and CWD incidence, on meat consumption, Pollak and Wales (1981) proposed linking the demographic characteristics to the AIDS model as translation tools (Jones et al, 2003). Therefore, following the demographic translating method, demographic data and BSE, CWD media information (collected from tracking print media coverage of the two animal diseases from a national newspaper, in this case from the “Globe and Mail (Canada) ”) are incorporated into the LA/AIDS model and the extended demand function can be expressed as follows:, where, is the budget (expenditure) share of the ith good; is the intercept net of demographic and food safety effects; is the demographic variables and food safety media indices; are the prices deflated by CPI; and ln Y is the log of total expenditure. In this study, eight types of meats – Bison, Elk, Venison, Beef, Pork, Chicken, Turkey, and Seafood – are used and from the adding up property of the LA/AIDS demand system, one expenditure share equation (seafood) from the system is excluded. Using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation procedures, the above equations are estimated simultaneously. This study used annually aggregated Homescan™ household data (ACNielsen) for the years 2002 to 2008. The price data for bison, elk and venison are from ACNielsen Market TRack. Bison prices are computed as an average of retail prices of ground bison, roast bison and steak bison. For elk and venison, the annual average retail price of all types of elk and venison are calculated. Since there are no regional price indices for bison, elk and venison, the prices used for bison, elk and venison are the same for all provinces. Chicken and turkey regional retail prices are obtained through Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) web page. For beef and pork, national retail prices are derived as follows: the national retail prices of beef are computed as an average of prices of round steak, sirloin steak, prime rib roast, blade roast, stewing beef and ground beef. The national retail price of pork is approximated by the price of pork chops. In the next step, regional beef and pork retail prices are calculated by multiplying national retail prices of beef and pork with the regional price indices of beef and pork divided by the national price indices of beef and pork. The media coverage for BSE and CWD cases were collected from the Globe and Mail (Canada) through Factiva. com’s search criteria. For the household demographic data, dummy variables are used for the data defined in index numbers, which are language, region, household size, age of children, education of household head, and location (rural or urban). The midpoints are used for demographic data defined in value terms, such as the age of household head and household income. Because households who consumed the above exotic meats are not the same in all years, an unbalanced panel data for 2002 to 2008 was used in this study. Among total households (9304) surveyed by ACNielsen in 2006, only 7. 4 percent consumed these exotic meats. If the sample for 2006 in the analysis is compared to the total population from 2006 census of Canada, for example, the sample contains 66 (34) percent of households with size less than or equal to 2 members (greater than or equal to 3 members), while 2006 census population exhibits a breakdown of 60 (40) percent. Similarly, for the sample, data on children’s age and being present in the family, the sample contains 30 (71) percent for the presence of children 18 years and under (none), which is a close representation of the 2006 census population of 26 (74) percent. Meat expenditure shares for bison (3 %), elk (2 %) and venison (2 %) are relatively low as compared to those of beef (35 %), pork (18 %), chicken (26 %), turkey (6 %) and seafood (7 %) in the 2006 surveyed data. However, a significant increasing trend in expenditure share from 2002 to 2008 can be observed for bison (2 to 4 percent), elk and venison (0. 6 to 3 percent). A decreasing trend in beef (41 to 34 percent), pork (19 to 17 percent), chicken (27 to 25 percent), and a slightly increasing trend for turkey (4 to 5 percent) and seafood (5 to 8 percent) are also observed for the sampled households. Therefore, exotic meat types are tending to be consumed slightly more replacing domestic meat types beef, pork and chicken. From the results, it can be observed that all the own price elasticities have <b>negative</b> signs and <b>expenditure</b> elasticities have positive signs as a priori expectation showing the right curvature of underlying expenditure function and downward sloping demand (expenditure share) functions. Since the expenditure elasticities for beef, pork and chicken are slightly greater than 1, we may say that they are normal good to slightly luxury goods. Seafood, turkey, bison, elk and venison are normal to necessity goods. More interesting factors can be figured out from the results of demographic characteristics and BSE/CWD media indices. For example, 1) preferences for meat types are different across provinces; 2) pork and turkey are preferred by more English speaking people than French speaking people; 3) the larger the household size, the more elk and venison will be consumed; 4) the households with children under 18 consume less beef and more chicken; 5) elk, venison and turkey consumption increase and beef consumption decreases as income increases; 6) higher educated household heads choose more chicken, seafood and less elk, venison and pork; 7) urban people prefer more pork and less seafood; and 8) consumption will switch from beef/bison to elk/venison/turkey at the time of BSE reports and vice versa for CWD reports.
