500|$|The {{nonlinear}} narrative involving Joan's storyline and Don's Jaguar pitch was [...] "a {{solution to}} how to tell the story" [...] according to Weiner. [...] "The ordering of those events really was a problem {{and we got to}} a point where we can either show Don doing the pitch, or show Joan being with the guy, but we can't do them both," [...] he said, explaining that he felt [...] "if Don gives the pitch after [...] seen Joan do this, {{no one is going to}} listen to a word that he says. It doesn't matter how good it is. [...] <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he could have won." ...|$|E

60|$|LETTY. I {{do think}} people are horrible, always {{thinking}} things. It's not as if Molly were a stranger. She's my own cousin. I 'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> anything about my own cousin. I simply won't.|$|E

6000|$|... "What do I mean?" [...] {{repeated}} Lingard, slowly. [...] "Why, you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make me <b>believe</b> you did {{not know}} your wife was Hudig's daughter. Come now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{was the way}} {{in which}} John Eames avenged himself. Sir Raffle turned his face upon his private secretary, and his face was very black. Johnny bore the gaze without {{dropping}} an eyelid. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand it, and he may as well know that at once," [...] Johnny said to one of his friends in the office afterwards. [...] "If he ever wants any thing really done, I'll do it;--though it should take me twelve hours at a stretch. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pretend <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> all the lies he tells me about the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If that is {{to be part of the}} private secretary's business, he had better get somebody else." [...] But now Sir Raffle was very angry, and his countenance was full of wrath as he looked down upon his subordinate minister. [...] "If I had come here, Mr. Eames, and had found you absent, I should have been very much annoyed, very much annoyed indeed, after having written as I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{paused and}} resumed in a curt, businesslike manner: [...] "Daly's tale is {{plausible}} {{and may be}} true, but I have my doubts. Anyhow, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it because that doesn't suit my plans. We'll have Walters tried for murder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Laura {{takes it}} awfully hard, but I don't think she ought to--at least not yet," [...] {{said the girl}} from Star Ranch. [...] "There {{may not be a}} word of truth in the story. Anyway, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it until they prove it." ...|$|E
60|$|LETTY. Don't! Suppose they are! If joy were to hear it'd {{be simply}} awful. I like Molly. I 'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{anything}} against her. I don't see {{the use of}} it. If it is, it is, {{and if it is}} n't, it is n't.|$|E
5000|$|Baldwin {{was raised}} as an Evangelical Christian and often shares {{on social media}} {{quotations}} from the Bible: [...] "I was raised in church. I {{was brought up in}} that life, and I think that it's very important for everybody {{to be in touch with}} their spirituality and to have a relationship with God. <b>Not</b> everybody is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in the God that I believe in, but it's something that I'm not afraid to share with people because I know how it inspires me - how it positively affects my life .... I think that God kind of put me in the place in my life to not be quiet about it, not be quiet about him, but to reach people and to inspire people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I am delayed, my good André, then anyhow {{the game}} is up. But we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{anticipate}} misfortune and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in our lucky star." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most pictures," [...] he said, [...] "have two sides, but we {{need only}} look at one. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that we shall get them. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} the only true thing that fellow Selingman ever said: that our lesson had come {{before it is too}} late. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the heart and conscience of the nation is still a live thing. If it is, dear, the end is certain. And I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it is!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{carriage}} was {{preceded by}} the Kingston Brass Band, producing throbbing martial melodies, and followed (we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the State Tribune any longer) by a jostling' and cheering crowd. The band halts before the G.A.R. Hall; the candidate alights, with a bow of acknowledgment, {{and goes to the}} private office until the musicians are seated in front of the platform, when he enters to renewed cheering and the tune of [...] "See, the Conquering Hero Comes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Principle! I {{should like}} to see who has better {{principles}} than Guy!' cried Mr. Edmonstone. 'You have said so yourself, fifty times, and your aunt has said so, and Charles. I could as soon suspect myself.' He was growing vehement, but again Philip's imperturbability repressed his violence, and he asked, 'Well, what evidence have you? Mind, I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it without the strongest. I don't know that I would believe my own eyes against him.' ...|$|E
60|$|When a {{young lady}} states that she is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> a thing, good judges of human nature {{generally}} give up the case; but Miss Silence, to whom the language of opposition and argument was entirely new, could scarcely give her ears credit for veracity in the case; she therefore repeated over exactly what she said before, only in a much louder tone of voice, and with much more vehement forms of asseveration--a mode of reasoning which, if not strictly logical, has at least the sanction of very respectable authorities among the enlightened and learned.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep {{open house}} {{for all the}} poor of London,' pursued Pancks. 'You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lodge 'em for nothing.

6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> open {{a book or}} read a newspaper. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{write to}} a single soul except you. I'll be obliged to report to you, won't I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be French, and sceptical, and sneering? You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{think it}} {{a sign of}} wisdom to refuse to admire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe such}} things," [...] {{at last she}} snapped out, [...] "and I don't disbelieve them. I just let 'em alone. What do I know about 'em? Ruth tells me a story; and I believe her. I know what she saw beforehand, came true in a most {{remarkable}} way. Well, I'm sure I've no objection. One thing may be true, or another, for all me; but, just because I believe Ruth Sullivan, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> right and left, all the stories in Cotton Mather, and all that anybody can hawk up to tell.

6000|$|... "It's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop my pitching, Gif," [...] {{answered}} the young pitcher. His hand stung as if burnt by fire, {{but he was}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> admit it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let her be." [...] He {{turned on}} the rising young journalist, and his massive face was unusually massive and his voice fine and full and fruity. [...] "Do you think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make our public believe {{anything}} simply because it's true? They know perfectly well what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> and what they aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> and they aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> anything about mermaids--you bet your hat.

6000|$|He {{turned over}} {{a paper on}} his desk. [...] "You didn't know, of course," [...] he said.

5000|$|Rev. Francis Engels was {{the subject}} of {{numerous}} complaints, but accusers say the bishop ignored them until the accusers went to the news media in the early 1990s. Myers suspended Engels, but later attempted to re-instate him. Myers later said that he [...] "didn't realize they would be so upset" [...] about re-instatement. [...] In 2005, Engels plead guilty (in an Alford plea) to molesting a Peoria altar boy on trips to Milwaukee in the early 1980s; the victim said Engels told him, [...] "If you tell anybody, they're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> you".In May 2002, When the Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse was reorganized in late 2002, Myers was one of three bishops no longer on the committee.|$|E
5000|$|I {{have long}} {{recognized}} Judge Mitchell {{as one of}} the best judges in this country, and have come to know also the opinion held of him by lawyers competent to pass on an opinion on such a question [...] [...] [...] Pray do not allow your state to lose the services of such a man. To keep him on the bench is a service not merely to Minnesota, but to the whole country and to the law. Your state it is that is now on trial before the country. The question is: Can Minnesota appreciate such a man? Is it worthy to have him? I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a state which can command the services of one of the few judges in the country that stand out among their fellows as pre-eminent, that give it distinction, will refuse to accept these services.|$|E
5000|$|Warren: When I {{was there}} Vanderbilt {{we had some}} fine teams. There was Alf Sharp - he was an All-Southern center at one time. He looked like a badly formed pirate; he was really a menacing looking man. He was two years ahead of me, and then I taught his younger brother Sharp, who later taught at Vanderbilt. He was {{instrumental}} in founding the Department of Fine Arts, {{of which he was}} Chairman from 1955 to 1960 when brother came up one day and said, [...] "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> this, but I have documentation: my big brother was writing poems secretly the whole time he was here" [...] So I saw the poems years later when the younger brother betrayed him.Wood: Any good?Warren: Well, as a matter of fact, they were skillful. They were close imitations of Housman. Very skillfully done, totally unoriginal. But the man had this need, hidden under that murderous exterior, to write poems.|$|E
