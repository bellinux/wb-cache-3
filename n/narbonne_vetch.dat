40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} an energy balance of common vetch, hungarian vetch and <b>narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> production during the production season of 2015 in Bingol province of Turkey. The energy input in common vetch, hungarian vetch and <b>narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> production have been calculated as 13060. 72 MJ ha- 1, 15767. 22 MJ ha- 1 and 14769. 73 MJ ha- 1, respectively. The energy output in common vetch, hungarian vetch and <b>narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> production have been calculated as 42048. 22 MJ ha- 1, 10051. 33 MJ ha- 1 and 11963. 62 MJ ha- 1, respectively. Energy usage efficiency, specific energy, energy productivity and net energy values related to common vetch, Hungarian vetch and <b>Narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> production have been determined as 3. 22, 0. 64, 0. 81; 5. 46 MJ kg- 1, 29. 98 MJ kg- 1, 21. 98 MJ kg- 1; 0. 18 kg MJ- 1, 0. 03 kg MJ- 1, 0. 05 kg MJ- 1 and 28987. 50 MJ ha- 1, - 5715. 89 MJ ha- 1, - 2806. 11 MJ ha- 1 respectively for each type. The total renewable energy input applied in common vetch, hungarian and <b>narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> was 26. 85, 20. 42 and 29. 69 per cent, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Plant genetic {{resources}} are a live treasury of both one {{country and the}} whole mankind, although their ex situ preservation and in situ conservation are very demanding in numerous ways, especially if human resources and financial issues are considered. Legumes (Fabaceae Lindl.) are facing the bottlenecks caused by breeding emphasizing yield and quality, raising the questions how to solve the issue of this narrowing the genetic basis of cultivated legume species. The reintroduction of neglected and underutilised crops, such as red vetchling (Lathyrus cicera), Cyprus vetchling (Lathyrus ochrus), French serradella (Ornithopus sativus), Ethiopian pea (Pisum abyssinicum), field pea (Pisum sativum var. arvense), fenugreek (Trigonella phoenum-graecum), bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia), <b>Narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia narbonensis), Hungarian vetch (Vicia pannonica) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) may significantly assist many contemporary farming systems by diversifying their needs and improve the efficiency of environment resources...|$|E
40|$|Plenary {{invited paper}} Abstract: Pea and common vetch have been {{successfully}} grown for green forage and forage dry matter production, with yields higher than 30 t ha- 1 of green forage and 7 t ha- 1 of forage dry matter. Pea and faba bean have the greatest potential as feed annual legumes, with more than 5, 000 kg ha- 1 and harvest indexes of nearly 0. 50. When cut in the stages of full flowering and first pods forming, the average crude protein content of forage dry matter in most annual legumes ranges about 200 g kg- 1. Although most modern cultivars of pea contain between 250 and 270 g kg- 1 of crude proteins of grain dry matter, they are characterised by a rather low content of antinutritive factors. Forage dry matter of annual legumes may be regarded as rich in lysine, with 13. 9 g kg- 1 in hairy vetch and 12. 7 g kg- 1 in common vetch. It is notable that <b>Narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia narbonensis L.) is rather rich in lysine, with average values of more than 20 g kg [...] 1, closely followed by grass pea, with average values of nearly 20 g kg [...] 1. Common vetch...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>Narbonne</b> <b>vetch</b> grain {{in the diet}} of 20 Charolaise bulls (420 ± 44 BW), during the finishing period (100 days), was investigated to study the effects on in vitam and post mortem performances and on quality of meat. No significant differences for ADWG (“Vetch” 1. 55 kg/d vs. “Control” 1. 40 kg/d; P = 0. 34), FCR (“Vetch” 7. 10 kg/kg vs. “Control” 7. 49 kg/kg; P = 0. 93) and yield (“Vetch” 60. 97 % vs. “Control” 62. 13 %: P = 0. 33) were observed. The nutritional and physical characteristics of Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle showed no significant differences for Crude Protein (“Vetch” 22. 47 vs. “Control” 22. 36; P = 0. 80), Fat (“Vetch” 2. 56 vs “Control” 2. 49; P = 0. 87), Energy (“Vetch” 1130 vs. “Control” 1119; P = 0. 79), TBARs (“Vetch” 0. 063 vs. “Control” 0. 069; P = 0. 72), Luminosity (“Vetch” 46. 47 vs. “Control” 43. 43; P = 0. 11), Hue (“Vetch” 0. 6 vs. “Control” 0. 6; P = 0. 16), Chrome (“Vetch” 27. 64 vs. “Control” 25. 5; P = 0. 56), Cooking loss (“Vetch” 26. 77 % vs. “Control” 28. 62 %; P = 0. 33) and WBS (“Vetch” 3. 4 kg f/cm 2 vs. “Control” 3. 3 kg f/cm 2; P = 0. 76). These preliminary results show interest towards the vetch grain as a protein source in the finishing period of bulls...|$|E
