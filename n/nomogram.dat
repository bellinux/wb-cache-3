5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug <b>nomogram</b> developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew <b>nomogram,</b> estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the <b>nomogram.</b> Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the <b>nomogram</b> appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment <b>nomogram</b> (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the <b>nomogram</b> is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew <b>nomogram</b> to determine level of concern.|$|E

(b) To adjust such variables, resulting in predictive <b>nomograms</b> for OCD and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) : the USP <b>nomograms.</b> Materials and MethodsThe accuracy of Crippa and colleagues&# 8217; <b>nomograms</b> for OCD prediction was examined in 1002 men submitted to radical prostatectomy between 2005 and 2010 at the University of S&# 227;o Paulo (USP). ROC-derived area under the curve (AUC) and Brier scores {{were used to}} assess the discriminant properties of <b>nomograms</b> for OCD. <b>Nomograms</b> performance was explored graphically with LOESS smoothing plots. Furthermore, univariate analysis and logistic regression models targeted OCD and SVI. Variables consisted of PSA, PPBC, biopsy Gleason score and clinical stage. The resulted predictive <b>nomograms</b> for OCD and SVI were internally validated with bootstrapping and the same abovementioned procedures. ResultsCrippa and colleagues&# 8217; <b>nomograms</b> for OCD showed ROC AUC = 0. 68 (CI: 0. 65 - 0. 70), Brier score = 0. 17 and overestimation in LOESS plots.

25|$|Dosage of {{chemotherapy}} can be difficult: If the dose is too low, {{it will be}} ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity (side-effects) will be intolerable to the patient. The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated body surface area (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a <b>nomogram,</b> using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body mass. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans. The study only included 9 human subjects. When chemotherapy {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, the BSA formula was adopted as the official standard for chemotherapy dosing {{for lack of a better}} option.|$|E
25|$|Transoesophageal Doppler {{includes}} two main technologies; transoesophageal echocardiogram —which is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, and oesophageal Doppler monitoring—which is primarily {{used for the}} clinical monitoring of cardiac output. The latter uses continuous wave Doppler to measure blood velocity in the descending thoracic aorta. An ultrasound probe is inserted either orally or nasally into the oesophagus to mid-thoracic level, {{at which point the}} oesophagus lies alongside the descending thoracic aorta. Because the transducer is close to the blood flow, the signal is clear. The probe may require re-focussing to ensure an optimal signal. This method has good validation, is widely used for fluid management during surgery with evidence for improved patient outcome, and has been recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Oesophageal Doppler monitoring measures the velocity of blood and not true Q, therefore relies on a <b>nomogram</b> based on patient age, height and weight to convert the measured velocity into stroke volume and cardiac output. This method generally requires patient sedation and is accepted for use in both adults and children.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{common use}} of <b>nomograms</b> in Low Dose Rate (LDR) {{permanent}} prostate brachytherapy (BT) allowsto estimate {{the number of}} seeds required for an implant. Independent dosimetry verification is recommended for eachclinical dosimetry in BT. Also, <b>nomograms</b> can be useful for dose calculation quality assurance {{and they could be}} adaptedto High Dose Rate (HDR). This work sets <b>nomograms</b> for LDR and HDR prostate-BT implants, which are applied tothree different institutions that use different implant techniques. Material and methods: Patients treated throughout 2010 till April 2011 were considered for this study. This examplewas chosen to be the representative of the latest implant techniques and to ensure consistency in the planning. A sufficientnumber of cases for both BT modalities, prescription dose and different work methodology (depending on theinstitution) were taken into account. The specific <b>nomograms</b> were built using the correlation between the prostatevo lume and some characteristic parameters of each BT modality, such as the source Air Kerma Strength, numberof implanted seeds in LDR or total radiation time in HDR. Results: For each institution and BT modality, <b>nomograms</b> normalized to the prescribed dose were obtained andfitted to a linear function. The parameters of the adjustment show a good agreement between data and the fitting. It should be noted that for each institution these linear function parameters are different, indicating that each centreshould construct its own <b>nomograms.</b> Conclusions: <b>Nomograms</b> for LDR and HDR prostate brachytherapy are simple quality assurance tools, specific foreach institution.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the prognostic factors in locally advanced cervical cancer {{limited to the}} pelvis and develop <b>nomograms</b> for 2 -year progression-free survival (PFS), 5 -year overall survival (OS), and pelvic recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 2, 042 patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma enrolled onto Gynecologic Oncology Group clinical trials of concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <b>Nomograms</b> for 2 -year PFS, five-year OS, and pelvic recurrence were created as visualizations of Cox proportional hazards regression models. The models were validated by bootstrap-corrected, relatively unbiased estimates of discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified prognostic factors including histology, race/ethnicity, performance status, tumor size, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, tumor grade, pelvic node status, and treatment with concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy. PFS, OS, and pelvic recurrence <b>nomograms</b> had bootstrap-corrected concordance indices of 0. 62, 0. 64, and 0. 73, respectively, and were well calibrated.

We aimed to develop <b>nomograms</b> predicting SFRs after the first and within the third session of SWL. Computed tomography (CT) information was also modeled for constructing <b>nomograms.</b> From March 2006 to December 2013, 3028 patients were treated with SWL for ureter and renal stones at our three tertiary institutions.

The <b>nomograms</b> were developed using multivariate logistic regression models with selected significant variables in a univariate logistic regression model. A C-index {{was used to assess}} the discrimination accuracy of <b>nomograms</b> and calibration plots were used to analyze the consistency of prediction.

Kattan and Stephenson <b>nomograms</b> {{are based}} on the {{outcomes}} of patients with prostate cancer recruited in the USA, but their applicability to Chinese patients is yet to be validated. We aim at studying the predictive accuracy of these <b>nomograms</b> in the Chinese population. Patients and Methods. A total of 408 patients who underwent laparoscopic or open radical resection of prostate from 1995 to 2009 were recruited. The preoperative clinical parameters of these patients were collected, and they were followed up regularly with PSA monitored. Biochemical recurrence was defined as two or more consecutive PSA levels > 0. 4 [*]ng/mL after radical resection of prostate or secondary cancer treatment. Results. The overall observed 5 -year and 10 -year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 68. 3 % and 59. 8 %, which was similar to the predicted values by the Kattan and Stephenson <b>nomograms,</b> respectively.
