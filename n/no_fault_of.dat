5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{contemporary}} egalitarians {{have been}} identified as luck egalitarians, believing, roughly, that it is bad when one person is worse off than another through <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> her own. Temkin argues that the egalitarian’s fundamental concern should not be with luck per se but with comparative fairness. His view is that, among equally deserving people, it is bad, because unfair, for some to be worse off than others through <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> their own. But, among unequally deserving people, it is not bad, because not unfair, for someone less deserving to be worse off than someone more deserving, even if the former is worse off through <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> her own. [...] To illustrate, egalitarians need not object if criminal John is worse off than law-abiding Mary, even if John craftily avoided capture and is worse off only because, through <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> his own, a falling limb injured him. In that case the effects of luck need not trouble egalitarians because they do not undermine comparative fairness.|$|R

25|$|The partial state {{government}} shutdown of July 2005 was an unprecedented fiasco which {{will live on}} {{in the minds of}} MAPE members and other state employees who were sent home for eight days that summer with no knowledge of when they would be allowed to return to work. The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no authority to pay thousands of the state’s employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some “essential,” and sending the rest home.

25|$|In King Henry III's long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny {{continued}} in use until 1247. By then, however, through <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the moneyers' {{there was a}} problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus giving people no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.|$|E

25|$|While she-tragedies {{were more}} comfortably tragic, {{in that they}} showed women who {{suffered}} for <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> their own and featured tragic flaws that were emotional rather than moral or intellectual, their success {{did not mean that}} more overtly political tragedy was not staged. The Exclusion crisis brought with it a number of tragic implications in real politics, and therefore any treatment of, for example, the Earl of Essex (several versions of which were circulated and briefly acted at non-patent theatres) could be read as seditious. Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd of 1682 was a royalist political play that, like Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel, seemed to praise the king for his actions in the meal tub plot. Otway's play had the floating city of Venice stand in for the river town of London, and it had the dark senatorial plotters of the play stand in for the Earl of Shaftesbury. It even managed to figure in the Duke of Monmouth, Charles's illegitimate, war-hero son who was favoured by many as Charles's successor over the Roman Catholic James. Venice Preserv'd is, in a sense, the perfect synthesis of the older politically royalist tragedies and histories of Dryden and the newer she-tragedies of feminine suffering, for, although the plot seems to be a political allegory, the action centres on a woman who cares for a man in conflict, and most of the scenes and dialogue concern her pitiable sufferings at his hands.|$|E

40|$|In 1993, two hot-mix {{asphalt and}} four whitetopping overlay test {{sections}} were constructed on low volume TH 30 in southern Minnesota. A study was undertaken {{to examine the}} performance and {{costs associated with the}} test sections after nine years of service. The field testing and evaluation are described, and the costs incurred through 2001 are tabulated. The hot-mix asphalt overlay test sections are performing up to their design expectations. Both hot-mix asphalt test sections have had routine preventative maintenance applied to them, adding to their long-term cost of operation and ownership. The whitetopping test sections are performing very well at the midpoint of their design life of 20 years. Most distresses to date are related to poor construction and materials, rather than inherent design features. Some random longitudinal cracking has occurred in areas of the whitetopping control section. The doweled test section has numerous distressed transverse joints caused by dowels near the surface of the slabs. There is virtually <b>no</b> <b>faulting</b> <b>of</b> the transverse joints, and the ride quality has stabilized. No maintenance has been performed on the whitetopping sections through 2001. As of 2002, the most economical overlay design in this study is a 6 inch thick bonded whitetopping.
