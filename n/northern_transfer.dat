40|$|The {{level of}} 10 Sb (M 1) RNA, the RNA of RNase P, {{is very low}} in growing {{cultures}} of rnpB mutants. <b>Northern</b> <b>transfer</b> experiments suggested that these strains accumulate no more than 10 % of the wild-type level of 10 Sb RNA.

The 10 Sb RNA synthesized from this plasmid is equivalent to wild-type 10 Sb RNA since it can replace it in the reconstitution of RNase P. The 10 Sb RNA, which is a rather stable molecule, is unstable in the presence of the rnpB mutation. This could explain why rnpB mutants do not accumulate 10 Sb RNA.

In fibroblast cultures established from the lesional skin of a 32 -year-old patient with lipoid proteinosis, the levels of mRNA coding for pro-α 1 (IV) polypeptides were increased approximately 4. 5 -fold, as compared with age- and passage-matched control cultures. This increase was selective in that the levels of fibronectin, pro-α 1 (I), and β-actin mRNAs were unaltered in the same cultures. The increase in pro-α 1 (IV) mRNA level was also uncoordinate with the expression of the laminin B 2 chain gene, which was unaltered in lipoid proteinosis.

40|$|The LEU 3 gene of {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is {{involved}} in the regulation of at least two LEU structural genes (LEU 1 and LEU 2), has been cloned by complementation of leu 3 mutations and shown to reside within a 5. 6 -kb fragment. Transformation of leu 3 mutants with LEU 3 -carrying multicopy plasmids restored normal, leucine-independent growth behavior in the recipients. It also restored approximately wild-type levels of isopropylmalate isomerase (LEU 1) and β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (LEU 2), which were strongly reduced when exogenous leucine was supplied. Strains containing a disrupted leu 3 allele were constructed by deleting 0. 7 -kb of LEU 3 DNA and inserting the yeast HIS 3 gene in its place. Like other leu 3 mutants, these strains were leaky leucine auxotrophs, owing to a basal level of expression of LEU 1 and LEU 2.

Following exposure of PC 12 cells to various effecters, cytoplasmic RNA was isolated and analyzed by <b>Northern</b> <b>transfer</b> and autoradiography using a GAP- 43 cDNA probe. Induction by NGF is apparent after 3 hr exposure and reaches maximal levels at 24 hr. Beyond 24 hr, levels remain constant in the continued presence of NGF. Induction is insensitive to variations in culture conditions, such as plating density or substrate, which influence NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Other inducers, {{in order of}} decreasing efficacy, are FGF, dBcAMP, TPA, K+, and EGF. Insulin and retinoic acid are ineffective. Dexamethasone partially inhibited basal expression as well as induction by NGF, FGF, dBcAMP, and TPA. The methyltransferase inhibitor 5 ’-S-(2 -methyl-propyl) adenosine completely inhibited induction by NGF, FGF, and dBcAMP. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide partially decreased induction by NGF, FGF, and TPA but slightly enhanced dBcAMP induction. Complete downregulation of protein kinase C by chronic TPA treatment completely eliminated the TPA response but slightly enhanced induction by NGF. These findings {{and the results of}} additivity experiments in which cells were stimulated with various combinations of NGF, dBcAMP and TPA suggest that NGF induction of GAP- 43 RNA (1) does not involve activation of protein kinase C but (2) may be mediated partially via activation of protein kinase A.

Furthermore, dermal fibroblasts of 19 and 34 wk-old fetuses displayed a clearly detectable immunosignal for neurofibromin. In vitro studies were designed to investigate the potential effects of selected growth factors – known to be operative in wound healing – on neurofibromin mRNA steady-state levels in cultured fibroblasts. <b>Northern</b> <b>transfer</b> analyses revealed that different isoforms of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) exerted selective effects on the neurofibromin mRNA levels: PDGF isoform AB elevated neurofibromin mRNA levels in a concentration-dependent manner when concentrations of 0. 1, 1, 10, and 30 ng per ml were used. The maximal upregulatory effect of PDGF BB was reached at a concentration of 1 ng per ml. In contrast, PDGF AA did not alter the steady-state levels of neurofibromin mRNA.

The labeled oligonucleotide was then used to screen a human liver cDNA library, and a single candidate cDNA clone of 1. 85 kilobase pairs was isolated. Hybridization of the mixed-sequence probe to the complementary strand of the plasmid insert and sequence analysis by the dideoxy method predicted the expected protein sequence of C 5 a (positions 1 - 12), amino-terminal to the anticipated priming site. The sequence obtained further predicted an arginine-rich sequence (RPRR) immediately upstream of the N-terminal threonine of C 5 a, indicating that the promolecule form of C 5 is synthesized with a beta alpha-chain orientation as previously shown for pro-C 3 and pro-C 4. The C 5 cDNA clone was sheared randomly by sonication, subcloned into M 13 mp 8, and sequenced at random by the dideoxy technique, thereby generating a contiguous sequence of 1703 base pairs. This clone contained coding sequence for the C-terminal 262 amino acid residues of the beta-chain, the entire C 5 a fragment, and the N-terminal 98 residues of the alpha'-chain.

The cloned gene was identified as LEU 4 by integrative transformation that caused gene disruption at the LEU 4 locus. When this transformation was performed with a LEU 4 fbr LEU 5 strain, the resulting transformants had lost the 5 ', 5 ', 5 '-trifluoro-d,l-leucine resistance of the recipient strain but were still Leu+. When it was performed with a LEU 4 leu 5 recipient, the resulting transformants were Leu -. The α-isopropylmalate synthase of a transformant that carried the LEU 4 gene on a multicopy plasmid (in a leu 5 background) was characterized biochemically. The transformant contained about 20 times as much α-isopropylmalate synthase as wild type. The enzyme was sensitive to inhibition by leucine and coenzyme A, was inactivated by antibody generated against α-isopropylmalate synthase purified from wild type and was largely confined to the mitochondria. The subunit molecular weight was 65, 000 – 67, 000.

Our studies reveal that three c-erbB gene products of Mr 300, 000, Mr 170, 000, and Mr 95, 000 are synthesized in uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts. Only the Mr 300, 000 and Mr 170, 000 species can be precipitated by using antisera specific for the cytoplasmic domain of the c-erbB product. The 95, 000 species is not recognized by the antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of c-erbB and is specifically released into the culture medium. <b>Northern</b> <b>transfer</b> studies reveal a lower molecular weight transcript of approximately 2. 6 kilobases that selectively hybridizes to the ligand-binding domain of the avian c-erbB gene product but does not hybridize with probes specific for the cytoplasmic kinase domain of c-erbB.

40|$|Using {{the record}} of 30 flank eruptions over the last 110 years at Nyamuragira, we have tested the {{relationship}} between the eruption dynamics and the local stress field. There are two groups of eruptions based on their duration () that are also clustered in space and time. We find that the eruptions fed by dykes parallel to the East African Rift Valley have longer durations (and larger volumes) than those eruptions fed by dykes with other orientations. This is compatible with a model for compressible magma transported through an elastic-walled dyke in a differential stress field from an over-pressured reservoir (Woods et al., 2006). The observed pattern of eruptive fissures is consistent with a local stress field modified by a northwest-trending, right lateral slip fault {{that is part of the}} <b>northern</b> <b>transfer</b> zone of the Kivu Basin rift segment. We have also re-tested with new data the stochastic eruption models for Nyamuragira of Burt et al. (1994). The time-predictable, pressure-threshold model remains the best fit and is consistent with the typically observed declining rate of sulphur dioxide emission during the first few days of eruption with lava emission from a depressurising, closed, crustal reservoir. The 2. 4 -fold increase in long-term eruption rate that occurred after 1977 is confirmed in the new analysis. Since that change, the record has been dominated by short-duration eruptions fed by dykes perpendicular to the Rift. We suggest that the intrusion of a major dyke during the 1977 volcano-tectonic event at neighbouring Nyiragongo volcano inhibited subsequent dyke formation on the southern flanks of Nyamuragira and this may also have resulted in more dykes reaching the surface elsewhere. Thus that sudden change in output was a result of a changed stress field that forced more of the deep magma supply to the surface. Another volcano-tectonic event in 2002 may also have changed the magma output rate at Nyamuragira...|$|E

The corresponding p 56 and p 50 polypeptides {{of the two}} viruses were enriched in the basic amino acid arginine. Pulse-chase and peptide mapping experiments confirmed a precursor-product relationship between the p 56 and p 50 proteins. MHV- 3 virions, however, showed {{no trace of the}} p 50 protein. Moreover, of the total five detected polypeptides only three, p 22, p 56 and p 180 were labeled in MHV- 3 -infected cells during a short two minute pulse with lcub(2 ̆ 735) Srcub-methionine and, are therefore, presumed to be immediate translation products. Pulse-chase and peptide mapping experiments confirmed that p 24 is derived from p 22 by post-translational modification. Further analyses with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin provided strong evidence that conversion of p 22 to p 24 apparently does not involve N-linked glycosylation.;Analysis of lcub(2 ̆ 735) Srcub-methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on five different murine hepatitis strains: A 59, JHM, MHV- 1, MHV- 3, and MHV-S revealed that the proteins of each strain of MHV have very similar molecular weights.

Macrofossils of larch in the Scandinavian mountains prove the existence of larch in Scandinavia after the last ice age, Siberian or Russian larch is now considered as an indigenous tree species of Sweden. The larches of Russia are of interest for their production potential and wood quality. The aim of this thesis was to determine frost resistance, juvenile growth, stem straightness and branch traits in a 5 -year-old combined provenance/progeny test with Larix sukaczewii, L. sibirica, L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi originating from Russia and tested on three sites in Sweden. An evaluation of genetic parameters in this half-sib family material was also made. The yield in 37 - 86 year old field tests of L. sukaczewii and Russian larch hybrids was also evaluated. The results indicate that larches from western Russia, L. sukaczewii were least damaged in the artificial freezing test, had highest survival in the field trials and had the best stem quality. The most northern provenances of this species had, however, poorer growth and lower survival, especially on the southern test site. L. sibirica from central Siberia and continental provenances of L. cajanderi and L. gmelinii were not adapted to any of the sites. Among provenances of L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi those with more maritime origin showed generally better adaptation than those from more continental areas. Geographic and climatic variables of provenance origin were important for the performance of the provenances. At the southern test site, provenances from northern latitudes and strongly continental areas in Russia showed poor growth and survival. On the two test sites located in harsh climates, provenances originating in climates similar to the test sites showed best survival. This means a <b>northern</b> <b>transfer</b> of 2 - 3 latitudes for the most northern site.

Southern transfers of apDNA and ctDNA, probed with the large subunit (LS) gene of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), shows hybridization to the expected restriction fragments for both apDNA and ctDNA. However, <b>Northern</b> <b>transfers</b> of total RNA from chloroplasts and amyloplasts, probed again with the LS gene of Rubisco, shows that no detectable LS meggage is found in amyloplasts although LS expression in mature chloroplasts is high. Likewise, two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of etiolated gravisensitive pea tissue shows that {{both large and small}} subunits of Rubisco are conspicuously absent; however, in greening tissue these two constitute the major soluble proteins. These findings suggest that although the informational content of these two organelle types is equivalent, gene expression is quite different and is presumably under nuclear control...|$|R
