25|$|Various {{symbolic}} and religious qualities {{are attributed to}} Hasidic dress, though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes' origin is cultural and historical. For example, the long overcoats are considered modest, the Shtreimel is supposedly related to shaatnez and keeps one warm without using wool, and Sabbath shoes are laceless in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tie a knot, a prohibited action. A gartel divides the Hasid's lower parts from his upper parts, implying modesty and chastity, and for kabbalistic reasons, Hasidim button their clothes right over left. Hasidim customarily wear black hats during the weekdays, as do nearly all Haredim today. A variety of hats are worn depending on the group: Chabad often pinch their hats to form a triangle on the top, Satmar wear an open-crown hat with rounded edges, and Samet (velvet) or biber (beaver) hats are worn by many Galician and Hungarian Hasidim.|$|E

25|$|The Lee County Board of Education has {{announced}} plans to close Beattyville Elementary and transfer the students to Southside Elementary. To accommodate the influx of students, an expansion of the facilities at Southside will be required. The decision was not popular with residents of the community The Board of Education exhausted its bonding capacity to fund the addition to Southside, so it proposed a tax increase in 2013 to fund other repairs at other facilities. Residents of the county signed a petition to place the tax increase on the ballot. The school board decided to delay the implementation of the tax until 2014 so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay approximately $20,000 to fund a special election. The school board passed the tax in 2014 and again, a petition was filed placing the matter on the ballot for the fall 2014 general election.

25|$|In late 2008, a new {{variable}} {{came into}} play. Previously, applicants to most colleges {{were required to}} submit all scores, with some colleges that embraced Score Choice retaining the option of allowing their applicants <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> submit all scores. However, in 2008, an initiative to make Score Choice universal had begun, with some opposition from colleges desiring to maintain score report practices. While students theoretically now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score one wishes to send) to the college of their choice, some colleges and universities, such as Cornell, ask that students send all test scores. This had led the College Board to display on their web site which colleges agree with or dislike Score Choice, with continued claims that students will still never have scores submitted against their will. Regardless of whether a given college permits applicants to exercise Score Choice options, most colleges do not penalize students who report poor scores along with high ones; many universities, such as Columbia and Cornell, expressly promise to overlook those scores that may be undesirable to the student and/or {{to focus more on}} those scores that are most representative of the student's achievement and academic potential. College Board maintains a list of colleges and their respective score choice policies that is recent as of November 2011.|$|E
25|$|Although {{access to}} {{judicial}} review is restricted for ordinary questions of law, the Court of Justice has gradually developed {{a more open}} approach to standing for human rights. Human rights have also become essential in the proper interpretation and construction of all EU law. If there are two or more plausible interpretations of a rule, the one which is most consistent with human rights should be chosen. The Treaty of Lisbon 2007 made rights underpin the Court of Justice's competence, and required the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, overseen by the external Strasbourg Court. Initially, reflecting its primitive economic nature, the treaties made no reference to rights. However, in 1969 particularly after concern from Germany, the Court of Justice declared in Stauder v City of Ulm that 'fundamental human rights' were 'enshrined in the general principles of Community law'. This meant that Mr Stauder, who received subsidised butter under an EU welfare scheme only by showing a coupon with his name and address, was entitled to claim that this violated his dignity: he was entitled <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through the humiliation of proving his identity to get food. While those 'general principles' were not written down in EU law, and simply declared to exist by the court, it accords with a majority philosophical view that 'black letter' rules, or positive law, necessarily exist for reasons that the society which made them wants: these give rise to principles, which inform the law's purpose. Moreover, the Court of Justice has clarified that its recognition of rights was 'inspired' by member states' own 'constitutional traditions', and international treaties. These include rights found in member state constitutions, bills of rights, foundational Acts of Parliament, landmark court cases, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Social Charter 1961, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, or the International Labour Organization's Conventions. The EU itself must accede to the ECHR, although in '’Opinion 2/13'’ the Court of Justice delayed, because of perceived difficulties in retaining an appropriate balance of competences.|$|E

500|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since the 2010 season, the Nittany Lions looked {{to achieve their}} fourth {{consecutive}} win in the series, however even a hometown paper, the York Daily Record, predicted the Lions would lose, albeit in a close game, citing Michigan's superiority on both offense and defense, as well as coaching, compared to Penn State's superiority on special teams and intangibles. [...] Penn State's edition of SB Nation also predicted the Lions would lose citing the Wolverines' better athletes, but noted that Michigan's quarterback Devin Gardner has thrown as many interceptions as touchdowns (8) coming into the game, and that Penn State's best chance to win would be if Michigan turned the ball over frequently. Coming off an embarrassing loss against Indiana, Penn State's coach Bill O'Brien was [...] "focused" [...] all week and {{refused to talk to}} the media about the prior week's loss, focusing strictly on the Michigan game, which was Homecoming for Penn State, was expected to be the first sellout of the season, and featured a whiteout, led by the student section. O'Brien noted, [...] "it would be crazy to think this is just another game". The game was Penn State's second national broadcast of the year, with Penn State alumnus Matt Millen providing color commentary on Penn State's homecoming weekend. Michigan, coming off a 42–13 victory over Minnesota, entered the game with a win-loss record of 5–0, one of two remaining undefeated teams in the Big Ten (the other was Ohio State, who was 6–0, and whom the Lions are scheduled to play on October 26). Michigan's defense, led by their star cornerback Blake Countless, who was tied for the NCAA lead with four interceptions entering the game, had yet to allow a rushing touchdown, and was expected to receive a boost from the return of their 2012 All-Big Ten linebacker Jake Ryan, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) the prior season. As such, a key for Penn State was to match Michigan's physicality in strong offensive line play and establish the line of scrimmage, both on offense and defense, as the game would be won in the trenches. The game was described as a [...] "critical juncture". Before the game, Penn State realized that, due to a Ticketmaster glitch, it had oversold student section tickets, and was forced to offer several alternate packages in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> boot students.|$|E
500|$|Schneider {{returned}} from injury {{to play in}} Game 3 after missing two weeks. After the first two periods, the Canucks trailed 2–1. The Sharks scored quickly {{in the third period}} and by the 4:07 mark had scored three goals to make it a 5–1 game. After the fifth goal, Schneider was pulled and replaced by Luongo. Vancouver eventually lost the game 5–2, with Schneider making 23 saves on 28 shots. Luongo stopped all 10 shots he faced. In the post-game press conference, Schneider stated he felt good, but did not do enough to help out his teammates. Later, questions were raised about who would be the starter for Game 4. Luongo stated he would be ready if asked to play, but also stated he would be supportive of Schneider if he was the starter. Sharks' centre Joe Thornton stated that San Jose felt Luongo had played great in the first two games, and they were lucky <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face him in Game 3. In Game 4, Schneider made the start and after two periods, the Canucks trailed 2–1. Midway through the third period, Vancouver had taken the lead, but late in the period, San Jose tied the game with a power play goal to force overtime. In the extra period, Daniel Sedin checked Tommy Wingels, which sent the Sharks winger's head into the boards. Sedin was given a controversial boarding penalty on the play. On the ensuing power play, San Jose scored to win the game and complete the series sweep. After the goal was scored, Daniel voiced his opinion of the call to the referees and was given a game misconduct penalty for abusive language. When asked about the call after the game, he replied, [...] "It's the playoffs. It's shoulder to shoulder," [...] and it was a bad call, though he further noted that the Canucks did not lose the series on the call. Brother Henrik noted that it was [...] "a bullshit call" [...] also pointing out that it was shoulder to shoulder. Referee Kelly Sutherland explained the call by stating he deemed it a violent shove into the boards where the player could not defend himself. For his part, Schneider made 43 saves on 47 shots in Game 4, he stated that he was 100% healthy and his groin injury was not a factor in his play.|$|E
