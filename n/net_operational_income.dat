Many researchers believed that capital structure includes share issuance, private investment, bank debt, business debts, leasing contracts, tax debt, retirement debt, deferred compensation for executives and employees, deposits, product related-debt and other probable debt. These theories and hypothesis include: Net income, <b>Net</b> <b>operational</b> <b>income,</b> Traditional approach theory, Miller and Modigliani theory, Static trade–off theory, Asymmetric of the information hypothesis, Pecking order theory, Signaling theory, Agency cost theory, Free cash flow hypothesis, Dynamic trade-off theory and Market Timing theory. By applying these theories, the analysts will be able to reach a maximum return with minimum risk while they increase the value of corporation. Because of the close relationship between profitability and capital structure, this paper is going to suggest a new model called genetic algorithm model by using support vector regression and profitability factors for obtaining an international range of optimal capital structure...|$|E

Implicity, the informal sector is needed and, indeed, its emergence conversely helps the formal sector. However, {{it is necessary to}} understand that some people resist its emergence and existence. Apart from the remark that the informal sector still needs some justification and approaches in order to minimize and to remove the resulted impacts, what is more important to know is that the incomes obtained from this sector are quite sufficient to ful fit the daily minimum basic needs. The objective of the study is to know the influence of the internal variables on the <b>operational</b> <b>incomes</b> of the street vendors. The internal variables consist of such independent variables as Personnel (X 1), Finance/Capital (X 2), Marketing (X 3), and a dependent variable of <b>Operational</b> <b>Incomes</b> (Y). Therefore, the methodology concerning the objective pursued is as folloows: The data are colled using closed quistionnaires and purposive sampling. Its sample consists of 70 respondents. Then, the collected data are analyzed using a computer program of SPSS 12. 00 n order to know their correlations and regressions. Based on the data nalyis, it is partially proven that all the internal variables have a positive correlation with the <b>operational</b> <b>incomes,</b> being seen from the correlational coefficient (r) of X 1 = 0. 623 (P= 0. 000), X 2 = 0. 638 (P= 0. 000), X 3 = 0. 786 (P= 0. 000).

In contrast with the prevailing case-study investigations, one considers a panel for quoted Brazilian firms in the manufacturing industry along the 1988 - 3 / 2003 - 2 period. Granger causality tests are considered {{and even though the}} results are not completely clear cut, some discernible uni-directional patterns emerge. In particular, there seems to be informational content between economic and accounting rates of return, between ROA (Net Profits/Total Assets) and PM (Gross Profits/ <b>Operational</b> <b>Income),</b> and internal rates of return. This seems to indicate that there is some validity in using accounting rates of return in certain economic studies. ...|$|R
40|$|Causality {{is often}} {{interpreted}} as establishing dependencies between events. The standard {{view is that}} an event b causally depends on an event a if, whenever b occurs, then a has already occurred. If the occurrences of a and b mutually depend on each other, i. e. a depends on b and vice versa, then (under the standard notion of causality) neither of them can ever occur. This does not faithfully capture systems where, for instance, an agent promises to do event a provided that b will be eventually done, and vice versa. In this case, the circularity between the causal dependencies should allow both a and b to occur, in any order. In this paper we review three models for circular causality, one based on logic (declarative), one based on event structures (semantical), and one based on Petri <b>nets</b> (<b>operational).</b> We will cast them in a coherent picture pointing out their relationships...|$|R
