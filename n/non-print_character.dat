5000|$|... 0W or ZW, or zero width, a <b>non-printing</b> <b>character</b> used in {{computer}} typesetting of some complex scripts ...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to display <b>non-printing</b> <b>characters,</b> which may be illustrated with the bell character in ASCII encoding: ...|$|R
5000|$|ASCII {{includes}} definitions for 128 <b>characters</b> (33 <b>non-printing</b> <b>characters,</b> mostly obsolete control {{characters that}} affect how text is processed, and 94 printable) ...|$|R
50|$|The ASCII and Unicode {{character}} sets {{were designed to}} solve this problem by the provision of <b>non-printing</b> <b>characters</b> that can be used as delimiters. These are the range from ASCII 28 to 31.|$|R
5000|$|A {{composition}} mode, {{in which}} the user sees something somewhat similar to the end result, but with additional information useful while composing, such as section breaks and <b>non-printing</b> <b>characters,</b> and uses a layout that is more conducive to composing than to layout.|$|R
50|$|<b>Non-printing</b> <b>character</b> or Formatting marks are {{characters}} {{for content}} designing in word processors, which aren't displayed at printing. It {{is also possible}} to customize their display on the monitor. The most common non-printable characters in word processors are pilcrow, space, non-breaking space, Tab character etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{characters}} {{which are}} considered whitespace varies between programming languages and implementations. For example, C traditionally only counts space, tab, line feed, and carriage return characters, while languages which support Unicode typically include all Unicode space characters. Some implementations also include ASCII control codes (<b>non-printing</b> <b>characters)</b> along with whitespace characters.|$|R
50|$|The right-to-left mark (RLM) is a <b>non-printing</b> <b>character</b> {{used in the}} {{computerized}} typesetting of bi-directional text containing mixed left-to-right scripts (such as English and Cyrillic) and right-to-left scripts (such as Persian, Arabic, Syriac and Hebrew). It is used {{to change the way}} adjacent characters are grouped with respect to text direction.|$|R
5000|$|A {{plain text}} file uses a {{character}} encoding such as UTF-8 or ASCII to represent numbers, letters, and symbols. The only <b>non-printing</b> <b>characters</b> in the file {{that can be used}} to format the text are newline, tab, and formfeed. Plain text files are often displayed using a monospace font so horizontal alignment and columnar formatting is sometimes done using space characters.|$|R
50|$|The zero-width space (ZWSP) is a <b>non-printing</b> <b>character</b> used in {{computerized}} typesetting {{to indicate}} word boundaries to text processing systems when using scripts {{that do not}} use explicit spacing, or after characters (such as the slash) that are not followed by a visible space but after which there may nevertheless be a line break. Normally, {{it is not a}} visible separation, but it may expand in passages that are fully justified.|$|R
5000|$|In {{computing}} and telecommunication, {{a control}} <b>character</b> or <b>non-printing</b> <b>character</b> is a code point (a number) in a character set, {{that does not}} represent a written symbol. They are used as in-band signaling to cause effects other than {{the addition of a}} symbol to the text. All other characters are mainly printing, printable, or graphic characters, except perhaps for the [...] "space" [...] character (see ASCII printable characters).|$|R
50|$|The zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ) is a <b>non-printing</b> <b>character</b> {{used in the}} {{computerization}} {{of writing}} systems that make use of ligatures. When placed between two characters {{that would otherwise be}} connected into a ligature, a ZWNJ causes them to be printed in their final and initial forms, respectively. This is also an effect of a space character, but a ZWNJ is used when it is desirable to keep the words closer together or to connect a word with its morpheme.|$|R
50|$|On teletypewriters {{and early}} keyboards, holding down the Control key while {{pressing}} another key zeroed the leftmost two {{bits of the}} seven bits in the generated ASCII character. This allowed the operator to produce the first 32 characters in the ASCII table. These are <b>non-printing</b> <b>characters</b> that signal the computer to control where the next character will {{be placed on the}} display device, eject a printed page or erase the screen, ring the terminal bell, or some other operation. Aptly, these characters are also called control characters.|$|R
5000|$|Sequences of {{the form}} , where [...] "0x" [...] is literal, and [...] "FF" [...] {{represents}} any two-digit hexadecimal number, are replaced with the corresponding single-byte value. This {{can be used to}} embed <b>non-printing</b> ASCII <b>characters,</b> or extended ASCII characters.|$|R
50|$|Since {{not all of}} the {{characters}} encoded by PETSCII are 'graphic' (i.e., control codes) and {{not all of the}}m have a corresponding Unicode representation, they cannot be portably displayed in a web browser. The following table shows for PETSCII characters the corresponding Unicode glyph and code point, if there is any; otherwise the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD (ï¿½) and a hyphen for the code point. Control <b>characters</b> and other <b>non-printing</b> <b>characters</b> are represented by their names. Where a particular code point encodes both a shifted and unshifted character, both characters/code points/glyphs are shown, with the unshifted character/glyph on the left and the unshifted code point at the bottom. Row and column headings indicate the hexadecimal digit combinations to produce the eight-bit code value; e.g., the letter L is at code value $4C.|$|R
40|$|Steganography {{is one of}} the {{important}} fields of information security that depend on hiding secret information in a cover media (video, image, audio, text) such that un authorized person fails to realize its existence. One of the lossless data compression techniques which are used for a given file that contains many redundant data is run length encoding (RLE). Sometimes the RLE output will be expanded rather than compressed, and this is the main problem of RLE. In this paper we will use a new coding method such that its output will be contains sequence of ones with few zeros, so modified RLE that we proposed in this paper will be suitable for compression, finally we employ the modified RLE output for stenography purpose that based on Unicode and <b>non-printed</b> <b>characters</b> to hide the secret information in an Arabic text...|$|R
5000|$|Using <b>non-printing</b> Unicode <b>{{characters}}</b> Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ) and Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ). These {{characters are}} used for joining and disjoining letters in Arabic and Persian, but {{can be used in}} Roman alphabets for hiding information because they have no meaning in Roman alphabets: because they are [...] "zero-width" [...] they are not displayed. ZWJ and ZWNJ can represent [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0".|$|R
50|$|In Code page 437, the {{original}} character {{set of the}} IBM PC, the value of 3 (hexadecimal 03) represents the heart symbol. This value is shared with the <b>non-printing</b> ETX control <b>character,</b> which overrides the glyph in many contexts.|$|R
50|$|During tokenization, the parser {{identifies}} {{sequences of}} characters which represent words and other elements, such as punctuation, which {{are represented by}} numeric codes, {{some of which are}} <b>non-printing</b> control <b>characters.</b> The parser can also identify entities such as email addresses, phone numbers, and URLs. When identifying each token, several characteristics may be stored, such as the token's case (upper, lower, mixed, proper), language or encoding, lexical category (part of speech, like 'noun' or 'verb'), position, sentence number, sentence position, length, and line number.|$|R
50|$|Fred Brooks of IBM argued {{strongly}} {{for going}} to 8-bit bytes, because someday people might want to process text; and won. Although IBM used EBCDIC, most text from then on came to be encoded in ASCII, using values from 0 to 31 for (<b>non-printing)</b> control <b>characters,</b> and values from 32 to 127 for graphic characters such as letters, digits, and punctuation. Most machines stored characters in 8 bits rather than 7, ignoring the remaining bit or {{using it as a}} checksum.|$|R
30|$|KyotoFormat (/P and /D) {{files are}} simple text files that contain no binary data. The line break code {{in the file}} is {{different}} for each of platform; LF (line feed or new line, ASCII hex code 0 x 0 a) in UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, and other derivatives and CR[*]+[*]LF (carriage return[*]+[*]line feed, 0 x 0 d[*]+[*] 0 x 0 a) in Microsoft Windows. The treatment and display of non-ASCII characters are not standardized, so the output displayed depends on the program used; the use of other <b>non-printing</b> ASCII <b>characters</b> is therefore not recommended. The first line of the file indicates the plot title. In each line (record) below the title, the column delimiter should be either a space (0 x 20) or tab (0 x 09) character.|$|R
50|$|Most word {{processors}} can {{read and write}} files in plain text format, allowing them to open files saved from text editors. Saving these files from a word processor, however, requires ensuring the file is written in plain text format, and that any text encoding or BOM settings won't obscure the file for its intended use. Non-WYSIWYG {{word processors}}, such as WordStar, are more easily pressed into service as text editors, and in fact were commonly used as such during the 1980s. The default file format of these word processors often resembles a markup language, with the basic format being plain text and visual formatting achieved using <b>non-printing</b> control <b>characters</b> or escape sequences. Later word processors like Microsoft Word store their files in a binary format and are almost never used to edit plain text files.|$|R
