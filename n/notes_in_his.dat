5|$|Carl Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1893, 1898) {{discussed}} {{portions of}} the anatomy of A. adamsii, A. porcellanus, A. contrarius, and A. sinistralis. Walter Edward Collinge (1901, 1902) briefly noted features of A. palaceus and A. parakensis (reported as A. perversus). Haniel (1921) dissected A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris, and Bernhard Rensch published a few scattered <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> various faunistic surveys. A few earlier notes are mentioned in Pilsbry (1900).|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E
5|$|Sunday never {{attended}} seminary {{and made}} no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, {{but he had a}} thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was later charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted agnostic Robert Ingersoll.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E
5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E

25|$|Faber is {{a former}} English professor. He has spent years regretting {{that he did not}} defend books when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a chance meeting in a park {{sometime}} earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag, and later realizes Montag is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them.

25|$|When Trotsky was eight, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Odessa to be educated in a Jewish school. He was {{enrolled}} in a German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa {{as a result of the}} Imperial government's policy of Russification. As Isaac Deutscher <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook. Although Trotsky said in his autobiography My Life that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.|$|E
25|$|The early {{style and}} {{presentation}} of Roxy Music {{was influenced by}} the art school backgrounds of its principal members. Ferry, Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid-to-late 1960s, when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice, with its emphasis on painting, and instead focused on more recent developments, most notably pop art, and explored new concepts such as cybernetics. As writer Michael Bracewell <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book Roxy: the band that invented an era, Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry, Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music, modern art and fashion.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{appointed}} Robert Morris to be Superintendent of Finance of the United States {{following the}} collapse of Continental currency. In 1782, Morris advocated {{the creation of the}} first financial institution chartered by the United States. The Bank of North America was funded in part by specie loaned to the United States by France. Morris helped finance the final stages of the war by issuing <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> name, backed by his own money. The Bank of North America also issued notes convertible into specie. On July 6, 1785, the Continental Congress of the United States authorized the issuance of a new currency, the US dollar.|$|E

25|$|On August 18, the Wednesday {{after he}} {{returned}} to the Santa Rosa Beach house, he went up to Vortex Spring again. In the middle of the day, he did one dive. Other divers saw him looking closely at the area around the cave entrance, as if, it was later reported, he was planning something. After resurfacing he filled his tanks at the dive shop, a transaction recorded on security cameras (it is not known what he filled those tanks with). He spent {{much of the rest of}} the afternoon by himself alongside the spring, witnesses said, testing equipment and making <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dive log.|$|E
25|$|Many {{prisoners at}} Norman Cross made {{artefacts}} such as toys, model ships and dominoes sets from carved wood or animal bone, and straw marquetry. Examples of the prisoners' craftwork {{were sold to}} visitors and passers by. Some highly skilled prisoners were commissioned by wealthy individuals, some of the prisoners becoming very rich in the process. Archdeacon William Strong, a regular visitor to the prison, <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> diary of 23 October 1801 that he provided a piece of mahogany and paid a prisoner £1 15s 6d to build {{a model of the}} Block House and £2 2s for a straw picture of Peterborough Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with {{the completion of}} Robert of Chester's translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy. Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe {{at the time of}} his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century Toledo, Spain, through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath. Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum, and the works of Avicenna and al-Razi. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.|$|E

25|$|A serious blow to Kovalevsky's {{career was}} dealt by a scandalous affair {{involving}} fake promissory notes. Back in 1896, {{he met the}} actress and entrepreneur Elizaveta Shabel'skaya, and they had an affair. But in 1902, he became interested in Maria Ilovayskaya and accused his former lover of faking promissory <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> name. The controversy dragged on until 1905. To marry Ilovayskaya, Kovalevsky divorced his wife, Ekaterina Lukhutina, on the premise of her unfaithfulness. With that, he promised to the consistory, under the oath, that he never failed to perform his conjugal responsibilities. His wife, however, accused him of lying and perjury, and {{in order not to}} discredit the Ministry of Finance, Kovalevsky was forced to resign as Deputy Finance Minister in 1902. His duties in the Ministry of Finance were filled by Vassily Timiryazev.|$|E
25|$|Most of Twelver Shia criticize Abu Bakr because, after Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr {{refused to}} grant Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah, {{the lands of}} the village of Fadak which she claimed her father had given {{to her as a}} gift before his death. He refused to accept the {{testimony}} of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims, Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{credible evidence}} of coffee-drinking or {{knowledge of the}} coffee tree appears {{in the middle of}} the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin of coffee (seeds) prior to its appearance in Yemen. One account credits Muhammad ben Said for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast. Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia. According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401. Famous 16th century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> writings of a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in the Zeila region.|$|E
