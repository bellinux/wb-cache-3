5|$|July 18–20, 2015: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Dolores brought scattered showers and thunderstorms throughout Southern California, breaking many rainfall records and causing flooding. One such flash flood caused {{a bridge to}} collapse which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe, effectively shutting off the primary Phoenix-to-Los-Angeles route. The good <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the rain helped firefighters contain the North Fire within 3 days.|$|E

Soon the <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> not only were individuals joining {{the religion}} but whole families and social networks.|$|E
25|$|Far worse <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{during this}} time the club's {{financial}} situation became dire. The club had accumulated debts of nearly £4m, and owner Brooks Mileson fell ill and withdrew his financial support for the club (Mileson never fully recovered from his health problems and died on 3 November 2008). A confused management situation did not help. Whilst Rowan Alexander was officially still manager, Davie Irons was {{in control of the}} team. On 6 November 2007, Gretna officially sacked Alexander as manager and formally installed Irons in his position.|$|E

25|$|Prior to his {{election}} as pope in 2005, Ratzinger {{had hoped to}} retire—on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)—and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but he recovered completely. This was never officially made public—the official <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Ratzinger had fallen and struck his head against a radiator—but was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the lack on <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> on 22 July the weather was foggy and Blenden Hall had drifted on to the rocks at Inaccessible Island. Two seamen drowned trying to swim to shore. However {{all the rest of}} the crew and {{passengers}} on Blenden Hall made it to shore safely. Once there, they were marooned for four months. They subsisted on birds, birds' eggs, and seal meat. On 19 October six men sailed for Tristan da Cunha on a boat or raft that the survivors had constructed; this party was never heard from again. The survivors constructed a second boat that with three men aboard reached Tristan da Cunha on 8 November. Two boats set out from the island and rescued the remainder of the survivors.|$|E
25|$|The Australia XI {{match against}} the MCC {{used to be}} seen as {{virtually}} another Test match and important for the Australian selectors to see up and coming cricketers in action before choosing a team. For some reason in 1950–51 it was scheduled between the First and Second Tests and after the team for the latter had already been announced. Even if someone made a century or took ten wickets they could not be picked for the Australian team until the Third Test early in 1951, though Ken Archer and Jim Burke had been named in the XII and were fighting to avoid being the twelfth man. The game was held in Sydney as their rivals Melbourne were hosting two of the Tests. The Australian vice captain Arthur Morris was in charge on his home ground with local hero Keith Miller and the Victorian Neil Harvey who hardly needed testing. The batsmen Graeme Hole, wicket-keeper Gil Langley and bowlers Alan Walker, Geoff Noblet and Chris Langdon were also included, as was Ritchie Benaud, but he was too ill to play and was replaced by the veteran leg-spinner Doug Ring. Morris won the toss again and batted on a flat Sydney wicket, he added 170 with Ken Archer (81) before he was out for exactly 100, Harvey (40), Miller (62), Burke (128) and Hole (41) piled up the runs and Morris declared during the second day's tea interval for 526/9. John Warr (2/89) opened the bowling, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown failed to take a wicket and Eric Hollies (3/108) and Bob Berry (2/108 off just 14 overs) could not contain the attack. The two spinners could not blame the fielding as they each dropped Morris of their own bowling, and Berry dropping him off Hollies. Alan Walker (5/60) and Doug Ring (3/106) reduced the MCC's reply to 47/3 by stumps and it was up to Denis Compton (115) and nightwatchman Godfrey Evans (31) to restore the innings with a partnership of 85, followed by another of 130 between Compton and Gilbert Parkhouse (58). Burke added to his credentials be taking a great catch in gully to dismiss a tired Compton, leaving Brown to punch 46 before the tail gave way five runs short of saving the follow on. Morris sent the MCC back in to bat and saw them fall to 22/2 before John Dewes (66 not out) and Parkhouse (46 not out) saved the day. Dewes retired hurt at 66/2, but returned after Compton was dismissed for 29 and they ended on 173/3. Although Jim Burke made the most runs he carried the drinks in the Second Test and Archer opened with Morris, but Burke was chosen for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and made a century on debut. Langley proved to be a competent keeper, but failed to oust Don Tallon despite the latter's lack of form. The results for Freddie Brown were more dire, Compton's knee had swollen again due to his exertions and he was unfit to play at Melbourne, Berry and Hollies had proved incapable of containing the Australian batsmen and Bedser and Brown has lost the form which had caught Australia out at Brisbane. The only good <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> John Dewes had shown his fighting abilities regardless of form and a fair crowd had come to watch, so increasing coffers of the MCC Manager John Nash.|$|E

500|$|... was a {{critical}} and commercial success, and Paramount Pictures quickly prepared for a third Star Trek film. The Wrath of Khans director, Nicholas Meyer, would not return; he had disagreed with changes made to his film's ending without his consent. Upon seeing The Wrath of Khan, Leonard Nimoy became [...] "excited" [...] about playing Spock again. When asked by Paramount {{if he wanted to}} reprise the role for the third feature, Nimoy agreed and told them, [...] "You're damned right, I want to direct that picture!" [...] Studio chief Michael Eisner was reluctant to hire Nimoy because he mistakenly believed that the actor hated Star Trek and had demanded in his contract that Spock be killed. Nimoy was given the job after he persuaded Eisner that this was not the case. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's first reaction to the <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> producer Harve Bennett had [...] "hired a director you can't fire".|$|E
500|$|The ending {{sequence}} with Pam and Jim in {{the hospital}} was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs. Although the good news Jim and Pam learn {{in the hospital}} was never specifically stated, episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Pam was pregnant; the script included an off-hand question from a nurse to Pam about whether she was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later. Celotta said {{the idea of the}} pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode, although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction. The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue, but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer [...] "are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue." [...] Celotta said the show's producers have no plans to release the scene with audio. While filming Jim Halpert's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news, Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew for the last five years, so he would be glad to share this moment with them. The moment when Jim looked directly at the camera, in particular, was meant to convey the idea that he was celebrating the news with the crew. The script did not call for tears, but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Judy Berman {{praised the}} finale, stating [...] " [...] this year {{went out with}} a bang. I had my doubts and reservations, largely {{concerning}} Blair and Chuck, but I am surprised and pleased to report that I found the end of [...] "Gossip Girl" [...] Season 4 both exciting and satisfying." [...] The return of Georgina Sparks was well-received as with Serena's development, with Berman citing Serena's confession with Charlie before she could plunge to her death. [...] "This debacle, along with the events of this season in general, seems to have given S some perspective. Friends, she apologizes to Nate and Dan for leading them on and confesses to Charlie that her decision-making skills leave something to be desired! Even if lazy writing results in Serena falling into old habits next season, it's a pretty gratifying moment." [...] Berman also questioned Vanessa's motive behind publishing Dan's novel [...] "it's impossible to know whether she's trying to do her old friend one last favor or profit from stirring up more drama in his life. Considering that Jessica Szohr won't be returning to the show in the fall, we may never find out." [...] Berman also complimented the casting of director David O Russell calling it [...] "one of the show's most delightfully random cameos ever". New York Magazine labeled Chuck and Blair's relationship as the [...] "Longest-Delayed Breakup" [...] of the season, adding that [...] "the big <b>news</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Blair and Prince Louis are somehow still together and engaged, with the wedding scheduled for November sweeps. We feel comfortable assuming that by then, Chuck will have regrouped enough to break things up more definitively." ...|$|E

Rindt won the 1970 event at the expense of Brabham running out of fuel {{at the end of the}} race, and 1971 saw Stewart win again in a Tyrrell (Ken Tyrrell had started building his own cars). 1973, however, saw a huge first lap accident at Woodcote that took out 11 cars, including all 3 works Surtees cars.

Antonio Catricalà, the then head of the Italian National Authority for Fair Trading and Competition, announced that the Authority filed a case against the Atheist Bus initiative because of the potentially [...] "dangerous and mendacious nature" [...] of the ads.
