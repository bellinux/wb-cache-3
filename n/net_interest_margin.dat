40|$|Interest rate {{risk and}} bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> 1 Banks and their {{supervisors}} have spent considerable {{time and effort}} in recent years developing systems for monitoring and managing interest rate risk. 2 This special feature examines that specific component of interest rate risk arising from the possible effects of changes in market interest rates on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> Such effects can be very large if interest rate risk is not managed carefully. For example, the secondary banking crisis in the United Kingdom in the 1970 s reflected, at least in part, the funding of longer-term assets with short-term liabilities. 3 Similarly, funding of long-term, fixed rate mortgages with savings deposits led to a very sharp drop in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> at US thrift institutions in the early 1980 s when interest rates rose to historic highs and the yield curve inverted. The result was actually negative <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income for two years at US thrifts, after <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> had averaged nearly 1. 5 % over the preceding decade (FHLBB (1984)). By contrast, the results presented here suggest that commercial banks in the 10 industrial countries considered have generally managed their exposures to volatility in the yield curve in ways that have limited effects on their <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> Thus, while fluctuations in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> could be {{an important source of}} uncertainty in bank profitability – and could surely have adverse effects for particular institutions – changes in interest rates seem unlikely to undermine sharply the health of the banking sector through their effects on <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income. The next section provides background on interest rate risk at banks, and discusses methods for assessing it. Given data limitations, the approach taken here focuses on the effects of market interest rates on the average yields on bank assets and liabilities and also on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> The subsequent section reports on the empirical findings. A final section provides some concluding remarks and caveats. 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.

(Financial Management) There {{is a wide}} {{perception}} that bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> (NIMs) in Sub-Saharan Africa in general and South Africa in particular, are higher compared to other regions. The study investigates four commercial banks in South Africa {{with the aim of}} identifying the relevant factors affecting the behaviour of NIMs in commercial banking in South Africa, and draws comparisons with other markets. The study employs the Classical Linear Regression Model (CLRM) using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) data estimating technique to analyse <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> over the period 2000 to 2010. The study takes note of Ho and Saunders’s seminal work produced in 1981, and subsequent extensions and modification by other authors and researchers. <b>Net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> are modeled in a single-step together with explanatory variables driven from the theoretical model. Using data obtained from the Bankscope data base, the variables examined in the study are; competitive structure of the market, average operating costs, management’s propensity for risk aversion, credit risk exposure, the quantum of the bank’s operations, short-term money market interest rate volatility, the opportunity cost of holding reserves and quality of management running the institution. The findings of the study suggest that market power, average operating costs, degree of risk aversion, credit risk exposure, and size of operations are major factors explaining the behaviour of NIMs in South Africa. These variables are major {{in terms of the number}} of banks that exhibit statistical significance. Market power, interest rate volatility and opportunity cost of holding reserves are also relevant factors, although they affect fewer banks than the major factors.
