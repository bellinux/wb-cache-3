5|$|The AFM's {{national}} representative body is the triennial General Business Meeting. Its main function is {{the election of}} the national officers: president, deputy president, general secretary and general treasurer. The four national officers always represent the significant ethnic groups within the church. Each local assembly is entitled to send a pastor and a delegate as voting members. Additional voting members are members of the <b>National</b> <b>Leadership</b> Forum, members of standing committees, one additional member representing each church department and one additional representative of the church's theological training institutions. Before 2000, the General Business Meeting was known as the Workers Council, met annually, and possessed greater power. After the adoption of the new constitution, most of the body's power was transferred to the <b>National</b> <b>Leadership</b> Forum.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1920, the Colored Commercial Club {{organized}} to help blacks in Omaha secure employment {{and to encourage}} business enterprises among African Americans. The National Federation of Colored Women had five chapters in Omaha. In 1927 the first Urban League chapter (now the Urban League of Nebraska) in the American West was founded in the city. Whitney Young led the chapter in 1950, tripling its membership. Eventually, he would take over the <b>national</b> <b>leadership</b> of the Urban League in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of <b>national</b> <b>leadership,</b> likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E

5|$|Even so, churches {{within the}} Assemblies of God have {{experienced}} revivals {{in the last}} two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants. In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's <b>national</b> <b>leadership</b> gave it cautious approval and support.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), <b>National</b> <b>Leadership</b> Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event {{conducted by a}} lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, {{on the role of}} advisers in the OA.|$|E
5|$|Local {{assemblies}} {{are organized}} into geographical regions. Regional leadership forums are representative bodies consisting of pastors and delegates from each local assembly. Every three years, each forum elects a regional committee from {{among its members}} and a regional leader from among its pastors. The committee acts as an executive and advisory body to the regional leadership forum. Each region is represented by its leader on the <b>National</b> <b>Leadership</b> Forum. Non-geographical regions, {{in the form of}} networks of local churches that share a peculiar ministry philosophy, also exist. These are normally led by the senior pastors of urban mega-churches, who network with a number of local assemblies nationwide that look to them for leadership and mentorship.|$|E

Malhotra moved to Guelph to begin his OHL career with the Guelph Storm, during which time he was awarded the Bobby Smith Trophy as the OHL's scholastic player of the year in 1998. He has referred to it as the award he is most proud of in his hockey career. In 2009, he received the <b>National</b> <b>Leadership</b> Award in a ceremony at his former high school in Guelph.|$|E
5|$|The Chongqing model {{provided}} an alternate development paradigm that diverged from the policies preferred {{by those in}} the <b>national</b> <b>leadership</b> seen as favouring further reform such as Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. Bo's leadership in Chongqing dramatically raised his profile, both nationally and internationally. In 2010, he was named {{as one of the}} 'World's 100 Most Influential People in 2010' by Time. Observers noted that, in China's non-electoral political system, Bo's high-profile presence and bold political maneuvers essentially amounted to a public 'election campaign' for the top leadership. However, he drew the ire of some of the country's leaders; President Hu and Premier Wen were reluctant to acknowledge Bo publicly, ostensibly due to a discomfort over his leadership style.|$|E
5|$|Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka {{flew from}} Tokyo on 5 April to Tokuyama {{in a final}} attempt to {{convince}} the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet—including Admiral Itō—to accept the plan. Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it had been kept secret from most of them), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral Itō in rejecting it {{for the same reasons}} that he had expressed. Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan's <b>national</b> <b>leadership,</b> including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Diệm and the {{execution}} of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent <b>national</b> <b>leadership</b> and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary counter-insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes. In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians {{in an attempt to}} have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide <b>national</b> <b>leadership</b> in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|The Order of the Arrow is {{organized}} into four regions, Central, Southern, Northeast and Western Region; {{the boundaries of}} each OA region correspond with {{the boundaries of the}} BSA's regions. Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer adult who is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser. Each region chief is elected at the national planning meeting the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief by a caucus of the section chiefs from the given region. The members of the region committee consist of the region chief, the region chairman, all national committeemen from the region, and other appointed adult volunteers. Each region annually has a gathering of all section officers and advisers. As a region, they are trained in topics relevant to their jobs. Each region also provides opportunities for Order of the Arrow members to go through a <b>National</b> <b>Leadership</b> Seminar. This weekend course is highly rated and a lasting memory for many members.|$|E

5|$|Vietnam was {{in chaos}} after the Japanese invaded {{the country during}} World War II and {{displaced}} the French colonial administration. At {{the end of the}} war, the Japanese left the country and France, severely weakened by political turmoil within the Vichy regime, was unable to exert control. Hồ Chí Minh's Viet Minh declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and battled other Vietnamese nationalist groups as well as French forces for control of the nation. During this time, Cẩn organised a clandestine support base for Diệm in central Vietnam. At the time, Diệm was one of many nationalists who were attempting to stake a claim to <b>national</b> <b>leadership,</b> having spent a decade in self-imposed exile from public affairs. Cẩn helped weaken other anti-communist nationalist groups, such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party) and the Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), which competed with Diệm for support. On 23 October 1955, Diệm toppled Bảo Đại in a fraud-ridden referendum orchestrated by Nhu. Diệm declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later.|$|E
5|$|While Croitoru was {{awaiting}} {{trial for the}} bombing, the Hamilton branch of Satan's Choice was shut down after an informant gave the police information about the gang's involvement with drug dealing and extortion. The gang's clubhouse was confiscated and the club's <b>national</b> <b>leadership</b> decided to disband the Hamilton chapter. Croitoru got in a fight in Hamilton with another former Satan's Choice member on January 13, 1998. A police officer saw Croitoru punch the other man {{in the face and}} arrested Croitoru for assault. In addition to the assault charge, Croitoru was charged with extortion from an unrelated incident as well as carrying a concealed weapon and breaking the conditions of his release following the police station bombing. In September 1998, Croitoru was brought to trial {{for his role in the}} bombing. He was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison.|$|E
