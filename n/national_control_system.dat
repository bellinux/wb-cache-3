In the Republic of Korea, STH were highly {{prevalent}} and were considered a high priority target for national control. To promote the control, a non-governmental organization named Korea Association for Parasite Eradication (currently Korea Association of Health Promotion) was founded in 1964, and mass fecal examination followed by selective mass chemotherapy with anthelmintics was performed twice a year from 1969 to 1995 targeting whole nationwide schoolchildren. Meanwhile, decreasing patterns of national STH infections have been monitored by 7 times' quinquennial national surveys targeting general population. In 1971, the overall intestinal helminth egg positive rate was 84. 3 % (Ascaris 58. 2 %, Trichuris 65. 4 %, and hookworms 10. 7 %), which became 63. 2 % in 1976, 41. 1 % in 1981, 12. 9 % in 1986, 3. 8 % in 1992, 2. 4 % in 1997, and 4. 3 % (Ascaris 0. 03 %, Trichuris 0. 02 %, and hookworms 0 %) in 2004.

40|$|The article {{estimates}} the theoretical {{basis of the}} external state financial control in Ukraine {{in the context of}} defining its place {{in the formation of the}} functional areas of internal and external controls in order to eliminate duplication of a single <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The authors have investigated the scientific approaches to the interpretation of the concept of «external state financial control», «internal financial control», «public audit» in order to eliminate terminological confusion. It were found the differences between the external and internal financial control on the basis of comparative characteristics of such features as the entity controlling entities, controlled objects, object methods, and direction control. The concept of internal and external controls are considered to expedient to communicate with the system in which this control is identified. «Internal» in this case is identical intra-control, that is located within the executive branch, while an external control is not included in it and is external to the executive bodies of the controlled institution, and is not related to them and, as a consequence, independent. The authors suggest to form a unified system of state financial control, a clear distinction between internal and external powers of species. The authors consider that appropriate in this context will be the adoption of a single legislative act «About State Financial Control», the proposed structure is introduced in the article. Implementation of this law will contribute to the clear division of functional areas of the state control (internal and external), the elimination of departmental conflicts, and promote the formation of a single integrated control system in Ukraine, able to counteract abuses and prevent the possible loss of budgetary funds. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper assesses key {{provisions}} of the ATT by first back-grounding its origins and contested formulation before assessing its transfer, prohibition and national control provisions, Introduction The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) was adopted by vote at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in April 2013 and opened for signatures two months later. It was approved by 154 states (later revised to 156), three against (Iran, Syria and North Korea), its 23 abstentions {{including some of the}} world’s key arms exporters and manufacturers (China, Russia, India) and leading arms buyers (Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia). The treaty formally enters into force on December 24 2014 having received its requisite fiftieth ratification (including Australia and New Zealand) three months earlier. The United States reversed the previous Bush Administration’s opposition and signed the ATT in September 2013. In brief, the ATT introduces specific, legally binding measures to regulate international trade, transit and brokering of conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons (SALW). Before authorising transfers, states parties must subject them to criteria established under a mandatory <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The treaty prohibits transfers where a UN authorised arms embargo is in place, where there is violation of international agreements relating to the transfer or illicit trafficking of conventional arms, or where risks of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes are known to exist. Where such prohibitions do not apply, an assessment is required as to whether a transfer risks undermining peace and security, potential violation of human rights, mounting of terrorist attacks, or conduct of organised crime. States parties are required to report annually to the UN on international exports and imports of conventional arms, and on the national laws and administrative procedures adopted for ATT implementation...|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and nature}} of civilian firearm- and explosion-injuries in Finland, {{and the nature of}} severe gunshot injuries of the extremities were described in seven original articles. The main data sources used were the National Hospital Discharge Register, the Cause-of-Death Register, and the Archive of Death Certificates at Statistics Finland. The present study was population based. Epidemiologic methods were used in six and clinical analyses in five papers. In these clinical studies, every original hospital record and death certificate was critically analyzed. The trend of hospitalized firearm injuries has slightly declined in Finland from the late 1980 s to the early 2000 s. The occurrence decreased from 5. 1 per 100 000 person-years in 1990 to 2. 6 in 2003. The decline was found in the unintentional firearm injuries. A high incidence of unintentional injuries by firearms was characteristic of the country, while violence and homicides by firearms represented a minor problem. The incidence of fatal non-suicidal firearm injuries has been stable, 1. 8 cases per 100 000 person-years. Suicides using firearms were eight times more common during the period studied. This is contrary to corresponding reports from many other countries. However, the use of alcohol and illegal drugs or substances was detected in as many as one-third of the injuries studied. The median length of hospitalization was three days and it was significantly associated (p< 0. 001) with the type of injury. The mean length of hospital stay has decreased from the 1980 s to the early 2000 s. In this study, there was a special interest in gunshot injuries of the extremities. From a clinical point of view, the nature of severe extremital gunshot wounds, as well as the primary operative approach in their management, varied. The patients with severe injuries of this kind were managed at university and central hospital emergency departments, by general surgeons in smaller hospitals and by cardiothoracic or vascular surgeons in larger hospitals. Injuries were rarities and as such challenges for surgeons on call. Some noteworthy aspects of the management were noticed and these should be focused on in the future. On the other hand, the small population density and the relatively large geographic area of Finland do not favor high volume, centralized trauma management systems. However, experimental war surgery has been increasingly taught in the country from the 1990 s, and excellent results could be expected during the present decade. Epidemiologically, explosion injuries can be considered a minor problem in Finland at present, but their significance should not be underestimated. Fatal explosion injuries showed up sporadically. An increase occurred from 2002 to 2004 for no obvius reason. However, in view of the historical facts, a possibility for another rare major explosion involving several people might become likely within the next decade. The <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of firearms is mainly based on the new legislations from 1998 and 2002. However, as shown in this study, {{there is no reason to}} assume that the national hospitalization policies, or the political climate, or the legislation might have changed over the study period and influenced the declining development, at least not directly. Indeed, the reason for the decline to appear in the incidence of unintentional injuries only remains unclear. It may derive from many practical steps, e. g. locked firearm cases, or from the stability of the community itself. For effective reduction of firearm-related injuries, preventive measures, such as education and counseling, should be targeted at recreational firearm users. To sum up, this study showed that the often reported increasing trend in firearm as well as explosion-related injuries has not manifested in Finland. Consequently, it can be recognized that, overall, the Finnish legislation together with the various strategies have succeeded in preventing firearm- and explosion-related injuries in the country. Tässä väitöskirjatutkimuksessa, joka koostui seitsemästä osajulkaisusta, selvitettiin ampuma- ja räjähdysvammojen epidemiologiaa Suomessa kahdenkymmenen vuoden ajalta, vuodesta 1985 vuoteen 2004. Lisäksi arvioitiin kliinisemmin raajojen vakavia ampumavammoja. Sairaalahoitoa vaativat ampumavammat ovat Suomessa vähentyneet tarkastelujakson aikana. 1980 -luvun lopussa sairaalassa hoidettujen ampumavammapotilaiden insidenssi oli 5. 1 tapausta 100 000 henkilövuotta kohden (254 kpl), mutta vuonna 2003 enää vain 2, 6 tapausta 100 000 henkilövuotta kohden (133 kpl). Tämä väheneminen perustui ensisijassa tapaturmaisten vammojen vähenemiseen, kun sen sijaan väkivaltaisissa ampumavammautumisissa ei selvää pysyvämpää muutosta havaittu. Kuolemaan johtaneissa ampumavammoissa havaittiin pieni väheneminen viimevuosina. Ylivoimaisesti merkitävin riskitekijä ampumiselle on itsemurhayritys. Sairaalahoitoa vaatineita räjähdysvammautumisia esiintyi 1990 -luvulla vain 2 tapausta 100 000 henkilövuotta kohden (100 kpl). Hyvin harvinaisissa kuolemaan johtaneissa räjähdysvammoissa havaittiin pieni lisääntyminen 2000 -luvun alussa. Tutkimuksen merkittävin löydös oli, että toisin kuin monissa muissa maissa, ampumavammojen määrä on Suomessa laskussa. Tärkeä löydös on vammautumiseen liittyvä merkittävä (kolmanneksessa tapauksista) samanaikainen alkoholin ja huumeiden käyttö. Tämä on haaste tulevaisuudelle mikäli alkoholin käyttö Suomessa kasvaa. Kolmas löydös oli, että raajojen vaikeiden ampumavammojen hoidossa esiintyi yllättäen yksittäisiä komplikaatioita. Näiden taustalla on ensisijassa vammojen harvinaisuus ja laajat etäisyydet jotka eivät suosi suuria tapaturmien hoitokeskuksia. Harvinaisissa räjähdyskuolemissa on esiintynyt hienoinen nousu viimevuosina ilman selvää osoitettavaa taustasyytä. Yhteenvetona tutkimus osoitti, että ampuma- ja räjähdysvammautuminen on Suomessa kokonaisuutena vakaa ja pääosin hallinnassa. Ampumalainsäädännön uudistuksien ja erilaisten preventiivisten ohjelmien voidaan katsoa onnistuneen tehtävässään...|$|E
40|$|This thesis titled "Model methodological of {{the audit}} {{financial}} with approach Integral to the National Control System", is character descriptive and explanatory grounded in professional experience obtained {{in the field of}} the financial audit and investigations around the work of control and control being developed by the governing body of the national system of Control in compliance with provisions in articles 81 ° and 82 ° of the Constitution politics in Peru, and attribution in article 22 literal ° f) of the Act N ° 27785 22. Jul. 2002, organic law of the system National Control and the Comptroller General of the Republic. Actually, the General Comptroller of the Republic as a technical entity rector of the <b>National</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System,</b> it comes by modifying the rules of Government control and technical procedures for the exercise of Government control, in accordance with article 14 of the law N ° 27785, organic law of the system National Control and the Office of the Comptroller General; directly affecting the methodology of the financial audit and other audit approach, adopting general rules of governmental Control (NGCG), through which they leave without effect the application of the rules of audit Government (NAGUs) and Manual of governmental audit (MAGU), governmental audit planning guide, the Guide to the preparation of the report of audit Government. Subsequently the Office of the Comptroller-General approved the audit financial Government Manual, which is a normative, binding document, which defines the process for the exercise {{of the audit}} the financial and budget States, and has been designed for its application, audit companies, the institutional supervisory bodies, as well as the Comptroller General of the Republic in the implementation of the audit financial and budgetary in accordance with the rules of Government control, agreed with the international standards of audit. However, despite the changes being the governing body of the national system of Control, these do not solve the problem raised in the thesis entitled "Methodological model of auditing financial with comprehensive approach to national Control System", which should be overcome with the methodological model proposed in the thesis, which prioritises the comprehensive validation of acts and results of public management, the efficient, effective and economic use of the resources and assets of the State, as well as the compliance with legal norms and policy guidelines and action plans established by public entities in their plans Strategic. By this, we emphasize that the identified problems would be overcome to apply modern tools we propose, through the implementation and application of the governmental financial audit with Integral approach and methodology which it seeks to apply a warning or prevention control so the public administrator know real-time inconsistencies detected in its management and appropriate to remedy them, with the purpose of converting to public entities in efficient and effective, entities that comply with the ultimate aim of the control which is its continuous improvement and modernization that will ensure the fulfillment of its mission vision and goals {{for the good of the}} citizens of our country. This difference between what applies in the Peru and which applies for example in Colombia, in terms of Government control, has led to this investigation that general objective, identify and implement modern approaches to comprehensive financial audit that allows results of the evaluation of management of public entities and promote continuous improvement. To carry out this investigation has been considered taking into account the universe that make up the national system of Control (companies, institutions, ministries and regional and local governments) which we take as a sample 15 entities: 05 ministries, universities 02, 03 regional Governments, local government 02, and 03 State enterprises. In addition, we will consider interview 10 partners of firms of Auditors which trail those entities that represent the study sample, 10 officials from auditees and 10 public accountants. To achieve our objective, we proceeded to carry out a survey to participants in our sample and whose main retrieved data is that <b>national</b> <b>Control</b> <b>system</b> currently does not allow the comprehensive assessment of the management and their financial and budgetary, effects reflected in the financial statements and budget States; in order to validate the use of efficient, effective and economic resources of the State, so it is a priority that the governmental financial audit with Integral approach is applied promptly, for which need to modify the current regulations, which allow the Comptroller General of the Republic, its modernization and application technology tools and modern approaches of auditing activities and control actions that you schedule and execute in the scope of the sector government. The proposed comprehensive audit approach is based on the comprehensive understanding of the Government entity to be audited in their systemic environment, which leads to evaluate its management planning by verifying the fulfillment of its mission, vision and objectives, through documents management generated, and their alignment with the policies of the Government, also evaluate the results of management through processes that developed, identifying and proposing recommendations that exceed the internal and/or external risks that have affected them. This methodological change is carried out in five phases which widely explained in this work, which seek to formalize rules that ensure the comprehensive reform of the national system of Control in the Peru. Key words: approach, system, audit, comprehensive Control. La presente Tesis titulada “Modelo Metodológico de la Auditoría Financiera con Enfoque Integral para el Sistema Nacional de Control”, es de carácter descriptivo y explicativo fundamentada en la experiencia profesional obtenida en el campo de la auditoría financiera y las investigaciones realizadas en torno a la labor de fiscalización y control que viene desarrollando el ente rector del Sistema Nacional de Control, en cumplimiento de lo establecido en los artículos 81 ° y 82 ° de la Constitución Política del Perú, y la atribución conferida en el artículo 22 ° literal f) de la Ley N° 27785 de 22. Jul. 2002, Ley Orgánica del Sistema Nacional de Control y de la Contraloría General de la República. Actualmente, la Contraloría General de la República como ente técnico rector del Sistema Nacional de Control, viene modificando las normas de control gubernamental y procedimientos técnicos correspondientes al ejercicio del control gubernamental, de conformidad con el artículo 14 ° de la Ley N° 27785, Ley Orgánica del Sistema Nacional de Control y de la Contraloría General de la República; afectando directamente el enfoque metodológico de la auditoría financiera y otras auditorías, al haber aprobado las Normas Generales de Control Gubernamental (NGCG), a través del cual dejan sin efecto la aplicación de las Normas de Auditoría Gubernamental (NAGUs), el Manual de Auditoría Gubernamental (MAGU), la Guía de Planeamiento de Auditoría Gubernamental, y la Guía para la Elaboración del Informe de Auditoría Gubernamental. Posteriormente la Contraloría General de la República, aprobó el Manual de Auditoría Financiera Gubernamental, que es un documento normativo, de obligatorio cumplimiento, que define el proceso para el ejercicio de la auditoría a los estados financieros y presupuestales, y ha sido diseñado para su aplicación por las Sociedades de Auditoría, los Órganos de Control Institucional, así como la Contraloría General de la República en la ejecución de la auditoría financiera y presupuestaria, de conformidad con las normas de control gubernamental, concordado con las normas internacionales de auditoría vigentes. Sin embargo, pese a los cambios que viene realizando el ente rector del Sistema Nacional de Control, estos no resuelven el problema planteado en la Tesis titulada “Modelo Metodológico de la Auditoría Financiera con Enfoque Integral para el Sistema Nacional de Control”, la misma que debe ser superado con el modelo metodológico que se propone en la Tesis, la misma que prioriza la validación integral de los actos y resultados de la gestión pública, el uso eficiente, eficaz y económico de los recursos y bienes del Estado, así como del cumplimiento de las normas legales y de los lineamientos de política y planes de acción establecidos por las entidades públicas en sus Planes Estratégicos. Por ello, señalamos que el Sistema Nacional de Control, no tiene un modelo metodológico de auditoría financiera que tienda a transparentar la información presupuestaria y financiera del Estado peruano, identificando los actos de corrupción y promoviendo la mejora continua de la gestión pública; asuntos que se superaría de aplicarse la metodología y herramientas modernas que proponemos, a través de la implantación y aplicación de la Auditoría Financiera Gubernamental con Enfoque Integral, la cual busca aplicar un control de advertencia o de prevención para que el administrador público conozca en tiempo real las inconsistencias detectadas en su gestión y proceda a subsanarlas, con lo finalidad de convertir a las entidades públicas en entes eficientes y eficaces, que cumplan con el fin último del control que es su mejoramiento continuo y modernización que asegure el cumplimiento de su misión, visión y objetivos en bien de los ciudadanos de nuestro país. Esta gran diferencia entre lo que se aplica en el Perú y lo que se aplica por ejemplo en Colombia, en materia de control gubernamental, ha conllevado a que se efectúe esta investigación que tiene por objetivo general, identificar y aplicar modernos enfoques de auditoría financiera integral que permita obtener resultados de la evaluación de gestión de las entidades públicas y promueva su mejora continua. Para llevar a cabo esta investigación se ha considerado tomar en cuenta el universo que conforman el Sistema Nacional de Control (empresas, entidades, ministerios y gobiernos regionales y locales) de los cuáles tomamos como muestra la información financiera auditada de 15 entidades: 05 Ministerios, 02 Universidades, 03 Gobiernos Regionales, 02 Gobiernos Locales, y 03 Empresas del Estado. Además, consideraremos entrevistarnos con 10 socios de firmas de auditores que auditaron esas entidades que representan la muestra de estudio, 10 funcionarios de entidades auditadas y 10 contadores públicos. Para cumplir con nuestro objetivo, se procedió a efectuar una encuesta a los participantes de nuestra muestra y cuyo principal dato obtenido es que el Sistema Nacional de Control actualmente no permite la evaluación integral de la gestión y sus efectos financieros y presupuestarios, plasmados en los estados financieros y estados presupuestarios; a fin de validar el uso eficiente, eficaz y económico de los recursos del Estado, por lo que es prioritario que la Auditoría Financiera Gubernamental con enfoque Integral, sea aplicada con prontitud, para lo cual deberá modificarse la normatividad actual vigente, que permita a la Contraloría General de la República, su modernización y aplicación herramientas tecnológicas y enfoques modernos de auditoría en las actividades y acciones de control que programe y ejecute en el ámbito del sector gubernamental. El enfoque de auditoría integral propuesto se fundamenta en el conocimiento integral de la entidad gubernamental a ser auditada en su entorno sistémico, el cual conlleva a evaluar la planificación de su gestión verificando el cumplimiento de su misión, visión y objetivos, a través de los documentos de gestión que generan, y su alineamiento con las políticas públicas del gobierno, asimismo, evaluar los resultados de la gestión a través de los procesos que desarrolla, identificando y proponiendo recomendaciones que superen los riesgos internos y/o externos que los hayan afectado. Este cambio metodológico se efectúa en cinco fases que explicamos ampliamente en este trabajo, el cual buscamos se formalice mediante normas que aseguren la reforma integral del Sistema Nacional de Control en el Perú.

40|$|Management review In 2016, all Finnish {{nuclear power}} plants {{operated}} safely and caused no danger to their surrounding environment or employees. The collective radiation doses of employees were yet again historically low in {{almost all of the}} plant units and radioactive releases into the environment very small. The low employee radiation doses were the result of short annual outages and improvements implemented at the {{nuclear power plants}}. In spring 2016, three leaking fuel assemblies were replaced at Olkiluoto 1 during an extra refuelling outage, and then three more assemblies were replaced in connection with the annual outage due to subsequent leaks. The fuel leaks were one reason why the employee radiation doses at the plant unit were somewhat higher than in the previous years. Over the course of 2016, Fortum Power and Heat Oy (Fortum) submitted to STUK a total of 20 operational event reports. The operational events did not compromise nuclear or radiation safety. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the periodic inspection programme during the annual outage. During the annual outages, Fortum inspected – according to a programme agreed with STUK – that there was no hydrogen flaking in the reactor pressure vessel of the power plant unit 1. Hydrogen flaking could have occurred during manufacture of the pressure vessel. A similar inspection on the pressure vessel of Loviisa 2 was performed in 2014. No hydrogen flaking was detected in either of the pressure vessels. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on the Fortum’s organisation, inspecting Fortum’s management, competence, resource and procurement processes. Also in 2016, Fortum completed a major organisational renewal, and STUK oversaw its implementation and initial impact as part of its regulatory oversight. In 2016, Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) submitted to STUK 11 operational event reports. Some radioactive materials were released into the environment in the case of two of the events. One of the events involved fuel leaks and the other an error during maintenance. The set limits were not exceeded and neither of the events compromised radiation safety of the population. Both events increased the radiation level inside the plant, which was taken into account when planning the work to be done by the employees. STUK performed an annual outage inspection in compliance with the periodic inspection programme during the annual outage. TVO implemented a new organisation and operations model in 2015. Based on inspections by STUK, the new operations model has been largely established, but there are still some challenges pertaining to the atmosphere at the company and the adequacy of resources. STUK will continue to monitor as part of its regulatory oversight the situation and the actions taken by TVO to maintain the organisation’s safety culture during the challenging change. At both Olkiluoto and Loviisa, modifications required for improving safety continued. New main steam line safety valves were installed at Loviisa 1 during the 2016 annual outage. They will also operate in a case where water flows through them in addition to steam. A similar installation was carried out at Loviisa 2 in 2014. New main steam line radiation measuring instruments were also installed and commissioned at Loviisa 1. Of the improvement measures started after the Fukushima accident, further improvements of the flood protection and securing the cooling of the fuel pools are still remaining. Their planning proceeded in 2016. An improvement project of the diesel fuel storage and transfer system was completed in 2016. STUK continued its review of the Loviisa I&C renewal documents and supervised installation work of the renewal’s first phase during the 2016 annual outage. The first phase included a preventive safety function control and indication system as well as modernisation of the I&C status monitoring system. The rest of the I&C renewal installations will be completed during the 2017 and 2018 annual outages. As a result of the Fukushima accident, Olkiluoto will improve, for example, systems used to cool the reactor and add whole new systems for pumping water into the reactor in case of a complete loss of AC power. Another ongoing project at Olkiluoto is an upgrade of the reactor coolant pumps and the emergency diesel generators. In 2016, first of the six reactor coolant pumps in Olkiluoto 1 was replaced. TVO plans to commission the new reactor coolant pumps between 2016 and 2018. STUK continued its review of documents pertaining to the modifications and the supervision of manufacture. The installation and construction work of Olkiluoto 3 are nearing the end, and full-scale testing of the systems and components was started in 2016. Testing of the I&C systems started {{at the beginning of the}} year and the first process system tests were performed in April 2016. TVO submitted an operating licence application for the plant unit to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in April 2016. At the same time, TVO submitted the documents on the plant and its operation required by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Decree to STUK for approval. In 2016, STUK focused its regulatory oversight on review of the operating licence application and on oversight of the remaining installations and the commissioning activities. While reviewing the operating licence application, STUK also prepared implementation decisions for Olkiluoto 3 of the updated YVL Guides that were published in 2013. The new YVL Guides will enter into force for Olkiluoto 3 as soon as the operating licence is granted. Due to suspected product forgeries involving manufacturers in France, STUK required reports from the power companies on whether the suspicions involve manufacture of the components used at Olkiluoto 3 or whether any components from the said manufacturers have been used at the operating nuclear power plants. The report on Olkiluoto 3 must be submitted to STUK by the end of April 2017. No forgeries have been detected at the operating plant units, but the reports on Loviisa will be supplemented in early 2017. In June 2015, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE a construction licence application for a new nuclear power plant. At the same time, Fennovoima submitted to STUK for review documents required by the Nuclear Energy Decree. Fennovoima has supplemented and will supplement the construction licence application in stages between 2015 and 2018. Delivery of documents has been delayed from the schedule of the first licensing plan due to slower organisation than expected of the project and its supply chain and due to a lack of resources in the design organisation. STUK monitored the development of Fennovoima’s management system and quality management, and assessed the company’s organisational resources to begin construction of a nuclear power plant. In September 2015, STUK launched the inspections included in the regulatory inspection programme, and a total of 15 inspections of Fennovoima and key organisations of the plant supplier were carried out in 2016. Furthermore, STUK’s experts participated as observers in audits of the plant supplier and its subcontractors, arranged by Fennovoima. The handling and storage of spent nuclear fuel and operational waste and the disposal of operational waste were implemented safely, and no events compromising safety were detected at the Loviisa or Olkiluoto nuclear power plants. Due to the successful planning of operations, the plants accumulated clearly less operational waste than nuclear power plants on average. An important positive development in the waste management of the plants was the fact that operation of a solidification facility for liquid radioactive waste at the Loviisa nuclear power plant started on 15 February 2016 after STUK had approved the related application. Fortum continued the planning of repairs of the damage observed in the outer surface of the concrete vault in the solidified waste disposal facility, which is why the disposal of solidified waste could not be started yet. The operating licence for the research reactor FiR 1 of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is valid until the end of 2023. VTT shut down the research reactor for financial reasons in June 2015 and has been preparing decommissioning of the research reactor ever since. STUK has conducted all the measures necessary for the oversight of the reactor that was shut down and prepared for the review of the application on the decommissioning of the reactor. VTT submitted a nuclear waste management plan for the research reactor to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in September 2016. The report described all measures since the 2015 report and all planned measures up until 2022. STUK stated in its statement to the MEAE that VTT had clearly progressed with the planning of the research reactor’s decommissioning over the course of the past year. The most important open issues regarding the decommissioning of the research reactor involve the return of spent fuel to the United States and the storage and disposal of dismantling waste. After Posiva Oy received a construction licence from the Government on 12 November 2015, STUK’s oversight has focused on the construction of the encapsulation and disposal facility. The regulatory oversight during the construction stage covers design, manufacture, construction and installation of the nuclear waste facility and its safety-classified systems, structures and components. This stage also includes the nuclear waste facility’s commissioning stage, at which time STUK will oversee Posiva’s operations, review testing programmes and results, and perform commissioning inspections. In 2016, STUK’s oversight focused particularly on the assessment of Posiva’s readiness for construction after the submission of the construction licence. STUK continued to oversee construction of the underground research facility by Posiva, Posiva’s system design, activities of the Posiva organisation and development of Posiva’s safety analyses. An important stage in 2016 was the start of the construction of the disposal facility according to the construction licence. STUK comprehensively assessed Posiva’s readiness for construction before the construction work was started. In June 2016, Fennovoima submitted to the MEAE its environmental impact assessment programme on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel as required in the 2010 decision-inprinciple. The submission of the EIA programme started Fennovoima’s spent fuel disposal project and the selection process of the disposal facility site. Fennovoima has proposed Sydänneva in Pyhäjoki and Eurajoki as the potential sites. The more exact research area in Eurajoki has not been determined as of yet. In its statement on the EIA programme, STUK emphasised the fact that the proposed process would last a long time, the need to regularly assess the programme to ensure that it is up to date and the fact that the exact research area in Eurajoki must be determined as soon as possible. In addition to the operation and construction of a nuclear facility, the use of nuclear energy as laid down in section 2 of the Nuclear Energy Act includes the possession, manufacture, production, transfer, handling, use, storage, transport, export and import of nuclear material. Furthermore, components, systems and information required by nuclear facilities are subject to licensing and oversight by virtue of the Nuclear Energy Act. In 2016, STUK became aware of two cases of import without the proper licence. Nuclear safeguards in Finland were implemented in compliance with the international treaties. Nuclear safeguards ensure that nuclear materials and other nuclear items remain in peaceful use in compliance with the relevant licences and declarations and that nuclear facilities and related technologies are only utilised for peaceful purposes. STUK maintains a <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> which aim is to take care of the necessary oversight of use of nuclear energy for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. STUK processed reports and declarations on nuclear materials and performed safeguards inspections together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission. STUK actively promoted with the IAEA and the European Commission the development of nuclear safeguards for the disposal of spent fuel. Key issues in this development work were the development of a new oversight model and a new fuel measuring technology...|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} public {{administration}} {{and control of}} timber production in its biodiversity-rich forests, in 2000 Ecuador implemented {{the development of an}} innovative scheme: the Outsourced <b>National</b> Forest <b>Control</b> <b>System.</b> The system was based on three components: (i) Vigilancia Verde, a government-civil society body responsible for policing the road transport of forest products; (ii) the Regentes Forestales, professional foresters with public responsibility for monitoring legality in the forest; and (iii) the outsourcing to a private company of administrative and verification services. The innovation and early achievements of this system attracted worldwide attention but, in 2002, the implementation of the third component engendered fierce opposition within the country. In October 2003, Ecuador’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled against the component, leading to its suspension and the overall weakening of the system.

40|$|<b>National</b> food <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are a {{key element}} in the {{protection}} of consumers from unsafe foods and from other fraudulent practices. International guidance is available and provides a framework for enhancing national systems. However, it is recognized that before reaching decisions on the necessary improvements to a national system, an analysis is required of the current state of key elements in the present system. This paper provides such an analysis for the State of Kuwait. The fragmented nature of the food <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is described. Four key elements of the Kuwaiti system are analyzed: the legal framework, the administrative structures, the enforcement activity and the provision of education and training. It is noted that the country has a dependence on imported foods and that the present <b>national</b> food <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is largely based on an historic approach to food sampling at the point of import and is unsustainable.

40|$|Effective <b>national</b> food <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are {{essential}} {{to ensure the safety}} of food and to protect consumers. They are also critical in enabling countries to assure the safety and quality of foods entering international trade and to ensure that imported foods conform to national requirements (FAO, 2007). During recent years, GCC countries have moved to update and strengthen their systems and infrastructure for food control. Progressive efforts have been made both at national and regional level to strengthen capacity in food safety and quality. Despite the efforts of capacity building performed within the <b>national</b> food <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in the Region, countries still have fragmented systems and the situation is far from being adequate as many problems continue to persist. The high import dependence together with new foodborne risks and the emergence of serious transboundary food threats have highlighted the challenges to securing safe and good quality food as well as protecting consumers. An overview and assessment of the food control situation has outlined some of the most important issues and has generated several recommendations providing guidance as to how the food <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in the region can rise to the challenges identified, stressing the importance of a risk based food chain approach and regional collaboration. A detailed assessment of the food <b>control</b> <b>system</b> in Kuwait has identified organisational needs and gaps and has provided recommendations to help in the. development, implementation and enhancement of food control. Analysing progress in the UAB, where HACCP has been incorporated into their <b>national</b> food <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> has highlighted the importance of HACCP as a food control tool and has emphasized the role of government agencies in driving/encouraging the successful implementation of HACCP-based food <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> Evaluating the system in Saudi Arabia has revealed the advantages and challenges of reforming and streamlining food control activities with a central authority to lead food safety enforcement. An overview of the current food <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in each of Bahrain, Oman and Qatar has also been presented, contributing to the overall analysis. With these findings, the performance of each GCC country has been benchmarked against internationally accepted criteria, resulting in a compliance percentage score for each country. Finally, a proposal is made to establish a GCC Central Food Safety Authority to encourage the development of a common and integral GCC food policy; act as a scientific point of reference for the entire region and facilitate harmonisation between the member States. This thesis hence provides guidelines that would assist the competent authorities of GCC national governments and other governments of the world, in the development and improvement of their <b>national</b> food <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} that the post-Cold War establishment of <b>national</b> export <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in former Soviet states displays organized hypocrisy. Organized hypocrisy is a phenomenon in which formal organizational structures adopted for symbolic purposes are decoupled from actual behavior. It arises as a response to inconsistent pressures on organizations deriving from the organizational environment. Since the end of the Cold War, former Soviet states have, with Western pressure and assistance, developed national legal and regulatory <b>systems</b> to <b>control</b> the export and transshipment of goods and technologies with applications in the development of weapons of mass destruction. While this has resulted in the establishment of formal structures and procedural arrangements conforming, to varying degrees, to international standards, the mere existence of <b>national</b> export <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> has not translated into consistent implementation and enforcement. This discrepancy has generally been treated as a problem arising from a lack of capacity (resources and expertise to effectively enforce export controls) or political will within former Soviet states. Current policies, appropriate for addressing capacity problems, are unlikely to affect implementation problems arising from organized hypocrisy. This paper surveys relevant theoretical and methodological issues, and policy implications, and presents a plausibility probe of {{the hypothesis that}} organized hypocrisy has effects in the export control area that are not reducible to lack of capacity or political will...|$|R

40|$|Stringent {{food safety}} {{requirements}} set by developed country markets, which require exporting countries to establish effective <b>national</b> food <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> (NFCS) that guarantee {{safety of the}} products to the market, pose a challenge to Sub-Saharan countries in development of aquaculture products as alternative exports following the decline of capture fisheries. In the study, four components of Uganda's NFCS including legislation, competent authority, inspection services, and laboratory services were evaluated for compliance with FAO/WHO, European Union (EU), and the United States (US) market recommendations for guaranteeing aquaculture product safety. Using a checklist, component elements were benchmarked and scored, and components ranked for compliance with the recommendations. On a scale of 0 - 5, where 0 denotes none, 1 very low, 2 low, 3 some, 4 almost total, and 5 full compliance, only laboratory services had a barely acceptable score of 3. 3 (some compliance). The rest including legislation which is central in setting the level of controls by the other three components scored below three, and the combined score for all components was only 2. 2, indicating that Uganda's NFCS was still short of the requirements to allow entrepreneurs to access markets in the EU and other developed countries. The low score is partly attributed to the dynamics of this country's fledgling aquaculture industry and the rapidly evolving food safety requirements in the international markets. <b>National</b> food <b>control</b> <b>system</b> Aquaculture Compliance International requirements Uganda Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{criminal}} justice policy {{has a strong}} inclination to confront <b>national</b> crime <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in accordance to corresponding levels of punitiveness. Some author (Díez-Ripollés, 2011, 2013) has advocated for a more enriched and comprehensive comparative framework, which is founded in either the social inclusion or the social exclusion effects that different crime <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> entail on three specific groups: suspects, offenders and ex-offenders. To this end, it identifies nine topic pools (control of public spaces, legal safeguards, sentencing and sanctions systems, harshest penalties, prison rules, preventive intervention, legal and social status of offenders and ex-offenders, police and criminal records, youth {{criminal justice}}), each of them comprising a number of punitive rules or practices. Assuming this model, we are designing and validating a comparative instrument able to measure current criminal policy of Western industrialized countries in accordance to the social inclusion / social exclusion dimension. In order {{to achieve this goal}} we have chosen a methodology, which intends to establish an inter-judge agreement on the social exclusive character of a certain amount of punitive rules and practices previously included within those pools. In this presentation, we will explain how we designed the questionnaire sent to the experts, as well as the results of the first validation process. This took place with the cooperation of over 70 international experts from 18 different Western industrialized countries. The inter-judge agreement on the punitive rules and practices capable of producing significant social exclusive effects on the three studied groups was verified through inter-rater reliability (IRR) statistical tests, like the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Aiken's V Coefficient. We will also describe the pending validation process. Once available, we intend to draw attention of the criminological community to this tool for comparing <b>national</b> crime <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and to promote its application.
