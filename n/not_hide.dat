5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{initially}} {{supported the}} separatist movement in Sicily. On December 6, 1943, Vizzini participated {{at the first}} clandestine regional convention of the Sicilian separatists movement of the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano - MIS) in Catania. Other prominent Mafia bosses like Giuseppe Genco Russo, Gaetano Filippone, Michele Navarra and Francesco Paolo Bontade did <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> their sympathies for the separatists either. The separatists benefited from covert support of the OSS. As Italy experienced a leftward drift in 1943-1944, the American military became increasingly concerned about their future prospects in Italy. The island's naval bases and strategic location in the Mediterranean provided a possible future counterbalance to a Communism on the Italian mainland. The Italian Communist Party's membership had doubled and the largely left inspired resistance movement in the north was gathering strength.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} {{fight with a}} knife {{received}} {{early in the game}} and later with firearms that feature auto-aim. There are also sequences where the player can snipe enemies with a sniper rifle. Enemies do <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> {{due to a lack of}} a cover system. The player can earn money by finishing missions and robbing pedestrians, which can then be used to buy food, weaponry, spray paint, and accessories for the character's home. The mobile game features minigames for robbing pedestrians, stealing, and hijacking vehicles. While robbing, the player taps happy and angry face icons to terrorize the victim into giving more money. When stealing, a Tetris clone lets the player fit more items into the truck, and the carjacking minigame lets the player earn more money for scaring the captive passenger by driving at high speeds.|$|E

25|$|According to his great-great-grandson, d'Alembert {{received}} him rather poorly, {{and to get}} rid of him {{gave him}} a thick mathematics book, saying to come back when he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.|$|E
25|$|A Matter of Principle: Published in 2011, Black {{described}} his indictment and the trial, the subsequent conviction, imprisonment and the appeal.

Black reserved the most indignation toward the prosecutors who he believed mounted a campaign to destroy him. The book also discussed his views on politics, corporate governance, and the U.S. justice system and its need of reform.|$|E

This, though, was {{as nothing}} when set against his miserable 2004: a career-best knock of 99 against Warwickshire could <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> {{the fact that}} he was selected for only three County Championship matches, in which he took precisely one wicket in total; and though he played ten one-day games these were almost entirely as a batsman: he bowled only 36 List A balls in 2004.|$|E

In May 1963 Danjon left Radio Andorra and became Assistant Secretary of the Syndicat d'Initiatives Valleys of Andorra in Andorra la Vella, then in 1966 became director of the House of Andorra in Paris. Then from 1975 to 1981, he worked at Sud Radio and then joined the Andorran Ministry of Education and Culture until 1989.|$|E

In an effort to evade them, Frodo puts on the Ring, not realizing it does <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> him from them. The Witch-king stabs him with a morgul-blade. Aragorn manages to fight off the attackers, but Frodo's blood is corrupted by evil. As they race to Rivendell, they are met by Glorfindel (Steve Staley), who gives Frodo his horse. Frodo crosses the River Bruinen, and the Nazgûl attempt to follow, but the waves of the river, {{under the control of}} Elrond, rise up, washing the Nazgûl away. At this point, Frodo faints.|$|E

The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council’s Declaration Nostra Aetate, whose fourth chapter represents the Magna Charta of the Holy See's dialogue with the Jewish world. The Statement Between Jerusalem and Rome does <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, {{now and in the}} future.|$|E
25|$|More {{positively}} speaking, Masayoshi Son (Son Jeong-ui), {{a businessman}} and CEO of Japanese telecom giant SoftBank, is of Zainichi background. In addition, some of Japan's baseball players and martial artists were of Zainichi Korean background, including Rikidōzan (Kim Sin-rak), Mas Oyama (Choi Yeong-eui), Isao Harimoto (Jang Hun), and Masaichi Kaneda (Kim Kyung-hong). To avoid discrimination, some Zainichi Koreans have adopted Japanese names. Today, however, as {{the relationship between}} Japan and South Korea has improved, there also exist many Zainichi Koreans or former Zainichi Koreans with Japanese nationality who do <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> their origin and are in full activity, such as Yu Miri, an Akutagawa Prize-winning playwright and Tadanari Lee (Lee Chung-Sung), a Japanese football player of Korean origin.|$|E

25|$|Thirteen American {{civilians were}} killed by the Japanese during the battle. Six U.S. Navy seamen decided to evade capture from the Japanese rather than surrender; five were {{eventually}} captured by the Japanese and beheaded. George Ray Tweed, a U.S. Navy radioman and one of the original six men, managed to survive with the help of local Chamorros. They moved him from village to village, sometimes endangering their own families for his protection. The Japanese knew that an unknown American could <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> without some form of help. Consequently, Chamorro suspects were questioned, tortured, and beheaded. Despite the horrific abuses, Chamorros loyal to the United States protected Tweed. The radioman managed to covertly endure throughout the two and one-half years of occupation.|$|E
25|$|The Temple Beau is {{straightforward}} unlike Love in Several Masques, and {{it relies on}} a simpler set of patterns: instead of triplicates, the images are repeated only once. Additionally, many of the characters are analogous to {{the roles of the}} characters within the other play (Wilding and Wisemore, Veromil and Merital, Valentine and Malvil, etc.). However, the plot of the two plays are different because Fielding focuses more on hypocrisy and how characters interact with Wilding. Bellaria's two aunts, Lady Pedant and Lady Gravely, representing immodesty and prudishness respectively, try to influence her actions; Bellaria is able to avoid the suggestions of both, and believes that one should <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> their love for another and should be passionate towards a virtuous man. When it comes to matters of gender, the play expresses a view of equality between the sexes that manifests in marriage. However, the play reveals that there are different standards for the genders even though the male characters may express concerns about these double standards.|$|E
25|$|Kỳ and Thiệu were {{reluctant}} to campaign and meet the populace as they saw such events as liabilities rather than opportunities {{to win over the}} public, and showed little interest in gaining popular support in any case, as they could always count on a rigging of the ballot. The CIA reported that the pair had no intention of participating on the arranged rallies with the civilian candidates because they felt that “possible heckling from the audience that would be too humiliating.” Thiệu and Kỳ were correct; they made one public campaign appearance at a rally, where a very disapproving crowd in Huế assailed Kỳ as a “hooligan” and “cowboy leader.” Kỳ and Thiệu decided to campaign indirectly by appearing at set piece ceremonial appointments, such as transferring land titles to peasants, as hostile elements from the general population {{were less likely to be}} present. Thiệu took a restrained and more moderate stance during the campaign toward the issue of demoncracy, while Kỳ, the public face of the ticket and the incumbent government, went on the attack, damaging the pair’s image and supposed commitment to democracy. Kỳ did <b>not</b> <b>hide</b> his distaste for democracy or his opponents and “described the civilian candidates as 'ordure' , 'traitors,' and 'destroyers of the national interest.'” He continued on to say that if his opponents continued to attack him, he would cancel the poll. In the accompanying senate election, Kỳ openly endorsed 11 slates, but only one was successful in gaining one of the six seats.|$|E
