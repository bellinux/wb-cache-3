40|$|Abstract. Currently {{available}} CAD systems require {{geometric parameters}} to have fixed values. Valid range information on parameters cannot be properly represented and embedded in existing CAD data. Specifying fixed parameter values implicitly adds rigid {{constraints on the}} geometry, which {{have the potential to}} introduce conflicts during later design stages. In this paper, a geometric modeling scheme based on <b>nominal</b> <b>interval</b> representation and analysis is presented to represent design uncertainty and inexactness. Parameters are represented by nominal intervals, which contain the information of nominal values, lower bounds, and upper bounds. Interval constraints represent inexactness at the early design stages, uncertainty in the detailed design, as well as the boundary information for design optimization. To solve under-constrained and over-constrained interval problems, iteration-based equation solving methods are used. A generalized nonlinear constraint solving method based on linear enclosure is developed for fast convergence. Inequalities are transformed into equations and can be solved uniformly. Interval subdivision and constraint re-specification methods are developed for design refinement. Active and inactive constraints are differentiated in sensitivity analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{evolving}} coastal observatory {{has been}} {{hosted by the}} National Oceanography Centre at Liverpool, United Kingdom, for more than nine years. Within this observatory an instrumented ferry system has been developed and operated to provide near-surface scientific measurements of the Irish Sea. Passenger vessels such as ferries {{have the potential to}} be used as cost-effective platforms for gathering high-resolution regular measurements of the properties of near-surface water along their routes. They are able to operate on an almost year-round basis, and they usually have a high tolerance to adverse weather conditions. Examples of the application of instrumented ferry systems include environmental monitoring, the generation of long-term measurement time series, the provision of information for predictive model validation, and data for model assimilation purposes. This paper discusses the development of an engineering system installed on board an Irish Sea passenger ferry. Particular attention is paid to explaining the engineering development required to achieve a robust, automated measuring system that is suitable for long-term continuous operation. The ferry, operating daily between Birkenhead and Belfast or Dublin, United Kingdom, was instrumented between December 2003 and January 2011 when the route was closed. Measurements were recorded at a <b>nominal</b> <b>interval</b> of 100 m and real-time data were transmitted every 15 min. The quality of the data was assessed. The spatial and temporal variability of the temperature and salinity fields are investigated as the ferry crosses a variety of shelf sea and coastal water column types. ...|$|E

In pursuit of empirically grounded answers to the “Why " question, which is critical in understanding and establishing a scientific ground for traffic classification research, this paper reveals the three sources of the discriminative power in classifying the Internet application traffic: (i) ports, (ii) the sizes of the first one-two (for UDP flows) or four-five (for TCP flows) packets, and (iii) discretization of those features. We find that C 4. 5 performs the best under any circumstances, {{as well as the}} reason why; because the algorithm discretizes input features during classification operations. We also find that the entropy-based Minimum Description Length discretization on ports and packet size features substantially improve the classification accuracy of every machine learning algorithm tested (by as much as 59. 8 %!) and make all of them achieve> 93 % accuracy on average without any algorithm-specific tuning processes.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} digital model SibCrust of the crustal {{structure}} of the Siberian craton (SC) and the West Siberian basin (WSB), based on all seismic profiles published since 1960 and sampled with a <b>nominal</b> <b>interval</b> of 50 km. Data quality is assessed and quantitatively assigned to each profile based on acquisition and interpretation method and completeness of crustal model. The database represents major improvement in coverage and resolution and includes depth to Moho, thickness and average P-wave velocity of five crustal layers (sediments, and upper, middle, lower, and lowermost crust) and Pn velocity. Maps and cross sections demonstrate strong crustal heterogeneity, which correlates weakly with tectono-thermal age and strongly with tectonic setting. Sedimentary thickness varies from 0 – 3 km in stable craton to 10 – 20 km in extended regions. Typical Moho depths are 44 – 48 km in Archean crust and up-to 54 km around the Anabar shield, 40 – 42 km in Proterozoic orogens, 35 – 38 km in extended cratonic crust, and 38 – 42 km in the West Siberian basin. Average crustal Vp velocity is similar for the SC and the WSB and shows a bimodal distribution with peaks at ca. 5. 4 km/s in deep sedimentary basins and ~ 6. 2 – 6. 6 km/s {{in parts of the}} WSB and SC. Exceptionally high basement Vp velocities (6. 8 – 7. 0 km/s) at the northern border between the SC and the WSB indicate the presence of magmatic intrusions and are proposed to mark the source zone of the Siberian LIP. The cratonic crust generally consists of three layers and high-velocity lowermost crust (Vp~ 7. 4 km/s) is observed only locally. Pn velocities are generally ~ 8. 2 km/s in the SC and WSB and abnormally high (8. 6 – 8. 9 km/s) around kimberlite fields.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{research}} was to obtain medical personnel perceptions about the role of behavioral health psychology within their medical care practices in Oregon. Four hypotheses were explored. Hypothesis 1 asserted that medical personnel from urban, suburban, and rural locations would hold significantly different views; Hypothesis 2 suggested that the sample would more likely refer the more acute patients; Hypothesis 3 posited that medical personnel would make more referrals if they knew a mental health provider; Hypothesis 4 stated that there would be significant differences between the perceptions and practices of female and male members of this sample. A 26 -item questionnaire was sent to a multi-stage probability random sample of 509 medical personnel, representing 4. 1 % of those holding licenses from the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners as of April 10, 2011. Of the 509 questionnaires originally mailed, 69 were returned and usable (14. 9 % of the sample). The questionnaire collected <b>nominal,</b> <b>interval,</b> and ratio data to explore four working hypotheses. The four hypotheses were explored via analyses of variance and correlations between various factors. Results indicate that (H 1 a) where the medical personnel practiced did not impact the acuity levels they assigned to patient symptoms or the use of behavioral health referral services; (H 1 b) those practicing in urban and suburban locales who wanted to refer to externally located behavioral health specialists preferred referring to psychiatrists; (H 1 c) practice locations did not impact either the perceived need for or actual referrals made; (H 1 d) practice locations also did not impact the type of professionals to whom referrals were made; (H 2) respondents were expecting to refer both lower and higher acuity level patients for behavioral health services; (H 3) knowing a specific behavioral health specialist did not significantly affect the referral process; (H 4) more female medical professionals believed their patients from last year would have benefitted from a behavioral health referral.
