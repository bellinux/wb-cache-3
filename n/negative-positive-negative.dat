30|$|We {{find that}} regions of intense radial SV {{at the core}} surface occur close to edges of patches of strong radial field {{that can be seen}} to drift when {{examining}} a sequence of maps (or a movie) of the radial field between 1999 and 2016. Intense SV in 2015 is observed to lie in a broad band equatorward of 30 ^∘ latitude between longitudes 100 ^∘E and 90 ^∘W. There is also a well-localized <b>negative–positive–negative</b> series of three patches of radial SV visible under Alaska and Siberia; this appears to be a consequence of a very rapid westward movement of the intense high-latitude radial field patches. The SV is also generally large in the longitudinal sector from 60 ^∘ to 120 ^∘E, particularly in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new international}} {{evidence on the}} relationship between dividend policy and insider ownership by analysing a sample of firms from countries characterised by an Anglo-Saxon tradition and a matching sample of companies from countries with Civil Law legal systems. We hypothesize that, due to the different characteristics of both the legal system and the nature of agency conflicts in firms from those countries, the relation between dividend policies and ownership by insiders will be considerably distinct between the two sets of companies. We find that while in firms from Anglo-Saxon tradition the relation between dividends and insider ownership follows the pattern <b>negative-positive-negative,</b> in Civil Law countries the relation is positive-negative-positive. These results are consistent with our hypotheses and breed new insights into the role of dividend policy as a disciplining mechanism in countries with different legal systems and distinct agency problems. dividend policy, corporate governance, insider ownership, international financial markets, dynamic panel data and GMM estimation...|$|E
40|$|A <b>negative-positive-negative</b> {{switching}} {{behavior of}} magnetoresistance (MR) with temperature is {{observed in a}} ferromagnetic shape memory alloy Ni_ 1. 75 Mn_ 1. 25 Ga. In the austenitic phase between 300 and 120 K, MR is negative due to s-d scattering. Curiously, below 120 K MR is positive, while at still lower temperatures in the martensitic phase, MR is negative again. The positive MR cannot be explained by Lorentz contribution and is related to a magnetic transition. Evidence for this is obtained from ab initio density functional theory, a decrease in magnetization and resistivity upturn at 120 K. Theory shows that a ferrimagnetic state with anti-ferromagnetic alignment between the local magnetic moments of the Mn atoms is the energetically favoured ground state. In the martensitic phase, there are two competing factors that govern the MR behavior: a dominant negative trend up to the saturation field due to the decrease of electron scattering at twin and domain boundaries; and a weaker positive trend due to the ferrimagnetic nature of the magnetic state. MR exhibits a hysteresis between heating and cooling that {{is related to the}} first order nature of the martensitic phase transition. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures. Accepted in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal (three-month average) climate {{forecasts}} {{have advanced}} {{due in large}} part to improved modeling of the ENSO phenomenon. Long-range monthly forecasts are more problematic because of internal atmospheric variability. Further, it is often assumed that monthly precipitation anomalies are representative of the overall seasonal anomaly. This is not always the case as, according to the Global Precipitation Climatology Project Version 2. 1 data set, up to 20 % of areas demonstrating some significant teleconnection to ENSO show El Niño minus La Niña differences of one sign in the middle month and the opposite sign in the adjacent months. Most interestingly, this maximum percentage occurs in December-January-February (DJF), a time when the ENSO boundary forcing is strongest. These oscillatory DJF seasons also cluster in space- with significant positive-negative-positive differences in the western South Tropical Indian Ocean (STIO) and <b>negative-positive-negative</b> differences in the far eastern STIO. Representative gauges confirm that these precipitation patterns have been associated with ENSO events since 1951, and pentad precipitation data confirm that they are confined to DJF and evolve at the monthly scale. The abrupt end of the Indian Ocean Dipole mode in January, an increase in the importance of local SST anomalies in February, and an ENSO-induced mid-latitude Rossby wave during austral summer combine to generate the cross-basin precipitation gradient around 15 °S...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{cerebral}} evoked potentials (EPs) can be recorded after balloon distension of the human esophagus. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the characteristics of these viscerosensory EPs and to investigate the relations between these EPs and perception of esophageal distension. Nineteen healthy volunteers (22 - 60 yr old) were studied. A balloon positioned 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter was inflated 10 times each minute. EPs recorded from four midline scalp electrodes were averaged for 50 and 100 inflation cycles. A clearly defined triphasic (<b>negative-positive-negative)</b> EP was recorded in all subjects and from all four recording sites when a volume leading to definite sensation and rapid balloon inflation (170 ml/s) was used. The latencies of the peaks were 231 +/- 7 (N 1), 303 +/- 7 (P 1), and 379 +/- 8 ms (N 2). No significant correlation between stimulus perception and latency was found. The amplitude and quality of the EPs (scored by 3 blinded observers) increased significantly (P less than 0. 01, ANOVA) with increasing sensation. Slow balloon inflation (30 ml/s) was significantly less effective in evoking EPs than rapid inflation (P less than 0. 01). The EPs evoked by 100 inflations were not significantly clearer than those evoked by 50 inflations. It is concluded that the ability to record cerebral potentials evoked by esophageal balloon distension is related to the rate of balloon inflation and to the level of awareness of the stimulu...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{interior}} of chlorosomes of green bacteria forms an unusual antenna system organized without proteins. The steady-spectra (absorption, circular dichroism, and linear dichroism) have been modeled using the Frenkel Hamiltonian {{for the large}} tubular aggregates of bacteriochlorophylls with geometries corresponding to those proposed for Chloroflexus aurantiacus and Chlorobium tepidum chlorosomes. For the Cf. aurantiacus aggregates we apply a structure used previously (V. I. Prokhorenko., D. B. Steensgaard, and A. R. Holzwarth, Biophys. J. 2000, 79 : 2105 – 2120), whereas for the Cb. tepidum aggregates a new extended model of double-tube aggregates, based on recently published solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance studies (B. -J. van Rossum, B. Y. van Duhl, D. B. Steensgaard, T. S. Balaban, A. R. Holzwarth, K. Schaffner, and H. J. M. de Groot, Biochemistry 2001, 40 : 1587 – 1595), is developed. We find that the circular dichroism spectra depend strongly on the aggregate length for both types of chlorosomes. Their shape changes from “type-II” (negative at short wavelengths to positive at long wavelengths) to the “mixed-type” (<b>negative-positive-negative)</b> in the nomenclature proposed in K. Griebenow, A. R. Holzwarth, F. van Mourik, and R. van Grondelle, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1991, 1058 : 194 – 202, for an aggregate length of 30 – 40 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per stack. This “size effect” on the circular dichroism spectra is caused by appearance of macroscopic chirality due to circular distribution of the transition dipole moment of the monomers. We visualize these distributions, and also the corresponding Frenkel excitons, using a novel presentation technique. The observed size effects provide a key to explain many previously puzzling and seemingly contradictory experimental data {{in the literature on}} the circular and linear dichroism spectra of seemingly identical types of chlorosomes...|$|E
40|$|Some cycling {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} two kinds of cells: Nickel-Iron and Nickel-Metal-Hydride. A nominal 200 Ampere-hour Nickel-Iron battery was obtained from Eagle-Picher, Inc. and its initial capacity was determined by cycling at the manufacturer's recommended regime. A single cell {{was removed from the}} bat-tery and placed in a cell case designed to provide for quantitative assay of all gases evolved. After determining that no change in ampere-hour capacity of the cell had occurred {{as a result of the}} handling of the cell, the cell capacity was reduced to 15 ampere-hours in a <b>negative-positive-negative</b> configuration by removal of plates and by cutting the remaining plates to approximately one-half the original area. The resultant cell displayed the calculated capacity. At this time the charging regime was changed to include high rate DC, up to 6 C, and various forms of non-DC charging, again at high rates. During these experiments, careful as-say of the instantaneous quantities of hydrogen and oxygen were performed using gas chromatogra-phy. No significant effects of kinds of charging currents upon quantities of gases evolved were found. Very difficult-to-interpret results represent-ing the quantity of gas evolved as a function of state of charge were observed. The well-known ruggedness of the Edison couple was observed during the study which subjected the cell to three year's worth of time and many non-standard and otherwise abusive charging conditions; the capacity of the cell did not change during all of this. Some Nickel- Metal-Hydride cells were subjected to cycling experiments. The cells were of generic manufacture intended for use in lap-top computers; the capacity was at the 2 ampere-hour level. A pressure-measuring transducer was af-fixed to cells under study in such a way that the interior gaseous content of a cell was not allowed to escape, and the void volume of the cell system was not increased by more than about 0. 5 ml. Pressure versus state-of-charge results at various temperatures are presented...|$|E
