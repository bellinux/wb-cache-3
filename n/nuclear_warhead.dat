5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> for the Polaris missile. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Bond infiltrates the circus, {{and finds}} that Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures with a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> primed to explode at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament, {{in the belief}} that the bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the warhead and then he returns to India, joining an assault on Khan's palace.|$|E
5|$|The Predator {{travels through}} {{rural and urban}} areas of Gunnison, {{fighting}} more Aliens along the way, and occasionally being harassed by human soldiers and civilians. Finally, the main Alien lair is found in a hospital, where several mines are set by the Predator to bring the Hive down. The game concludes with the final fight against an attacking helicopter and the hospital's destruction. Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only to be destroyed, along with the entire town, by a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> while the Predator successfully leaves Earth.|$|E
50|$|The {{full-scale}} {{production of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> {{is believed to}} have commenced by 1966, with the Israel Defense Forces believed to be in possession of up to 13 operational <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> by 1967.|$|R
50|$|The {{exact number}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> {{is a state}} secret and is {{therefore}} a matter of guesswork. The Federation of American Scientists estimates that Russia possesses 4,300 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads,</b> while the U.S. has 4,000; Russia has 1,950 active strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads,</b> compared with the U.S. having 1,650. On the other hand, Russia is estimated to have roughly 1,500 tactical nuclear weapons, {{all of which are}} declared to be in central storage.|$|R
50|$|Estimates of Pakistan's {{stockpile}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> vary. The most recent analysis, {{published in the}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2010, estimates that Pakistan has 70-90 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> In 2001, the U.S.-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimated that Pakistan had built 24-48 HEU-based <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> with HEU reserves for 30-52 additional warheads. In 2003, the U.S. Navy Center for Contemporary Conflict estimated that Pakistan possessed between 35 and 95 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads,</b> with a median of 60. In 2003, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace estimated a {{stockpile of}} approximately 50 weapons. By contrast, in 2000, U.S. military and intelligence sources estimated that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal may be as large as 100 warheads.|$|R
5|$|The high-altitude explosions {{that had}} caused so much concern for Nike Zeus due to {{blackout}} had been further studied in the early 1960s {{and led to a}} new possibility for missile defense. When a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> explodes in a dense atmosphere, its initial high-energy X-rays ionize the air, blocking other X-rays. In the highest layers of the atmosphere, there is too little gas for this to occur, and the X-rays can travel long distances. Sufficient X-ray exposure to an RV can damage its heat shields.|$|E

The three who reach the city are taken prisoner, and Flagg orders one of them executed for his defiance. As the other two are being prepared for a public execution, one of Flagg's most loyal followers, the Trashcan Man, arrives with a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> salvaged from a military base. As Trash dies of radiation poisoning the Hand of God appears, detonating the warhead and annihilating Flagg, his followers, and the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the missiles {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the missiles were taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{examples}} of air-launched ballistic missiles (Air Launched ICBM), {{but they are}} rare.

During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra's head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{eccentric}} scientist Dr. Brackish Okun {{examines the}} alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks. It telepathically invades Dr. Okun's mind and uses his vocal cords {{to communicate with}} Thomas before launching a psychic attack against him. Thomas sees visions of the aliens' plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and harvesting the planet of all natural resources. After Secret Service agents and military personnel kill the alien, Thomas reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a B-2 Spirit fires a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above Houston, but the saucer remains intact.|$|E
5|$|Chief and Cortana use {{a fighter}} {{to follow the}} Didact's ship through slipspace towards Earth. Aided by Infinity, now {{commanded}} by Lasky, and the UNSC home fleet, the Chief boards the Didact's ship with a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b> Cortana inserts copies of herself into the Didact's computer systems to overwhelm the Didact's shield, but not before the Didact directs the Composer at Earth. With the help of Cortana, the Chief defeats the Didact, who falls into a slipspace portal generated underneath the Composer. The Master Chief activates the bomb but is saved by Cortana, who sacrifices herself. The Chief is found by a UNSC rescue team and is taken back to Infinity, where he, mourning the loss of Cortana, talks with Lasky about Earth, humanity, and what his duty as a soldier means.|$|E

After being repelled, the Didact uses his ship, the Mantle's Approach, to retrieve the Composer from the UNSC Station Ivanoff in orbit around Halo Installation 03, followed by the Master Chief and Cortana. After retrieving the Composer, the Didact heads to Earth. Though {{he is able to}} fire the Composer at mid-west North America, digitizing over seven million people, the Chief and Cortana are able to destroy his ship and the Composer with a Havok <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b> Before his ship explodes, the Didact is incapacitated and falls into a slipspace portal underneath the Composer.|$|E
5|$|Nike Zeus was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed to intercept warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 kiloton W31 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b> During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the totally new design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 kiloton W50 warhead. In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able to intercept warheads, and even satellites.|$|E
5|$|The AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a {{stealthy}} {{cruise missile}} platform {{to deliver the}} W80-1 variable yield <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b> Although originally designed to equip the B-1B Lancer bomber, the AGM-129 was redesignated {{so that it would}} only be carried by the B-52H, mounted on external pylons on the wings or internally in the bomb bay. In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement in order to help comply with international arms-control treaties and to replace them with AGM-86 missiles. In order to do so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana by B-52s for ultimate disposal. According to The Washington Post, by 29 August 2007, more than 200 AGM-129s had been shipped from Minot to Barksdale in this manner.|$|E

50|$|The AGM-86 ALCM is the US Air Force's current nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile. The ALCM is only {{carried on}} the B-52 Stratofortress which can carry 20 {{missiles}}. Thus the cruise missiles themselves can be compared with MIRV warheads. The BGM/UGM-109 Tomahawk submarine-launched cruise missile is capable of carrying <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads,</b> but all <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> were removed.|$|R
25|$|Initially, it {{was unclear}} whether the {{missiles}} would be equipped with <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> By 1960 it became known that the missiles were to have a nuclear payload, and a debate ensued about whether Canada should accept nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the Diefenbaker government decided that the Bomarcs should not be equipped with <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> The dispute split the Diefenbaker Cabinet, and led to the collapse of the government in 1963. The Official Opposition and Liberal Party leader Lester B. Pearson originally was against nuclear missiles, but reversed his personal position and argued in favor of accepting <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> He won the 1963 election, largely {{on the basis of this}} issue, and his new Liberal government proceeded to accept nuclear-armed Bomarcs, with the first being deployed on 31 December 1963. When the <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> were deployed, Pearson's wife, Maryon, resigned her honorary membership in the anti-nuclear weapons group, Voice of Women.|$|R

After recovering three of the lost artifacts, the player fails to recover the last one, the Ark of the Covenant, which {{takes the form of a}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b> The player is able to choose one of three endings, depending on whether they decide to enter a final doorway in the chambers of one of the two opposing factions represented by Kether and Malchut, or enter a new central chamber via the Bequest Globe.|$|E
5|$|As {{an interim}} measure, the US offered the Honest John missile. The offer was accepted, and 120 Honest John {{missiles}} with W31 warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments, the 24th at Nienburg (and later Paderborn), the 39th at Sennelager, and the 50th at Menden, with two batteries each. In addition, each regiment had two batteries of eight-inch M115 howitzers (later replaced by M110 howitzers) with W33 nuclear warheads. A British nuclear artillery round project was cancelled in 1958, and Blue Water met {{the same fate}} on 10 August 1962. The Honest Johns therefore remained in service until 1977. One of the Honest John regiments, the 50th Missile Regiment, Royal Artillery, was then re-equipped with the Lance missile, with its W70 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b> The W48 was acquired for the 155mm M109 howitzers. Both it and the W33 would remain in service until 1992. The British Army also considered acquiring the Davy Crockett, but had decided against it by February 1962.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker is {{the third}} novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel so he added {{the passage of the}} bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In {{the latter half of the}} novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations.|$|E

The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament {{in the belief that}} the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car, drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed at the border by East German guards, after they mistake Orlov for a defector. Bond kills the twin knife-throwing assassins Mischka and Grischka to avenge the murder of 009, and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base, and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her by showing her one of the treasures found in Orlov's car, which she was to smuggle for him. Octopussy realizes that she has been tricked, and assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.|$|E
25|$|In July 1955, the W-27 <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Warhead</b> was {{considered}} {{as a replacement for}} the W-5 for the RASCAL.
