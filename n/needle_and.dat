5|$|As planned, the {{exposition}} {{left behind}} a fairground and numerous public buildings and public works; some credit it with revitalizing Seattle's economic and cultural life (see History of Seattle since 1940). The fair saw {{the construction of the}} Space <b>Needle</b> <b>and</b> Alweg monorail, as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now KeyArena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the Cornish Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the <b>needle,</b> <b>and</b> tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|The World of Commerce and Industry {{was divided}} into {{domestic}} and foreign areas. The former was sited mainly south of American Way (the continuation of Thomas Street through the grounds), an area it shared with the World of Science. It included the Space <b>Needle</b> <b>and</b> {{what is now the}} Broad Street Green and Mural Amphitheater. The Hall of Industry and some smaller buildings were immediately north of American Way. The latter included 15governmental exhibitors and surrounded the World of Tomorrow and extended to the north edge of the fair.|$|E
50|$|Reusable <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> {{syringes}} are not recommended. If reusable <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> syringes are used, clean, disinfect and sterilize {{them before}} reuse. <b>Needles</b> <b>and</b> syringes used with VHF patients require special care. Cleaning staff should wear {{two pairs of}} gloves when handling <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> syringes used with any patient with a known or suspected VHF.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the level of}} bacterial contamination of <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> sutures used in strabismus surgery. Material and Methods: Strabismus surgery was performed on 30 eyes of 20 patients in our clinic between January 2004 and June 2004. Preoperative site preparation included installation of 5 % povidine-iodine in the conjunctival fornices in all cases. A total of 60 <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> 60 sutures were cultured immediately after final scleral passage. Results: Ten of the 20 cases (50 %) produced at least one positive specimen. 8. 3 % of the <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> 15 % of the sutures were culture positive. In all culture positive specimens 40 % of the <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> 55 % of the sutures produced 3 or less colony forming units (CFU). 4 - 6 CFU in 20 % of <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> 11 % of sutures, 7 or more CFU in 40 % of <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> 34 % of sutures were demonstrated accordance with dilution scheme. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were overwhelmingly predominated. Conclusion: The amount of bacterial contamination is usually below the level known to produce endophthalmitis in strabismus surgery. <b>Needles</b> <b>and</b> sutures used in strabismus surgery can become contaminated during surgery despite povidine-iodine usage. <b>Needles</b> <b>and</b> sutures with high contamination could potentially cause postoperative intraocular infection...|$|R

5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue {{has been removed}} to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the {{opposite sides of the}} labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back {{together}} again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found. Once this has been returned to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> thread in order to restore the Android Queen. The location of the refrigerator is randomized {{at the beginning of each}} new game.|$|E
5|$|Nicole starts dating Penn who manipulates her. He {{makes her}} believe she has accidentally {{stepped on a}} <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> she has tests for HIV. She later finds out she has the all clear. Nicole reveals to Marilyn that she is {{pregnant}} with Penn's child. She initially chooses to have an abortion, but changes her mind and decides to give the baby to Marilyn. Nicole goes {{on a date with}} Angelo and she takes him to her antenatal class. When he learns that Nicole is giving her baby away, Angelo ends their relationship. Nicole become friends with Roo and asks her to be at the birth, but Roo turns her down. Marilyn apologises to Nicole when she starts to take over and begins leaving her out of her plans for the baby. Nicole becomes fed up when the baby is late and Angelo tries to help her start labour. They go for a walk on the beach and Nicole's water breaks. Angelo is then forced to deliver the baby. Nicole later decides that she wants her baby back and tells Marilyn, who is devastated. Marilyn takes the baby, but later returns him. Nicole then leaves Summer bay with Angelo and George. She later contacts Marilyn and they meet in the city. Nicole and Marilyn talk things through and Angelo shows up with George.|$|E

25|$|Depending on its capabilities, {{the machine}} will require {{varying degrees of}} user input to read and sew {{embroidery}} designs. Sewing-embroidery machines generally have only one <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> require the user to change thread colors during the embroidery process. Multi-needle industrial machines are generally threaded prior to running the design and do not require re-threading. These machines require the user to input the correct color change sequence before beginning to embroider. Some can trim and change colors automatically.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to expand}} the size and number of coral reefs {{generally}} involve supplying substrate to allow more corals to find a home. Substrate materials include discarded vehicle tires, scuttled ships, subway cars, and formed concrete, such as reef balls. Reefs also grow unaided on marine structures such as oil rigs. In large restoration projects, propagated hermatypic coral on substrate can be secured with metal pins, superglue or milliput. <b>Needle</b> <b>and</b> thread can also attach A-hermatype coral to substrate.|$|E
25|$|Pleural {{effusion}} and empyema: Microorganisms {{from the}} lung may trigger fluid {{collection in the}} pleural cavity. If the microorganisms are in the fluid, the collection is an empyema. If pleural fluid is present, it should be collected with a <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> examined. Depending on the results, complete drainage of the fluid with a chest tube may be necessary. If the fluid is not drained, bacteria may continue to proliferate because antibiotics do not penetrate the pleural cavity well.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} popular {{approaches}} are injection of DNA in saline, using a standard hypodermic <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> gene gun delivery. Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in skeletal muscle, or intradermally (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by electroporation; by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with myotoxins such as bupivacaine; or by using hypertonic solutions of saline or sucrose. Immune responses to this method can be affected by factors including needle type, needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.|$|E
