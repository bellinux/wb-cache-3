At low concentrations of <b>nifurzide,</b> the growth rate of the cultures decreased, and elongated, nonseptate cells appeared. At high concentrations, complete growth inhibition occurred, accompanied by a rather strong bactericidal effect, but the appearance of the cells was normal; in particular, no bacteriolytic effect was observed. A very large number of antibiotic molecules were bound per bacterial cell. After cell disruption, similar amounts of <b>nifurzide</b> were found in the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic membranes, and cell wall, respectively. Most of the bound <b>nifurzide</b> was rapidly degraded or became protein bound. The structure of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide appeared to have little influence on the activity of <b>nifurzide.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
