40|$|A unitary {{description}} for wobbling {{motion in}} even-even and even-odd nuclei is presented. In both cases compact formulas for wobbling frequencies are derived. The {{accuracy of the}} harmonic approximation is studied for the yrast {{as well as for}} the excited bands in the even-even case. Important results for the structure of the wave function and its behavior inside the two wells of the potential energy function corresponding to the Bargmann representation are pointed out. Applications to $^{ 158 }$Er and $^{ 163 }$Lu reveal a very good agreement with available data. Indeed, the yrast energy levels in the even-even case and the first four triaxial super-deformed bands, TSD 1,TSD 2,TSD 3 and TSD 4, are realistically described. Also, the results agree with the data for the E 2 and M 1 intra- as well as inter-band transitions.

50|$|A chart {{or table}} of nuclides {{is a simple}} map to the nuclear, or radioactive, {{behaviour}} of nuclides, as it distinguishes the isotopes of an element. It contrasts with a periodic table, which only maps their chemical behavior, since isotopes of the same element do not differ chemically. <b>Nuclide</b> <b>charts</b> organize isotopes along the X axis by their numbers of neutrons and along the Y axis by their numbers of protons, out {{to the limits of}} the neutron and proton drip lines. This representation was first published by Giorgio Fea in 1935, and expanded by Emilio Segrè in 1945 or G. Seaborg. In 1958, Walter Seelmann-Eggebert and Gerda Pfennig published the first edition of the Karlsruhe <b>Nuclide</b> <b>Chart.</b> Its 7th edition was made available in 2006.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, an {{exploratory}} experiment to investigate cluster-transfer reactionswith radioactive beams in inverse kinematics is presented. The {{aim of the}} experimentwas to test the potential of cluster-transfer reactions at the Coulomb barrier, as a possiblemean to perform gamma spectroscopy studies of exotic neutron-rich nuclei at medium-highenergies and spins. The experiment was performed at ISOLDE (CERN), employing theheavy-ion reaction 98 Rb + 7 Li at 2. 85 MeV/A. Cluster-transfer reaction channels werestudied through particle-gamma coincidence measurements, using the MINIBALL Ge arraycoupled to the charged particle Si detectors T-REX. Sr, Y and Zr neutron-rich nucleiwith A = 100 were populated by either triton- or alpha- transfer from 7 Li to the beam nucleiand the emitted complementary charged fragment was detected in coincidence withthe gamma cascade of the residues, after few neutrons evaporation. The measured gamma spectra were studied in detail and the residue distributions were investigated as a functionof the excitation energy and different spin distributions of the nuclei produced in thecluster-transfer process. Moreover, the reaction mechanism was qualitatively studiedas a two-body process, considering the direct transfer of a cluster-like particle and usinga Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA). The results of this work show thatcluster-transfer reactions can be well described as a direct process and that they couldbe considered for the population of neutron-rich nuclei at medium-high energies andspins. The same experimental technique can therefore be used in future experiments tostudy different exotic regions of the <b>nuclides</b> <b>chart</b> using radioactive ion beams of newgeneration. status: publishe...|$|E

This specific subset of the <b>nuclide</b> <b>chart</b> was chosen precisely because of a clear static deformation pattern. We analyze the convergence of the coupled-channel calculations regarding the number of states being explicitly coupled. A model for deforming the spherical Koning-Delaroche optical potential as function of quadrupole and hexadecupole deformations is also proposed, inspired by previous works. We demonstrate that the obtained results of calculations for total, elastic, inelastic, and capture cross sections, as well as elastic and inelastic angular distributions are in remarkably good agreement with experimental data for scattering energies around a few MeV.

40|$|It is studied how the α cluster {{degrees of}} freedom, such as α {{clustering}} configurations {{close to the}} α decay threshold in ^ 12 C and ^ 16 O, including the linear chain, triangle, square, kite, and tetrahedron, affect nuclear collective vibrations with a microscopic dynamical approach, which can describe properties of nuclear ground states well across the <b>nuclide</b> <b>chart</b> and reproduce the standard giant dipole resonance (GDR) of ^ 16 O quite nicely. It is found that the GDR spectrum is highly fragmented into several apparent peaks due to the α structure. The different α cluster configurations in ^ 12 C and ^ 16 O have corresponding characteristic spectra of GDR. The number and centroid energies of peaks in the GDR spectra can be reasonably explained by the geometrical and dynamical symmetries of α clustering configurations. Therefore, the GDR {{can be regarded as}} a very effective probe to diagnose the different α cluster configurations in light nuclei. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|The nuclear {{reaction}} network is usually studied via precise calculation of differential equation sets, and much research interest {{has been focused}} on the characteristics of nuclides, such as half-life and size limit. In this paper, however, we adopt the methods from both multilayer and reaction networks, and obtain a distinctive view by mapping all the {{nuclear reaction}}s in JINA REACLIB database into a directed network with 4 layers: neutron, proton, ^ 4 He and the remainder. The layer names correspond to reaction types decided by the currency particles consumed. This combined approach reveals that, in the remainder layer, the β-stability has high correlation with node degree difference and overlapping coefficient. Moreover, when reaction rates are considered as node strength, we find that, at lower temperatures, nuclide half-life scales reciprocally with its out-strength.

Another reason for studying such nuclei is that the 2 − isomer can be produced cleanly, i. e. without contamination from the 9 + activity.

40|$|The {{collective}} excitation {{phenomena in}} atomic nuclei are studied {{in two different}} formulations of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) : (i) RPA based on correlated realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions constructed within the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM), and (ii) relativistic RPA (RRPA) derived from effective Lagrangians with density-dependent meson-exchange interactions. The former includes the dominant interaction-induced short-range central and tensor correlations {{by means of an}} unitary transformation. It is shown that UCOM-RPA correlations induced by collective nuclear vibrations recover a part of the residual long-range correlations that are not explicitly included in the UCOM Hartree-Fock ground state. Both RPA models are employed in studies of the isoscalar monopole resonance (ISGMR) in closed-shell nuclei across the <b>nuclide</b> <b>chart,</b> with an emphasis on the sensitivity of its properties on the constraints for the range of the UCOM correlation functions. Within the Relativistic Quasiparticle RPA (RQRPA) based on Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model, the occurrence of pronounced low-lying dipole excitations is predicted in nuclei towards the proton drip-line. From the analysis of the transition densities and the structure of the RQRPA amplitudes, it is shown that these states correspond to the proton pygmy dipole resonance.
