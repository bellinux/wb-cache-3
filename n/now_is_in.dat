25|$|From 1894 to 1966 {{the town}} was an urban {{district}} (a form of local government) in its own right, before becoming part of Ludlow Rural District (the separate Church Stretton Rural District had already been abolished in 1934) and the contemporary civil parish was then established. The Urban District Council was based at offices on Beaumont Road, where Beaumont Court <b>now</b> <b>is.</b> <b>In</b> 1974 the system of urban and rural districts was replaced and the town came under South Shropshire non-metropolitan district and Shropshire non-metropolitan county. The most recent change in local government occurred in 2009 when Shropshire became a unitary area with Shropshire Council replacing South Shropshire District Council and Shropshire County Council.|$|E
25|$|Trailer: Up to 1955 {{the trailer}} has a Q/Tnnn-nnn format in white on black base (with QT in reverse B). From 1955, the format was from NTA·000 to NTZ·999.

The standard size format for larger trailers in white on black runs from QVA-000 to QZZ-999 running from 1963 to 1988. In 1988 it switched to green on reflective white starting at 000-QAA then the 2002 change to maroon in the QHR-000 series and now in 000-QZZ range. As of 20 May 2015, 000-UBA was allocated onwards for new issues.|$|E
500|$|Pendennis Castle {{continued}} in use through the 18th and 19th centuries {{under the command}} of successive captains, still operating in partnership with St Mawes. In 1714, Colonel Christian Lilly carried out an inspection of the fortification, finding it to be [...] "in a very precarious condition" [...] and noting that [...] "the body of the fort having been for many years neglected is <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a very ruinous condition". The parapets had collapsed, the ramparts could easily be scaled and the ditches were filled with brambles. Little was done to remedy this, however, until the 1730s, when the castle was extensively modernised. The interior was redesigned, the ramparts were rebuilt and the castle's guns were replaced, incorporating new 18-pounder cannons.|$|E

500|$|Eddie {{returns to}} Washington as Mulder and, along with Scully, reports to Skinner {{on the case}} with a poorly written report. Eddie visits Mulder's office, then his apartment, being {{surprised}} at what a loser Mulder appears to be (though highly pleased with how attractive a man he <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> Mulder's face - as he admires himself and practices his 'agent moves' in the mirror). Later that evening Eddie visits Scully {{with a bottle of}} wine and tries to get her drunk, as well as seduce her. As a reluctant Scully is about to give in to a kiss, the real Mulder breaks in and interrupts them. Revealed, Eddie sheepishly reverts back to his actual form, as a shocked Scully just about jumps out of her own skin at the revelation. A month later, Mulder visits Eddie in a prison visitation room at Eddie's bidding. Eddie complains at being given muscle relaxants to prevent him from turning into someone else, asking if that was Mulder's doing. Eddie then tells Mulder that he was born a loser, but Mulder is one by choice and that he should seriously [...] "live a little".|$|E

2500|$|On March 14, 2013, Portman {{announced}} that he had changed his stance on gay marriage, and <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> support of its legalization.

[...] Prior to this revelation, Portman was noted as having a voting record that was strongly opposed to gay rights, consistent with statements he had made on the subject. Portman co-sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act, passed in 1996, defining marriage as one man and one woman, and in 1999 he voted for a measure prohibiting same-sex couples in Washington, D.C., from adopting children.|$|E

2500|$|Pop art is {{exemplified}} by artists: Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Wayne Thiebaud, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Tom Wesselmann and Roy Lichtenstein among others. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint {{in his best}} known works, such as Drowning Girl (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts #83. (Drowning Girl <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the collection of Museum of Modern Art, New York.) Also featuring thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists [...] "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's." [...] Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted The New Realists the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Sidney Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the New York School and reverberated worldwide. Earlier {{in the fall of}} 1962 a historically important and ground-breaking New Painting of Common Objects exhibition of Pop art, curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum sent shock waves across the Western United States. Campbell's Soup Cans (sometimes referred to as 32 Campbell's Soup Cans) is the title of an Andy Warhol work of art (see gallery) that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20inches in height x 16inches in width (50.8 x 40.6cm) and each consisting of a painting of a Campbell's Soup can—one of each canned soup variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised silkscreen process, using a non-painterly style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from popular culture. These works by Andy Warhol are repetitive and they are made in a non-painterly commercial manner.|$|E
2500|$|Handsome Dan was {{selected}} based {{on his ability to}} tolerate bands and children, negative reaction to the color crimson and to tigers (the symbols of rival schools Harvard and Princeton respectively), and Graves (?) cleaned up the dog and named him “Handsome Dan.” Soon, Dan followed Graves everywhere around campus, including sporting events. The students quickly adopted Dan as the Yale mascot. After Graves graduated and returned to England, Dan stayed on campus with his master’s brother. Before football and baseball games would begin, Handsome Dan founded a tradition and a dynasty by being led across the field. One newspaper reported: [...] "He was a big white bulldog, with one of the greatest faces a dog of that breed (English) ever carried". This was not an exaggeration, as Handsome Dan was one of the finest specimens of his breed in America, and went on to win first prize at the Westminster Dog Show and at least thirty other first prize ribbons in the United States and Canada. According to the Hartford Courant, [...] "In personal appearance, he seemed like a cross between an alligator and a horned frog, and he was called handsome by the metaphysicians under the law of compensation. The title came to him, he never sought it. He was always taken to games on a leash, and the Harvard football team for years owed its continued existence {{to the fact that the}} rope held." [...] The Philadelphia Press reported that [...] "a favorite trick was to tell him to 'Speak to Harvard.' He would bark ferociously and work himself into physical contortions of rage never before dreamed of by a dog. Dan was peculiar to himself in one thing – he would never associate with anyone but students. Dan implanted himself more firmly in the hearts of Yale students than any mascot had ever done before." [...] Handsome Dan crossed the Atlantic to join his old master in 1897 and died in 1898. Graves had Dan stuffed and returned him to be displayed at Yale in the old gymnasium. When it was torn down, Dan I was sent to the Peabody Museum for reconstruction. Handsome Dan I <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a sealed glass case in one of the trophy rooms of Yale's Payne Whitney Gymnasium, where, according to Stanton Ford, [...] "he is the perpetual guardian of the treasures which attest to generations of Yale athletic glory." [...] Andrew Graves died of tuberculosis on February 18, 1948, in Westbury, Long Island.|$|E
