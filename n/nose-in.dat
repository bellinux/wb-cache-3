25|$|The {{airport is}} {{operational}} 24 hours a day. It {{is able to}} handle large aircraft {{up to and including}} the Boeing 747-400 and Antonov An-225. The majority of freight services use widebody aircraft, with Cargolux mainly now using their new Boeing 747-8F aircraft and Air France operating the Boeing 777F. Volga-Dnepr are also occasional users of Prestwick with Antonov An-124 aircraft. The apron features seven <b>nose-in</b> PAPA/AGNIS (1A,1,2,3,4,7,8) plus 5 stands assisted by Ground Operations (5,6,9,10,11).|$|E

50|$|This wheel {{arrangement}} allows {{entry and}} exit at four points around the vehicle's perimeter. The CityCar {{was designed for}} front entry, which is feasible {{because there is no}} engine in the way. Baggage and emergency entry and exit are at the rear, and there is no side entry and exit. This configuration allows <b>nose-in</b> parking to the curb, and passenger embarkation from the sidewalk rather than from the road, which allows the elimination of the need for side clearance between parked vehicles. It also simplifies the vehicle, which does not need to accommodate door openings.|$|E
50|$|A 12 ft {{wheelbase}} {{version of}} the Worldmaster with 0.680H engine, five-speed gearbox and two-speed rear-axle with the radiator relocated to the UK nearside {{just ahead of the}} rear-axle was sold from 1958 to fire-appliance builders as the Leyland Firemaster, the unique selling-point being that a water pump with power take-off from the transmission could be fitted at the extreme front of the chassis allowing the Firemaster to <b>nose-in</b> to incidents and be ready to deploy water hoses in half the time of conventional front-engined fire engines. Only Manchester and Glasgow Fire Brigades really took to the idea and the project was dropped by 1962-3 as it had proved unprofitable.|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{helicopter}} {{flight is}} widely regarded to be a highly challenging control problem. This paper presents the first successful autonomous completion on a real RC helicopter of the following four aerobatic maneuvers: forward flip and sideways roll at low speed, tail-in funnel, and <b>nose-in</b> funnel. Our experimental results significantly extend {{the state of the}} art in autonomous helicopter flight. We used the following approach: First we had a pilot fly the helicopter to help us find a helicopter dynamics model and a reward (cost) function. Then we used a reinforcement learning (optimal control) algorithm to find a controller that is optimized for the resulting model and reward function. More specifically, we used differential dynamic programming (DDP), an extension of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). ...|$|E
30|$|It {{is shown}} that the sidereal {{anisotropy}} (SiA) of cosmic rays (CRs) with energies smaller than 104 GeV consists of three kinds: one (GA) is of galactic origin from the direction ΦG (αG = 0 hr; δG = − 20 °), {{and the other two}} (tail-in TA and <b>nose-in</b> HA) are of solar origin from the respective directions ΦT (αT = 6 hr; δT ∼ − 24 °) and ΦH (αH = 18 hr; δH > 0 °) and supposed to be produced by the acceleration of CRs on the tail and nose boundaries of the heliomagnetosphere (HMS). This conclusion was arrived at in 1995 after a long-term delay since the beginning of CR observations in the early 20 -th century. This delay was mainly due to the inconsistency among observations caused by the belief that the sidereal anisotropy must be unidirectional in space. The inconsistency has been solved at least qualitatively by the discovery of GA and TA. These anisotropies, including also HA, are subject, respectively, to their proper solar modulations in the HMS characterized by a polarity reversal every 11 years of the solar polar magnetic field and solar activity dependence with an 11 -year periodicity. By using these modulation patterns, the origins of the three anisotropies have been determined. TA and HA thus determined inversely produce the following kinds of evidence and problems in the HMS: (1) the structure of the HMS, (2) acceleration of CRs on the boundary of the HMS, (3) CR Lens Effect of the HMS for the sharp concentration of TA and HA, (4) the proper motion (VHMS) of the HMS relative to neighboring stars, (5) the proper motion of interstellar gaseous matter (including the magnetic field) relative to neighboring stars, and (6) the existence of the Subordinate HMS surrounding the HMS for the explanation of the duality of the motion of the HMS and also of the absence of the Compton-Getting (C-G) effect on the HMS. The present paper not only presents a brief summary of the studies of CR sidereal anisotropy made by many researchers during the 20 th century leading to the present understanding, but also presents some problems to open up a new vista of the future.|$|E
