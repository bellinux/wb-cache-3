5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible <b>nerve</b> <b>damage</b> including optic <b>nerve</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A novel {{intraoperative}} neuromonitoring (IONM) method {{based on}} electric stimulation of pelvic autonomic nerves under electromyography {{of the internal}} anal sphincter (IAS) has been recently introduced to rectal cancer surgery. The aim of this experimental {{study was to investigate}} the impact of selective surgical pelvic autonomic <b>nerve</b> <b>damaging</b> on the evoked IONM signal of the IAS. Methods: For this purpose 12 pigs underwent low anterior rectal resection. The pelvic splanchnic nerves were identified by means of electric stimulation under continuous electromyography of the IAS. For standardized neurostimulation, currents of 3 mA, frequency of 30 Hz and monophasic rectangular pulses with pulse duration of 200 mu s were chosen. Surgical autonomic <b>nerve</b> <b>damaging</b> was performed on both pelvic sides while recording the evoked IONM signal of the IAS. <b>Nerve</b> <b>damaging</b> was carried out proximal to the stimulation point {{at the level of the}} pelvic splanchnic nerves and then distally at the level of the inferior hypogastric plexus. Scissors, monopolar diathermy, ultracision and waterjet were used for <b>nerve</b> <b>damaging,</b> each in 3 animals. Results: Selective instrumental <b>nerve</b> <b>damaging</b> during neurostimulation resulted in a dissection specific superimposed artefact followed by a change in the evoked electromyographic amplitude, which could be observed online on the monitor of the IONM device. Comparison of the recorded IONM signals before and after proximal <b>nerve</b> <b>damaging</b> demonstrated a significant decrease in the evoked amplitude level (median 2. 8 mu V (interquartile range (IQR) 1. 6; 5. 7) vs. median 1. 4 mu V (IQR 0. 6; 2. 9), (p= 0. 026)). <b>Nerve</b> <b>damaging</b> performed distally to the stimulation point resulted in absence of evoked IONM signals. Conclusion: The present study provided first differentiated insights into the dynamic IONM signal behaviour in response to selective pelvic autonomic <b>nerve</b> <b>damaging.</b> Further studies with neurophysiological and surgical IONM signal analysis are mandatory to reach a more accurate IONM resulting in effective nerve sparing pelvic surgery...|$|R

5|$|Bleak {{reportedly}} suffered <b>nerve</b> <b>damage</b> as {{a result}} of his leg wound. His wounds required hospitalization, but he returned to duty on 9 July 1952. His tour in Korea ended shortly after the event. He finished his enlistment by serving in Japan, and on 27 October 1953 he was awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He retired from the Army as a Staff Sergeant.|$|E
5|$|A further {{tour of the}} US {{was planned}} for December 1976, {{but it had to}} be {{cancelled}} when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in the dressing room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and <b>nerve</b> <b>damage</b> to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe <b>nerve</b> <b>damage</b> to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E
50|$|Neurolemma {{serves a}} {{protective}} function for peripheral <b>nerve</b> fibers. <b>Damaged</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers may regenerate if the perikaryon is not damaged and the neurolemma remains intact.

50|$|Diabetic neuropathies are <b>nerve</b> <b>damaging</b> {{disorders}} {{associated with}} diabetes mellitus. These conditions {{are thought to}} result from diabetic microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum) in addition to macrovascular conditions that can culminate in diabetic neuropathy. Relatively common conditions which {{may be associated with}} diabetic neuropathy include third nerve palsy; mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; a painful polyneuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy.|$|R
5|$|The {{antibiotics}} neomycin and metronidazole {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. The rationale of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria, and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. Neomycin was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption, as neomycin and similar aminoglycoside antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause <b>nerve</b> <b>damage,</b> in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. <b>Nerve</b> <b>damage</b> can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary {{was rewarded}} with {{international}} selection for the five-match One Day International ODI series against India {{at the start of}} the 2008–09 Australian season. <b>Nerve</b> <b>damage</b> in her toe ruled Ebsary out of contention for the first match at Hurstville Oval, which the hosts won by eight wickets with more than 12 overs to spare. The next day, she was given her debut in the second match of the series, at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Ebsary made five not out as the hosts made 6/215 batting first. Ebsary came in at 6/194 with 14 balls remaining in the Australia innings. She took a single off each of the five balls she faced, rotating the strike as her partner Lisa Sthalekar completed an unbeaten century. In the seventh over of India's reply, Ebsary's throw from the boundary ran out Jaya Sharma as the opener attempted to take a third run, leaving the tourists at 2/9.|$|E
50|$|Since {{both the}} short and long ciliary nerves carry the afferent limb of the corneal blink reflex, one can test the {{integrity}} of the nasociliary nerve (and, ultimately, the trigeminal nerve) by examining this reflex in the patient. Normally both eyes should blink when either cornea (not the conjunctiva, which is supplied by the adjacent cutaneous nerves) is irritated. If neither eye blinks, then either the ipsilateral nasociliary <b>nerve</b> is <b>damaged,</b> or the facial nerve (CN VII, which carries the efferent limb of this reflex) is bilaterally damaged. If only the contralateral eye blinks, then the ipsilateral facial <b>nerve</b> is <b>damaged.</b> If only the ipsilateral eye blinks, then the contralateral facial <b>nerve</b> is <b>damaged.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2006–07, Salo sprained {{his knee}} {{in a game}} against the Minnesota Wild on 2 November 2006. Soon after returning, he {{sustained}} <b>nerve</b> <b>damage</b> in his shoulder from a hit against the Edmonton Oilers in December. Towards the end of the season, he suffered a groin injury, sidelining him for five games in March and April. Although he cumulatively missed 15 games, Salo still managed to have a career year, recording personal bests with 14 goals, 23 assists and 37 points. He tied for 10th among league defencemen in goals and ranked first in game-winning goals with six. Late in the season, he avoided his pending unrestricted free agency by re-signing with the Canucks to a four-year, $14 million contract extension on 29 March 2007. The Canucks entered the 2007 playoffs as the third seed. After eliminating the Dallas Stars in the first round, Vancouver was defeated by the Anaheim Ducks in five games. Salo missed the first two games of the second round due to the flu. He notched an assist over 10 post-season games.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered <b>nerve</b> <b>damage</b> to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, <b>nerve</b> <b>damage</b> and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model was}} established to investigate the possibility of repairing cervical <b>nerve</b> roots <b>damaged</b> above the dorsal root ganglion, as occurs in fraction injuries of the brachial plexus. In four sheep the C 6 root was divided and repaired within the dura using freeze-thawed muscle grafts. Recovery was assessed after eight months by electrophysiology and histology. Action potentials were recorded distal to the grafts in all four sheep, indicating regeneration ofmotor fibres. Histological examination showed regenerated fibres in the ventral roots below the grafts in all cases. These fibres could be traced distally to the brachial plexus. There {{was no evidence of}} recovery of dorsal roots. Traction injuries to the brachial plexus have devastating effects on the function of the upper limb. Where damage is confined to the nerves distal to their dorsal root ganglia some recovery may occur spontaneously or after surgical repair.
