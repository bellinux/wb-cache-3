40|$|This paper {{presents}} part of {{the research}} project Greyness and spatial experience. Its main objective is to discuss the concept of <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> and to investigate the preconditions for perceiving <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> colours in different situations. <b>Neutral</b> <b>grey</b> is defined as having similarity only to black and white, not to the chromatic elementary colours. Greyish colour samples have been observed with different backgrounds and in different light. One of these series is presented in detail in the paper, the conclusions from others are considered in the discussion, together with relevant literature. Greyish colours are seldom perceived as neutral, but rather tend to get a perceived hue, which depends on the observation situation. Inherent <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> colours are not found in nature. In production of materials and artefacts no tolerance level can assure a total lack of hue. In conclusion we suggest that <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> {{should be considered as}} an abstraction, its unique but in practice unobtainable quality lying in its absolute lack of hue and chromaticness.  Greyness and Spatial Experience/ Konstfack, Research and development in the art...|$|R

On the theoretical basis of ink-jet printing principle, gray balance control method and the G 7 specification, through designs the test sheet and prints it with digital ink-jet printer, then, measures the parameters in G 7 which influence the gray balance effects. The experimental {{results show that}} the data come from the test sheet is basically consistent with G 7 standard data in <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> density of HR, HC, SC. Moreover, the <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> in CMY overprint and monochromatic K can be well matched.

The present study investigated whether this other-race advantage {{will also be}} observed when faces were presented in certain contexts. Twenty {{subjects were asked to}} search a Chinese face among Caucasian faces in a block, and to search a Caucasian face among Chinese faces in the other block. These faces were presented in a <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> background, a Chinese background (e. g., the Great Wall), or a Caucasian background (e. g., the White House) separately in three sub-blocks. The set size varied from 2, 4, to 6. Results showed the other-race advantage in the <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> background, and the other-race advantage when the races of target and context were inconsistent. However, an own-race advantage was observed when the races of target and context were consistent...|$|R

However, this suggestion {{does not appear to be}} supported by the observed colours.

40|$|Purpose. We {{assessed}} chromatic sensitivity {{along the}} protan, the deutan, and the tritan line (Cambridge Colour Test, CRS Ltd.), the loci {{of the unique}} hues (red, green, yellow, blue) and the achromatic locus (<b>neutral</b> <b>grey)</b> for a very large sample (n= 185) of colour-normal observers ranging from 18 to 75 years of age. Visual judgements were obtained under normal viewing conditions using broad-band self-luminous stimuli (CRT) under controlled adaptation conditions. Results. Trivector discrimination thresholds increased {{as a function of}} age along the protan, the deutan, and the tritan axis (with coefficient of determination of R 2 > 0. 1), with the largest increase being present along the tritan line, which is consistent with the known age-related changes in the lens. We find less pronounced shifts in unique hue settings. Unique red and unique yellow settings do not change with age. Unique blue shifts towards green and unique green shift towards yellow; however, the coefficient of determination is very small in both cases (R 2 < 0. 1). Similarly, the locus of <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> is not affected by age (R 2 < 0. 1). Conclusion. We conclude that the chromatic sensitivity deterioriates significantly with age, whereas the appearance of unique hues and <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> is much less affected remaining almost constant despite the known changes in the ocular media. Our study provides useful normative data both for sensitivity and appearance changes with ageing...|$|R

50|$|Subjective quality {{tests can}} be done in any environment. However, due to {{possible}} influence factors from heterogenous contexts, it is typically advised to perform tests in a neutral environment, such as a dedicated laboratory room. Such a room may be sound-proofed, with walls painted in <b>neutral</b> <b>grey,</b> and using properly calibrated light sources. Several recommendations specify these conditions. Controlled environments have been shown to result in lower variability in the obtained scores.|$|R

50|$|Previously, the AAA paint had a {{blue tint}} to it, which {{required}} the main paint {{to have a}} pink tint, so that the combination produced a true Neutral Grey; however, batches of AAA since 2013 have a different formulation {{that does not have}} a significant tint. It is now recommended to use a <b>Neutral</b> <b>Grey</b> paint as the main paint - as below, many have used Dulux Grey Steel 2, which has an NCS code of 00NN 53/000 which equates to N7.8 on the Munsell scale. The same ratio of the paints are used instead.|$|R
50|$|Mountbatten pink, {{also called}} Plymouth Pink, is a naval {{camouflage}} colour resembling greyish mauve. It {{was first used}} by Lord Mountbatten of the British Royal Navy during World War II. After noticing a Union-Castle Line ship with a similar camouflage colour disappearing from sight, he applied the colour to his own ships, believing the colour would render his ships difficult to see during dawn and dusk. While the colour was met with anecdotal success, it was judged by experts to be equivalent to <b>neutral</b> <b>greys</b> at best and would make ships with the colour more obvious at worst.|$|R
5000|$|The {{visibility}} of these patterns {{is dependent on}} the medium or substrate in which they appear, and these may be opaque (as for example on paper) or transparent (as for example in plastic film).

The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|R
50|$|Kolkoutine {{settled into}} his current {{characteristic}} style {{by the end}} of the 1980s in which he mixes traditions from the Russian icons with suprematism from Malevich, cubism and naïve art. Kolkoutine states that he sought the special tones of colours which are seen in the old Russian icons, and he developed a method for making these tones by pasting a layer of <b>neutral</b> <b>grey</b> paint on the canvas before painting the colours. Suprematist elements are combined with figurative elements. Distorted buildings and playing cards may appear at the bottom of the paintings as well as Cyrillic letters. Frames in different colours surrounding the motifs are often oblique.|$|R
