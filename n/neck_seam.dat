40|$|Sunbonnet {{of brown}} linen. Made of a plain weave with both white and brown threads, the hat has {{pasteboard}} staves within the brim, a crenelated buttoning crown and long tail. The crown and tail are separate pieces, sewn together at <b>neck</b> <b>seam,</b> with the tail fastening {{to the sides}} of the brim by 3 off-white buttons on each side. The tail is semi-circular in shape, and the narrow chin ties are hemmed by hand. Poke-style bonnets are generally those that have brims stiffened either through quilting or plain starched fabric. Sunbonnets that rely on staves for brim support are not considered poke-style sunbonnets. The TFC thanks Rebecca Jumper Matheson for her research on this object...|$|E

[...] The farmwife sat on the couch, expressionless, bulky in a man's dogskin coat and unplumbed layers of jackets. The flowery silk handkerchief which she had worn over her head now hung about her <b>seamed</b> <b>neck.</b> Her white wool gloves lay in her lap.|$|R
