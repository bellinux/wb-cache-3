5|$|The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> in soils {{depends on}} the {{fixation}} of atmospheric nitrogen. This is achieved {{by a number of}} diazotrophs. One way this can occur is in the nodules in the roots of legumes that contain symbiotic bacteria of the genera Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Azorhizobium.|$|E
5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms) {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle.</b> Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle.</b> No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E

5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle,</b> although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> is the {{biogeochemical}} cycle by which nitrogen is converted into various chemical forms as it circulates among the atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. The conversion of nitrogen {{can be carried}} out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen, making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> is the {{transformation}} of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.|$|E
50|$|Microorganisms {{are vital}} to humans and the environment, as they {{participate}} in the carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycles,</b> as well as fulfilling other vital roles in virtually all ecosystems, such as recycling other organisms' dead remains and waste products through decomposition. Microorganisms also have an important place in most higher-order multicellular organisms as symbionts. Many blame the failure of Biosphere 2 on an improper balance of microorganisms.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that similar chemical cycles to Earth's occur on a lesser scale on Mars, facilitated by the thin atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (and possibly carbon), water, sulphur, methane, oxygen, ozone, and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycles.</b> Many studies point to significantly more active chemical cycles on Mars in the past, however the faint young Sun paradox has proved problematic in determining chemical cycles involved in early climate models of the planet.|$|R

25|$|Nitrogen {{is present}} in the {{environment}} {{in a wide variety of}} chemical forms including organic nitrogen, Ammonium (NH), nitrite (NO), nitrate (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), Nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used as new. The diagram besides shows how these processes fit together to form the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ninety {{percent of}} {{nematodes}} {{reside in the}} top 15nbsp&cm of soil. Nematodes do not decompose organic matter, but, instead, are parasitic and free-living organisms that feed on living material. Nematodes can effectively regulate bacterial population and community composition — they may eat up to 5,000 bacteria per minute. Also, nematodes {{can play an important}} role in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> by way of nitrogen mineralization.|$|E
40|$|Eutrophication {{and climate}} change, key {{environmental}} concerns, are both {{linked to the}} carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycles</b> hence the improved understanding of these cycles is essential. Currently, there is no system that simultaneously measures the fluxes of the three key gas phase products of nitrogen and carbon cycling (CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O) in submerged ecosystems with hourly time resolution. A “Lake-in-a-box” (mesocosm) {{was developed in the}} laboratory which allowed the monitoring of key components of the carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycles</b> within the air, water and sediments. The approach is automated, simple and time efficient and novel in its ability to examine many different carbon and nitrogen compounds in all three physical component of the “lake”. Dramatic fluctuations in gaseous flux and the concentrations of overlying water and sedimentary carbon and nitrogen compounds were noted over a three week period. These were split into five distinct phases which were linked to changes in sedimentary N and C cycling. The results highlighted the important of links between the two cycles and supported recent studies showing that estuarine sediments can act as both a source and a sink of nitrogen...|$|R

25|$|What hobbyists {{call the}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is only a}} portion of the {{complete}} cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water {{at the end of the}} process, or become bound in the biomass of plants.

25|$|Animal urine forms {{part of the}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle.</b> In {{balanced}} ecosystems it fertilizes {{soil and}} plants, which in turn continue to support the animal population. Some animals use it to mark their territories. Human urine and human feces are collectively referred to as human waste; as sewage, they require sewage treatment in places where population density is high. Livestock urine and feces similarly require proper management if the livestock population density is high. Such management is part of ecological sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{nutrient}} cycles {{are important}} in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface. Similarly, carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle,</b> along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|Denitrification is the {{reduction}} of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle.</b> This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium in anaerobic conditions. They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor {{in the place of}} oxygen during respiration. These facultatively anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{carbon cycle}} is the {{biogeochemical}} cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and {{atmosphere of the}} Earth.

Along with the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>cycle</b> and the water cycle, the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life.
