25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about things that are}} unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

The king, the prince and Marinoni (disguised as each other) enter. Elsbeth is not impressed by the aide-de-camp's song. When she and Fantasio are alone he casts more doubt in her mind about going ahead with the liaison with the prince, and she longs for a reason to delay the union. The court enter and while Marinoni (as the prince) sings her a pompous song in praise of beauty Fantasio climbs a tree and with a stick lifts the wig {{from the head of}} the false prince. The marriage of the Mantuan prince is immediately compromised but Fantasio is taken away.|$|E
25|$|During initial episodes from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, {{director}} Mitsuo Fukuda did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{too much}} about Shinn's character. However, he defined him as Kira's opposite in regards to their personalities when comparing the two lead characters. Shinn {{is defined as a}} civilian whose character could already go through a large development in contrast to Kira who was forced to become a soldier in the prequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. In comparison with Kira, Shinn was stated to be character harder to predict his role in the TV series. As with Kira in Gundam SEED, Fukuda mentioned Shinn's character would also change across the series. Kenichi Suzumura was especially hired to work as Shinn's Japanese voice actor with Fukuda stating he was not a character difficult to play. Fukuda also anticipated Suzumura's work as Shinn's voice actor in an optimistic way. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the Gundam SEED Destinys protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance.|$|E

Bilheimer, who had received an Academy Award nomination for The Cry of Reason, said that [...] "the unrelenting, unpunished, and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor, sex, and hundreds of sub-categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so-called human civilization we have ever seen." [...] Bilheimer's wife, Heidi Ostertag, is Worldwide Documentaries' Senior Producer, and she co-produced Not My Life with him. She said that she found making a film about human trafficking difficult because [...] "people do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about this issue." [...] Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of A Closer Walk were also useful when producing Not My Life because {{the poor and the}} outcast are at the greatest risk of both HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; there is, for this reason, much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions. Bilheimer attempted to fashion the film {{in such a way that}} every part of it would illustrate a statement made by Abraham Lincoln: [...] "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong." ...|$|E

Walsh stated that [...] "absolutely someone knows" [...] the {{identity}} of the Jane Doe and that in similar cases, it was often the [...] "live-in boyfriend" [...] or the mother of the child that had abused or neglected one of several children in a family, citing that the victim could have been [...] "accidentally killed or starved to death." [...] When explaining a probable reason why the girl had remained unidentified, Walsh stated that [...] "people do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to cops," [...] possibly due to the fear of authorities investigating their own lives. For instance, the family of Anjelica Castillo, who were undocumented immigrants and never reported the victim missing due to fear of deportation. Walsh encouraged viewers to contact him instead, giving the number for the show he hosts, The Hunt With John Walsh and the URL for his profile on the CNN website. He confirmed that those submitting tips could remain anonymous.|$|E
500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at any time {{that he wanted to}} rely on his right to remain silent, nor that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequence—did he believe in God, did he pray to God, and did he pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction.|$|E

Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in.
