The three concluding paragraphs consider the example of the saints, ending with a prayer to the Virgin Mary. The text mentions the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mother</b> Teresa four times, the last as a [...] "saint" [...] (despite {{the fact that she was}} not yet canonised) in such company as Francis of Assisi, Ignatius of Loyola, John of God, Camillus of Lellis, Vincent de Paul, Louise de Marillac, Giuseppe B.

6000|$|It was on {{this first}} ride of {{inspection}} that Teddy was seized by the inspiration that suggested the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mother</b> Goose's heroine, and he at once bestowed it upon Octavia. The idea, supported by both a similarity of names and identity of occupations, seemed to strike him as a peculiarly happy one, and he never tired of using it. The Mexicans on the ranch also took up the name, adding another syllable to accommodate their lingual incapacity for the final [...] "p," [...] gravely referring to her as [...] "La Madama Bo-Peepy." [...] Eventually it spread, and [...] "Madame Bo-Peep's ranch" [...] was as often mentioned as the [...] "Rancho de las Sombras." ...|$|E

The sacred associations which gather round the mere <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mother</b> were associations unknown to her; the man who held her to him so tenderly, the hero who had pitied and saved her, was father and mother both to her simple mind. She dropped {{her head on his}} breast; her faltering voice told him that she was crying. [...] "Will my mother take me away from you?" [...] she asked.

6000|$|In 1697 Charles Perrault {{published}} in France {{a book of}} children's tales entitled [...] "Contes de ma Mere Oye," [...] {{and this is really}} the first time we find authentic record of the use of the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mother</b> Goose, although Perrault's tales differ materially from those we now know under this title. They comprised [...] "The Sleeping Beauty," [...] "The Fairy," [...] "Little Red Riding Hood," [...] "Blue Beard," [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] "Riquet with the Tuft," [...] "Cinderella," [...] and [...] "Little Thumb"; eight stories in all. On the cover of the book was depicted an old lady holding in her hand a distaff and surrounded by a group of children listening eagerly.

6000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{at the trial}} in 1754 the {{neighbours}} reported Elizabeth's tale as told on the night when she came home, more dead than alive. Mrs. Myers had known Elizabeth for eleven years, 'a very sober, honest girl as any in England.' Mrs. Myers found her livid, her fingers 'stood crooked;' Mrs. Canning, Mrs. Woodward, and Polly Lyon were then present, and Mrs. Myers knelt beside Elizabeth to hear her story. It was as Chitty gave it, till {{the point where she}} was carried into a house. The 'several persons' there, she said, were 'an elderly woman and two young ones.' Her stays were cut by the old woman. She was then thrust upstairs into a room, wherein was hay, a pitcher of water, and bread in pieces. Bread may have been brought in, water too, while she slept, a point never noted in the trials. She 'heard the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mother</b> Wills, or Wells, mentioned.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{philosophers}} of antiquity, interrogated as to {{the cause}} of these phenomena, were provided with a ready and a plausible answer. It did not enter their minds even to doubt that these low forms of life were generated in the matters in which they made their appearance. Lucretius, who had drunk deeper of the scientific spirit than any poet of ancient or modern times except Goethe, intends to speak as a philosopher, rather than as a poet, when he writes that [...] "with good reason the earth has gotten the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>mother,</b> since all things are produced out of the earth. And many living creatures, even now, spring out of the earth, taking form by the rains and the heat of the sun."[1] The axiom of ancient science, [...] "that the corruption of one thing is the birth of another," [...] had its popular embodiment in the notion that a seed dies before the young plant springs from it; a belief so widespread and so fixed, that Saint Paul appeals to it {{in one of the most}} splendid outbursts of his fervid eloquence:-- ...|$|E
60|$|I now {{began to}} feel {{unsettled}} and ill at ease about the stomach, as if matters were all topsy-turvy there; and felt strange and giddy about the head; and so I made no doubt {{that this was the}} beginning of that dreadful thing, the sea-sickness. Feeling worse and worse, I told one of the sailors how it was with me, and begged him to make my excuses very civilly to the chief mate, for I thought I would go below and spend the night in my bunk. But he only laughed at me, and said something about my mother not being aware of my being out; which enraged me not a little, that a man whom I had heard swear so terribly, should dare to take such a holy name into his mouth. It seemed a sort of blasphemy, and it seemed like dragging out the best and most cherished secrets of my soul, for at that time the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> was the center of all my heart's finest feelings, which ere that, I had learned to keep secret, deep down in my being.|$|E

60|$|I {{will not}} say that this enthusiasm declined; rather my soul held out in its ecstasy as in a strong castle, and was there besieged by cold and sorrowful considerations. I could not doubt but that I loved her at first sight, and already with a quivering ardour that was strange to my experience. What then was to follow? She was the child of an afflicted house, the Senora's daughter, the sister of Felipe; she bore it even in her beauty. She had the {{lightness}} and swiftness of the one, swift as an arrow, light as dew; like the other, she shone on the pale background {{of the world with}} the brilliancy of flowers. I could not call by the name of brother that half-witted lad, nor by the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> that immovable and lovely thing of flesh, whose silly eyes and perpetual simper now recurred to my mind like something hateful. And if I could not marry, what then? She was helplessly unprotected; her eyes, in that single and long glance which had been all our intercourse, had confessed a weakness equal to my own; but in my heart I knew her for the student of the cold northern chamber, and the writer of the sorrowful lines; and this was a knowledge to disarm a brute. To flee was more than I could find courage for; but I registered a vow of unsleeping circumspection.|$|E
