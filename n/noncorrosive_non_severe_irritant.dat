40|$|To reduce and/or {{replace the}} Draize test, testing schemes {{combining}} strengths of particular in vitro assays were proposed during a 2005 ECVAM expert meeting. The testing scheme proposes, based on expected irritancy {{of the test}} substance, a Bottom-Up approach, beginning with test methods that accurately identify non-irritants, or a Top-Down approach, beginning with test methods that accurately identify <b>severe</b> <b>irritants</b> before progression of further in vitro testing. Furthermore as its core activity, ECVAM participated in the retrospective validation of and has peer reviewed scientific validity of four organotypic assays, and undertook retrospective validation of four cell function/cytotoxicity assays. The BCOP and ICE organotypic assays were ICCVAM and ESAC endorsed as scientifically valid for identifying <b>severe</b> <b>irritants,</b> and OECD Test Guidelines are under adoption. NRR, FL and CM cell function/cytotoxicity assays were recommended by an ECVAM Validation Management Group for identification of non-irritants or <b>severe</b> eye <b>irritants</b> in the Bottom-Up/Top-Down approaches. These assays were peer reviewed by ESAC during 2009. Finally, a joint ECVAM-COLIPA prospective validation study was initiated in 2008 to evaluate two Reconstructed human Tissue assays to discriminate non-classified materials from eye irritants, based on the proposed test strategies. The {{ultimate goal is to}} combine validated in vitro assays, based on their performances and applicability domains, to define the most suitable testing strategy to classify substances for eye irritation potential and ultimately replace the Draize test.

40|$|In {{spite of}} over 20 years of effort, no single {{in vitro assay}} has been {{developed}} and validated as a full regulatory replacement for the Draize Eye Irritation test. However, companies have been using in vitro methods to screen new formulations {{and in some cases}} as their primary assessment of eye irritation potential for many years. The present report shows the outcome of an Expert Meeting convened by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods in February 2005 to identify test strategies for eye irritation. In this workshop test developers/users were requested to nominate methods to be considered as a basis for the identification of such testing strategies. Assays were evaluated and categorized based on their proposed applicability domains (e. g., categories of irritation severity, modes of action, chemical class, physicochemical compatibility). The analyses were based on the data developed from current practice and published studies, the ability to predict depth of injury (within the applicable range of severity), modes of action that could be addressed and compatibility with different physiochemical forms. The difficulty in predicting the middle category of irritancy (e. g. R 36, GHS Categories 2 A and 2 B) was recognized. The testing scheme proposes using a Bottom-Up (begin with using test methods that can accurately identify non-irritants) or Top-Down (begin with using test methods that can accurately identify <b>severe</b> <b>irritants)</b> progression of in vitro tests (based on expected irritancy). Irrespective of the starting point, the approach would identify non-irritants and <b>severe</b> <b>irritants,</b> leaving all others to the (mild/moderate) irritant GHS 2 / R 36 categories. JRC.

50|$|Even {{before the}} advent of the Reformation, there had been much discontent against the {{pervasive}} influence of the Church, particularly in the Free Imperial Cities that, while largely independent politically, had to contend with the control of the Church in religious matters such as tithes, ecclesiastical tribunals, etc., not counting the fact that religious property and the clergy, both secular and regular, were largely exempted from taxation and civic control. Therefore, a final break with Rome and the local bishop—in the case of Giengen, the Bishop of Augsburg—meant the end of a <b>severe</b> <b>irritant</b> and {{a significant increase in the}} political reach of the new Protestant cities and princes who, from then on, will have full control over the reformed clergy, tithes and religious regulations and foundations.|$|R
30|$|Results One hundred {{patients}} {{were included in}} the <b>non</b> <b>severe</b> bronchiolitis group and 152 in the severe group. Factors significantly associated with severe bronchiolitis were a young age, a small weight and the presence of apneas at the admission. The Wang severity score, the heart rate, the apH and the PaCO 2 were significantly different between the two groups at the admission and at H 4. The level of oxygenation at H 4 were also higher in the <b>non</b> <b>severe</b> group. The rate of bacterial coinfection, the length of stay in PICU and of ventilation were higher in the severe group. Over the 3 years period, the rate of IV and NIV bilevel positive airway pressure significantly decreased in parallel with the increased utilization of HFNCT. Comparing patients responders or not to HFNCT, the weight, the Wang score, the respiratory rate, the apH and the PaCO 2 at H 4 were significantly different.|$|R
50|$|White {{spirit is}} mainly classed as an irritant. It has a fairly low acute {{toxicity}} by inhalation of the vapour, dermal (touching the skin) and oral routes (ingestion). However, acute exposure {{can lead to}} central nervous system depression resulting in lack of coordination and slowed reactions. Exposure to very high concentrations in enclosed spaces can lead to general narcotic effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea etc...) and can eventually lead to unconsciousness. Oral ingestion presents a high aspiration hazard. Prolonged or repeated skin exposure {{over a long period}} of time can result in <b>severe</b> <b>irritant</b> dermatitis, also called contact dermatitis. Exposure to white spirit in direct contact with the skin for several hours can cause severe chemical burns.It is recommended that skin exposure be kept to a minimum by use of gloves, and that hands be washed after contact. Occasional exposure to skin is highly unlikely to cause any problems.|$|R
500|$|Irritancy can be {{measured}} using the Draize test, where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing {{the effects of the}} substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows [...] "continuing signs of severe pain or distress". The Humane Society of the United States writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness. This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world. Although no accepted in vitro alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the low volume eye test may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009. However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not <b>severe</b> <b>irritants.</b>|$|R

Nonetheless, there are limited data on the risk of stroke/thromboembolic (TE) complications in AF patients with valvular heart disease, other than those with valvular prosthesis or rheumatic mitral valve disease. MethodsAmong 8962 patients with AF seen between 2000 and 2010, patients were categorised into Group 1 “non valvular AF” (n= 6851; 78 %), Group 2 “quasi valvular AF” ie. valve disease with neither rheumatic mitral stenosis nor valve prothesis (n= 1202; 13 %) and Group 3 “valvular AF” (n= 909; 9 %) using ESC AF guidelines definition. ResultsIn group 2, 61 % of the patients had mitral regurgitation (n= 917, <b>non</b> <b>severe</b> in 52 %, severe in 9 %), 24 % had aortic regurgitation (n= 414, <b>non</b> <b>severe</b> in 22 %, severe in 2 %) and 32 % had aortic stenosis (n= 555, <b>non</b> <b>severe</b> in 18 %, severe in 14 %). In group 3, 88 % of the patients with valvular AF had valve prostheses (n= 797) and 14 % had mitral stenosis (n= 124). After follow up of 884 ± 1084 days, 715 stroke/TE events were recorded. Group 2 was significantly older, had a higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and had {{a higher risk of}} TE events (relative risk 1. 39; 95 %CI 1. 14 – 1. 69) compared with Group 1. Severe valve disease was not associated with worse prognosis for stroke/TE events (relative risk 1. 12, 95 %CI 0. 78 – 1. 61). In the 3 groups, stroke/TE risk increased with a higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. Factors independently associated with increased risk of stroke/TE events were older age (RR 1. 02, 95 %CI 1. 01 – 1. 03) and higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (RR 1. 33, 95 %CI 1. 23 – 1. 45). The increased risk of stroke/TE events in patients from Group 2 (compared to those from Group 1) did not reach statistical significance in multivariate analysis. ConclusionsIn patients with AF, left-sided valvular heart disease (excluding mitral stenosis and protheses) was associated with an increased risk of stroke/TE events. A higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was the main driver of these events...|$|R

Aim of the present multicentre study was to retrospectively analyze growth response to GH therapy and factors related to good response of 2 groups of short subjects with different GH secretion. Inclusion criteria for both groups, besides short stature, were absence of puberty, no other diseases affecting height (Ht) and treatment to adult Ht with same GH therapy schedule (7 mg/m 2 /wk or 0. 20 - 25 mg/kg/wk). Specific criteria for group 1 (n. 76, 47 M and 29 F) was <b>non</b> <b>severe</b> GHD (peak 3 - 10 μg/L), whereas for group 2 (n. 33, 21 M and 12 F) normal GH secretion (peak > 10 μg/L) with IGF- 1 levels 1 SDS (63 vs 79 %) was similar between the 2 groups. By examining the parameters affecting Ht gain, the subjects showed similar characteristics not associated to the group of treatment, i. e. significant negative correlation with statural deficit at diagnosis (r=- 0. 49; p= 0. 0001), age at diagnosis (r=- 0. 20; p= 0. 05) and positive with duration of therapy (r= 0. 28; p= 0. 007). GH peak at diagnosis was not related to Ht gain in both groups. In the whole group and in the 2 separate groups, among Ht SDS at diagnosis, age at diagnosis and therapy duration, multiple regression analysis identified Ht deficit at diagnosis as the only parameter influencing Ht gain (R 2 = 0. 42 in the whole group, R 2 = 0. 36 in group 1, R 2 = 0. 49 in group 2). Conclusions. Short subjects with normal GH secretion but low IGF- 1 levels showed a similar growth response to GH therapy as short subjects with <b>non</b> <b>severe</b> GHD.

40|$|Introduction: Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} (CAH) due to 21 -Hydroxylase deficiency {{occurs in}} 90 - 95 % of cases, being a common autosomal recessive condition that can present {{with a wide}} range of hyperandrogenemic signs in childhood or adulthood. Severity of this disease is correlated with the enzymatic blockade of 21 -Hydroxylase which depends of the mutation in gene CYP 21 A 2. Two clinical forms are possible: classic, subdivided in salt-wasting and simple virilizing form (severe) and nonclassic or late onset (less severe). Aims: We studied two portuguese families with NCCAH due to 21 -Hidroxilase deficiency in order to improve clinical management and genetic counseling of their members. Methods: Clinical presentation and hormonal assays (including test of tetracosactide) were performed in index cases (IC). Genomic DNA of each family member was sequenced for the 9 most frequent mutations in CYP 21 A 2. Total deletion of CYP 21 A, conversion in non functioning CYP 21 A 1 P or CYP 21 A 1 P_ CYP 21 A 2 quimeras were also analyzed by enzymatic restriction. Results: Family 1 - IC: Female, 31 years old with NCCAH diagnosed at age 6, after investigation of precocious pubarche and with test of tetracosactide positive (17 -alpha hydroxyprogesterone levels > 10 - 15 ng/ml). Molecular study of CYP 21 A 2 showed a mutation g. 1683 G> T, homozygous, in CYP 21 A 2 and a non functioning allele of CYP 21 A 2, heterozygous (<b>non</b> <b>severe</b> 21 -Hidroxilase deficiency). Mother was carrying a non functioning allele of CYP 21 A 2, heterozygous (severe); Father, Brother and Partner were heterozygous for mutation g. 1683 G> T (<b>non</b> <b>severe).</b> Family 2 - IC: Female, 45 years old presenting hirsutism and oligoamenorrhea at age 35 and with test of tetracosactide positive confirming NCCAH Genetic study identified mutation g. 1683 G> T (less severe) in a copy and g. 655 A/C>G in another copy (splicing mutation severe).

40|$|PurposePercutaneous left atrial {{appendage}} closure (LAAC) is {{accepted as a}} valuable solution for patients (pts) with atrial fibrillation (AF) and high thromboembolic risk in case of contra-indication to oral anticoagulation (OAC). Little is known about mid-term results in the real life setting. MethodsWe analyzed mid-term results in a dedicated EP team (2 experienced electrophysiologists [AF ablation> 200 per yr], 1 echographist, 1 anesthesiologist). All indications were discussed before the procedure in a multidisciplinary approach. Procedures were done under general anesthesia in a dedicated EP room with in-hospital cardiac surgery facilities. All LAAC procedures were performed with Watchman devices (Boston Scientific). Results 50 pts were enrolled (male 76 %, 77 ± 6 years, paroxysmal AF 44 %, permanent 54 %). The CHADS 2 VASC average score was 4. 6 ± 1, 3;≥ 4 : 76 %, HASBLED score was 3, 7 ± 1 :≥ 4 : 64 %. All indications were definitive contra-indications for OAC due to hemorrhagic events (neurological 75 %, gastrointestinal 13 %, ENT 3 %, other 4 %). The CT-scan ruled out any thrombus before the procedure for all pts with a perioperative TEE confirmation. Success rate of implantation was 100 % (time of procedure 50 ± 10 min, scopy time 8 ± 3 mn). There were no periprocedure complications. Postoperative therapy was: antiagregation 31 %, double antiagregation 37 %, anticoagulation 18 %, none 3 %. After 2 months, and TEE control, the initial treatment was switched to: antiagregation 50 %, double antiagregation 10 %, anticoagulation 10 %, none 30 %.
