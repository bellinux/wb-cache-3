We compared the clinical outcomes of endoscopy between the two groups. Results: There were 49 patients in the early-endoscopy group and 41 patients in the delayed-endoscopy group.

Three plots with 729 plants each were selected and evaluated every two months for stem bleeding incidence. In the temporal analysis, the monomolecular model gave the best fit to data on disease incidence, as it accurately showed the temporal dynamics of the disease during the experiment period. The spatial pattern of stem bleeding varied over time, with initial infections presenting random pattern and then evolving to aggregate pattern during evaluations.

40|$|Understanding the {{differential}} bonding mechanics underlying bleeding disorders is of crucial importance to human health. In this research insight is provided into how {{four of these}} bleeding disorders (each with somewhat similar clinical characteristics), work at the molecular bond level. The <b>bleeding</b> <b>diseases</b> studied here can result from defects in the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ibα the von Willebrand factor (vWF) molecule, or the ADAMTS- 13 enzyme. Types 2 B and 2 M von Willebrand Disease (VWD) result in excess bleeding, yet type 2 B has increased binding affinity between platelet GPIbα and vWF, while type 2 M has decreased binding affinity between these two molecules. Platelet type VWD (pt-VWD) causes mutations in the GPIbα molecule and has similar characteristics to type 2 B VWD. Further, in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, bleeding results {{when there is a}} lack of active ADAMTS- 13 enzyme. Each disease results in patient bleeding, but due to different mechanisms. This dissertation will explore the bonding mechanics between GPIbα and vWF and how they are altered in each disease state. To observe the GPIbα-vWF bonding mechanics, rolling velocities, transient tethering lifetimes, and tether frequency were determined using a parallel plate flow chamber. Data from these experiments suggest that wt-wt interactions are force dependent and have biphasic catch-slip bonding behavior. The data show that the shear stress at which the maximum mean stop time occurs differs between gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations. Using similar methods, we study the changes resulting from pt-VWD mutations in GPIbα, and find that the catch bond seen for wt-wt interactions is lost for these mutations. Further, the data suggest that interactions with gain-of-function GPIbα mutations may be transport rather than force dependent. Finally, how the GPIbα-vWF tether bond changes for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was also investigated to show that the bond lifetime in the absence of the enzyme is increased presenting a possible rationale for why bleeding occurs in this disease. Overall, the data show how the bonding mechanics of the GPIbα-vWF tether bond differ in four <b>bleeding</b> <b>diseases.</b> Further, these observations offer potential explanations for how these changes in the bonding mechanism may play a role in the observed patient bleeding.

40|$|Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked <b>bleeding</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency. We {{previously}} demonstrated that FVIII is produced specifically in liver sinusoid endothelial cells (LSECs) {{and to some}} degree in myeloid cells, and thus, in the present work, we seek to restrict the expression of FVIII transgene to these cells using cell-specific promoters. With this approach, we aim to limit immune response in a mouse model by lentiviral vector (LV) -mediated gene therapy encoding FVIII. To increase the target specificity of FVIII expression, we included miRNA target sequences (miRTs) (i. e. miRT- 142. 3 p, miRT- 126, and miRT- 122) to silence expression in hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, respectively. Notably, we report, for the first time, therapeutic levels of FVIII transgene expression at its natural site of production, which occurred without the formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors). Moreover, inhibitors were eradicated in FVIII pre-immune mice through a regulatory T cell-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, targeting FVIII expression to LSECs and myeloid cells by using LVs with cell-specific promoter minimized off-target expression and immune responses. Therefore, at least for some transgenes, expression at the physiologic site of synthesis can enhance efficacy and safety, resulting in long-term correction of genetic diseases such as HA.
