40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the extent to which a School <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme</b> can {{catalyse}} community-based environmental learning and promote food security in the school and the community. This is an interpretive case study of a junior secondary school in the rural Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The school is located in an area characterised by high levels of poverty and under-nutrition. The school’s food garden, a central focus of this study, contributes to the School <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme,</b> which falls under the National School <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme</b> (NSNP). The aim of the NSNP is to alleviate poverty in public schools. This case study was conducted by means of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis and field observations. The data set was analysed, firstly, to ascertain if the School <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme</b> functions as a community of practise (Wenger, 1998). Thereafter, the data set was analysed to identify the knowledge related to food security and environmental sustainability that is learned and shared in the School <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme,</b> and also how such learning took place. The study found that the School’s <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme</b> was indeed operating as a community of practice and that it created a platform for sharing explicit and tacit knowledge and skills related to food security and environmental sustainability.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Among {{people living}} with HIV/AIDS, {{nutritional}} support is increasingly recognized as {{a critical part of}} the essential package of care, especially for patients in sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the outcomes of HIV-positive malnourished adults treated with ready-to-use therapeutic food and to identify factors associated with <b>nutrition</b> <b>programme</b> failure. METHODS: We present results from a retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 15 years or older with a body mass index of less than 17 kg/m^ 2 enrolled in three HIV/AIDS care programmes in Africa between March 2006 and August 2008. Factors associated with <b>nutrition</b> <b>programme</b> failure (patients discharged uncured after six or more months of nutritional care, defaulting from nutritional care, remaining in nutritional care for six or more months, or dead) were investigated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 1340 of 8685 (15. 4 %) HIV-positive adults were enrolled in the <b>nutrition</b> <b>programme.</b> At admission, median body mass index was 15. 8 kg/m 2 (IQR 14. 9 - 16. 4) and 12 % received combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). After a median of four months of follow up (IQR 2. 2 - 6. 1), 524 of 1106 (47. 4 %) patients were considered cured. An overall total of 531 of 1106 (48. 0 %) patients failed nutrition therapy, 132 (11. 9 %) of whom died and 250 (22. 6 %) defaulted from care. Men (OR= 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 0), patients with severe malnutrition at <b>nutrition</b> <b>programme</b> enrolment (OR= 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 2. 8), and those never started on ART (OR= 4. 5, 95 % CI 2. 7 - 7. 7 for those eligible; OR= 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 5 for those ineligible for ART at enrolment) were at increased risk of <b>nutrition</b> <b>programme</b> failure. Diagnosed tuberculosis at <b>nutrition</b> <b>programme</b> admission or during follow up, and presence of diarrhoeal disease or extensive candidiasis at admission, were unrelated to <b>nutrition</b> <b>programme</b> failure.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{why and how}} capacity-building {{systems for}} scaling up <b>nutrition</b> <b>programmes</b> should be constructed in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Design: Position paper with task force recommendations based on literature review and joint experience of global <b>nutrition</b> <b>programmes,</b> public health nutrition (PHN) workforce size, organization, and pre-service and in-service training. Setting: The review is global but the recommendations are made for LMIC scaling up multisectoral <b>nutrition</b> <b>programmes.</b> Subjects: The multitude of PHN workers, be they in the health, agriculture, education, social welfare, or water and sanitation sector, {{as well as the}} community workers who ensure outreach and coverage of nutrition-specific and -sensitive interventions. Results: Overnutrition and undernutrition problems affect {{at least half of the}} global population, especially those in LMIC. Programme guidance exists for undernutrition and overnutrition, and priority for scaling up multisectoral programmes for tackling undernutrition in LMIC is growing. Guidance on how to organize and scale up such programmes is scarce however, and estimates of existing PHN workforce numbers – although poor – suggest they are also inadequate. Pre-service nutrition training for a PHN workforce is mostly clinical and/or food science oriented and in-service nutrition training is largely restricted to infant and young child nutrition. Conclusions: Unless increased priority and funding is given to building capacity for scaling up <b>nutrition</b> <b>programmes</b> in LMIC, maternal and child undernutrition rates are likely to remain high and nutrition-related non-communicable diseases to escalate. A hybrid distance learning model for PHN workforce managers’ in-service training is urgently needed in LMIC...|$|E

30|$|We {{estimate}} a {{model of}} labour supply and participation in multiple cash and in-kind welfare programmes. The modeling exploits a reform that affected U.K. single mothers. In-work cash entitlements increased under this reform but eligibility to in-kind child <b>nutrition</b> <b>programmes</b> was lost for some households. When we allow for differences in {{the costs associated with}} each welfare programme we find that in-work cash and in-work in-kind transfers both have large positive labour supply effects. There is, however, a utility loss from programme participation which is estimated to be larger for the cash programme than for the child <b>nutrition</b> <b>programmes.</b> Our findings imply that the partial cash out of the in-kind transfers reduced labour supply and suggest {{that there may be a}} place in policy portfolios for in-kind programmes despite their “inefficiency”.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of education in}} the improvement of {{the quality of life of}} people is generally acknowledged. As a result, many countries today, including ours, have placed education among the key priorities for national development. However, given the prevalence of poverty in communities across the country, learners face the risk of reduced capacity to learn as a result of nutritional deprivation. It was against this background that the democratic government established the Primary School <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme</b> (PSNP) in selected schools in 1994, which was later renamed to the National School <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Programme</b> (NSNP) following an intensive review. The programme aims to provide well-balanced meals to learners in the hope that their concentration and performance levels will improve and ultimately infl uence their learning process. Viewed in this way, the NSNP is, therefore, an important part of government’s interventions for creating a better life for all.
