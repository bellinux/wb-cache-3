40|$|BACKGROUND New {{sources of}} insulin-secreting cells are {{strongly}} {{required for the}} cure of diabetes. Recent successes in differentiating embryonic stem cells, {{in combination with the}} discovery {{that it is possible to}} derive human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from somatic cells, have raised the possibility that patient-specific β cells might be derived from patients through cell reprogramming and differentiation. AIMS In this study, we aimed to obtain insulin-producing cells from human iPSC and test their ability to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in vivo. METHODS: Human iPSC, derived from both fetal and adult fibroblasts, were differentiated in vitro into pancreas-committed cells and their ability to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> was measured. iPSCderived cells at two different stages of differentiation (posterior foregut and endocrine cells) were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to test their ability to engraft, differentiate and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin.</b> RESULTS: IPSC were shown to differentiate into insulin-producing cells in vitro, following the stages of pancreatic organogenesis. At the end of the differentiation, the production of INSULIN mRNA was highly increased and up to 14 % of the cell population became insulin-positive. Terminally differentiated cells also produced C-peptide in vitro in both basal and stimulated conditions. In vivo, mice transplanted with pancreatic cells secreted human C-peptide in response to glucose stimulus, but transplanted cells were observed to lose insulin secretion capacity during the time. At histological evaluation, the grafts were composed of a mixed population of cells containing mature pancreatic cells, but also pluripotent cells and rare neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: These data overall suggest that human iPSC have the potential to generate insulinproducing cells and that these differentiated cells can engraft and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in vivo...|$|R

Transplantation of cadaveric pancreatic organs or pancreatic islets can restore normal physiology.

Here, we hypothesized that human iPS cells can be directly differentiated into insulin producing cells (IPCs) capable of <b>secreting</b> <b>insulin.</b> Using a series of pancreatic growth factors, we successfully generated iPS cells derived IPCs. Furthermore, to investigate the capability of these cells to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in vivo, the differentiated cells were transplanted under the kidney capsules of diabetic immunodeficient mice.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} is a metabolic disorder {{characterized by the}} inability of beta-cells to <b>secrete</b> enough <b>insulin</b> to maintain glucose homeostasis. MIN 6 cells <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in response to glucose and other secretagogues, but high passage (HP) MIN 6 cells lose their ability to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in response to glucose. We hypothesized that metabolism of glucose and lipids were defective in HP MIN 6 cells causing impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). HP MIN 6 cells had no first phase and impaired second phase GSIS indicative of global functional impairment. This was coupled with a markedly reduced ATP content at basal and glucose stimulated states. Glucose uptake and oxidation were higher at basal glucose but ATP content failed to increase with glucose. HP MIN 6 cells had decreased basal lipid oxidation. This was accompanied by reduced expressions of Glut 1, Gck, Pfk, Srebp 1 c, Ucp 2, Sirt 3, Nampt. MIN 6 cells represent an important model of beta cells which, as passage numbers increased lost first phase but retained partial second phase GSIS, similar to patients early in type 2 diabetes onset.

40|$|Background: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus {{results from}} an {{autoimmune}} {{destruction of the}} pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin. The lack of insulin leads to chronic hyperglycemia and secondary complications, such as cardiovascular disease. The currently approved clinical treatments for diabetes mellitus often fail to achieve sustained and optimal glycemic control. Therefore, {{there is a great}} interest in the development of surrogate beta cells as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Normally, pancreatic beta cells produce and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> only in response to increased blood glucose levels. However in many cases, insulin secretion from non-beta cells engineered to produce insulin occurs in a glucose-independent manner. In the present study we engineered liver cells to produce and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> and insulin secretion can be stimulated via the nitric oxide pathway. Results: Expression of either human insulin or the beta cell specific transcription factors PDX- 1, NeuroD 1 and MafA in the Hepa 1 - 6 cell line or primary liver cells via adenoviral gene transfer, results in production and secretion of insulin.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of glucose metabolism, in healthy subjects, {{is based on}} a complex control system which aims to maintain plasma glucose concentrations within a narrow range (70 ÷ 180 mg/dl). <b>Insulin,</b> a hormone <b>secreted</b> by pancreatic beta-cells, is fundamental in maintaining glucose homeostasis, by reducing liver glucose production, while promoting its utilization by the insulin-dependent organs. The inability of beta-cells to adequately <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> creates metabolic disorders which can result in glucose intolerance and even diabetes mellitus. There are two different kinds of diabetes: type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM), characterized by a total inability of pancreatic beta-cells to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin,</b> and type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM), in which, because of insulin resistance, tissues are unable to appropriately utilize glucose, and insulin secretion is unable to compensate for this defect.

40|$|In {{the present}} studies {{we sought to}} address the {{following}} questions: do chronically transplanted intrahepatic islets (IHI-Tx) <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in a coordinate pulsatile manner, and, if so, is reestablishment of this coordinate pulsatility a function of time after transplantation? We studied isolated perfused livers at 10 mM glucose from 27 rats rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and then transplanted with approximately 2 x 10 (3) islets, 2 (n = 5), 7 (n = 5), 30 (n = 5), and 200 (n = 12) d after transplantation. 12 out of 12 of the 200 -d IHI-Tx <b>secreted</b> <b>insulin</b> in coordinate pulses (frequency 3. 9 +/- 0. 3 pulses/h, amplitude 15. 2 +/- 2. 4 nmol/min). In contrast, {{one out of five}} 2 -d, zero out of five 7 -d, and one out of five 30 -d IHI-Tx showed pulsatile insulin secretion. Insulin secretion was markedly greater (76 +/- 13 vs 13 +/- 3 nmol/min, P < 0. 0001) in the 200 -d versus early IHI-Tx. Pentobarbital 25 micrograms/ml had no effect on total (13. 9 +/- 3. 9 vs 15. 9 +/- 3. 9 nmol/min), nonpulsatile (12. 9 +/- 3. 5 vs 14. 1 +/- 3. 3 nmol/min), or pulsatile (pulse amplitude 17. 6 +/- 4. 5 vs 20. 0 +/- 4. 2 nmol/min, pulse frequency 4. 1 +/- 0. 3 vs 4. 0 +/- 0. 7 pulses/h) insulin secretion.

40|$|Abstract. Beta-cell {{replacement}} therapy by pancreatic islet transplantation {{has become a}} promising treatment for type 1 diabetes. However, the limited supply of human islet tissue prevents this therapy from being widely used to treat patients with type 1 diabetes. In order to obtain insulin-secreting cells, retrovirus vector pLNCX was used to transfer the human insulin gene into human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The hMSCs were isolated from bone marrow of healthy volunteers and were expanded in vitro. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify the insulin DNA fragment from a healthy pancreas sample. The recombinant vector pLNCX-Ins was constructed by cloning the insulin DNA fragment into retrovirus vector pLNCX. After being packaged by BD RetroPack PT 67 packaging cells, the virus that contained the insulin gene was used to infect hMSCs. Transcription and expression of the insulin gene in transfected hMSCs were examined by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence.
