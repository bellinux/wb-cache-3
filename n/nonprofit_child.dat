40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between leadership style, as measured by the Leadership Opinion Questionnaire, and job satisfaction, global job satisfaction, and satisfaction with supervision, as measured by the Job Satisfaction Survey. Past research suggests that leaders with a considerate style of leadership are associated with greater job satisfaction compared to leaders who initiate structure. Although many studies of leadership style have been conducted in for-profit organizations, the objective of this research was to better understand the relationship of leadership style to job satisfaction in <b>nonprofit</b> <b>child</b> care centers. Eight directors in <b>nonprofit</b> <b>child</b> care centers in Rochester, New York, completed the Leadership Opinion Questionnaire, which posits a two-factor construct of leadership. Child care workers (N= 94) completed the Job Satisfaction Survey. All participating directors were White, college-educated females, and all child care workers were female, with varying educational and cultural backgrounds. Although the relationship between consideration and job satisfaction was not supported, significant relationships were found between a structured leadership orientation and global job satisfaction (r =. 597, p 3 ̆c. 01) as well as satisfaction with supervision (r =. 207, p 3 ̆c. 05). A post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference (t = 3. 36, df = 8, p 3 ̆c. 003) between satisfaction with supervision and leadership structure (LC-HS versus HC-LS). The findings demonstrated that leadership in <b>nonprofit</b> <b>child</b> care organizations does not follow the leadership trends in other for-profit agencies. The findings suggest that child care directors should attend leadership programs that develop a style high in structure to increase child care worker job satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a case study}} of a <b>nonprofit</b> <b>child</b> welfare agency that delivered family preservation services under three different purchase-of-service (POS) contracts. The research specifically focuses on how certain POS contract provisions and reimbursement rates influence the delivery of family preservation services. The three contacts examined differed on criteria, such as reimbursement mechanism, service volume, definition of clientele, and reimbursement rate. The study found that as reimbursement rates decline and as administrative costs increase, the service provider struggled with cash flow, staffing, fundraising, and service provision, among other things. It is concluded that contract-related resources, policies, and procedures impact provider agencies in multiple, significant ways that are critical to the provision of services and the accomplishment of positive client outcomes...|$|E

Parents of 95 preschoolers referred to a <b>nonprofit</b> <b>child</b> evaluation clinic because of behavioral or developmental concerns completed both the BASC- 2 and CBCL during an initial evaluation session. The findings revealed that while significantly high correlations occurred, the mean standard scores were significantly different for nine of the 15 construct comparisons.

Such findings imply that the two instruments are not equivalent, and results from these two behavior rating scales need to be interpreted with caution.
