5|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, but only a bare minimum were {{provided}} as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for <b>new</b> <b>installations.</b>|$|E

There are inexpensive smoke alarms that may be interconnected so that any detector that triggers sounds all alarms. They are powered by mains electricity, with disposable or rechargeable battery backup.

The online program is meant to solve some of the problems with providing educational opportunities to the more rural areas of the borough such the communities of Ajusco Medio and Ajusco Alto. In addition, to the online resources, students from the campus can also complete their social service requirement for graduation by tutoring in rural schools in the borough.|$|E

As a legacy from Spain's earlier development of solar power, the country remains a world leader in concentrated solar power, accounting for {{almost a third of}} solar power installed capacity in the country, a much higher ratio than that for other countries as of 2017. Many large concentrated solar power stations remain active in Spain and may have provided some of the impetus for large CSP developments in neighboring Morocco. In 2017 Spain held large auctions for renewable energy capacity to be constructed by 2020: solar and wind projects each won 4 GW.|$|E
25|$|These {{unearthed}} plugs {{with two}} flat parallel blades {{are intended for}} use on 240 volt circuits. The 2‐15 has coplanar current blades, and is used for 240V service at 15A, while the 2‐20 has the blades at 90° relative to each other (one vertical, one horizontal) and is used for 240 V service at 20A. NEMA 2 plugs and sockets are rare because they are unearthed and so, no longer permitted for <b>new</b> <b>installations.</b> They have no neutral. In some cases these plugs can be inserted into incorrect-voltage sockets. Prior {{to the adoption of}} the NEMA standard, a plug nearly identical to the 2‐20 was used for 120V at 20A. That obsolete plug would fit into 5‐20 and 6‐20 sockets, which supply different voltages, but will not fit a NEMA 2‐20 socket.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the Milwaukee Road), {{the last}} transcontinental line to be built, {{electrified}} its lines across the Rocky Mountains {{and to the}} Pacific Ocean starting in 1915. A few East Coast lines, notably the Virginian Railway and the Norfolk and Western Railway, electrified short sections of their mountain crossings. However, by this point electrification in the United States was more associated with dense urban traffic {{and the use of}} electric locomotives declined in the face of dieselization. Diesels shared some of the electric locomotive's advantages over steam and the cost of building and maintaining the power supply infrastructure, which discouraged <b>new</b> <b>installations,</b> brought on the elimination of most main-line electrification outside the Northeast. Except for a few captive systems (e.g. the Black Mesa and Lake Powell), by 2000 electrification was confined to the Northeast Corridor and some commuter service; even there, freight service was handled by diesels. Development continued in Europe, where electrification was widespread.|$|E
