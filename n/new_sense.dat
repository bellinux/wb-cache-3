Then in 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, {{the head of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other {{intelligence}} agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a <b>new</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower Administration in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961.|$|E

These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both {{the beauty of the}} colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

30|$|Theoretically, the <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix forms a tight {{frame with}} small coherence. Moreover, our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix {{theoretically}} guarantees unique recovery of sparse signals with uniformly distributed supports with high probability. From {{the structure of}} our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique can be applied for efficient signal measurement and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the <b>new</b> deterministic compressed <b>sensing</b> matrix, together with the CoSaMP recovery algorithm[20], empirically guarantees sparse signal recovery with high reliability. We observe that the empirical recovery performance of our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrices is {{similar to those of}} chirp sensing[6] and random partial Fourier matrices. However, our new matrices offer several practical benefits, requiring less storage and complexity than random partial Fourier matrices and providing more parameters of M and N than chirp sensing codes.|$|R
30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In Section 2, we introduce basic concepts and notations to understand this work. Section 3 modifies the structure of a basic partial Fourier matrix and presents a <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix for deterministic construction. We also discuss the efficient implementation and the theoretical recovery guarantee of the <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix. Section 4 describes the signal measurement process and the CoSaMP recovery algorithm by employing the FFT technique. In Section 5, we demonstrate the empirical recovery performance of our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrices in noiseless and noisy settings. Finally, concluding remarks will be given in Section 6.|$|R
5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a <b>new</b> <b>sense</b> of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
5|$|Performing live again brought Como a <b>new</b> <b>sense</b> of enjoyment. In May 1974, he {{embarked}} {{on his first}} concert appearance outside of the United States, a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children's charities. It was here where he discovered {{what he had been}} missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como sat in a chair, delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund with the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a <b>new</b> <b>sense</b> of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E

Moreover, while the N-point FFT {{is required for}} random partial Fourier matrices, the DFT-based submatrix structure of our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrices allows the (M[*]+[*] 1)-point FFT processing, which enables efficient signal measurement and reconstruction with low complexity and fast processing. The benefits in implementation indicate the potential of our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrices in practical compressed sensing.|$|R
5|$|Underlying {{social and}} racial {{tensions}} {{also had a}} great impact {{on the nature of the}} fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in Querétaro, who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican Bajío to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant José Tomás Boves was able to form a nearly invincible, though informal, royalist army out of the Llanero, mixed-race, slave and plains people, by seeking to destroy the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually reestablishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally in the backcountry of Upper Peru, the republiquetas kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and Native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers. This period witnessed increasingly violent confrontations between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a <b>new</b> <b>sense</b> of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the gachupines (a disparaging term for Peninsulares), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and Peninsulares who had taken refuge at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his Admirable Campaign, Simón Bolívar instituted a policy of a war to the death—in which and royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral Peninsulares would be killed—in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan Llaneros switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we compare}} our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> {{matrices}} to chirp sensing[6] and random partial Fourier matrices {{in terms of}} empirical recovery performance in noiseless and noisy scenarios. For comparison, we assume that a random partial Fourier matrix has the same parameters M and N[*]=[*](M[*]+[*] 1)L as those of our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix. To obtain it, we made ten trials to select M rows randomly from the N-point IDFT matrix, where the coherence was checked at each trial. Then, we chose {{the one with the}} smallest coherence for our experiments. For a chirp sensing matrix, on the other hand, M is set to a prime number closest to the parameter used in our <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix, and N[*]=[*]M L. Each submatrix of the partial chirp sensing matrix has an alternating polarity as in[30].|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityWith the {{ever-increasing}} {{abundance of}} sensing and computing devices embedded into our environments {{we have the}} opportunity to create personalized activity recognition ecosystems. Two key challenges must first be overcome, the new environment problem and the <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> platform problem. The new environment problem is encountered every time a sensing platform is deployed to a new environment. The <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> platform problem is encountered every time a <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> platform is deployed into an environment with an existing sensing platform. We approach these problems as transfer learning problems with heterogeneous feature-spaces, referred to as heterogeneous transfer learning. We propose several novel algorithms for each setting. Additionally, some theoretical work on the accuracy bounds and the run-time of the algorithms is also presented. Feature-Space Remapping (FSR) is proposed as a novel class of heterogeneous transfer learning algorithms which {{can be applied to the}} new environment problem. These algorithms are the first to perform heterogeneous transfer learning without requiring explicit linkage data. We show how these algorithms are able to outperform learning a model generalized across different environments using relations between features as specified by a domain expert. We also show how FSR can be used in conjunction with ensemble learning to combine information from multiple datasets. This method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 10 % to 20 %. Multi-view Transfer Learning is proposed as a solution to the <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> platform problem. In multi-view transfer learning the same instance can be seen from multiple views or feature-spaces which facilitates transferring knowledge from one view to another. We develop several new multi-view learning algorithms for this problem. Using a well-trained view as a teacher, we show that the performance of <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> platforms can be increased by as much as 20 % through multi-view learning. The teacher can also be used to bootstrap a set of labeled training data for the <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> platform which removes the need to manually annotate data when introducing <b>new</b> <b>sensing</b> platforms. We also provide bounds and an estimation of the learner's accuracy when the ground truth labeled data cannot be used to directly estimate the accuracy.

25|$|In the {{eventual}} Standard Model of particle physics codified in the 1970s, all mesons {{other than the}} mu meson were understood to be hadrons—that is, particles made of quarks—and thus subject to the nuclear force. In the quark model, a meson was no longer defined by mass (for some had been discovered that were very massive—more than nucleons), but instead were particles composed of exactly two quarks (a quark and antiquark), unlike the baryons, which are defined as particles composed of three quarks (protons and neutrons were the lightest baryons). Mu mesons, however, had shown themselves to be fundamental particles (leptons) like electrons, with no quark structure. Thus, mu mesons were not mesons at all, in the <b>new</b> <b>sense</b> {{and use of the}} term meson used with the quark model of particle structure.|$|E
