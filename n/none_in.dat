40|$|Cryostat {{sections}} of normal skin from 57 white adults were examined by {{direct and indirect}} immunofluorescence for immunoglobulins, complement factors, and transferrin. The results for basement membrane zone (BMX) were significantly different for the 11 face and 46 non-face biopsies: in the face, IgM was found in five, IgG in two, IgA in one, and C 3 <b>in</b> <b>none,</b> whereas, <b>in</b> non-face, IgM was present in six, IgG <b>in</b> <b>none,</b> IgA <b>in</b> one, and C 3 in five. The results for dermal vessel walls (DV) were not apparently different for face and non-face; in the 57 biopsies IgM was present in one, IgG <b>in</b> <b>none,</b> IgA <b>in</b> one, and C 3 in one. The 11 biopsies from the face and 26 of the non-face biopsies were examined further. No IgD or C 4 was identified, but one case (scalp) showed BMZ Clq, properdin, and transferrin, and in two cases (one face, one non-face) DV properdin was found. Cytoid bodies (IgM and IgA) were present in moderate numbers in one case; all other positive reactions were finely granular...|$|R
5|$|Adams {{left the}} club in April 1962 and was {{replaced}} with Sid Abel, who was also head coach. First under Abel as GM and then Ned Harkness, Alex Delvecchio, Lindsay, and Jimmy Skinner in the position, the Red Wings suffered {{a long period of}} decline, from 1967 until 1983, during which they made the playoffs only twice. They did not appear in the Finals in this time and only won one of the three series they appeared in, beating the Atlanta Flames two games to <b>none</b> <b>in</b> 1978.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but <b>none</b> <b>in</b> private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|Germanium's {{abundance}} in the Earth's crust is approximately 1.6ppm. Only a few minerals like argyrodite, briartite, germanite, and renierite contain appreciable amounts of germanium, and <b>none</b> <b>in</b> mineable deposits. Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction {{from the final}} ore concentrate. An unusual natural enrichment process causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams, discovered by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt during a broad survey for germanium deposits. The highest concentration ever found was in Hartley coal ash with as much as 1.6% germanium. The coal deposits near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia, contain an estimated 1600tonnes of germanium.|$|E

5|$|In his lone {{season with}} the Bears, Christopher pitched in 31 games. Among those games was a four-hit shutout against the Rochester Red Wings in the International League playoffs to put the Bears up two games to <b>none.</b> <b>In</b> the {{championship}} series against the Montreal Royals, Christopher pitched seven solid innings in {{a victory for the}} Bears, but injured his back and did not play another game that season. He finished the season with a 16–7 record, a 2.82 ERA and 12 complete games. At the conclusion of the season, Christopher was considered the top prospect in the rule 5 draft, and the Philadelphia Athletics selected him with the first pick of the draft.|$|E
5|$|In later life, Hamming became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but <b>none</b> <b>in</b> the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and <b>none</b> <b>in</b> the South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude {{them from the}} political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E

5|$|Major urinary {{proteins}} (Mups), {{also known}} as α2u-globulins, are a subfamily of proteins found in abundance in the urine and other secretions of many animals. Mups provide a small range of identifying information about the donor animal, when detected by the vomeronasal organ of the receiving animal. They belong to a larger family of proteins known as lipocalins. Mups are encoded by a cluster of genes, located {{adjacent to each other}} on a single stretch of DNA, that varies greatly in number between species: from at least 21 functional genes in mice to <b>none</b> <b>in</b> humans. Mup proteins form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a ligand-binding pocket that accommodates specific small, organic chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Novomessor was synonymized in 1974, {{although}} {{evidence to}} retain it as a valid genus emerged when scientists discovered an exocrine gastral glandular system in two Novomessor species and <b>none</b> <b>in</b> Aphaenogaster. However, N. ensifer {{does not have}} this glandular system. English myrmecologist Barry Bolton argues that basing the genus on such feature cannot justify the separation of Novomessor and Aphaenogaster. In 2015, a phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct from Aphaenogaster, and the genus was revived from synonymy to include N. ensifer, N. albisetosus and N. cockerelli as members of it.|$|E

5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. <b>None</b> <b>in</b> the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E

5|$|Robinson's {{appearances}} at Leeds were at first sporadic, {{although he did}} play in a UEFA Champions League match against Barcelona, which finished 1–1. He was Leeds' number two goalkeeper behind Nigel Martyn, making five league appearances in his debut season and <b>none</b> <b>in</b> the following season. He made 16 appearances in the 2000–01 season, following Martyn sustaining an injury, but did not play a league match in the following season. Terry Venables dropped Martyn after he requested a break from pre-season training after the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Robinson became Leeds' number one goalkeeper as a result, with Robinson playing in all 38 matches of the 2002–03 season. Martyn left for Everton {{at the start of}} the following season, with young goalkeepers Danny Milosevic and Scott Carson taking over as backups for Robinson.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 World Series was the 100th {{edition of}} Major League Baseball's {{championship}} series.

The Red Sox defeated the Cardinals by four games to <b>none</b> <b>in</b> the best-of-seven series, played at Fenway Park and Busch Memorial Stadium. The series was played from October 23 to 27, 2004, broadcast on Fox, and watched {{by an average}} of just under 25.5 million viewers.
