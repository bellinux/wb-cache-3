5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years.

The male {{and the female}} begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E

5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active {{for a few hours}} in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> this.|$|E

5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven back toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily {{be found in the}} oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; woody plants are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India.

The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E
