5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1147, the Pope {{authorized}} {{the expansion of the}} crusade into the Iberian peninsula, {{in the context of the}} Reconquista. He also authorized Alfonso VII of León and Castile to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade. In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from Dartmouth in England for the Holy Land. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Porto on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with King Afonso I of Portugal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Inhalable {{particulate}} matter seriously affects ambient air quality. To analyze temporal-spatial distribution char-acteristics of PM 10 pollution and {{the impacts of}} meteorological factors in China since 2000, using statistical methods and GIS, monitoring data of PM 10 during 2000 - 2013 in China were analyzed. It was found that annual mean of PM 10 in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> China basically presented declining tendency since 2000. PM 10 concentration in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> China had obvious seasonal change characteristics, and monthly average PM 10 concentration which was higher during November-December and January-April and had double-peak characteristics. PM 10 pollution in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> China was eased largely, and heavily polluted area significantly reduced. The overall tendency changed from the concentrated contiguous distribution into sporadic zonal and punctiform distribution. Meteorological factors had important impacts on PM 10 in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> China. PM 10 concentration and wind velocity presented negative correlation when wind veloc-ity 6 m/s and positive correlation when wind velocity 6 m/s. Relative humidity was an important factor affecting in-halable {{particulate matter}} pollution in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> China in winter, and high-humidity air was easy to cause heavier particulate matter pollution. Temperature and atmospheric pressure had no obvious impact on inhalable particulate matter pollution in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> China...|$|R

5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was the <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, {{as well as his}} wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Spanish government, which ruled over Puerto Rico, {{attempted}} to banish Betances {{for a second}} time, but he and Segundo Ruiz Belvis (a lawyer and city administrator who became his closest friend and political companion) fled the island before they were apprehended. Both fled to the <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic in 1861, where Betances established a close personal friendship with Gen. Gregorio Luperón, the military leader of the northern pro-independence faction who led the efforts to restore Dominican sovereignty over their country. Betances was also a collaborator of Dominican priest (and later Archbishop of Santo Domingo and one-time president of the country), Fernando Arturo de Meriño, who was the revolt's ideological leader (as well as its delegate in Puerto Rico when he was himself exiled by the restored republican government). These two friendships {{would prove to be}} key to Betances' own efforts to achieve Puerto Rican independence later on.|$|E
5|$|Lucas Rafael Bennazar Ortíz {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics as Puerto Rico's only sharpshooter. Born in the <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Guaynabo, Bennazar first {{participated in the}} Olympics as a 35-year-old in Athens that competed in the men's trap {{shooting}} and double trap. He again participated in the double trap {{when he returned to}} the Olympics as a 39-year-old. Bennazar took part in the preliminary round of the event, which took place on August 11. During this time, Bennazar earned 45 points in the first round; 39 points in the second round; and 39 points again in the third round. His overall score during preliminaries was 123 points, placing 17th out of 19 athletes. He defeated New Zealand's Graeme Ede (113 points) and fell behind Russia's Vitaly Fokeev (130 points), falling behind heat leader Walton Eller of the United States who set an Olympic record with his score (145 points). His score remained the same in the final round on August 12, and he remained in 17th place.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1940, {{following}} the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union seemed to Hitler {{to be the only}} solution. While no concrete plans were made yet, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for his important real task: the showdown with Bolshevism. With the successful end to the campaign in France, General Erich Marcks was assigned to the working group drawing up the initial invasion plans of the Soviet Union. The first battle plans were entitled Operation Draft East (but colloquially it was known as the Marcks Plan). His report advocated the A-A line to be the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union. This goal would extend from <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Arkhangelsk on the Arctic Sea through Gorky and Rostov to the port city of Astrakhan {{at the mouth of the}} Volga on the Caspian Sea. The report concluded that this military border would reduce the threat to Germany (and the Third Reich) from attacks by enemy bombers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, on 19 February 1942, the Japanese {{launched}} {{air raids}} on Australian soil, targeting the <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Darwin. Miller trained at flying schools at Cunderdin, Western Australia and Mallala, South Australia, {{just north of}} Adelaide and gained his wings in late 1942. He played only one match during the football season, playing in a combined West Adelaide and Glenelg Football Club team while posted in South Australia. His team lost. On 17 December he returned to Melbourne and was promoted {{to the rank of}} flight sergeant. On 15 January 1943, he embarked on the USS West Point at Port Melbourne, which was to take him to Europe in readiness for war combat. The journey included a stopover in February at a training camp in Boston in the United States. It was there that Miller met Peg Wagner, his future wife. They were engaged before Miller left for the United Kingdom. He arrived in Scotland on 18 March 1943 and was deployed to the southern English coastal town of Bournemouth. The once-popular tourist resort had been turned into a military centre and was the target of frequent German air raids.|$|E
