The structures in question are rather complicated and thus, sig-nificant {{part of the}} used analysis methods are numerical. <b>Numerical</b> <b>field</b> computation is based on finite-difference method (FD) or on finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD).

The correct use of Faraday’s induction law can sometimes be harder than one would think for the first sight.

First, {{the case of a}} small magnet falling within a copper tube –which is an impressive experiment as well – is dealt with. Second, a metallic plate moving below a small magnet is examined. In both cases, approximate and proper electromagnetic models are compared. The approximate solutions are usually of satis-fying accuracy, but they hide some parts of the physics behind the phenomenon.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt at {{introducing}} the latest technology in fluid power, thermoacoustics, a phenomenon due to solid-fluid interactions. Thermoacoustics can be generally characterised by the following two categories. The first, the oscillations induced by temperature difference across a stack of plates can generate acoustic power consistent of a prime mover. While the reverse, that of heat transfers across a stack of plates powered by acoustic waves is typical of a heat pump learnt in the engineering introductory course. Basic thermoacoustic theory and some simple thermoacoustic design parameters that are currently being used are discussed. Analysis using these theories is shown.
