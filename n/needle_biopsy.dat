5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> may be required.|$|E

40|$|While {{malignant}} lymphomas {{are commonly}} found in the spleen, they do not often originate there. We describe two lymphoma cases with nonspecific symptoms and splenic tumors that were discovered fortuitously.

Our experience indicates that fine <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are a useful tool to diagnose splenic lymphomas...|$|R
2500|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{findings on}} <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> consist of abundant stromal cells, which appear as bare bipolar nuclei, throughout the aspirate; sheets of fairly uniform-size epithelial {{cells that are}} typically arranged in either an antler-like pattern or a honeycomb pattern. [...] These epithelial sheets tend to show typical metachromatic blue on Diff-Quik staining. Foam cells and apocrine cells may also be seen, although these are less diagnostic features. [...] The gallery images below demonstrate these features.|$|E
2500|$|When a thymoma is suspected, a CT/CAT scan is {{generally}} performed {{to estimate the}} size and extent of the tumor, and the lesion is sampled with a CT-guided <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Increased vascular enhancement on CT scans can be indicative of malignancy, as can be pleural deposits. [...] Limited biopsies {{are associated with a}} very small risk of pneumomediastinum or mediastinitis and an even-lower risk of damaging the heart or large blood vessels. Sometimes thymoma metastasize for instance to the abdomen.|$|E
2500|$|Because <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> {{is often}} a {{reliable}} diagnostic investigation, some doctors may decide not to operate to remove the lesion, and instead opt for clinical follow-up to observe the lesion over time using clinical examination and mammography to determine the rate of growth, if any, of the lesion. [...] A growth rate of less than sixteen percent per month in women under fifty years of age, and a growth rate of less than thirteen percent per month in women over fifty years of age have been published as safe growth rates for continued non-operative treatment and clinical observation.|$|E
40|$|Thyroid large <b>needle</b> {{aspiration}} <b>biopsy</b> is disregarded {{because it}} {{is thought to be}} associated with pain. This is in contrast with our 32 years long experience. We surveyed reports of pain in patients examined with fine <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> (78, 87. 2 % women, mean age 59 years) or FNAB+large <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> (48, 87. 5 % women, mean age 60 years). Each patient was questioned regarding a) no unpleasant sensation (score " 0 "); b) unpleasant sensation (" 1 "); c) mild pain (no analgesic used; " 2 "); or d) pain (analgesic used; " 3 "). The mean size of the needle used was for FNAB 22. 3 ± 0. 7 or 20. 8 ± 1 gauge in the fine needle aspiration or fine needle aspiration plus large <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> group, respectively (p<. 0001). The number of percutaneous punctures was higher in the fine needle aspiration plus large <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> group. However, the pain score in the fine <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> or fine <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> plus large <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> group was not significantly different. Large <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> after fine <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> does not add any discomfort or pain and therefore in light of the demonstrable benefits, should be included in clinical algorithms for the evaluation of thyroid nodules...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Gleason score, {{which has}} a high {{interobserver}} variability, is used to classify prostate cancer.

40|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> {{are taken}} as {{standard}} diagnostic specimens for many cancers, but no technique exists for the high-throughput analysis of multiple individual immunohistochemical (IHC) markers using these samples. Here {{we present a}} simple and highly reliable technique for constructing tissue microarrays (TMAs) from prostatic <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Serial sectioning of the TMAs, called ‘Checkerboard TMAs', facilitated expression analysis of multiple proteins using IHC markers. In total, 100 % of the analysed biopsies within the TMA both preserved their antigenicity and maintained their morphology. Checkerboard TMAs will allow the use of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> (i) alongside other tissue specimens (trans-urethral resection of prostates and prostatectomies {{in the case of}} prostate cancer) in clinical correlation studies when searching for new prognostic markers, and (ii) in a diagnostic context for assessing expression of multiple proteins in cancers from patients prior to treatment...|$|R

40|$|A non-radioactive in situ {{hybridization}} {{method for}} IL- 2 mRNA detection based {{on the use of}} four biotinylated oligonucleotide probes, plus appropriate positive and negative control probes was developed and applied to synovial surgical and <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthropathy (SpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) patients. In eight surgical biopsies (six RA, one SpA, one PsA) this non-radioactive system showed similar sensitivity to that of a previously described 32 P-labelled probe system, and in addition detected IL- 2 mRNA in five out of seven biopsies from SpA and PsA patients and in two out of two JCA <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies.</b> IL- 2 mRNA was found in the absence of IL- 2 protein in RA biopsies (six surgical, 12 needle), but variable amounts of IL- 2 protein were detected in six out of seven <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from SpA, PsA and JCA patients, where CD 3 + lymphoid infiltrates were present.

40|$|International audiencePhenotypic {{identification}} of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) subtypes using immunohistochemical markers {{has been developed}} from their molecular characteristics. Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity of these markers in the definitive diagnosis of these lesions by core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies.</b> A total of 239 <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> paired with their surgical resection specimen (group A) or without an associated resection specimen (group B) were reviewed. Using a step-by-step algorithm after standard staining, appropriate immunostaining analyses were performed to determine the certainty of diagnosis of FNH, HNF 1 α-inactivated HCA, inflammatory HCA, β-catenin-activated HCA, or unclassified HCA. The diagnosis of FNH was certain or probable on routine stains in 53 % of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> of group A, whereas after glutamine synthetase staining, the diagnosis was certain in 86. 7 % as compared with 100 % on the corresponding surgical specimen (P= 0. 04). In <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> of group A, the diagnosis of HCA was certain on routine stains in 58. 6 % as compared with 94. 3 % on surgical specimens. After specific immunostaining, diagnosis was established on biopsies with 74. 3 % certainty, including all HCA subtypes, with similar distribution in surgical specimens. For each "certain diagnosis" paired diagnostic test (biopsy and surgical specimen), a positive correlation was observed (P< 0. 001). No significant difference was observed between groups A and B for FNH (P= 0. 714) or for HCA subtypes (P= 0. 750). Compared with surgical specimens, immunohistochemical analysis performed on biopsies allowed the discrimination of FNH from HCA and the {{identification of}} HCA subtypes with good performance...|$|R

40|$|Pre-analytic variables, {{specifically}} cold ischemic time, {{have been}} implicated as key {{variables in the}} measurement of proteins by immunohistochemistry. To determine the significance and magnitude of antigenic loss due to pre-analytic variables, we have compared protein antigenicity in core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> with essentially no cold ischemic time, to that in routinely processed tumor resection specimens. Two cohorts of matched core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and tumor resections were collected with 20 matched pairs and 14 matched pairs, respectively. Both series were analyzed by quantitative immunofluorescence using the AQUA ® method. Antibodies to phospho-ERK, total ERK, phospho-AKT, total AKT, phospho-S 6 K 1, total S 6 K 1, Estrogen Receptor, Ki 67, cytokeratin and GAPDH were measured. Detection levels for all phospho-epitopes were significantly decreased in tumor resections compared to biopsies while no significant change {{was seen in the}} corresponding total proteins. Of the other four proteins examined, Estrogen Receptor and cytokeratin showed significant loss of antigenicity. This data suggests that measurement of phospho-protein antigenicity in formalin-fixed tissue by immunological methods is dramatically affected by pre-analytic variables.
