5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are <b>not</b> <b>watching.</b> Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
25|$|His {{other great}} passion in {{childhood}} was {{a love of}} horses. When <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> {{the stars of the}} silver screen, Neill would often be found at the local stables where he bartered some mucking out and grooming duties in return for the opportunity to ride the horses. After leaving school, where he excelled at art, he returned to Glasgow and enrolled for a course in commercial art at Glasgow School of Art.|$|E
25|$|While Rosebud looks on, {{everyone}} {{is affected by}} the magic and must play their harlequinade parts. When she is <b>not</b> <b>watching,</b> however, they regain their true personalities and are all horrified at the excesses of their harlequinade characters. Matters go from bad to worse, and Rosebud finally relents, agreeing to marry the demon and asking Aloysius to perform the ceremony. All are restored to their original characters, Aloysius embraces Clarissa, and Sir Trevor embraces Lady Angela.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{recorded and}} released its musical content {{early in the}} show's history, to reinforce its curriculum lessons for children when they were <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> it, and for entertainment. [...] Recording albums of the substantial amount of music written for the show, along with publishing books, was the first attempts to generate income and to fund the show and other projects of the Children's Television Workshop (the CTW, later renamed the Sesame Workshop), the organization that oversaw the production of Sesame Street.|$|E
500|$|David Bianculli {{from the}} New York Daily News stated [...] "If you're <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> this series on Fox, the {{least you can}} do is buy it on DVD. You'll love it, and it's such a dense show (in the best sense of the word) that it rewards {{repeated}} viewing. Like Scrubs and the British version of The Office, it is the sort of show that truly deserves to be seen uninterrupted, several episodes at a time, for maximum enjoyment. The laughs-per-minute quotient here is insanely high, making it great value as a home library purchase." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane {{addressed}} what viewers {{perceived to}} be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks through the front door, returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, [...] "Some of the fans actually noticed, commented {{on the fact that}} this was a very abrupt resolution, but, to that I would say, you're <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> [...] wouldn't you rather we throw in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute?".|$|E

500|$|Hearst summered at Wyntoon {{and raised}} her son's {{children}} there when he was <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> them. William Randolph Hearst and his wife Millicent produced five sons from 1904 to 1915—each one spent summer months at Wyntoon with grandmother. The boys' father sent instructions about their upbringing, writing after the eldest boy George Randolph Hearst was nearly washed down the McCloud, that the boys needed [...] "a severe warning about the river". Hearst occasionally entertained her society friends and acquaintances at Wyntoon, bringing selected guests up north from the Panama–Pacific International Exposition of 1915. At her death in 1919, she willed Wyntoon to her niece Anne Apperson Flint, along with a Cadillac car and $250,000.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} September, with Leopold's recovery, {{the family}} moved back to central London, to lodgings in Thrift Street (later 20 Frith Street), Soho. These lodgings were located {{conveniently}} close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J.C Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play a few bars individually, and that [...] "anyone <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> {{would have thought it}} was played by one person alone". There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps through the medium of the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.|$|E
500|$|Lois goes to {{her book}} club and asks Peter to babysit Stewie. Instead, he invites Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe and they all play Truth or Dare, which results in a make out session between Cleveland and Joe. After a fiasco {{involving}} Stewie attempting to fix their satellite TV, and getting stuck on the roof, due to Peter's lack of supervision, Brian tries to tell Peter {{but he does not}} listen and instead reads a magazine featuring Nick Jonas. After Peter starts a pillow fight that turns violent, Lois comes in, angry at Peter for <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> Stewie, who has gotten stuck on the roof. Peter attempts to go fix the satellite himself, at which point he comes across a raffle ticket from 1989 that he had forgotten to cash in, winning him a chance to play golf with a celebrity of his choice. Ultimately, he chose O. J. Simpson.|$|E

50|$|Lagardère Sports Asia, {{formerly}} known as World Sport Group, was acquired by Lagardère in 2008 and renamed (and reorganized its subsidiary structure) in 2015. World Sport Group angered many Asian football fans by increasing {{the price of the}} broadcasting rights for the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers 2014 (Asia Region), meaning home fans in South Korea could <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> their international team. Also expatriate Iranian fans could <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> the match in Europe or the Americas.|$|R
500|$|After 12-year-old Lad is {{praised for}} {{bringing}} the Mistress a lace parasol that he found on the road, he begins searching the road for more things to find, sometimes stealing them unintentionally from people who were nearby but <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> their items. As he had gotten more sensitive in his older age, his owners always praised him for the gifts, which ranged from a full picnic basket to roadkill. One night, he [...] "finds" [...] a baby, who was kidnapped from a wealthy household by a disgruntled former employee and his kin. The baby had been set in the grass by his two kidnappers while they changed a flat tire. The kidnappers eventually catch up to Lad, who is carrying the child home. He fights off the men when they attack him, eventually chasing {{them back to their}} car, and they escape. The baby is returned to his parents and the kidnappers arrested, but Lad is hurt that his present results in no praise, just a lot of activity around the house.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
500|$|Christman {{worked with}} the Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in her efforts to curtail or remove {{material}} critical of Scientology from the press, media, and the Internet. She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while {{a member of the}} Scientology organization. OSA agents serve as the [...] "internal security force and intelligence unit" [...] within Scientology. Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979, when a politician in Clearwater, Florida was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization's efforts to establish a presence in the city. She was ordered to participate in public meetings, and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician, Richard Tenning. He was defeated in a subsequent election, and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater. In 1985, Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member. She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the jury, and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors. At the time, Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents. Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents, she commented, [...] "I was in a cult. Scientology promotes <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> the news. It keeps you inside a Truman Show where you're totally unaware of things. It's like your own thinking gets shut down and you get used to not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology." ...|$|E

2500|$|NBC owned-and-operated {{stations}} and affiliates {{are given a}} 30-second window to insert a local forecast segment into the program following the national weather report; Roker's outcue for the local break is [...] "That's what's going on around the country, here's what's happening in your neck of the woods." [...] although in recent years, this outcue was used during only starting the second half-hour. [...] During the first half hour, Roker simply uses [...] "your local forecast" [...] which appears after a 30-second commercial.

2500|$|According to Edin: [...] "No one {{avoided the}} {{unnecessary}} expenditures, {{such as the}} occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them some money or something, or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will {{be out on the}} street if they are <b>not</b> <b>watching</b> TV." [...] However many mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses. According to Edin, for [...] "most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter alone cost almost as much as these mothers received from the government. For more than one-third, food and housing costs exceeded their cash benefits, leaving no extra money for uncovered medical care, clothing, and other household expenses." ...|$|E
