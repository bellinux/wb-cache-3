5|$|An {{alternative}} phylogenetic {{hypothesis that}} has gained substantial traction places Brancasaurus in the clade Leptocleididae, {{along with other}} leptocleidids including Leptocleidus itself, Vectocleidus, Umoonasaurus, Nichollssaura, and also possibly Hastanectes. This result has been recovered by the phylogenies of Benson et al., who have also <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> number of morphological traits which ally Brancasaurus with the more general Leptocleidia.|$|E
5|$|Andrés Torrón of El Observador <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> {{similarity}} between Almendra and Pink Floyd's 1967 album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Almendra lyrics (primarily by Spinetta) {{have been widely}} studied for their lyricism, poetic quality, precise use of language, and rich visual imagery; {{as well as the}} innovation of singing them in Spanish.|$|E
50|$|For example, if one <b>note</b> has <b>a</b> {{frequency}} of 400 Hz, the <b>note</b> <b>a</b> fifteenth above {{it is at}} 1600 Hz (15ma&thinsp;), and the <b>note</b> <b>a</b> fifteenth below is at 100 Hz (15mb&thinsp;). The ratio of frequencies of two <b>notes</b> <b>a</b> fifteenth apart is therefore 4:1.|$|R
50|$|For ease of discussion, {{ligatures}} {{of different}} lengths have different names. A ligature with two <b>notes</b> is called <b>a</b> binaria; one with three <b>notes,</b> <b>a</b> ternaria; one with four <b>notes,</b> <b>a</b> quaternaria; {{and one with}} five <b>notes,</b> <b>a</b> quinaria. Larger ones are possible, but rare.|$|R

5|$|Reactions to the {{extension}} between SR125 and SR67 were mixed. There were reports of faster transportation through the East County area, yet commuters <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> rush hour backup at SR125 headed westbound {{because there were}} only two lanes traveling west through the interchange. Traffic along Mission Gorge Road was reported to have decreased by 20percent.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} 2008 John McCain presidential campaign's August 29, 2008 {{announcement}} that Alaska governor Sarah Palin would be McCain's vice presidential nominee, people <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> physical resemblance between comedian Tina Fey and Palin.

50|$|Three {{types of}} Notes are used. The Click <b>Note,</b> <b>a</b> single {{circular}} <b>note,</b> requires tapping {{the object in}} time. The Drag <b>Note,</b> <b>a</b> continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. The Hold <b>Note,</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> with <b>an</b> extended ribbon meter, requires holding over the note until the meter is filled. Notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those as the line drops are colored yellow and green.|$|R

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Gomphidius vinicolor in 1898 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, based on specimens collected near Lake Mohonk in Ulster County, New York. Peck <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> resemblance to Gomphidius roseus, which {{he thought was}} closely related. It {{was transferred to the}} newly created genus Chroogomphus by Orson K. Miller, Jr. in 1964.|$|E
5|$|A 1937 {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> {{rectangular}} font made of gritstone, of unknown date, and a memorial to a Sion Evan and his son Evan Jones, who died in 1790 and 1822 respectively. A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded a chalice and paten made of Britannia metal (a pewter alloy), and an electro-plated set of communion vessels. It noted that the old silver communion service had been stolen.|$|E
5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E

5|$|An area of squally {{weather was}} first <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> few hundred {{miles east of}} the Lesser Antilles on September 18. The {{convective}} area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on September 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper level winds were very favorable and steering currents were very weak. On September 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which {{is distinct from}} C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E

5000|$|Each <b>note</b> {{features}} <b>a</b> bird on {{the left}} side of the <b>note's</b> front, <b>a</b> theme selected to represent a young Singapore [...] "ever ready to take flight to greater heights". Standard on each note, is the Coat of Arms, a lion head watermark, and the signature of the Minister for Finance and chairman of the board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore, on the front of the <b>note.</b> <b>As</b> an added security feature, all <b>notes</b> have <b>a</b> vertically embedded security thread, while the $1,000 and $10,000 notes have two.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early risers, instead waiting until the sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> flock of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, reviewers <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> lack {{of support}} for {{expandable}} storage, the initial absence of cellular connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, {{as well as an}} absence of a rear-facing camera. For the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such a camera so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing. Some consumers reported instances when the screen would not register inputs while the tablet performed data-intensive operations, while others complained about the build-quality of the screen.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot: Warped {{was praised}} by critics, who <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> high quality in many areas, {{including}} gameplay, graphics and audio. The game {{went on to}} sell nearly six million units, making it the thirteenth best-selling PlayStation video game of all time. In Japan, the game surpassed the sales of its two predecessors {{and became the first}} non-Japanese PlayStation title to sell over one million units in the country. A remastered version was included in the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection for the PlayStation 4 in June 2017.|$|E

5|$|Fighters Uncaged was {{announced}} by Ubisoft at Gamescom 2010, {{three months before}} its official release. There, people were allowed to preview the game. The game was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. Because the announcement came suddenly {{and close to the}} release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin Smith of VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing the concept and its character designs and <b>noted</b> <b>a</b> misspelling in the preview. The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E
5|$|Green Hill Zone {{is remembered}} as a classic within both the Sonic the Hedgehog series and video games in general. The level and its music have also {{received}} positive opinions from critics.

5|$|In August 2016, Microsoft {{released}} a refreshed Xbox One model, Xbox One S, {{which has a}} streamlined design, native support for 4K video playback and upscaling, and HDR10 high-dynamic-range color. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as {{the lack of a}} native Kinect port were <b>noted.</b> <b>A</b> high-end model, Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 for release in November, which features major hardware upgrades focused on enabling games to be rendered at 4K resolution.|$|E
