40|$|<b>Target</b> <b>prices</b> are analysts’ {{forecasts}} of a firm’s stock <b>price.</b> Although <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> {{can be used}} to help market participants make investment decisions, much is still unknown about how analysts make these forecasts. Because prior literature documents momentum in stock returns, in this paper, I examine whether <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> reflect the information in returns over the six months prior to the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> announcement date. I find that <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> systematically underestimate the persistence of these six month returns. I further find that the forecasted return in <b>target</b> <b>price</b> revisions is more pessimistic following periods of very good stock performance and more optimistic following periods of very poor stock performance. However, I find that <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> made by ‘All-Star’ analysts reflect the information in six month returns when these <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> follow a period of very poor stock performance...|$|R
40|$|Equity analysts’ <b>target</b> <b>price</b> {{estimates}} are uncertain. Some analysts gauge this uncertainty by supplementing their <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> with {{a risk assessment}} {{in the form of}} a bull–bear analysis (BBA). We explore whether disclosing a BBA reduces analysts’ <b>target</b> <b>price</b> error or, alternatively, whether analysts disclose a BBA to make their forecasts seem more credible and distract attention from less accurate <b>target</b> <b>prices.</b> Using propensity score matching to control for selection bias, combined with a difference-in-differences estimation to allow for company- and analyst-specific effects, we estimate the effect of supplementing <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> with a BBA on the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy of US stocks. We find that <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> are significantly more accurate, both statistically and economically, when analysts supplement them with a BBA. Our results shed light on the role of risk and uncertainty assessments in improving analyst valuations...|$|R
40|$|Using a large {{database}} of analysts' <b>target</b> <b>prices,</b> we examine short-term market reactions to <b>target</b> <b>price</b> announcements and long-term co-movement of <b>target</b> and stock <b>prices.</b> We find a significant market {{reaction to the}} information contained in analysts' <b>target</b> <b>prices,</b> both unconditional and conditional on contemporaneously issued stock recommendations and earnings forecast revisions. For example, the spread in average announcement day abnormal returns between positive and negative <b>target</b> <b>price</b> revisions is as high as 7 percent. We also find that stock recommendations and earnings forecast revisions are informative controlling for the information in <b>target</b> <b>prices.</b> Using a cointegration approach, we explore the long-term behavior of market and <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> and estimate the system's long-term equilibrium. In this equilibrium a typical firm's one-year ahead <b>target</b> <b>price</b> is 22 percent higher than its current market price. Finally, while market prices react to the information conveyed in analysts' reports, we show that any subsequent corrections towards the long-term equilibrium are, in effect, done by analysts alone...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{research}} to examine the determinants of {{the accuracy of the}} <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> of sell-side analysts within a relative context. This is achieved by utilising a within analyst rank-correlation of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> expected returns and realised price returns, which measures whether analysts can accurately rank the price appreciation of stocks within their coverage cluster. The study then investigates whether the factors that determine the absolute accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> also explain the relative accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices.</b> The evidence suggests that many of the determinants of the absolute accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> are not necessarily determinants of the relative accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices,</b> providing a more nuanced understanding of their association with analyst forecasts. This thesis is also the first research to examine discordance between analysts’ recommendations and <b>target</b> <b>price</b> expected returns at an individual analyst level, documenting similar discordance to that found in prior research at a consensus level...|$|R

This examination {{is relevant to}} the economic question: Does analyst reputation mitigate or exacerbate the conflicts of interest that analysts face? Consistent with institutional investor trades being based on superior information, I observe differences in the information content of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> revisions by star and non-star analysts. Additionally, a duration analysis shows that low <b>target</b> <b>price</b> quality significantly increases the hazard of institutional investors not voting analysts as ‘stars’...|$|R
40|$|I have {{documented}} that <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> subsumed in downgrade recommendations {{are the most}} informative while <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> in coverage reiteration are the least informative. The First Call database enables me to extend the analysis to an intraday frequency.

The modified approach to event study is relevant to the fast-changing trading environment in today 2 ̆ 7 s capital market. For upgrades, there are significant positive market-adjusted returns lasting 20 minutes; for downgrades, there are significant negative market-adjusted returns lasting 25 to 35 minutes. By constructing portfolios {{on the basis of}} <b>target</b> <b>price</b> information measures (TP/P, ΔTP/TP- 1 and ΔTP/P), I also document that the information subsumed in <b>target</b> <b>price</b> revision is more useful than <b>target</b> <b>price</b> alone. Furthermore, the dramatic rise in trading activity coupled with a shift in order imbalances implies that the market interprets recommendations with <b>target</b> <b>price</b> changes broadly as a liquidity event. More importantly, I find that <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> are informative both unconditionally and conditionally on the type of recommendations and rating revision at intraday frequency.

Using a sample of US takeovers from 1999 to 2014, we find a negative relation between <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> for a takeover target and the chances for successful deal completion. High degrees of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> dispersion indicate high reference points for some investors. Accordingly, we find low completion rates when <b>target</b> <b>price</b> dispersion is high.

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} whether dynamic <b>targeted</b> <b>pricing</b> based on consumer purchase history could benefit a practicing firm even when consumers are "strategic" in that they actively seek to avail themselves of a low price in the future. Such strategic behavior {{on the part of}} consumers has been shown in the literature to render such dynamic <b>targeted</b> <b>pricing</b> unprofitable, even for a monopoly firm. We show that dynamic <b>targeted</b> <b>pricing</b> can benefit competing firms, when they actively pursue customer recognition based on consumer purchase history. This is because in order to pursue customer recognition, competing firms need to price high to "screen out" price-sensitive consumers and hence price competition is moderated. As a result, all competing firms can become better off with <b>targeted</b> <b>pricing</b> than without even when consumers behave strategically. Interestingly, because of this competition moderation effect, the paradoxical outcome occurs where dynamic <b>targeted</b> <b>pricing</b> may not benefit a monopolist, but it may benefit competing firms. We also show that dynamic <b>targeted</b> <b>pricing</b> can expand the market such that social welfare unambiguously improves.

40|$|Research {{shows that}} analyst <b>target</b> <b>price</b> {{accuracy}} is limited and yet {{evidence on the}} factors driving this limited accuracy is inconclusive. Complementing the results of recent studies that show that the increasing incidence of cash flow forecasts in analyst reports has helped mitigate accruals mispricing, we address the question: are analyst <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> more accurate when accompanied by cash flow forecasts than when they are not? Using propensity score matching to control for selection bias, we estimate the effect of disclosing cash flow forecasts on the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy of US stocks during 2000 – 2010. The results suggest that <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> are more accurate when analysts also disclose cash flow forecasts. The paper contributes to the continuing debate about the usefulness of analyst <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> {{as well as the}} usefulness of analyst cash flow forecasts...|$|R

We compute a measure for <b>target</b> <b>price</b> forecast accuracy that evaluates the ability of analysts to exactly forecast the exante (unknown) 12 -month stock price. Furthermore, we determine factors that explain this accuracy. <b>Target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy is negatively related to analyst-specific optimism and stock-specific risk (measured by volatility and price-to-book ratio). However, <b>target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy is positively related {{to the level of}} detail of each report, company size and the reputation of the investment bank. The potential conflicts of interests between an analyst and a covered company do not bias forecast accuracy.|$|R

Importantly, our findings are not merely a small stock phenomenon but apply to the sample of S&P 500 stocks and do not rely on trading at the exact time of announcement. Using a large database of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> announcements from 1997 to 2004, we construct a simple strategy based on <b>target</b> <b>price</b> implied relative valuations and show that the resulting abnormal return is both economically and statistically significant and not easily explained by transaction costs alone. <b>Target</b> <b>price</b> Relative valuation Return reversal...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on the usefulness of analysts’ cash flow forecasts is unsettled, with Call et al. (2009), Mohanram (2014), and Radhakrishnan and Wu (2014) providing evidence in favor of their usefulness, and Givoly et al. (2009), Bilinski (2014), and Ecker and Schipper (2014) questioning this. <b>Target</b> <b>prices</b> provide a good setting to test the usefulness of cash flow forecasts because they are an ultimate output of an analyst's valuation process to which cash flow forecasts are an input. Moreover, studying the effect of cash flow forecasts on <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> is more relevant for assessing their usefulness than is studying their effect on earnings forecast accuracy, as the accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> requires a comparison with market prices, which are less subject to management influence than reported earnings. By improving an analyst's understanding of unexpected accruals and permanent earnings, a cash flow forecast can increase an analyst's <b>target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy and signal an analyst's superior forecasting ability. We examine whether, conditional on their earnings forecasts, analysts’ cash flow forecasts improve their <b>target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy. We find that when analysts issue cash flow forecasts, their <b>target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy increases. We also find that this accuracy increases with the accuracy of their cash flow forecasts. Finally, we find that this increased <b>target</b> <b>price</b> accuracy is greater for more challenging-to-value firms. Our study provides confirmatory evidence of the usefulness of analysts’ cash flow forecasts...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the nuclear}} {{meltdown}} in Fukushima Daiichi, the German parliament decided in summer 2011 to phase-out nuclear power by 2022. We investigate which influence this decision has on national and European electricity prices and on CO 2 emissions {{and to which}} extent this decision is influencing European energy policy. A model-based analysis of electricity prices and CO 2 emissions let us conclude that emissions can be kept at levels that {{are in line with}} the <b>national</b> reduction <b>targets.</b> Electricity <b>prices</b> for consumers will hardly be affected by the decision on the phase-out, whereas those for industry will increase due to the phase-out. A comparison with results from other studies shows that some model assumptions, e. g. the gas price, have a much larger influence on the electricity price than the nuclear phase-out itself. An empirical analysis reveals that the effect on the electricity prices for other European countries was only short-term but that a long-term influence of the German nuclear phase-out on the prices cannot be determined yet. We argue that for avoiding an excessive increase in costs the transformation of the German energy system requires further European coordination beyond the current level...|$|R
40|$|Conservatism in {{earnings}} {{does not have}} a direct impact on the present value of future cash flows. This paper examines whether financial analysts correctly undo the effect of accounting conservatism incorporated in their own earnings forecasts in arriving at their <b>target</b> <b>price</b> forecasts. Based on prior findings, we consider alternative valuation models/heuristics that may be used by analysts to estimate <b>target</b> <b>prices,</b> e. g. the forward P/E and the PEG ratio. Our evidence suggests that analysts fail to fully undo the effect of accounting conservatism embedded in their forecasts of earnings and earnings growth when estimating their <b>target</b> <b>price</b> forecasts. More sophisticated analysts undo the effect of conservatism {{to a greater extent than}} other analysts, although their <b>target</b> <b>price</b> forecasts also exhibit conservatism-induced bias. In contrast, the market on average appears to correctly unravel the conservatism in future earnings when pricing securities. However, for extreme levels of conservatism, our evidence suggests that the under/over-statement of <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> leads to a distortion of market prices...|$|R
40|$|Whether or not analyst {{inaccuracy}} {{related to}} intangible intensive and diversified firms {{is due to}} poorly calculated firm fundamental forecasts or behavioural factor use {{has yet to be}} considered within the literature. This thesis investigates the explanatory power of the 52 -week high, past market sentiment and rounding in explaining <b>target</b> <b>price</b> and <b>target</b> <b>price</b> errors associated with intangible intensive and diversified firms. It is hypothesised that firms with higher intangible intensiveness or which are more diversified, present a more complex valuation task for an analyst who contends with such complexity by resorting to behavioural factors. Results suggest that past market sentiment and rounding partially explain <b>target</b> <b>price</b> levels and <b>target</b> <b>price</b> errors for highly intangible intensive and diversified firms. However these results are heavily dependent upon the measurement of intangibles and firm diversification used. Notably, the 52 -week high is found not to explain either <b>target</b> <b>price</b> levels or errors in any case...|$|R

40|$|In this study, I {{propose a}} simple {{framework}} {{to examine the}} link between analysts’ <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> and their stock recommendations. I hypothesize that the favorableness of stock recommendations is positively associated with the deviation of the ratio of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> to price from the benchmark return. I employ three widely used models to proxy for the benchmark return: the CAPM, Fama and French (1993) 3 -Factor Model and Carhart (1997) 4 -Factor Model. I find results consistent with my hypothesis. Both contingency table and regression analysis support the prediction that analysts issue more favorable recommendations to stocks with a higher difference between the ratio of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> to price and the benchmark return. I further investigate whether this positive association is due to analysts’ perception about risk or mispricing. I use firm characteristics as the explanatory variables to examine how analysts incorporate them into their outputs. I find evidence that <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> are associated with growth variables {{the same way as}} recommendations are. However, I am not able to completely rule out the risk interpretation. Therefore, the mechanism underlying the link between analysts’ <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> and stock recommendations is not conclusive. </p...|$|R

40|$|The low {{reliability}} of listed companies' <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> {{is a major}} issue globally. As {{the foundation of the}} <b>target</b> <b>price,</b> the value estimate is important in the determination of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> reliability. The value estimate is the estimated intrinsic value of a company produced by the company valuation model. However, there is no individual valuation model capable of fully disclosing the intrinsic value, and the use of more than one valuation model simultaneously is a common practice. In addition, {{it is important for the}} valuation model to be consistent with the characteristics of the company. However, the existing literature offers little guidance on this valuation issue, especially on how to appropriately construct a combined valuation model based on the characteristics of the company. This study investigates the underlying reasons for the low {{reliability of}} listed companies' value estimates and <b>target</b> <b>prices,</b> and attempts to improve their reliability via the enhanced company valuation method. In particular, the study focuses on the industry based combined valuation models and their application to the valuations of listed companies from different industries. The study begins with the estimation of discount rate for each selected firm, and then applies the industry based individual and combined models to generate value estimates for each firm, followed by the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> setting process to determine the most reasonable <b>target</b> <b>price.</b> The improved reliability test techniques will be used to measure the performance of value estimates, <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> and the financial analysts' <b>target</b> <b>prices,</b> so that the best individual and combined valuation models for different industries can be identified. This study has produced several important findings. The results show that the reliability of the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> is determined by the value estimate and the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> setting process. The reliability of the value estimate is influenced by the data and valuation method. The results also show that absolute valuation models have significant advantages in emerging industries such as biotechnology. The relative valuation models exhibit good performance in the traditional industries such as technology hardware. The forward valuation models are suitable for stable industries such as insurance with accurate forecasts. The trailing valuation models have apparent advantages in unstable industries such as securities with great uncertainty. The results also show that the combined valuation models have significant advantages over the individual valuation models. The mixed combined valuation models are preferred in practice...|$|R

I investigate whether error in <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> is attributable to separable, inde-pendent error in earnings forecasts and PE ratios, or whether PE ratios are unbiased and <b>target</b> <b>price</b> error is simply a mechanical function of variation in earnings forecasts. Using a novel methodology, I decompose <b>target</b> <b>price</b> error into PE-attributable and earnings-attributable components, generate an estimate from this of actual PE ratio error measured in multiples and investigate the variation in this PE ratio error over time and in the cross section. I find that a large proportion of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> error is attributable to error in PE ratio forecasts. I find that over time, the PE ratio error of the analyst community as a whole is driven by changes in stock returns that are unforseen by analysts. I find that overestimation of the PE ratio in the cross-section increases in optimism that is relatively long-term, decreases in optimism that is relatively short-term and increases in contemporaneous stock returns, {{as a result of the}} high returns earned by value stocks that trade at low PE ratios.

40|$|Background and Problem: Pricing {{has begun}} to gain more {{interest}} in the management account-ing field, where cost management earlier has been in focus. The use of price during the develop-ment of new products is a concern which there is divergent opinions about. The establishment of an early <b>target</b> <b>price</b> is a well known practice in new product development in the manufacturing industry. With which types of processes this <b>target</b> <b>price</b> enters into the new product develop-ment process and how the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> is set are not entirely clear from the literature, though. Aim of the Study: This thesis has explored which aspects business-to-business companies con-sider in their pricing of new products. The thesis has also explored how these aspects interact in {{the determination of the}} <b>target</b> <b>price</b> in the new product development process, and how the final price to the individual customer is reached. Methodology: The empirical data is obtained via semi-structured interviews conducted and rec-orded on site at three large Swedish manufacturing companies. The case companies were chosen out of criterion regarding size, product line range and that they produce somehow standardized products. Analysis and Conclusion: The thesis finds that the case companies allow the <b>target</b> <b>price</b> to emerge throughout the new product development process and that it is influenced by three main aspects; competitors, costs and customers, which integrate during the process. The price is dy-namic in the process and none of the companies had an exact <b>target</b> <b>price</b> established in the first phases.
