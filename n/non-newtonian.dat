5|$|Rubin's {{calculations}} {{showed that}} galaxies must contain {{at least five}} to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter. Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades, {{and became the first}} persuasive results supporting the theory of dark matter, initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, and images of gravitational lensing. Her research also prompted a theory of <b>non-Newtonian</b> gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.|$|E
25|$|For some fluids, {{viscosity}} is {{a constant}} {{over a wide range}} of shear rates (Newtonian fluids). The fluids without a constant viscosity (<b>non-Newtonian</b> fluids) cannot be described by a single number. <b>Non-Newtonian</b> fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.|$|E

25|$|As shown below, {{the problem}} also {{conforms}} to Jean Le Rond D'Alembert's <b>non-Newtonian</b> {{first and second}} Principles and to the nonlinear -body problem algorithm, the latter allowing for a closed form solution for calculating those interactive forces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-Newtonian</b> fluids {{have a more}} complicated, {{non-linear}} stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of rheology {{describes the}} stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include emulsions and slurries, some viscoelastic materials such as blood and some polymers, and sticky liquids such as latex, honey and lubricants.|$|E
25|$|However, in the {{presence}} of couple-stresses, i.e. moments per unit volume, the stress tensor is non-symmetric. This also is the case when the Knudsen number is close to one, , or the continuum is a <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluid, which can lead to rotationally non-invariant fluids, such as polymers.|$|E
25|$|Solids, liquids, and gases have stress fields. Static fluids support {{normal stress}} but will flow under shear stress. Moving viscous fluids can support shear stress (dynamic pressure). Solids can support both shear and normal stress, with ductile {{materials}} failing under shear and brittle materials failing under normal stress. All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress-related properties, and <b>non-Newtonian</b> materials have rate-dependent variations.|$|E
25|$|Using CAE programs, a {{mechanical}} design team can quickly and cheaply iterate {{the design process}} to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing {{hundreds or thousands of}} designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or <b>non-Newtonian</b> flows.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that while}} bound orbits {{of a point}} mass or a spherical body with a Newtonian {{gravitational}} field are closed ellipses, which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely, any non-spherical or <b>non-Newtonian</b> effects (such as caused by the slight oblateness of the Earth, or by relativistic effects, thereby changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance) will cause the orbit's shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of Newtonian two-body motion. The two-body solutions were published by Newton in Principia in 1687. In 1912, Karl Fritiof Sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the three-body problem; however, it converges too slowly to be of much use. Except for special cases like the Lagrangian points, no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds number can {{be defined}} for several {{different}} situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface. These definitions generally include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension {{is a matter of}} conventionnbsp&– for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.|$|E
25|$|The use of zero-point {{energy for}} space travel is highly speculative. A {{complete}} quantum theory of gravitation (that {{would deal with}} the role of quantum phenomena like zero-point energy) does not exist. Speculative papers explaining a relationship between zero-point energy and gravitational shielding effects have been proposed,Cu3O7−y Superconductor with Composite Crystal Structure|date=2001|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0108005.pdf}} but the interaction (if any) is not yet fully understood. Most serious scientific research in this area depends on the theorized anti-gravitational properties of antimatter (currently being tested at the alpha experiment at CERN) and/or the effects of <b>non-Newtonian</b> forces such as the gravitomagnetic field under specific quantum conditions. According to the general theory of relativity, rotating matter can generate a new force of nature, known as the gravitomagnetic interaction, whose intensity is proportional to the rate of spin. In certain conditions the gravitomagnetic field can be repulsive. In neutrons stars for example it can produce a gravitational analogue of the Meissner effect, but the force produced in such an example is theorized to be exceedingly weak.|$|E

500|$|There are {{forces that}} are frame dependent, meaning that they appear due to the {{adoption}} of <b>non-Newtonian</b> (that is, non-inertial) reference frames. Such forces include the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force. These forces are considered fictitious because they do not exist in frames of reference that are not accelerating.

2500|$|Ketchup is a <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluid {{meaning that}} its {{viscosity}} changes under stress {{and is not}} constant. It is a shear thinning fluid which means its viscosity decreases with increased shear stress. The equation used to designate a <b>Non-Newtonian</b> fluid is as follows: [...] This equation represents apparent viscosity where apparent viscosity is the shear stress divided by shear rate. Viscosity is dependent on stress. This is apparent when you shake a bottle of tomato sauce/ketchup so it becomes liquid enough to squirt out. Its viscosity decreased with stress.|$|E

50|$|A <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluid is a fluid {{that does}} not follow Newton's Law of Viscosity. Most commonly, the {{viscosity}} (the measure of a fluid's ability to resist gradual deformation by shear or tensile stresses) of <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history. Some <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluids with shear-independent viscosity, however, still exhibit normal stress-differences or other <b>non-Newtonian</b> behavior.

50|$|A <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluid is a fluid whose flow {{properties}} differ {{in any way}} from those of Newtonian fluids.

Many salt solutions and molten polymers are <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluids, as are many commonly found substances such as ketchup, custard, toothpaste, starch suspensions, paint, blood, and shampoo. In a Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is linear, passing through the origin, the constant of proportionality being the coefficient of viscosity. In a <b>non-Newtonian</b> fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is different, and can even be time-dependent.
