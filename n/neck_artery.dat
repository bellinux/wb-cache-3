40|$|Abstract- A {{robotic system}} with force {{feedback}} for micro-surgery is developed (named “Microhand”). The system designed {{is based on}} a master-slave operation mode. The slave manipulators are designed by using macro-micro frames. The PHANToM Desktop developed by the SensaAble Technology Company is used as the master device. The interactive force/torque information of the slave manipulators and the surgical environments measured by the six-dimension force/torque sensors are fed back to the master device, so that the system is capable of providing force feedback to the surgeon during operations. The validity of the system has been proved through animal experiments of vas suturing a rabbit’s 3 mm in diameter <b>neck</b> <b>artery</b> and its 1 mm in diameter leg artery.

40|$|Ectopic {{internal}} {{carotid artery}} (ICA) is a very rare variation. The major congenital abnormalities of the ICA can be classified as agenesis, aplasia and hypoplasia, {{and they can be}} unilateral or bilateral. Anomalies of the <b>neck</b> <b>artery</b> may be vascular neoplasms or ectopic position. Carotid angiograms provide absolute confirmation of an aberrant carotid artery, while EcoColorDoppler (ECD) gives also important information about the evaluation of carotid vassels. Nevertheless Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the neck provide spatial information about the adjacent pharyngeal anatomy and are less invasive than angiogram. Injuries to the ICA during simple pharyngeal surgical procedures can be catastrophic due to the risk of massive bleeding. We report a case of a 56 year-old male patient suffering from dysphagia associated with aberrant ICA manifesting itself as a pulsative protruding of the left lateral wall of the oropharynx...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasound of the <b>neck</b> <b>arteries</b> is a reliable, noninvasive {{and safe}} investigation. It enables the {{evaluation}} of atherosclerosis in the primary prevention of vascular diseases and has an even more {{important role in the}} secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. A quarter of ischemic infarctions can be explained by hemodynamically important carotid stenosis and subsequent thrombembolism. Patients with a hemodynamically important carotid stenosis have a bad prognosis which changes dramatically if they receive surgical, endovascular or even intensive drug treatment. Due to time and human resource limitations we can not perform ultrasound of the <b>neck</b> <b>arteries</b> in the entire population. Patients who need urgent investigation are lost in the crowd of other not so urgent patients, and therefore we wrote the present guidelines. Carotid ultrasound is an urgent investigation for most symptomatic patients – ABCD score enables evaluation of emergency.

30|$|Unlike humans, sheep have an {{arterial}} structure (rete mirabile) {{consisting of}} a complex net of arteries close to the major <b>neck</b> <b>arteries.</b> This structure is visible in the early PET images, for instance, in S 24 in Fig. 5 (indicated by a green arrow). In contrast, this structure is not visible in the TOF-MRA data. This is most likely because the TOF-MRA method is only sensitive to blood flowing into the imaging slab with a relatively high velocity. Therefore, the blood in this structure may bias quantification by uncorrected spill-over effects in PET.

30|$|Extracranial {{dissection}} of the <b>neck</b> <b>arteries,</b> symptomatic or not, {{may occur}} as a complication of FMD lesions [4, 32]. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} establish a final diagnosis of FMD. In our experience, out of 64 patients with FMD, {{more than half of the}} cervico-encephalic artery dissections were discovered unexpectedly (unpublished data). Spontaneous dissection of a cervical artery is a frequent cause of stroke in young adults and may be associated with FMD in 15 – 20  % of cases [33, 34]. For this reason, physicians should consider FMD in patients with cervico-encephalic artery dissection, particularly if it is spontaneous, multifocal or in an atypical location. This situation should lead to further exploration of the renal arteries. The same approach could be proposed in case of a pseudoaneurysm that might correspond to the aftermath of a dissection.|$|R

The pull on the knot {{at the end of the}} drop levers the jaw and head violently up and to the right, which combines with the jerk of the rope becoming taut to wrench the upper neck vertebrae apart. This produces very rapid death, whereas the traditional position beneath the ear was intended to result in the mass of the knot crushing closed (occluding) the <b>neck</b> <b>arteries,</b> causing cessation of brain circulation.

Thus, a decreased level of embryonic RA (through genetic and/or nutritional causes) could represent a major modifier of the expressivity of human 22 q 11 del-associated DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndromes and, if severe enough, could on its own lead to the clinical features of the DiGeorge syndrome...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to create a computer simulation of the chemical agent injection in the head and <b>neck</b> <b>arteries</b> to investigate the distribution and concentration of the chemical. Methods Realistic three dimensional patient specific geometry was created from image scan data. Pulsatile blood flow, turbulence, the chemical agent injection via a catheter, and the mixture between blood and the chemical were then simulated through the arterial network by computational fluid dynamics software. Results The results show a consistent chemical distribution throughout all the arteries and this is ineffective. In addition, due to high wall shear stress and turbulence at the inner bifurcation wall, serious complications during the treatment could occur, for instance haemolysis or thrombosis. Conclusions The modelled catheter position is insufficient to provide a high chemical agent concentration in the desired tumour feeding artery, which is vital for therapy success. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{selection}} {{of cases of}} direct cannulation in surgery for type A dissection We {{would like to thank}} Sami and colleagues for their comments on our manuscript. We also used carbon dioxide field flooding in all cases, for cerebral embolism prevention. We did not reduce the blood pressure by fibrillation because it decreases to 30 – 40 mm Hg in less than 10 seconds, and does not need extra measures. Further, when the blood pressure reduces, the true lumen can be picked up easily. We do not ventilate the patients with 100 % oxygen before draining the blood from the heart, nor place ice bags around the patient’s head. We infrequently experienced an exces-sive leak around the cannula. In many cases, by pinch-ing with our fingers, we could assess the condition of the aortic wall and avoid heavily diseased areas.

40|$|Background—Reopening of an {{occluded}} internal {{carotid artery}} (ICA) is often seen in dissections but only rarely occurs in atherothrombotic occlusion of the {{internal carotid artery}}. Case Description—A 60 -year-old man suffered a minor stroke with dysphasia in March 1995. Color-coded duplex ultrasonography of his <b>neck</b> <b>arteries</b> revealed a left ICA occlusion. He was placed on a regimen of aspirin and followed up clinically and with ultrasonography. At follow-up 18 months later, the patient was asymptomatic. On duplex ultrasonography his left occluded ICA {{was found to be}} reopened, with a residual, proximal, high-grade stenosis. However, intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a persistent ICA occlusion and a vas vasorum originating from the carotid bulb and draining into the ICA distal to the occlusion. Conclusions—The rare collateralization of an occluded ICA by vasa vasorum seems to take several months. It can be a pitfall in the ultrasound diagnosis of carotid artery occlusive disease.

50|$|The {{uniqueness}} of Iizasa's Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū is still evident today, {{in the particular}} aspects of weapon-wielding, posture, stance, and foot and body movements which make allowance {{for the fact that}} the bushi (classical samurai warriors) of his era would be wearing 'yoroi' (armour) weighing around 35 kg, and fighting on uneven terrain. These factors tend to keep the wearer's feet firmly and flat on the ground, and slow down mobility considerably. The distinctive techniques and tactics of this ryū also acknowledge the design of classical Japanese armour, which, although protecting the wearer well, had many 'suki' (openings). The main attacking areas included: under the wrists; inside and behind the legs; the hip area; the space between the 'kabuto' (helmet) and 'do' (chest protector) where the <b>neck</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins could be easily severed. The signature, 'omote' (basic-battlefield) sword technique of the ryū, 'makiuchi-jodan', was created by Iizasa because the bushi could not raise the sword above the head, due to the obstruction of the kabuto, and secondly, notwithstanding that restriction, a very powerful 'chopping' blow from above was still needed to be generated in order to produce the maximum destructive force for when circumstances dictated attacking areas of the 'yoroi' other than the 'suki'.|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The raw data of 34 studies were simultaneously reconstructed with FBP, HIR (iDose(4), Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands), and with a prototype version of a MIR algorithm (IMR, Philips Healthcare). Objective (contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR], vascular contrast, automatic vessel analysis [AVA], stenosis grade) and subjective image quality (ranking at level of the circle of Willis, carotid bifurcation, and shoulder) of the five reconstructions were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: Vascular contrast was significantly higher in both the circle of Willis and carotid bifurcation with both levels of MIR {{compared to the other}} reconstruction methods (all p 0. 33). AVA showed most complete carotids in both MIR-levels, followed by high HIR (p> 0. 08), mid HIR (p CONCLUSION: Objectively, MIR significantly improved the overall image quality, reduced image noise, and improved automated vessel analysis, whereas FBP showed the lowest objective image quality.
