5|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play the backing tracks singing <b>nonsense</b> syllables to himself, then taking them and forming them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his vocal-based {{recordings}} of the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Another related form of {{experiment}} is the double-task experiment, {{in which a}} subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating <b>nonsense</b> syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind {{of experiment}} {{has been used to}} investigate the use of working memory in language processing.|$|E
5|$|Scientists in Oslo reacted {{strongly}} to Reich's work on bions, deriding it as <b>nonsense.</b> Tidens Tegn, a leading liberal newspaper, {{launched a campaign}} against him in 1937, supported by scientists and other newspapers. Between March and December 1938, more than 165 articles or letters appeared in 13 Norwegian newspapers denouncing him.|$|E
5|$|Fielding drew {{inspiration}} from many literary sources and traditions {{as well as from}} his own life. The structure and plot of The Author's Farce {{are similar to those of}} George Farquhar's Love and a Bottle (1698), in that both plays describe the relationship between an author and his landlady. The plays only deal with the same generalised idea however; the particulars of each are different. Fielding also drew on the Scriblerus Club's use of satire and the humour common to traditional Restoration and Augustan drama. Many of Luckless's situations are similar to those found within various traditional British dramas, including Buckingham's The Rehearsal (1672), a satirical play about staging a play. It is possible that Pope's Dunciad Variorum, published on 13 March 1729, influenced the themes of the play and the plot of the puppet show. The Court of <b>Nonsense</b> in the puppet show are related to the Court of Dulness in The Dunciad and the Court of <b>Nonsense</b> in John Dryden's Mac Flecknoe. The Scriblerus Club style of humour as a whole influences The Author's Farce, and it is possible that Fielding borrowed from Gay's Three Hours after Marriage (1717) and The Beggar's Opera (1728). In turn, Fielding's play influenced later Scriblerus Club works, especially Pope's fourth book of his revised Dunciad and possibly Gay's The Rehearsal at Goatham.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He {{developed}} dementia, {{and became}} completely blind and increasingly deaf. He {{was incapable of}} knowing or understanding either that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke <b>nonsense</b> for 58 hours, {{and for the last}} few weeks of his life was unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38pm on 29 January 1820, six days {{after the death of his}} fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him. George III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|Satyajit Ray's ancestry can {{be traced}} back for at least ten generations. Ray's grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray was a writer, illustrator, philosopher, publisher, amateur {{astronomer}} and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and social movement in nineteenth century Bengal. He also set up a printing press by the name of U. Ray and Sons, which formed a crucial backdrop to Satyajit's life. Sukumar Ray, Upendrakishore's son and father of Satyajit, was a pioneering Bengali writer of <b>nonsense</b> rhyme (abol tabol) and children's literature, an illustrator and a critic. Ray was born to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta.|$|E
5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents were white, and the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with this horse. It is a <b>nonsense</b> mutation on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented skin and hair, which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat. Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable.|$|E
5|$|We {{received}} daily e-mails with feedback {{that was}} concise, unambiguous and occasionally entertaining. She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, {{and it was}} clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, and there was no place to hide... First it felt like doing <b>nonsense,</b> then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with <b>nonsense,</b> carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of <b>nonsense</b> verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E
5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was <b>nonsense.</b> Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. <b>Nonsense!</b> They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common <b>Nonsense,</b> and pointed out the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question was exactly the same as that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.|$|E
5|$|The exosome is {{involved}} in the degradation and processing {{of a wide variety of}} RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it {{is involved}} in the turn-over of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the <b>nonsense</b> mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the nucleolus is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often <b>nonsense</b> mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or <b>nonsense</b> (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
5|$|In vocal music, noisy <b>nonsense</b> syllables {{were used}} to imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before Clément Janequin made these devices famous in his {{programmatic}} chanson La bataille (The Battle) in 1528. Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by Engelbert Humperdinck, in {{the first version of}} his melodrama, Königskinder. This style of performance {{is believed to have been}} used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by Arnold Schoenberg, who introduced it for solo voices in his Gurrelieder (1900–11), Pierrot Lunaire (1913), and the opera Moses und Aron (1930–32), and for chorus in Die Glückliche Hand (1910–13). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten (in Death in Venice, 1973), Mauricio Kagel, and Wolfgang Rihm (in his opera Jakob Lenz, 1977–78, amongst other works). A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was Rex Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady. Another form of unpitched vocal music is the speaking chorus, prominently represented by Ernst Toch's 1930 Geographical Fugue, an example of the Gebrauchsmusik fashionable in Germany at that time.|$|E
5|$|The tall flint {{tower of}} StMichael's at Ocklynge {{is one of}} Eastbourne's landmarks. The church was consecrated in 1902 and built {{on the site of}} the mission hall where the <b>nonsense</b> writer Lewis Carroll (the clergyman CL Dodgson) is known to have preached during his {{holidays}} in the town. All Souls, in Italian style, is a finely proportioned building with an Evangelical church tradition. Holy Trinity also has a strong history of Evangelism, particularly during the early 20th century when Canon Stephen Warner was the vicar for 28 years. There is a Greek Orthodox Church converted from a 19th-century Calvinistic chapel. The Strict Baptist Chapel in Grove Road is an interesting building, despite its rather grim street frontage. The United Reformed Church in Upperton Road has tall rogue Gothic windows set in red brick walls. Several other denominations have similarly interesting church buildings, including some of 20th century design, such as the Baptist Church in Eldon Road. The copyrights of many well-known hymns used in the English-speaking world are handled by Kingway's Thankyou Music of Eastbourne. There is a tradition of Judaism in Eastbourne, and a Jewish rest home. The Islamic community uses a small mosque that was formerly the Seeboard social club.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{fight their}} way through Roman′s men, {{reaching}} an underground chamber where Nate believes the statue is buried. Meanwhile, Eddy, consumed by paranoia, warns Roman that an unearthly force has been killing off his men, which the former dismisses as <b>nonsense.</b> Nate investigates the chamber but not before he gets separated from Sully via a booby-trapped secret doorway. Unfortunately, Nate and Elena, after deciding to carry on without Sully, find not the statue but Drake's corpse, with whom he sadly leaves the ring (believing he never found the sarcophagus). A group of zombie-like creatures swarm him and his companions, including Eddy and his bodyguard. In the chaos that follows, Eddy and his man are killed. Nate and Elena press on and find themselves in an old Nazi submarine base built into the island. Looking for a way out, Nate finds a letter written by Drake exposing the truth: El Dorado is protected by a curse that turned both the Spanish colonists and the German soldiers into monsters. Drake sought to destroy it, but the creatures killed him before he could; a picture reveals that Drake's corpse {{was in front of}} the statue before it was moved by the Germans.|$|E

25|$|A {{statistical}} learning mechanism {{has also}} been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and Smith conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard <b>nonsense</b> words. Each <b>nonsense</b> word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each participant was presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the <b>nonsense</b> word associated {{with one of those}} objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times {{over the course of the}} training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a <b>nonsense</b> word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.|$|E
