40|$|New powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) disk superalloys, such as ME 3, LSHR, and Alloy 10, {{have been developed}} in recent years which enable rim temperatures in turbine disk applications to approach 1300 F. Before these alloys can be utilized at 1300 F their long term durability must be ensured. One of the key requirements for disk rims is <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength. This issue is extremely important and {{is a direct result}} of the blade attachment geometry employed at the disk rim. Further, the imposition of a dwell at maximum load, associated with take off and landing, can also affect <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength. For these reasons a study has been undertaken to assess the notch dwell fatigue strength of a modern PM disk alloy through spin pit evaluation of a prototypical disk. The first element of this program involves screening potential heat treatments with respect to <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength at 1300 F utilizing a conventional <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> specimen with a stress concentration factor (K(sub t)) of 2 and a 90 sec dwell at peak load. The results of this effort are reported in this paper including the downselect of an optimal heat treatment, from a <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> standpoint...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} fatigue {{characterization of}} Alloy 10, a high strength nickel-based disk alloy, {{was conducted on}} test coupons machined from a 'pancake' forging. Smooth bar, strain controlled fatigue testing at various R-ratios was run at representative bore, 750 F, and rim, 1300 F, temperatures. This was followed by <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> testing (Kt= 2) run under load control. Analysis of the fatigue data using a Smith-Watson-Topper approach and finite element analysis of the notch root was employed to understand material behavior in these tests. Smooth bar fatigue data showed a significant R-ratio dependence at either test temperature which could be accounted for using a Smith-Watson-Topper parameter (SWT). In general, fatigue life was longer at 750 F than 1300 F for a given SWT. For <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests, life was longer at 750 F than 1300 F but only at higher stresses. This was attributed to differences in alloy strength. At lower stresses, finite element analysis suggested that convergence of fatigue life at both temperatures resulted from relaxation of stresses at the notch root in the 1300 F tests...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{shot peening}} (SP) on <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{strength}} of the high-strength wrought magnesium alloy AZ 80 has been investigated by using different SP media (including glass, Zirblast B 30 and Ce-ZrO 2 (ZrO 2 stabilized by Ce) shots) and various Almen intensities. The results showed that shot peening improved the <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength of AZ 80 more effectively than the un-notched <b>fatigue</b> strength. The <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength of AZ 80 increased from 45 to 110 MPa after optimum shot peening, regardless of particular peening media. Optimum SP conditions were obtained at high Almen intensities, implying that surface defects and high roughness induced by heavier SP played a tiny role on the <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength of AZ 80. Fatigue crack initiated {{on the surface of}} shot-peened specimens due to high stress concentration at notch root. Short cracks were observed in run-out shot-peened specimens, indicating that the beneficial effect of SP on <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength of AZ 80 was mainly caused by the compressive residual stresses, which can effectively retard/or even arrest the fatigue cracks...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} the multiaxial fatigue limit {{estimation}} of sharply notched components has been addressed using two different methods: a critical distance method and a method involving modified Wöhler curves. These two methods had been previously developed by the authors, but required modification for use in conjunction with finite element stress analysis of sharply-notched specimens subjected to multiaxial loadings. Initially, it was demonstrated mathematically that these methods are equivalent in terms of multiaxial stresses near the notch tip. Subsequently, by employing some well-known uniaxial <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> concepts, some assumptions have been made in order to extend the use of these methods to in-phase multiaxial <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> situations. Experimental data was obtained from tests conducted on V-notched specimens subjected to in-phase mixed MODE I and MODE II loadings.

LENM is based on fundamental analytical results and definitions introduced by Williams and Gross and Mendelson.

40|$|This work focusses on {{the problem}} of {{predicting}} the fatigue strength of engineering components where the geometry and stress distribution differ from conventional <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> test specimens. The traditional approach based on the use of a net section nominal stress is therefore difficult to apply. The use of estimated local surface stresses and strains can lead to misleading and often highly erroneous predictions of the fatigue strength at high (107) cycles, particularly for components manufactured in cast iron, since this type of material exhibits a relatively high <b>notch</b> insensitivity in <b>fatigue</b> tests.;The work is of a theoretical nature, but makes use of the availability of a significant quantity of recent experimental data on cast iron test specimens of various grades, geometries and loading conditions. An approach based on the calculation of the condition for crack arrest has been investigated as a means of predicting fatigue strength. The finite element method has been used to help calculate the range of stress intensity factor (K) values for cracks in <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> specimens of various geometries. The K value at a number of different crack sizes is compared with the apparent short crack threshold value. If the K value for a growing crack becomes less than the threshold value (Kth) then the crack is assumed to arrest.;Comparisons between the predicted strengths and the estimated values from the test data show that a crack growth assessment procedure based on a continuous surface crack geometry at the notch root gives a reasonable approximation to the data and can account for the effects of geometry, stress distribution and mean stress. The inclusion of a short crack model makes the procedure particularly relevant to assessments of cast iron components, however, limited comparisons with notched data for other materials were also favourable...|$|R

The investigated materials were: Distaloy AE, Distaloy DC, Distaloy HP, Fe + 2, 0 % Cu + 0, 8 % C, Astaloy Mo, and Astaloy CrL. All materials were pressed to a green density of 7, 05 - 7, 10 g/cm 3 and sintered 30 min at 1120 deg C. CrL was also sintered at 1250 deg C. The results showed that the heterogeneous materials (Distaloys and FeCuC) showed low notch sensitivity, q= 0, 6 - 0, 8 and that the homogeneous materials (Astaloys) showed notch sensitivities in the range q= 0, 6 - 1.

To test this concept, a fatigue crack was grown in a mode-I single-edge <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> crack growth specimen containing sensory particles. As the crack approached the sen-sory particles, measurements of particle strain, matrix-particle debonding, and phase transformation behavior of the sensory particles were performed. Full-field deformation measurements were performed using a novel multi-scale optical 3 D digital im-age correlation (DIC) system. This information {{will be used in}} a finite element-based study to determine optimal sensory material behavior and density. ...|$|E
40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} in the present paper that cavitation peening {{which is one of}} the mechanical surface modification technique can suppress fatigue crack propagation in duralumin. The impacts produced when cavitation bubble collapses can be utilised for the mechanical surface modification technique in the same way as laser peening and shot peening, which is called “cavitation peening”. Cavitation peening employing a cavitating jet in water was used to treat the specimen made of duralumin Japanese Industrial Standards JIS A 2017 -T 3. After introducing a <b>notch,</b> <b>fatigue</b> test was conducted by a load-controlled plate bending fatigue tester, which has been originally developed. The fatigue crack propagation behavior was evaluated and the relationship between the fatigue crack propagation rate versus stress intensity factor range was obtained. From the results, the fatigue crack propagation rate was drastically reduced by cavitation peening and the fatigue life of duralumin plate was extended 4. 2 times by cavitation peening. In addition, the fatigue crack propagation can be suppressed by 88 % in the stable crack propagation stage by cavitation peening...|$|E
40|$|Journal articleThis paper {{presents}} a novel multiaxial, cyclic viscoplasticity material model for high temperature {{low cycle fatigue}} of P 91 power plant steel. The model incorporates mechanisms-based variable strain-rate sensitivity and the key high temperature cyclic deformation phenomena of cyclic softening and non-linear kinematic hardening. The model has been calibrated to accurately represent the cyclic high temperature constitutive behaviour of âas receivedâ P 91 steel. Details on the material Jacobian, with the consistent tangent stiffness for finite element implementation, are presented. The multiaxial implementation is applied to a notched specimen under strain-controlled loading at 600 Â°C and a thin walled pipe under representative pressurised thermomechanical fatigue loading conditions. It is shown that the model for variable strain-rate sensitivity of the present paper predicts significantly different Coffin-Manson <b>notch</b> <b>fatigue</b> life compared to the Chaboche power law model. Ratchetting is {{shown to be a}} key candidate failure mechanism for next generation thermomechanical power plant loading conditions, for thin walled pressurised pipes.

40|$|The {{influence}} of shot peening (SP) on {{high cycle fatigue}} (HCF) performance of smooth and notched specimens of hot-extruded ZK 60 magnesium alloy was investigated and {{compared to that of}} hot-extruded and T 5 aging-treated ZK 60 magnesium alloy referred to as ZK 60 -T 5. The increases in fatigue properties at the optimum Almen intensities were found to depend on the material states. In contrast to ZK 60 alloy, higher smooth and <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> properties for both unpeened and peened specimens were observed for ZK 60 -T 5 alloy. Meanwhile, the improvement of <b>fatigue</b> life for <b>notched</b> specimen by SP was much more than that for the smooth specimen. The mechanism by which the compressive residual stress induced by SP resulted in the improvement of fatigue performance of smooth and notched specimens for ZK 60 and ZK 60 -T 5 alloys was discussed. © 2010 Materials Research Society...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program called TFLIFE is described {{which can be}} used to predict the thermal fatigue life of metals and structural components from conventional metal properties. This program is used as a subroutine with a main program supplied by the user. The main program calculates input cycles of temperature and total strain for TFLIFE which then calculates a stress cycle, creep and plastic strain damage, and cyclic life. A unique feature of TFLIFE is that it calculates lives according to several different failure criteria for the same input data. These criteria are surface crack initiation, interior crack initiation, and complete fracture of both unnotched and <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> specimens. Results are presented for two typical problems: thermal-mechanical fatigue of bar specimens of the tantalum alloy T- 111 and thermal-stress fatigue of wedge specimens of the nickel alloy B- 1900. The {{computer program}} is now ready for more extensive evaluation on structural components and additional laboratory specimens...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} <b>notched</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{strength of the}} CMSX- 4 single crystal superalloy has been experimentally investigated. Notched specimens with orientation have been tested at 950 °C in load control in the LCF life regime. SEM observations of the failed specimens {{has been made in}} order to associate the actual crack initiation location in the notch to the crystallographic orientation and to the critical location in the notch as given by suitable multiaxial fatigue parameters. In order to model the material behavior in the notch, stress-strain analysis of the notched specimens was performed by an elastic-plastic FEM procedure; the parameters describing the material behavior of the single crystal superalloy have been identified by comparison with experimentally determined stress- strain fatigue behavior of smooth specimens. A suitable model for the assessment of the fatigue life of single crystal materials is proposed for the purpose of application to the design of turbine engines components...|$|R
