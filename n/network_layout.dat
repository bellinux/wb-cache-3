50|$|Network {{architecture}} {{encompasses the}} entire framework of an organization's computer network, including hardware components {{that are used}} for communication, <b>network</b> <b>layout</b> and topologies, physical and wireless connections, and cabling and device types, as well as software rules and protocols. The core and aggregation layers of a traditional three-tier, hierarchical model provide built-in redundancy, but this design can be inefficient for virtualized environments.

50|$|Dynamic wave routing {{can account}} for channel storage, backwater, entrance/exit losses, flow reversal, and {{pressurized}} flow. Because it couples together the solution for both water levels at nodes and flow in conduits it {{can be applied to}} any general <b>network</b> <b>layout,</b> even those containing multiple downstream diversions and loops. It is the method of choice for systems subjected to significant backwater effects due to downstream flow restrictions and with flow regulation via weirs and orifices. This generality comes at a price of having to use much smaller time steps, on the order of a minute or less (SWMM can automatically reduce the user-defined maximum time step as needed to maintain numerical stability).|$|E
5000|$|The basic [...] "skeleton" [...] of {{the network}} is {{developed}} by imposing on it the strongest links which were not necessarily in the MST by employing a threshold on the proximity values; they chose to include all links of proximity {{greater than or equal}} to 0.55. This produced a network of 775 nodes and 1525 links. This threshold was chosen such that the network exhibited an average degree equal to 4, a common convention for effective network visualizations. With the framework complete, a force-directed spring algorithm was used to achieve a more ideal <b>network</b> <b>layout.</b> This algorithm considers each node to be a charged particle and the links are assumed to be springs; the layout is the resulting equilibrium, or relaxed, position of the system.

50|$|Network {{visualization}} explores relationships, such as {{friendships and}} cliques. Three common types are force-directed layout, arc diagrams, and matrix view. Force-directed layouts {{are a common}} and intuitive approach to <b>network</b> <b>layout.</b> In this system, nodes are similar to charged particles, which repel each other. Links are used to pull related nodes together. Arc diagrams are one-dimensional layouts of nodes with circular arcs linking each node. When used properly, with good order in nodes, cliques and bridges are easily identified in this layout. Alternatively, mathematicians and computer scientists more often use matrix views. Each value has an (x,y) value in the matrix that corresponds to a node. By using color and saturation instead of text, values associated with the links can be perceived rapidly. While this method {{makes it hard to}} view the path of the nodes, there are no line crossings, which in a large and highly connected network can quickly become too cluttered.|$|E
50|$|In {{software}} engineering and computer science, abstraction {{is a technique}} for arranging complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level. The programmer works with an idealized interface (usually well defined) and can add additional levels of functionality {{that would otherwise be}} too complex to handle. For an example, a programmer writing code that involves numerical operations may not be interested in the way numbers are represented in the underlying hardware (e.g. whether they're 16 bit or 32 bit integers), and where those details have been suppressed {{it can be said that}} they were abstracted away, leaving simply numbers with which the programmer can work. In addition, a task of sending an email message across continents would be extremely complex if the programmer had to start with a piece of fiber optic cable and basic hardware components. By using layers of complexity that have been created to abstract away the physical cables and <b>network</b> <b>layout,</b> and presenting the programmer with a virtual data channel, this task is manageable.|$|E

The passenger transport hub construction will certainly attract new travel demands, producing a greater influence on <b>network</b> <b>layout.</b> In the network planning of rapidly developing intercity transportation, {{it is important to}} take both the hub location and <b>network</b> <b>layout</b> into consideration.|$|E

The most important (often used) are: Kamada-Kawai optimization, Fruchterman Reingold optimization, VOS mapping, Pivot MDS, drawing in layers, FishEye transformation. Layouts obtained by Pajek can be exported to different 2 D or 3 D output formats (e.g., SVG, EPS, X 3 D, VOSViewer, Mage,…). Special viewers and editors for these formats are available (e.g., inkscape, GSView, instantreality, KiNG,…). Using them we can further edit layouts or examine them in details.|$|R

The results demonstrate improving performance with increasing speed of rotation up to an upper limit on that speed, beyond which further increases yield no notable additional gains in sum rate or per-user rate. The clover-leaf-shaped layout gains more in performance from cluster rotation than the hexagonal-shaped one. This indicates in general that some <b>network</b> <b>layouts</b> (and their associated cluster patterns) may benefit more from cluster rotation than others.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study fault {{tolerance}} in area-universal networks and provide {{both positive and}} negative results. We present a new <b>network</b> <b>layout,</b> the mesh of ladders, which is area-universal and fault-tolerant. This network, laid out in an n n area, can simulate any other <b>network</b> <b>layout</b> laid out in the same area with O(log 4 n) slowdown, even if cn/ 2 log n blocks of size 2 log n 2 log n become faulty (for some constant c < 1). Furthermore, it can simulate any other <b>network</b> <b>layout</b> which has at most f(n) bends in each wire with slowdown O(f(n) log 2 n) even after any number of such blocks become faulty in both networks. Our results are tight, in the sense that if one of our assumptions is removed, it is no longer possible to obtain similar simulation results. We show for example that the width of a layout for a network with at least n nodes and diameter at most n 1 -# for any fixed 1 / 2 < # < 1 must be at least # n). Therefore, if faults can happen in any pattern the remaining non [...] ...|$|E

It is important to note that all implemented features and models have been devised in order to make the simulation framework compliant with 3 GPP specifications.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the design of a low-energy district heating (DH) system, concerning the studies of different pipe-dimensioning methods, substation types and <b>network</b> <b>layouts.</b> Computations were carried out separately on each of the pipe segments of which the DH network consisted. A simultaneity factor was taken account in connection with each of these pipe segments. The applicability of the developed optimization method was investigated with outcomes of its being highly useful in the pipe dimensioning and of its being superior in respect to traditional dimensioning methods. It was shown that an appreciable reduction in heat loss from the DH network could be achieved. The optimal pipe dimensions found were evaluated by use of the commercial software Termis with input of several randomly generated heat demand scenarios involving peak winter conditions. The effects of the network type on the pipe dimensions were investigated for substations of different types containing buffer tanks and heat exchangers and for booster pumps installed at the DH network. Two types of <b>network</b> <b>layouts</b> were compared in terms of satisfaction of customers concerning the supply temperatures and heat loss within the DH network to prevent excessive drops in supply temperature during the summer months...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} some algorithmic results concerning {{virtual path}} layouts for the one-to-many communication problem in ATM tree networks. The ATM network model {{is based on}} covering the <b>network</b> with a <b>layout</b> of virtual paths, under some constraints on the allowed load, namely, the number of paths that can share an edge. The quality measure used is the hop count, namely, the number of edges traversed between two vertices that need to communicate. Whereas most former results concerned the maximum hop count of the virtual path layout, our interest here is in measuring its total hop count, or alternatively its average hop count. The paper presents a dynamic programming algorithm for planning ATM <b>network</b> <b>layouts</b> with minimal total hop count for one-to-many requirements under load constraints over the class of tree networks...|$|R

Therefore LTE system is introduced by 3 GPP which promises higher throughput on mobile devices i. e. 326. 4 Mbps in downlink and 86. 4 Mbps in uplink. Theoritically LTE system promises high throughput, high bandwidth utilization, low latency, high spectral efficiency, and high peak data rates than all other 3 GPP technologies. The main motive behind this research is to analyze the LTE system performance in practical scenarios to estimate the practical system throughput and peak data rates in different situations.
