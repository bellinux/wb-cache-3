5|$|WTTG and New York's WABD (later WNEW-TV, and now WNYW) survived as Metromedia-owned independents until 1986, when Metromedia was {{purchased}} by the News Corporation to form the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the new Fox Broadcasting Company.

40|$|Using a {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} and energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer, the elemental composition <b>of</b> center <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> general and peculiar shapes of snow crystals was analyzed.

40|$|By {{adopting}} ultra-marine blue particles {{as standard}} material, a simple method for converting the X-ray intensity ratio {{in the energy}} spectra into the weight concentration ratio was developed. This method {{was applied to the}} center <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> snow crystals and airborne aerosol particles to find information on the origin <b>of</b> <b>nuclei</b> and particles. At Moshiri and Mt. Teine, the center <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> snow crystals mainly consisted of soil particles and sea salt particles, while at Yukomambetsu, they mainly consisted of soil particles and particles rich in S. From the comparison between the Si : Na : S ratios <b>of</b> the center <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> snow crystals and those of airborne aerosol particles collected at Mt. Teine, it was concluded that soil particles and sea salt particles of some size functioned as the center <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> snow crystals. In order to determine the materials <b>of</b> center <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> snow crystals in more detail, however, the relative weight fractions of the elemental compositions other than Si, Na, and S must be considered...|$|R
5|$|When the {{airborne}} establishment was expanded, No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion was renamed 1st Parachute Battalion, and eventually formed the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> 1st Parachute Brigade {{when it was}} created in September 1941.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} development {{during this}} period was {{the establishment of the}} Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James's Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old gunpowder store at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nuclei</b> <b>of</b> murine T {{lymphocytes}} or B lymphocytes were purified {{and transferred}} into lethally irradiated whole spleen cells or B or T lymphocytes {{by means of}} polyethyleneglycol-mediated cell fusion. Transfer <b>of</b> lymphocyte <b>nuclei</b> could save the irradiated cells from cell death, and such reconstituted cells could respond to mitogens. The present study showed that <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> T cells could be activated in the concanavalin A-stimulated T cell cytoplasms {{but not in the}} lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cell cytoplasms. On the other hand, <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> B cells were activated in the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells but not in the concanavalin A-stimulated T cell cytoplasms.

5|$|Formed {{for service}} during the World War II, the 2/17th Battalion was raised on 26 April 1940 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) volunteers at Ingleburn, New South Wales. With an {{authorised}} strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the 2/17th was formed around a <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– each consisting of three platoons; these {{were supported by}} a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons: signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortars.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1852 by Rabbi Abraham Ash as Beth Hamedrash, the {{congregation}} split in 1859, with the rabbi {{and most of}} the members renaming their congregation Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The congregation's president and a small number of the members eventually formed the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> Kahal Adath Jeshurun, also known as the Eldridge Street Synagogue. Rabbi Jacob Joseph, the first and only Chief Rabbi of New York City, led {{the congregation}} from 1888 to 1902. Rabbi Ephraim Oshry, one of the few European Jewish legal decisors to survive the Holocaust, led the congregation from 1952 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
40|$|The <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> {{the male}} and female gametocytes of the malarial parasites {Plasmo-dium and Hepatocystis) are Feulgen-negative, while the <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> the gametocytes of Hepatozoon, which are not sexually differentiated, are Feulgen-positive. The <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> the male gametocytes of Eimeria are {{strongly}} Feulgen-positive, while the <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> the female gametocytes are Feulgen-negative. The <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> the male gametes of Plasmodium are Feulgen-negative, while the <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> the male gametes of Eimeria are strongly Feulgen-positive. DNA appeared to be present in the gametocytes of Plas-modium when the fluorescence method of Armstrong (1956) was employed. Feulgen-positive inclusions have been found to occur in the cytoplasm of some of the oocysts of Plasmodium. The oocysts containing such inclusions may degenerate totally or partially. There is no evidence to relate this type of degeneration with the formation of Ross's black spores. These inclusions have been found in abundance in the oo'cysts of P. cynomolgi, while in those of P. gallinaceum they were found only once. Certain Feulgen-positive granules have been found in the cytoplasm of some of the oocysts and the female gametocytes of Eimeria. These granules {{did not appear to be}} related to any degenerating changes. A probable loss of some <b>of</b> the <b>nuclei</b> during sporogony <b>of</b> Eimeria is discussed. The nuclei in the early pre-erythrocytic schizonts of Plasmodium cynomolgi are Feulgen-positive, notwithstanding an earlier report to the contrary...|$|R

5|$|In 1932 and 1933, the {{scientists}} at the Cavendish Laboratory {{made a series of}} ground-breaking discoveries. Cockroft and Walton bombarded lithium with high energy protons and succeeded in transmuting it into energetic nuclei of helium. This was one of the earliest experiments to change the atomic <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> one element to another by artificial means. Then Chadwick devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the neutron. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his cloud chamber that confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron–electron pair production.|$|E

While there, it received a number of drafts of recruits and was brought up to strength.
