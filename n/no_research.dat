5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which he is going to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost <b>no</b> <b>research</b> for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{postponed}} {{the move}} to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do <b>no</b> <b>research.</b> Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, Eclogae Chronicae, from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in the United Kingdom at Bray Studios and on {{location}} at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its earlier use by Hammer Film Productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many of the kitsch science fiction and horror films, costume designer Sue Blane conducted <b>no</b> <b>research</b> for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of punk rock fashion trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.|$|E

5|$|As {{the players}} empire expands, agents and {{supervisors}} will make themselves available for employment. Agents {{are used for}} gathering intelligence on alien asteroids and can also be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter-intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased {{if there is a}} spy satellite orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony Supervisors are able to be employed to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies.

40|$|Regarding {{researches}} on Multinational Enterprises' (MNEs) cross-cultural manage-ment {{when they}} invest in foreign countries, most scholars have explored by comparing different managerial philosophies and management styles, or by discussing business and corporate ethics.

25|$|The longfin {{trevally}} is a predatory fish, {{known to}} take a variety of small fishes, cephalopods including squid, and crustaceans such as crabs and mantis shrimp.

There has been <b>no</b> <b>research</b> into their spawning patterns, although it is known juveniles inhabit shallow bays and occasionally estuaries.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid may be {{involved}} in schizophrenia; however, there has been <b>no</b> <b>research</b> done to examine the specific effects of quinolinic acid in schizophrenia.

Because quinolinic acid is strongly associated with KYNA and OHK, it may too play a role in schizophrenia.|$|E
