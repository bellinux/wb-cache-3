30|$|The {{outline of}} this study is as follows: the ‘Methods’ section {{discusses}} the AFM characterization of atomic-scale wear and <b>nanometer-scale</b> <b>mechanical</b> processing of muscovite; the ‘Results and discussion’ section concentrates on the mechanical nanoprocessing of layered crystalline structures by AFM and the bending process of graphene; and the ‘Conclusions’ section concludes with an outlook.|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic-force {{microscopy}} (UFM) {{has been}} employed {{to carry out}} <b>nanometer-scale</b> <b>mechanical</b> imaging of integrated circuit (IC) test structures comprised of 0. 32 -µm-wide aluminum interconnect lines inlaid in a low-dielectric-constant (low-k) polymer film. Such inlaid metal interconnects are typically referred to as damascene structures. UFM clearly differentiates the metal and polymer regions within this damascene IC test structure {{on the basis of}} elastic modulus with a spatial resolution 10 nm. In addition, this technique reveals an increase in the polymer elastic modulus at the metal/polymer interface. This nanometer-scale hardening corresponds to compositional modification of the polymer from the reactive ion etch (RIE) process used to form trenches in the polymer film prior to metal deposition. The reported direct, nondestructive <b>nanometer-scale</b> <b>mechanical</b> imaging of RIE-process-induced modifications of low-k polymers in IC test structures offers expanded opportunities for mechanical metrology and reliability evaluation of such materials...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} describes nano-scale fabrication {{technique used}} to create a sub-micron wide gap across the center conductor of a coplanar waveguide transmission line configured in a fixed-fixed beam arrangement, resulting in a pair of opposing cantilever beams that comprise an electro-mechanical switch. Accordingly, a <b>nanometer-scale</b> <b>mechanical</b> switch with very high switching speed and low actuation voltage has been developed. This switch is intended primarily for application in the RF/microwave/wireless industry...|$|R
25|$|Developed by Lord Kelvin, this is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} and accurate of all the <b>mechanical</b> <b>electrometers.</b> The original design uses a light aluminum sector suspended inside a drum cut into four segments. The segments are insulated and connected diagonally in pairs. The charged aluminum sector is attracted to one pair of segments and repelled from the other. The deflection is observed by a beam of light reflected from a small mirror attached to the sector, just as in a galvanometer. The engraving on the right shows a slightly different form of this electrometer, using four flat plates rather than closed segments. The plates can be connected externally in the conventional diagonal way (as shown), or in a different order for specific applications.|$|R
30|$|By taking {{advantage}} of the mechanical anisotropy of crystalline materials, processing at a single-layer level can be realized for layered crystalline materials with periodically weak bonds. Mica (muscovite), graphite, molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2), and boron nitride have layered structures, and there is little interaction between the cleavage planes existing in the basal planes of these materials. Moreover, it is easy to image the atoms on the basal plane, where the processed shape can be observed on the atomic level. This study reviews research evaluating the nanometer-scale wear and friction as well as the <b>nanometer-scale</b> <b>mechanical</b> processing of muscovite using atomic force microscopy (AFM). It also summarizes recent AFM results obtained by our research group regarding the atomic-scale mechanical processing of layered materials including mica, graphite, MoS 2, and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{detection of}} charge {{has a long}} history, dating back more than 200 years to Coulomb's torsion-balance electrometer. The modern analogues of such instruments are semiconductor-based field-effect devices, the most sensitive of which are cryogenically cooled single-electron transistors. But although these latter devices have extremely high charge sensitivity, they suffer from limited bandwidth and must be operated at millikelvin temperatures {{in order to reduce}} thermal noise. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of a working nanometre-scale <b>mechanical</b> <b>electrometer.</b> We achieve a charge sensitivity of 0. 1 e Hz^(- 0. 5), competitive with conventional semiconductor field-effect transistors; moreover, thermal noise analysis indicates that the nanometre-scale electrometer should ultimately reach sensitivities of the order of 10 ^(- 6) e Hz^(- 0. 5), comparable with charge-detection capabilities of cryogenic single-electron transistors. The nanometre-scale electrometer has the additional advantages of high temperature (≥ 4. 2 K) operation and response over a larger bandwidth, from which a diversity of applications may result...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Micromachined {{mechanical}} resonators are of considerable interest {{because of their}} many important scienti c and technological applications. They {{can be used as}} a components of radio-frequency lters in communication systems, <b>mechanical</b> <b>electrometer</b> or magnetometer for sensitive detection of force, charge, pressure. This work is directed towards the fabrication and characterization of microelectromechanical resonators, cantilevers and bridges. The SOI cantilever and the silicon nitride cantilevers and bridges are fabricated by using surface micromachining techniques. They are fabricated in the Advanced Research Laboratory of Bilkent University. The center frequencies are ranging from 20 kHz to 270 kHz. The characterization of cantilevers and bridges are done by using the beam de ection method and the ber optic interferometer method. The dynamic response of the rst devices, such as the resonance frequencies and the quality factors will be reported. In addition, simple beam theory and some fundamental loss mechanisms will be discussed. The experimental results will also be compared with the theoretical ones. Özer, SevilM. S...|$|R
40|$|NanoMEMS {{exploits}} {{the convergence}} between nanotechnology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{brought about by}} advances {{in the ability to}} fabricate <b>nanometer-scale</b> electronic and <b>mechanical</b> device structures. While the “nano ” aspect of this field is in its infancy, and is not expected to reach maturity until well into the 21 st century, its “MEMS” aspect is a topic of much current and near-term impact in, for instance, RF/Wireless communications. In this context, we discuss the fundamentals of NanoMEMS, in particular, as it relates to its most speculative and futuristic paradigms and applications, and then focus on the RF/Wireless MEMS aspect, specifically in its role as enabler of ubiquitous wireless connectivity...|$|R
40|$|Nanomedicine is the {{application}} of nanotechnology to medicine: the preservation and improvement of human health, using molecular tools and molecular knowledge of the human body. Medical nanorobotics {{is the most powerful}} form of future nanomedicine technology. Nanorobots may be constructed of diamondoid <b>nanometer-scale</b> parts and <b>mechanical</b> subsystems including onboard sensors, motors, manipulators, power plants, and molecular computers. The presence of onboard nanocomputers would allow in vivo medical nanorobots to perform numerous complex behaviors which must be conditionally executed on at least a semiautonomous basis, guided by receipt of local sensor data and constrained by preprogrammed settings, activity scripts, and event clocking, and further limited by a variety of simultaneously executing real-time control protocols. Such nanorobots cannot yet be manufactured in 2007 but preliminary scaling studies for several classes of medical nanorobots have been published in the literature. These designs are reviewed with an emphasis on the basic computational tasks required in each case, and a summation of the various major computational control functions common to all complex medical nanorobots is extracted from these design examples. Finally, we introduce the concept of nanorobot control protocols which are required to ensure that each nanorobot fully completes its intended mission accurately, safely, and in a timely manner according to plan. Six major classes of nanorobot control protocols have been identified and include operational, biocompatibility, theater, safety, security, and group protocols. Six important subclasses of theater protocols include locational, functional, situational, phenotypic, temporal, and identity control protocols...|$|R
