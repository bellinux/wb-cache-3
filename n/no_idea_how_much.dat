25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E

She furthered saying, [...] "The kids we've met have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they've given us. We wanted to record this song for them, in hopes that people would hear their voice through ours."

500|$|During 1957 Gielgud {{directed}} Berlioz's The Trojans at Covent Garden {{and played}} Prospero at Drury Lane, but the production {{central to his}} career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one-man show The Ages of Man. He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967. It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and sonnets, compiled by George Rylands, in which, wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage, Gielgud recited the verses, with his own linking commentary. He performed it all over Britain, mainland Europe, Australasia and the US, including a performance at the White House in 1965. He found there were advantages to performing solo: [...] "You've <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> easier it is without a Juliet. When there's a beautiful girl above you on a balcony, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, naturally the audience look at her the whole time, and Romeo has to pull {{out all the stops}} to get any attention." [...] His performance on Broadway won him a Special Tony Award in 1959, and an audio recording in 1979 received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. He made many other recordings, both before and after this, including ten Shakespeare plays.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{conflict}} {{with one of the}} theater's directors, who was said to have been less than careful about his hygiene, the director questioned Henriette about her bills regarding such things and she replied: [...] "It is easy to say, Mr Count, for someone with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it costs to keep oneself clean and fresh!" [...] She also writes that when she complained about men and boys trying {{to take a look at}} her when she had to change during performances, this director chased them all away, but guarded her from them by observing her himself—though, she adds, he was really quite harmless. She remained neutral during the great theater strikes of 1827 and 1834.|$|E

It was clear that there was nothing I could do to help him. The last person I remember speaking to was Jackie Weaver, who reassured me that if it were our time to go, then God’s will would be fulfilled. As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else.

6000|$|Some {{time ago}} I ventured to defend that race of hunted and persecuted outlaws, the Bishops; but until this week I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> persecuted they were. For instance, the Bishop of Birmingham made some {{extremely}} sensible remarks in the House of Lords, {{to the effect}} that Oxford and Cambridge were (as everybody knows they are) far too much merely plutocratic playgrounds. One would have thought that an Anglican Bishop might be allowed to know something about the English University system, and even to have, if anything, some bias in its favour. But (as I pointed out) the rollicking Radicalism of Bishops has to be restrained. The man who writes the notes in the weekly paper called the Outlook feels that it is his business to restrain it. The passage has such simple sublimity that I must quote it-- ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine teachers’ and principals’ attitudes towards the use of digital tools in school and how such tools are {{incorporated}} in their teaching practice. The study looks into the details of what teaching methods are used by the teachers when using digital tools. It also examines the resources available for teachers in order for them to develop their pedagogical skills in the field of digital tools. In this study, qualitative interviews were used as a method. The study shows that the interviewed teachers are both positive and negative to using different kinds of digital tools in their teaching but to different degrees. The interviews with the principals show that their knowledge of digital tools in school is limited. They do not agree whether the municipality has a policy for digital tools in schools. Moreover, and in line with this uncertainty, the interviews reveal that the principles think teachers use digital tools in their teaching, but they have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> or <b>how</b> teachers use them...|$|R

After Callum confronts his father about reneging on a deal they had, Troy snaps and refuses to let him leave his house.

Pranita revealed [...] "Jade is taking on the very protective auntie role of looking after Callum. But she also knows Callum has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of an untamed wild animal Troy is. Now, locked in the house with, she feels this is history repeating itself. Jade loathes Troy more now than she ever has." [...] The actress found the scenes were some of the toughest she has ever shot, as they were unlike the normal drama they usually filmed. She called the storyline [...] "intense" [...] and found it harder than normal to let go of it when she went home. Pranita later stated that the Troy storyline had been her most difficult storyline to film during her time on Neighbours.|$|R
2500|$|Cisneros {{was well}} praised {{for his work}} as HUD Secretary. [...] Judith Evans {{reported}} in the Washington Post that both critics and supporters of Cisneros said he never lacked passion for his job {{and that he was}} able to make changes at the margin that made HUD a more effective housing provider. Rep. Rick Lazio (R-NY), chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community opportunity in 1996 said Cisneros displayed [...] "the correct balance of advocacy on behalf of the president and a willingness to think creatively and outside the box in terms of solutions." [...] In his 1999 book, Inside Game/Outside Game: Winning Strategies for Saving Urban America, urban policy consultant David Rusk wrote “…in my view, (Cisneros was) the most successful of the ten secretaries of Housing and Urban Development since the cabinet agency was formed in 1965.” Clinton said Cisneros was a brilliant public servant, and additionally said that people had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he contributed to the government.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, artist John LeKay, {{a friend}} of Damien Hirst between 1992 and 1994, [...] was {{reported}} by Dalya Alberge of The Times to have provided ideas and inspirations {{for a variety of}} his alter works, including having given him a [...] "marked-up duplicate copy" [...] of a Carolina Biological Supply Company catalogue that LeKay had been using as inspiration and supply for his work, noting that [...] "You have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he got from this catalogue. The Cow Divided is on page 647—it is a model of a cow divided down the centre, like his piece", a reference to Hirst’s work Mother and Child, Divided, a cow and calf cut in half and placed in formaldehyde. LeKay also suggests that Hirst copied the idea of For the Love of God from his work on crystal skulls in 1993, saying, [...] "I would like Damien to acknowledge that 'John really did inspire the skull and influenced my work a lot.'" [...] Copyright lawyer Paul Tackaberry reviewed images of LeKay's and Hirst's work and saw no basis for any appropriation rising to the legal level of a copyright infringement.|$|E

It kept her awake at nights, that catastrophic explanation, that all unsuspected by Trafford hung over their attempts at mutual elucidation; it kept her awake but she could not bring it to the speaking point, and she clung, in spite of her own intelligence, to a persuasion that after they had got something really settled and defined then it would be time enough to broach the particulars of this second divergence....|$|R
