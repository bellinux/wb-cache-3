Other notable works by Cho include , a seemingly non-political love poem which was later adapted as a popular song that is known in both <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{with the}} European Union in 2014 have {{increased}} both unions to pressure post-Soviet states {{to join their}} integration unions. Both sides have accused each other of carving spheres of influence. Members of the union, especially Russia have tried to diversify their trade by signing economic agreements with China, Iran and Turkey. Trade with <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea</b> has also risen.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnam's {{victory over}} the South led to a {{considerable}} shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its {{interests in the region}} on two occasions, once when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea.</b>|$|E

However, the members of IRIS are intent on {{stopping}} the reunification. They attacked a local mall for hostages to blackmail {{both sides of the}} Korean government to threaten SK's president into announcing their political stand to not unite with NK. Hyun-jun became the negotiator for the president Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil) and for the hostages' release. Eventually, Sa-woo was killed.

5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of the Korean People's Army, the Korean War appeared to be all but over.

North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN forces into two groups. The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast.|$|E
