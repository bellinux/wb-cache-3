2500|$|A [...] {{supercharged}} {{version of}} the smaller engine {{was added to the}} line-up in February 1987, using the world's first <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> rocker arm assembly. This generation was badge engineered and was introduced to the Asian luxury car market as the Hyundai Grandeur, giving Hyundai a luxury sedan to shuttle foreign dignitaries during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. As Mitsubishi and Chrysler had a business relationship where automotive technology was being shared and used in both Chrysler and Mitsubishi products, this generation Debonair does have some superficial similarities with the Chrysler New Yorker of the same time period. The Debonair's platform, however, shares nothing with the Chrysler [...] "E", [...] "Y", or [...] "K" [...] platforms. The suspension was upgraded to MacPherson struts for the front suspension, and the rear suspension used a three-link torsion axle. The only transmission available was a four-speed automatic unit.|$|E

50|$|Borazon has {{a number}} of uses, such as: cutting tools, dies, punches, shears, knives, saw blades, bearing rings, <b>needles,</b> <b>rollers,</b> spacers, balls, pump, {{compressor}} parts, engine & drive train components (e.g. camshafts, crankshafts, gears, valve stems, drive shafts, CV joints, piston pins, fuel injectors, turbochargers, and aerospace and land-based gas turbine parts such as vanes, blades, nozzles, and seals), surgical knives, blades, scissors, honing, superfinishing, cylinder liners, connecting rods, grinding of steel and paper mill rolls, and gears.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the {{layshaft}} is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft gear cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications <b>needle</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearing is {{a special}} type of roller bearing which uses long, thin {{cylindrical}} rollers resembling needles. Ordinary roller bearings' rollers are only slightly longer than their diameter, but needle bearings typically have rollers that are {{at least four times}} longer than their diameter. [...] Like all bearings, they are used to reduce the friction of a rotating surface.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 two Venom Thruxton motorcycles, ridden by Neil Kelly and Keith Heckles gained {{first and}} second places in the Production TT, a {{category}} for road-based machines with limited controlled-modifications first staged at the Isle of Man in that year; Kelly also recorded the fastest lap at 91 mph. Prepared by Reg Orpin, workshop manager at London Velocette dealer L.Stevens, the winning motorcycle was far from standard, for {{as well as being}} in Thruxton trim, the valve gear included titanium tips to the pushrods and valve caps. A Norton Manx piston had been specially engineered at Velocette's Hall Green Workshops, and it had cam followers on <b>needle</b> <b>rollers</b> as well as light alloy timing wheels. It was nearly all for nothing, however, as Kelly failed to start {{and the rest of the}} field left him struggling to kick start the Venom. Orpin managed to start it just in time, and despite his poor start, Neil Kelly caught up with the other riders within three miles and went on to win the 500 cc class, recording 121 mph as he passed the Highlander speed trap.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} stage, the {{bearings}} of Structures 1 through 5 were repaired. The heavily polluted roller bearings were completely replaced. The <b>needle</b> bearings (compact <b>roller</b> bearings) were opened and cleaned and the abrasive contact surfaces were reground. The bearings were then greased and closed again.|$|R
50|$|The {{front brake}} caliper was resited {{to the rear}} of the fork leg and the front master {{cylinder}} reservoir shape was changed. A hazard switch was added. <b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings were fitted to the swingarm instead of the earlier plain bushings. Tuning modifications were made to the carbs to improve low speed operation. The manual operation fuel tap was replaced with an automatic diaphragm unit. A rear disc brake replaced the earlier drum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} use {{very long}} and thin cylinders. Often {{the ends of the}} rollers taper to points, and these are used to keep the rollers captive, or they may be hemispherical and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since the rollers are thin, the outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, the small-diameter rollers must bend sharply where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.|$|E
50|$|With roots tracing back to 1963, NTN Bearing Corporation of America of Mount Prospect, Illinois {{produces}} and distributes roller {{and ball}} bearings to the United States industrial, automotive and recreational clientele. Products manufactured {{by the company}} include agricultural and farm implement bearings, angular contact ball bearings, automotive bearings, ball and roller bearing mounted units, cylindrical roller bearings, electrical motor bearings, heavy industrial bearings, machine tool bearings, micro and miniature ball bearings, <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, radial ball bearings, spherical roller bearings, tapered roller bearings and ultra-class bearing units.|$|E

The current industrial and marine version has an available gearbox with ratios of 2.04, 2.65 or 3.06:1. Starting is electric start only.|$|R
5000|$|Brinelling can {{be caused}} by a heavy load resting on a {{stationary}} bearing for an extended length of time. The result is a permanent dent or [...] "brinell mark". The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the bearing races, resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for <b>needle</b> or <b>roller</b> bearings or rounded indentations in ball bearings. It is a common cause of roller bearing failures, and loss of preload in bolted joints when a hardened washer is not used. For example, brinelling occurs in casters when the ball bearings within the swivel head produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.|$|R
50|$|Some manufacturers, such as Cannondale and Strida, offer a fork with {{a single}} leg. Many of Cannondale's single bladed forks, called Lefty, are {{suspension}} forks, in either conventional or inverted configurations. These forks use linear <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings on octagonal races to transmit the steering torque to the wheel, while conventional two bladed suspension forks use tubular linear plain bearings. Use of a Lefty fork requires a special Lefty hub, which attaches to the fork end {{by means of a}} screw that presses the hub onto the axle that is fixed to the fork.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1898 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as the Star Ball Retainer Company, Star Ball Retainer Company {{merged with}} the Bretz Company in 1910 to form the Bearing Corporation of America. NTN Corporation then {{acquired}} Bearing Corporation of America in 1996, establishing NTN-BCA Corporation in Lititz, Pennsylvania the following year. [...] The company produced ball, mounted and <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings used in clutch releases, engines and heavy industrial equipment in addition to constant velocity joints for aerospace, automobile, forklift and manufacturing customers. The company made an announcement that they had plans to close the plant in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{anti-friction}} element employed {{is a full}} complement of needle rollers. This design can withstand high radial loads but no [...] A similar design is the caged <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> design, which also uses needle rollers, but uses a cage to keep them separated. This design allows for higher speeds but decreases the load capacity. The cage also increases internal space so it can hold more lubrication, which increases the time between relubrications. Depending on the exact design sometimes two rollers are put in each pocket of the cage, using a cage design originated by RBC Bearings in 1971.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{concentration}} of polyvinylbutyral solution on the process throughput and fibre properties was studied in <b>needle</b> and <b>roller</b> electrospinning. Whereas the polymer throughput is an optional independent parameter in needle electrospinning, it is a dependent parameter that is affected by both the material and process parameters in roller electrospinning. Polymer throughput increases considerably with an increasing concentration of polymer solutions in roller electrospinning. The properties of the nanofibers {{and the quality of}} the nanofiber layers were also studied. Fibre diameters increase with an increasing concentration in both techniques. Fibre diameters produced by needle electrospinning are smaller than those produced by roller electrospinning. The distribution of fibre diameters is rather narrow and not significantly dependent on the concentration of solutions in either technique...|$|R
50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti-friction bearings, including <b>needle,</b> ball, <b>roller,</b> and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill bits, surgeon needles, hooking and felting needles, swaging machines, and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBurn scars {{remain a}} serious {{physical}} and psychological problem for the affected people. Clinical studies as well as basic scientific research have shown that medical needling can significantly increase the quality of burn scars with comparatively low risk and stress for the patient with regards to skin elasticity, moisture, erythema and transepidermal water loss. However, medical needling has no influence on repigmentation of large hypopigmented scars. The goal {{of this study is}} to evaluate whether two established methods – needling (for improvement of scar quality) and non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (for repigmentation) – can be successfully combined. Twenty subjects with mean age of 33 years (6 – 60 years) with scars from deep second and third degree burns have been treated. The average treated surface area was 94 cm 2 (15 – 250 cm 2) and was focused on prominent areas such as the face, neck, chest and arm. Percutaneous collagen induction or “medical needling” was performed using a roller covered with 3 mm long <b>needles.</b> The <b>roller</b> is vertically, horizontally and diagonally rolled over the scar, inducing microtrauma. Then, non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (NCASCS) was produced and applied using the ReNovaCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita Medical), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The patients were followed 12 months postoperatively. Pigmentation changes were measured objectively, as well as with patient and observer ratings. Patient satisfaction/preference was also obtained. Taken together, the pigmentation ratings and objective measures indicate individual improvement in 17 of the study participants. The melanin increases seen 12 months after NCASCS treatment are statistically significant. Medical needling in combination with NCASCS shows promise for repigmentation of burn cars...|$|R
