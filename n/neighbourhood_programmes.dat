40|$|Weak market cities' across European and America, or 'core cities' as {{they were}} in their heyday, went from being 'industrial giants' {{dominating}} their national, and eventually the global, economy, to being 'devastation zones'. In a single generation three quarters of all manufacturing jobs disappeared, leaving dislocated, impoverished communities, run down city centres and a massive population exodus. So how did Europeans react? And how different was their response from America's? This book looks closely at the recovery trajectories of seven European cities from very different regions of the EU. Their dramatic decline, intense recovery efforts and actual progress on the ground underline the significance of public underpinning in times of crisis. Innovative enterprises, new-style city leadership, special <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>programmes</b> and skills development are all explored. The American experience, where cities were largely left 'to their own devices', produced a slower, more uncertain recovery trajectory. This book will provide much that is original and promising to all those wanting to understand the ground-level realities of urban change and progress...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{achieving}} independence 25 years ago, Georgia {{is still}} a country in transition which is striving to overcome wideranging economic development problems, particularly evident through out-migration from rural areas to urban centres and foreign countries, {{as well as through}} restricted employment integration. The ‘European <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>Programme</b> for Agriculture and Rural Development in Georgia’ focuses on local development in rural regions as a main national goal and offers a series of pilot actions to apply LEADER-like activities in various rural parts of the country. In this paper the application of such a pilot scheme in Borjomi Municipality, the observed case study in the Lesser Caucasus, is analysed. Reviews show a highly committed implementation process, comprising the establishment of the Local Action Group, the elaboration of the Local Development Strategy, an on-going mobilisation process of local actors and the transfer of experiences and good practices from European Union Member States. The assessment of the potential of the LEADER approach in the rural and mountainous area of Borjomi Municipality reveals a high degree of acceptance and interest of rural stakeholders and residents to taking up such an approach and engaging in innovative initiatives within the frame of sustainable rural development. Given the short period of work with these ideas so far, continued knowledge transfer, and enhanced appreciation and participation in search of place-specifi c opportunities in rural regions will be essential for successful rural development pathways across Georgia...|$|R

40|$|Generated as a {{response}} to the requirements in managing European cross border cooperation <b>programmes,</b> <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>Programme</b> Slovenia-Hungary-Croatia 2004 - 2006 (NP) in particular served as an impetus for establishment of new modes of governance in Croatia. Together with Hungary and Slovenia, Croatia participates in this trilateral Programme as an external EU border candidate state. The NP is implemented as a grant scheme in Croatia for the first time requiring many institutional changes for its implementation. On all levels of government, the NP contributed to the establishment of stronger relations among institutions, horizontally and vertically, and a transfer of know-how in preparation and implementation from experienced partners, Slovenia and Hungary. Such a complex programme generated also problems due to weak administrative capacity, different sources of financing and socio-economic discrepancies. On national level, weak capacity of the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration (MFAEI) has directly influenced the initiation and implementation of NP and difficulties in the decision-making process occurred. The relationship between MFAEI and the Delegation of the European Commission was unclear and there were difficulties in developing new administrative procedures. Additionally, insufficiently transparent information dissemination mechanisms through different government levels influenced the quality and selection of project proposals in certain counties. Socio-cultural differences in Croatia were insufficiently considered while setting up the coordination system resulting in the extent and quality of submitted proposals and their success in the selection procedure. Some regions showed successful coordination on county level contributing to selection of greater number of proposals from those counties, while in others, there was a lack of capacity in preparing coherent project proposals. In accordance with the presented first Croatian experiences in the trilateral European cross-border programme, the following can be concluded: In terms of socio-developmental impacts, the joint-project proposal preparation process of the cross border partners created intensive inter-institutional cooperation and inter-institutional communication. However, only successful project proposals result in inter-institutional collaboration through joint implementation of projects, which is considered fundamental to the creation of a network society and building of social capital. ...|$|R

METHODS/SUBJECTS: Intervention evaluation using prospective service level data. Families (N = 21 132) with overweight children are referred, or self-refer, to MEND. Families (participating child and one parent/carer) attend two sessions/week for 10 weeks (N = 13 998; N = 9563 with complete data from 1788 programmes across England).

The tourism field of activity, within regional or local cross border relations, is the strongest binding element, where it can materialize very well due to the smaller extent of the area. While stating this, we bear in mind the fact that the tourism influence is complex at an economic, social but also cultural level 2 ̆ 013 the affinity based on mutual heritage from the border areas. The tourism cross border cooperation field, involves mainly the productive use of the common tourism resources, the harmonization of transport and access infrastructure, but mostly accommodation, as well as a common policy concerning the organising of cultural events. The nowadays project regions overlap, in most cases, the ancient historical regions, which prove their functional aspect once more, also from the complex perspective that development projects imply. In the case of the Maramures Land, or Historical Maramures (which comprises as a cross border ethnographical and historical entity, a territory from the Maramures County 2 ̆ 013 Romania and also from The Transcarpathia Region 2 ̆ 013 Ukraine) the opportunity for gradual development of cross border tourism with Ukraine is granted mostly by the partnership for development projects, with funding from the financing authority of The <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>Programme</b> Romania - Ukraine 2004 - 2006, PHARE Cross Border Cooperation, through the Romanian Ministry of Development, Public Works and Housing starting with January 2007.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of a control {{programme}} for a disease outbreak in a population of livestock holdings. Control is achieved by culling infectious holdings when they are discovered and by the pre–emptive culling of livestock on holdings deemed to be at enhanced risk of infection. Because the pre–emptive control programme cannot directly identify exposed holdings, its implementation will result in the removal of both infected and uninfected holdings. This leads to a fundamental trade–off: increased levels of control produce a greater reduction in transmission by removing more exposed holdings, but increase the number of uninfected holdings culled. We derive an expression for the total number of holdings culled during the course of an outbreak and demonstrate that there is an optimal control policy, which minimizes this loss. Using a metapopulation model to incorporate local clustering of infection, we examine a <b>neighbourhood</b> control <b>programme</b> in a locally spreading outbreak. We find that there is an optimal level of control, which increases with increasing basic reproduction ratio, R 0; moreover, implementation of control may be optimal even when R 0 &# 60; 1.
