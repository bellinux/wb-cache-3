40|$|How {{to design}} {{automated}} procedures which (i) accurately assess {{the knowledge of}} a student, and (ii) efficiently provide advices for further study? To produce well-founded answers, Knowledge Space Theory relies on a combinatorial viewpoint on the assessment of knowledge, and thus departs from common, numerical evaluation. Its assessment procedures fundamentally differ from other current ones (such as those of S. A. T. and A. C. T.). They are adaptative (taking into account the possible correctness of previous answers from the student) and they produce an outcome which is far more informative than a crude <b>numerical</b> <b>mark.</b> This chapter recapitulates the main concepts underlying Knowledge Space Theory and its special case, Learning Space Theory. We begin by describing the combinatorial core of the theory, {{in the form of}} two basic axioms and the main ensuing results (most of which we give without proofs). In practical applications, learning spaces are huge combinatorial structures which may be difficult to manage. We outline methods providing efficient and comprehensive summaries of such large structures. We then describe the probabilistic part of the theory, especially the Markovian type processes which are instrumental in uncovering the knowledge states of individuals. In the guise of the ALEKS system, which includes a teaching component, these methods have been used by millions of students in schools and colleges, and by home schooled students.

[...] Bob Marlin argues that the concept of grading students' work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named William Farish and first implemented by the University of Cambridge in 1792. Hoskin's assertion has been questioned by Christopher Stray, who finds the evidence for Farish as the inventor of the <b>numerical</b> <b>mark</b> to be unpersuasive. Stray's article elucidates the complex relationship between the mode of examination (testing), in this case oral or written, and the varying philosophies of education these modes imply, to both the teacher and student. As a technology, grading both shapes and reflects many fundamental areas of educational theory and practice. Over the past hundred years, various colleges, such as Evergreen State College and Hampshire College have begun to eschew grades. Ivy League university Brown University does not calculate grade-point averages, and all classes can be taken on a pass/fail basis. Additionally, several secondary schools have additionally decided to forgo grades. A notable example is Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn which was ranked by the Wall Street Journal as the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in Ivy League and several other highly selective colleges.|$|R

40|$|Urban trees serve {{important}} environmental, {{social and}} economic functions, but similar to other natural endowments they are not customarily depicted in monetary terms. The needs to augment protection, funding and community support for urban greening call for proper valuation. Heritage trees (HTs), the cream of urban-tree stock, deserve special attention. Existing assessment methods do not give justice to outstanding trees in compact cities deficient in high-caliber greenery, and to their social-cultural-historical importance. They artificially separate evaluation from valuation, which should be a natural progression from the former. Review of tree valuation methods suggested the formula approach to be more suitable than contingent valuation and hedonic pricing, and provided hints on their strengths and weaknesses. This study develops an alternative formulaic expert method (FEM) that integrates evaluation and valuation, maximizes objectivity, broadly encompasses the key tree, tree-environment and tree-human traits, and accords realistic monetary value to HTs. Six primary criteria (dimension, species, tree, condition, location, and outstanding consideration) branched into 45 secondary criteria, each allocated <b>numerical</b> <b>marks.</b> Each primary criterion was standardized to carry equal weight, and a tree's maximum aggregate score is capped at 100. A Monetary Assignment Factor (MAF) to consign dollar value to each score unit was derived from three-year average per m 2 sale price of medium-sized residential flats. The applicability of FEM was tested on selected HTs in compact Hong Kong. The aggregate score of a tree multiplied by MAF yielded monetary value, which was on average 66 {{times higher than the}} result from the commonly-adopted Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers method. The computed tree values could be publicized together with multiple tree benefits to raise understanding and awareness and rally support to protect HTs. The property-linked FEM could be flexibly applied to other cities, especially to assess HTs in compact developing cities. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Student {{evaluations}} {{can be seen}} as {{a method}} utilised by universities across Australia and worldwide to determine the teaching performance of their academic staff. Such evaluations utilise a number of criteria against which students then allocate a <b>numerical</b> <b>mark</b> in order to rate their tutor. Essentially, the higher the numerical rating, the better the teaching performance is deemed to be. The aim of this paper is to outline research findings that demonstrate a link between highly rated tutors (as determined by student evaluations) and the use of self-directed learning strategies. A survey of tutors from across a range of disciplines, who tutor at first and second year undergraduate level, was carried out. The survey took the form of a self-assessment survey and was provided to tutors who achieved an above average rating on their teaching evaluations within one university. Tutors were asked to identify classroom practices and philosophies that were integral, or otherwise to their everyday teaching practice. These practices and philosophies as outlined in the survey were derived from a literature review undertaken in terms of practices and strategies that underpin the promotion of self-directed learning. The survey results were then collated in the form of quantitative data in order to demonstrate a relationship between highly rated tutors and the use of self-directed learning strategies. Participants, who achieved an above mean use of self-directed learning strategies, were then asked to participate in an interview. Due to a number of time restraints, only tutors who demonstrated an above mean use of such strategies, as revealed through the self-assessment survey, were contacted for interview. Information collected from the interviews was collated in the form of a list of the actual strategies being used by these tutors and is outlined in the following pages...|$|R

40|$|A {{milestone}} in numerical {{development is the}} acquisition of counting principles which allow children to exactly determine the numerosity of a given set. Moreover, a canonical left-to-right spatial layout for representing numbers also emerges during preschool. These foundational aspects of numerical competence have been extensively studied, but there is sparse knowledge about the interplay between the acquisition of the cardinality principle and spatial mapping of numbers in early numerical development. The present study investigated how these skills concurrently develop before formal schooling. Preschool children were classified according to their performance in Give-a-Number and Number-to-position tasks. Experiment 1 revealed three qualitatively different groups: (i) children who did not master the cardinality principle and lacked any consistent spatial mapping for digits, (ii) children who mastered the cardinality principle and yet failed in spatial mapping, and (iii) children who mastered the cardinality principle and displayed consistent spatial mapping. This suggests that mastery of the cardinality principle does not entail the emergence of spatial mapping. Experiment 2 confirmed {{the presence of these}} three developmental stages and investigated their relation with a digit comparison task. Crucially, only children who displayed a consistent spatial mapping of numbers showed the ability to compare digits by numerical magnitude. A congruent (i. e., numerically ordered) positioning of numbers onto a visual line as well as the concept that moving rightwards (in Western cultures) conveys an increase in <b>numerical</b> magnitude <b>mark</b> the mastery of a spatial mapping principle.

Subjects and methods The study involved 5, 159 children who developed diabetes between 1 July 1977 and 1 July 2000, and 1, 330, 968 non-diabetic children. We linked the nationwide Swedish Childhood Diabetes Register to the Swedish School-Mark Register, which contains school marks for all children in Sweden {{at the time of}} leaving compulsory education (usually at 16 years old). Adjustment was made for potential confounders such as year of birth, maternal age, parity and educational level. Results The mean of all <b>numerical</b> school <b>marks</b> for diabetic children was slightly but statistically significantly lower than those of the referent children (3. 15 +/- 0. 01 [mean + SD] vs 3. 23, p < 0. 001).
