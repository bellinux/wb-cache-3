5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in the rest of it. Therefore, this was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E

The punishment of beheading and quartering those executed for treason was abolished in 1870. The last application of that punishment had been in 1820 and the last sentence to the punishment had been in 1839.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} famous cases of Wendigo {{psychosis}} reported involved a Plains Cree trapper from Alberta, named Swift Runner. During the winter of 1878, Swift Runner {{and his family were}} starving, and his eldest son died. Twenty-five miles away from emergency food supplies at a Hudson's Bay Company post, Swift Runner butchered and ate his wife and five remaining children. Given that he resorted to cannibalism so near to food supplies, and that he killed and consumed the remains of all those present, it was revealed that Swift Runner's was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of pure cannibalism as a last resort to avoid starvation, but rather of a man with Wendigo psychosis. He eventually confessed and was executed by authorities at Fort Saskatchewan.|$|E
25|$|The Three Book Dunciad has an {{extensive}} inversion of Virgil's Aeneid, {{but it also}} structures itself heavily around a Christological theme. To some degree, this imagery of unholy consecration had been present in Dryden's MacFlecknoe, but Pope's King of Dunces is much more menacing than Thomas Shadwell could ever have been in Dryden's poem. It is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of an unworthy man getting praised that spurs the poem, but rather a force of degradation and decadence that motivates it. Pope is not targeting one man, but rather a social decline that he feels is all but irrevocable. Nevertheless, the poem is still a satire and not a lamentation. The top of society (the kings) may be dulled by spectacle and freak shows, but Dulness is only one force. She is {{at war with the}} men of wit, and she can be opposed. In the Four Book Dunciad (or Dunciad B), any hope of redemption or reversal is gone, and the poem is even more nihilistic.|$|E

500|$|In {{a single}} paragraph, the Court {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the continuing offense doctrine, which had been codified in Rev. Stat. § 731. [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of the commencement of a crime in one district and its completion in another, so that under the statute the court in either district has jurisdiction. There was no beginning of the offense in Missouri. The payment of the money was in Washington, and there was no commencement of that offense when the officer of the Rialto Company sent the checks from St. Louis to defendant. The latter did not thereby begin an offense in Missouri." ...|$|E
500|$|The Court {{held that}} the report made by the prison medical officer was {{obviously}} a decision but that alone did not make him a [...] "decision-maker" [...] in the sense explained by Lord Diplock. This was because the officer's report that the appellant was fit for caning did not have legal effect– the District Court judge was duty bound to impose the sentence of caning irrespective of what the officer might have said in his report. Hence, it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for judicial review at all. The Court also said that another example of non-decision-making conduct was a police officer arresting a person suspected of committing an offence.|$|E
500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court. [...] Sotomayor first noted that this was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of first impression, and that the court had ruled on a similar issue only seven years previously. [...] Sotomayor stated that Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt held that when the government makes a contractual promise to pay in return for services, the government is bound to pay for those services. [...] This was a long-standing principle of contract law, dating back to Ferris, and the [...] "principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States." [...] If the appropriation exceeds the amount of the individual contract, then the government is bound to honor the contract. [...] Sotomayor stated that although the situation that Congress placed the BIA in is frustrating, but it is an issue for Congress to resolve. [...] The Court affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court. [...] Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor's opinion.|$|E
50|$|There are, however, {{limits on}} what cases the circuit courts will hear. They will <b>not</b> hear <b>a</b> <b>case</b> if the parties lack standing, {{or if the}} case is moot or is not ripe.

State law distinguishes between the court's {{jurisdiction}} (power to hear <b>a</b> <b>case)</b> and its competency (ability {{to arrive at a}} valid judgment in <b>a</b> <b>case).</b> <b>A</b> court lacks competency if certain statutory requirements are not satisfied, for example, time limits for filing suit, or requirements as to which circuit should decide <b>a</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R

500|$|On 21 April 1999, the Manchester Evening News named a man it {{described}} as [...] "a prime {{suspect in the}} 1996 Manchester bomb plot". The newspaper reported that the file sent by Greater Manchester Police to the Crown Prosecution Service contained the sentence: [...] "It is {{the opinion of the}} investigating officers of GMP that there is sufficient evidence to charge [...] with being a party in a conspiracy to cause explosions in the United Kingdom." [...] The man denied any involvement. The Attorney General {{wrote in a letter to}} a local MP that the advice given to the CPS by an independent lawyer was that [...] "there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> to answer on the evidence available... a judge would stop the case": the Attorney General further wrote that the decision not to prosecute was not influenced by the government.

500|$|Counsel for the {{appellant}} {{argued that}} this was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of a decision reviewable on ordinary administrative law grounds, but rather {{a case where the}} exercise of the power depended [...] "upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact". However, the House of Lords disagreed with the argument. It held that the nature and process of the decision conferred upon immigration officers was inconsistent with the requirements for the establishment of any precedent facts. This was because the immigration officer had to consider a [...] "complex of statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines and other documentary evidence whose genuineness is doubtful, statements which cannot be verified, misunderstandings as to what was said, practices and attitudes in a foreign state which have to be estimated. There is room for appreciation, even for discretion." [...] On the other hand, the court was not well placed to determine which of several conflicting statements made by the appellant were true, or to decide if other factors were material to the immigration officer's decision. The court had to determine the case based on affidavit evidence and, though cross-examination on such evidence was permissible, this did not usually occur in practice. As the case did not fall into the precedent fact category, the court was unable to judicially review the decision.|$|E
500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed by historians that extermination {{was never the}} policy of the Free State, which benefitted from the labour provided by Congolese workers. The Free State even made some efforts to attempt to tackle the spread of infectious diseases in the Congo by seeking the support of foreign medical institutes such as the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Indeed, some of the violence of the period can be attributed to African groups using colonial support to settle scores or white administrators acting without state approval. According to historian David Van Reybrouck, [...] "It would be absurd... to speak of an act of [...] "genocide" [...] or a [...] "holocaust"; genocide implies the conscious, planned annihilation of a specific population, and that was never the intention here, or the result... But it was definitely a hecatomb, a slaughter on a staggering scale that was not intentional, but could have been recognised much earlier as the collateral damage of a perfidious, rapacious policy of exploitation". According to Hochschild, [...] "while <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of genocide, in the strict sense", the atrocities in the Congo were [...] "one of the most appalling slaughters known to have been brought about by human agency". By contrast, writers such as Hochschild did not hesitate to label the German extermination of the Herero in South-West Africa (1904–07) as a genocide because of its defined, systematic and intentional nature.|$|E
