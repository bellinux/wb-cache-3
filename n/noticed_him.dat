5|$|Garcia was {{pitching}} in semipro baseball when Cleveland Indians scout Willis Butler <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> in Tulare, California. In 1942, Butler signed {{him as an}} amateur free agent to the organization's Class D farm team, the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League. Garcia earned a 10–10 win–loss record with Appleton. He spent {{the next three years}} as a signalman in the United States Army during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Among other things, {{the episode}} was {{inspired}} by the history of baseball in Roswell, as well as the infamous 1947 Roswell Incident. Jesse Martin was offered the lead guest role as Exley after Duchovny <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> in a production of the musical Rent and an episode of Ally McBeal. Originally, Darren McGavin was cast as Arthur Dales, but after he suffered a stroke, he was replaced by Walsh. Many of the outdoor baseball scenes were filmed at Jay Littleton Ballfield, an all-wood stadium located in Ontario, California. The episode has been critically examined for its use of literary motifs, its fairy tale-like structure, and its themes concerning racism and alienation.|$|E

I'd rather fancied {{from the}} way you {{referred}} {{to him that he}} was awfully jolly and forceful, but rather crude. But I didn't <b>notice</b> <b>him</b> at all. He seemed perfectly well-bred, but slightly heavy." ...|$|R

5|$|At the party, the {{employees}} vent their hatred of Nellie onto Pam to avoid admitting the truth, making Pam uncomfortable. The magician that was hired (Brett Gelman) arrives, much to Nellie's dismay. Jim, Dwight, and Pam, out of solidarity to Nellie, sabotage the magician's tricks until he reaches breaking point and Dwight kicks him out. Nellie and Robert commend {{the employees}} for throwing a good party, but Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) complains that the carrot cake has actual vegetables in it, which Pam {{made as a}} prank. When Jim and Pam leave for the day, Pam asks Hank Tate (Hugh Dane) why he let the magician into the elevator {{when he was asked}} not to. Hank, busy reading a magazine, claims not to have <b>noticed</b> <b>him,</b> stating that as a magician he could have slipped by.|$|E
5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him to a potential target, and he took aim, {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

25|$|Vicente was {{attached}} to the courts of the Portuguese kings Manuel I and John III. He rose to prominence as a playwright largely on account of the influence of Queen Dowager Leonor, who <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> as he participated in court dramas and subsequently commissioned him to write his first theatrical work.|$|E
25|$|Rudolph {{was chosen}} for South Africa's Test team in 2003 having {{previously}} had his selection for the 2002 New Year's Test against Australia in Sydney overruled by cricket administrators due to the South African practice of obeying a 'quota' of non-white players; the board overruled the selectors and installed Justin Ontong in the team. The selectors <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> {{during one of his}} performances in domestic cricket.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day of the hostage crisis, the Beslan siege {{collapsed}} into a bloodbath. After the bloody conclusion of the crisis, Nur-Pashi attempted to escape by disguising himself as a hostage and hiding under an OMON truck.

25|$|Poška {{was born}} in 1903 in the family of farmers in {{northern}} Lithuania, {{in the village of}} Gripkeliai of Pasvalys district. His interest in Esperanto emerged as early as 1913, when he received his first Esperanto textbook as a gift. He learned the language independently and in 1917, during World War I, a German soldier <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> reading an Esperanto book. The soldier shared addresses of Esperantists and Poška began corresponding with many intellectuals. These connections proved vital in his later travels. Poška became an active member of an Esperantist group in Saločiai. Still a schoolboy, Poška began submitting articles to the Lithuanian press. His parents disapproved the various activities and he moved out to Kaunas in 1921.|$|E
25|$|Responding {{within three}} minutes to a {{dispatch}} call made at 10:15pm, seven police officers entered through the front entrance and moved toward the stage. Officer James Niggemeyer came in through the back door, behind the stage. Gale only saw the officers {{in front of the}} stage; he did not see Niggemeyer, who was armed with a 12 gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Niggemeyer approached Gale from {{the opposite side of the}} stage past a group of security guards, and saw Gale lift his gun to Brooks' head, and fired a single shot as Gale <b>noticed</b> <b>him.</b> Gale was struck in the face with eight of the nine buckshot pellets and killed instantly. Gale was found to have had 35 rounds of ammunition remaining.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, a young Jet Li {{arrived at}} the temple to shoot his feature film debut, Shaolin Temple. Though Shi barely <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> at the time, the film's 1982 release was a major turning point for the temple, which {{experienced}} {{a significant increase in}} tourism. This in turn resulted in more positive attention to the temple by the Chinese government, which rebuilt the building, and in a change to the monks' daily routine, so that they could accommodate the tourists. Around this time, when Shi was 16, his parents, who held stressful jobs and were heavy smokers, died of lung cancer within six months of each other. Shi would then take care of his younger brother, while his older brothers would take care of the younger siblings, with whom Shi is still in contact today.|$|E

500|$|Jesse L. Martin was {{the first}} actor {{considered}} to play the part of Exley. Duchovny had first noticed Martin in a production of the musical Rent, and <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> again during a guest appearance on the Fox legal comedy-drama Ally McBeal. Watching the latter performance, Duchovny decided that Martin had the [...] "right feel" [...] for the lead role. Duchovny later noted that he had little involvement with the casting process since {{a majority of the}} characters in the episode were recurring.|$|E
500|$|Different {{techniques}} {{were used for}} each task. The British Army had intentionally recruited designers, architects and artists for camouflage work. Tony Ayrton was a painter, son of the architect Maxwell Ayrton. Brian Robb had arrived more informally: he joined the army as a private, but Barkas <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> and made use of his skills as an artist, teacher and illustrator by having him speedily promoted to Staff Lieutenant. Ayrton and Robb became Barkas's [...] "GSO2"s, his senior staff officers, and they supervised the camouflage schemes used in Operation Bertram.|$|E
500|$|Born in Collingwood, {{an inner}} suburb of Melbourne, Trott {{was the third}} of eight {{children}} born to accountant Adolphus Trott and his wife Mary-Ann (née Stephens). [...] His younger brother Albert also became a Test cricketer. [...] The siblings played their junior cricket with the local Capulet club. [...] Harry transferred to South Melbourne, which played in Melbourne's pennant competition, after scouts for the club <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> playing park cricket. [...] In his first season, the 18-year-old Trott recorded the best batting average and bowling average for the team.|$|E

500|$|I {{found that}} such a {{pendulum}} actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. [...] At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. [...] We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. [...] The problem was {{to get it in}} exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> perspiring a good bit and no wonder. [...] That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.|$|E
500|$|Wheelwright {{probably}} {{spent most}} of his time in England in Lincolnshire, and besides preaching in Alford he likely preached at Belleau, the estate of Sir Henry Vane [...] "who had greatly <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> since his arrival in the kingdom". It is possible that Vane encouraged Wheelwright to publish his Apology. After the death of Cromwell in 1658, events became less favorable for England's Puritans. When the monarchy returned to power under King Charles II in 1660, Vane was imprisoned for his role during England's Interregnum and then executed in June 1662. With this situation, Wheelwright returned to New England in the summer of 1662 with several other ministers who had been visiting the kingdom.|$|E
500|$|As a {{young boy}} Abebe played gena, a {{traditional}} long-distance hockey game played with goalposts sometimes miles apart. Around 1952, he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Guard after moving to Addis Ababa the year before. During the mid-1950s, Abebe ran [...] from the hills of Sululta to Addis Ababa and back every day. [...] Onni Niskanen, a Swedish coach employed by the Ethiopian government to train the Imperial Guard, soon <b>noticed</b> <b>him</b> and began training him for the marathon. In 1956, Abebe finished second to Wami Biratu in the Ethiopian Armed Forces championship. According to biographer Tim Judah, his entry in the Olympics was a [...] "long planned operation" [...] and not a last-minute decision, as was commonly thought.|$|E
