25|$|Between 1933 and 1938 korenizatsiya was not {{actually}} repealed. Its provisions merely stopped being enforced. There also began purges of the leaderships {{of the national}} republics and territories. The charge against non-Russians {{was that they had}} instigated national strife and oppressed the Russians or other minorities in the republics. In 1937 it was proclaimed that local elites had become hired agents and their goal had become dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the restoration of capitalism. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to see that the Russians got fair treatment. National leaderships of the republics and autonomies were liquidated en masse.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, {{following}} {{an outbreak of}} eye disease at an orphanage run by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, some of the sisters and the sick children moved into the Schuyler Mansion. The order and the orphanage continued {{to use it for}} another 27 years, until the state bought it in 1913 for conversion into its present use as a historic site, which it has been since 1917. This institutional use of the district's original building heralded a new era for the South End. By the 20th century it was adequately supplied with housing and churches; <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for larger structures meant for the general welfare.|$|E
500|$|A former {{dancer and}} fixture on the New York club scene, Madonna Louise Ciccone became {{known to the}} world simply as Madonna, {{with the release of}} her 1983 self-titled debut album Madonna. Fueled by hit songs like [...] "Holiday", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star", the album {{was one of the best}} selling of the year and helped Madonna become one of the most {{exciting}} new artists of the 1980s. When she started work on her second album, Madonna felt that her first album had succeeded in introducing her [...] "street-smart dance queen" [...] persona, and she wanted to solidify and build upon that concept. According to her, [...] "My work, my dedication—the stubbornness for getting Madonna released—had paid off. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to solidify my future." ...|$|E

500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in {{the crack in the}} universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness was placed in a Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for a casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform and tried to make it [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E
500|$|While many of Rubber Souls {{prominent}} {{songs were}} {{the product of}} Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, it also featured distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit. The song [...] "In My Life", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue. Harrison called Rubber Soul his [...] "favourite album" [...] and Starr {{referred to it as}} [...] "the departure record". McCartney has said, [...] "We'd had our cute period, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to expand." [...] However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – [...] "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious", he wrote, and [...] "as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Rubber Soul fifth among [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time", and AllMusic's Richie Unterberger describes it as [...] "one of the classic folk-rock records".|$|E
500|$|In August 1965, the Beatles {{released}} the McCartney composition [...] "Yesterday", featuring a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP, {{the song was}} the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member. [...] "Yesterday" [...] {{became one of the}} most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, [...] "from ... would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director of the Beatles." [...] Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song [...] "In My Life". McCartney said of the album, [...] "we'd had our cute period, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to expand." [...] Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: [...] "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious... as far as Paul was concerned, George [...] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to get back to work. Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for Huxley {{to tackle}} the subject of {{evolution}} at full length, in what became the defining work of his life. His role {{was that of a}} synthesiser, and it helped that he had met many of the other participants. His book [...] was written whilst he was secretary to the Zoological Society, and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering {{the first part of the}} century. It was published in 1942. Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic; the American Naturalist called it [...] "The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps of the century. The approach is thoroughly scientific; the command of basic information amazing".|$|E
2500|$|On 19 May, German High Command grew very confident. The Allies seemed {{incapable}} {{of coping with}} events. There appeared to be no serious threat from the south – indeed General Franz Halder, Chief of Army General Staff, {{toyed with the idea}} of attacking Paris immediately to knock France out of the war in one blow. The Allied troops in the north were retreating to the river Scheldt, their right flank giving way to the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions. It would be foolish to remain inactive any longer, allowing them to reorganize their defence or escape. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to bring them into even more serious trouble by cutting them off. The next day the Panzer Corps started moving again, smashed through the weak British 12th and 23rd Territorial divisions, occupied Amiens and secured the westernmost bridge over the river Somme at Abbeville isolating the British, French, Dutch and Belgian forces in the north. In the evening of 20 May, a reconnaissance unit from 2nd Panzer Division reached Noyelles, [...] to the west, where they could see the estuary of the Somme flowing into The Channel.|$|E

No rebuke can surely be more gentle than this delivered by the upright Apostle.|$|E
60|$|Toward this vessel {{accordingly}} {{the pirates}} directed their course, {{and when they}} had come pretty nigh, Captain Morgan called upon the surgeon that <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for him to perform the duty that had been laid upon him.

60|$|By <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to eat; indeed, {{there are}} few things that make a man hungrier than long-continued poetical exercise, so Adrian ate. In {{the midst of the}} meal his mother returned, pale and anxious-faced, for the poor woman had been engaged in making {{arrangements}} {{for the safety of the}} beggared widow of the martyred Jansen, a pathetic and even a dangerous task. In his own way Adrian was fond of his mother, but being a selfish puppy he took but little note of her cares or moods. Therefore, seizing the opportunity of an audience he insisted upon reading to her his sonnet, not once but several times.|$|E
60|$|Leland glanced {{across the}} big room, towards where Aylmer was sitting, and was once more {{sensible}} of dislike and repulsion. The {{man did not}} look well in evening dress. It made his flabby heaviness of flesh too apparent, and the sharply contrasted black and white emphasised the florid colouring of his broad, sensual face. He was just then regarding Carrie Denham out of narrow slits of eyes, priggish eyes, Leland called them to himself, {{and there was the}} easily recognisable stamp of grossness and indulgence upon him. The Westerner himself was hard and somewhat spare, a man whose body had been toughened by strenuous labour and held in due subjection by an unbending will. Mrs. Annersly noticed the clearness of his steady eyes and the clean transparency of his bronzed skin. As a man, he was, she decided, certainly to be preferred to Aylmer, and perhaps the more so because there was a side of his nature which as yet, it was evident, had scarcely been awakened. She was glad that the drawing-room was large and the place where they sat secluded, because there was a notion with which she desired to inspire him. She had already gone a certain distance in that direction, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to go a little further. She could see that her last speech had had some effect.|$|E
50|$|By the {{overwhelming}} retail success they were inspired {{to set a}} semi-automatic plant instead of preparing wafers by the traditional frying method.
