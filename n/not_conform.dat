5|$|As Jennings {{was also}} {{achieving}} success in country {{music in the}} early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called outlaw country, since it did <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to Nashville standards. The album Wanted! The Outlaws in 1976 with Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser cemented the pair's outlaw image and became country music's first platinum album. Later that year Nelson released The Sound in Your Mind (certified gold in 1978 and platinum in 2001) and his first gospel album Troublemaker (certified gold in 1986).|$|E

His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E
5|$|Juan Leyrado {{played a}} {{grandfather}} {{for the first}} time in his career. Unlike the usual telenovela grandfather (a secondary character), his character has a prominent role and his own story arcs. Leyrado, who was 60 years old when the series was made, said that he was still active in his personal life and played the character according to his own experiences. Korean-Argentine Chang Kim Sung, who played Walter Mao, said he was proud that his character did <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to stereotypes of Asian people.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior that did <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline {{rather than through}} civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E

When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory {{now known as the}} Oppenheimer–Phillips process to explain the results, a theory still in use today.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} object with a mass that falls {{within the range of}} the definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star. By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E

5|$|Croatia is {{traditionally}} divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders {{are not always}} clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country are Central Croatia (also described as the Zagreb macro-region), Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and Mountainous Croatia (Lika and Gorski Kotar; {{to the west of}} Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the general area of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the Croatian Littoral and Istria. The geographical regions generally do <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to the new course following the turn. Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.|$|E
5|$|The halogens darken in colour as {{the group}} is descended: {{fluorine}} is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114°C and boils at 183°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to it, depending on how metallic {{it turns out to}} be). Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital.|$|E

5|$|Two {{varieties}} {{described by}} Derek Reid in 1972, H.aurantiaca var. macrospora and H.aurantiaca var. rufa, {{have since been}} promoted to distinct species status as H.macrospora (1996) and H.rufa (2008). Two other varieties of the fungus have been described, {{but they are not}} considered to have independent taxonomic significance by Index Fungorum: var. nana (Singer 1946), characterized by a small fruit body; and var. robusta (Antonín 2000), characterized by a robust fruit body and an odour similar to Maggi seasoning sauce. Pale forms of the fungus are sometimes referred to as var. pallida. This taxon was first published by Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi in 1953, but later considered invalid as it did <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to nomenclatural rules. Variety nigripes, a taxon with a black-brown stipe, is invalid for similar reasons. H.aurantiaca var. pallida was published validly in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Toshiyuki Itahana. In common with his typical drawing style for characters, Itahana created Wol to be a heroic fantasy character that both fitted within and did <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to earlier Final Fantasy titles. He and other designers created the multiple job outfits to further convey the fantasy setting. After its reveal, some changes {{were made to the}} character's initial costume: due to negative player feedback about the amount of skin shown, the Onion Swordsman outfit was adjusted to be more covering. The game's environments were designed by Takako Miyake, who had previously worked on console Final Fantasy titles. She did not change her working style for Mobius Final Fantasy: all the assets were designed in high definition, and only adjusted slightly when they were brought into the mobile environment. The visual effects were handled by company veteran Shintaro Takai, whose main preoccupation was to make sure the game did not slow down during the flashier visual combat effects due to hardware constraints. The cutscenes were not affected by these issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} licensing model {{remained in}} place until 1978 when the company hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements, disallowing new owners from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, preventing corporations from owning franchises and prohibiting franchisees from operating other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. Smith also altered the way the company dealt with new properties by making the company the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises. This policy would allow the company {{to take over the}} operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to the company guidelines and policies. However, by 1988 Burger King parent Pillsbury had relaxed many of Smith's changes, scaled back on construction of new locations and stalling growth. When Pillsbury was acquired in 1989 by Grand Metropolitan, the company fell further into decline, a pattern which continued under Grand Met successor Diageo. This institutionalized neglect further hurt the standing of the brand, in turn causing significant financial damage to Burger King's franchises.|$|E

5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} with Chart House {{on the mind}} of the company's board in 1978, Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners were barred from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line {{was one of the first}} attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product. The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.|$|E
