5|$|The {{morning of}} 27 February 1814 saw a light frost, but {{the ground was}} <b>not</b> <b>frozen.</b> At 8:30 am the 4th Division {{assaulted}} Taupin's soldiers at Saint-Boès. The initial rush seized the church which stood on a separate hill. The brigade of Robert Ross swept through Saint-Boès but was repulsed by the battery on the Plassotte knoll. When his soldiers fell back into the village, Cole brought up a KGL battery to duel with Taupin's guns. The battery immediately became {{the target of the}} French batteries on the Plassotte and Luc knolls; two guns were knocked out and Captain Frederick Sympher was killed. Cole deployed José Vasconcellos' Portuguese brigade on Ross' right and sent his line forward again. The result was a second repulse in which Ross went down with a wound. The subsequent counterattack by Taupin's troops recovered part of Saint-Boès. For a time there was a lull as the two sides fired away at each other from the houses, but Vasconcellos' men had no cover and began to edge backward. Wellington sent over the 1st Caçadores Battalion from the Light Division. Cole's line collapsed just as the reinforcement arrived. Taupin recovered the entire village and drove the Allies back to their starting point. Ross' brigade suffered 279 casualties and Vasconcellos' brigade lost 295.|$|E

25|$|The Arctic Ocean {{between the}} huge ice sheets of America and Eurasia was <b>not</b> <b>frozen</b> throughout, but like today {{probably}} was only covered by relatively shallow ice, subject to seasonal changes and riddled with icebergs calving {{from the surrounding}} ice sheets. According to the sediment composition retrieved from deep-sea cores there must even have been times of seasonally open waters.|$|E

25|$|On December 7, 1287, the {{northern}} group of Mongol forces under Talabuga left a camp near Wlodzimierz Wolynski, and, after by-passing Lublin, the army tried {{to cross the}} Vistula near Zawichost. Since the river was <b>not</b> <b>frozen,</b> they {{had to find a}} ford, heading southwards. The invaders besieged and assaulted Sandomierz, but abandoned their siege after their storming attempt was beaten back. They left Ruthenian units {{in the area of the}} city and changed their course.|$|E
25|$|Steam locomotives, by comparison, require {{intensive}} maintenance, lubrication, {{and cleaning}} before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold {{can take many}} hours, {{although it may be}} kept in readiness between uses with a small fire to maintain a slight heat in the boiler, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply itself is <b>not</b> <b>frozen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{was not an}} {{engineer}} and {{did not realize that}} the site was a poor choice for a large camp because of its wet, low–lying location. The camp lacked sewers for more than a year, and the prairie on which it was built could not absorb the waste from thousands of humans and horses. The camp flooded with each rainfall. In the winter, it was a sea of mud when the ground was <b>not</b> <b>frozen.</b> When the camp opened, only one water hydrant worked. There was a severe shortage of latrines and medical facilities {{from the time of the}} camp's initial use through the period of incarceration of the first group of Confederate prisoners in mid–1862.|$|E

5000|$|In Swedish, {{the phrase}} [...] "snow cannon" [...] (Snökanon) {{is used to}} {{designate}} the Lake-effect snow weather phenomenon. For example, if the Baltic sea is <b>not</b> yet <b>frozen</b> in January, cold winds from Siberia may lead to significant snowfall.|$|R
25|$|In March 2002, {{more than}} nine years after the murders, Anne Lockett came forward and implicated her former boyfriend, James Degorski, and his associate, Juan Luna, in the crime. Luna was a former {{employee}} of the restaurant. In April 2002, the Palatine Police Department matched a DNA sample from Luna {{to a sample of}} saliva from a piece of partially eaten chicken found in the garbage during the crime scene investigation. The chicken was kept in a freezer for most of the time since the crime; testimony at trial indicated it was <b>not</b> <b>frozen</b> for several days after discovery, and was allowed to thaw several times for examination and testing, in the hope of an eventual match via increasingly sophisticated testing methods not available in 1993.|$|E

40|$|Infection with Baylisascaris procyonis roundworms is rare {{but often}} fatal and {{typically}} affects children. We attempted to determine parameters of viability {{and methods of}} inactivating the eggs of these roundworms.

500|$|Lake James and the {{surrounding}} lakes are the home {{for a variety of}} birds. Common birds such as ducks, geese, gulls, and purple martins can be found when the lake is <b>not</b> <b>frozen.</b> Migrating birds such as loons, grebes, and double-crested cormorants can also be observed, typically during autumn. [...] Hawks and red-headed woodpeckers can be seen year around, as can barred and great horned owls. Several bald eagles were sighted on the lake in 2006. Other birds that can be observed, especially around Pokagon State Park, include brown creepers, veeries, several types of warblers, bluebirds, Carolina wrens, Baltimore orioles, and pileated woodpeckers.|$|E

50|$|In most astrophysical environments, {{as well as}} {{laboratory}} plasmas, {{the electric}} conductivity is not infinite, so the magnetic field lines are <b>not</b> ideally <b>frozen</b> into the fluid.

This is called the frozen flux approximation which is widely used in dynamo theory.|$|R
