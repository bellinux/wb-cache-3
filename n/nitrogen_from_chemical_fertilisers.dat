40|$|Diffuse {{pollution}} {{of water resources}} from agricultural sources is a major environmental issue in the European Union, and has been dealt with by specific legislation: the Nitrate Directive of 1991 and the Water Framework Directive of 2000. These attempts to provide a coordinated approach to solving environmental problems require methods and tools for spatial analysis and modelling on a continental scale, with river basins being used as spatial units. This paper presents a screening model (Ag-PIE), developed in a GIS environment, {{for the assessment of}} pressures from agricultural land use and the consequent impacts on surface and groundwater. Ag-PIE has been applied at the European scale (EU 15), with focus on <b>nitrogen</b> pollution <b>from</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and manure. The model adopts a multi-criteria evaluation procedure applied to spatial data layers which represent the variety of factors affecting the pollution process. The DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses) approach is applied to provide the modelling approach with a conceptual framework and to further analyse and communicate results. Ag-PIE is ultimately aimed at providing a tool making use of state-of-the-art geographical databases to support policy-makers at the European level. The scale of reference adopted is the river basin, in particular those that extend across national boundaries. The quality of the results obtained has been assessed against existing related studies and monitoring reports and by means of sensitivity analysis. Conclusions are driven by considering the potential of Ag-PIE in devising policy support and its strengths and weaknesses in view of identifying future research needs...|$|R
40|$|Many {{ecosystem}} {{models have}} been developed for simulating water and carbon exchanges between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. One, the biogeochemical cycles (BIOME-BGC) model, simulates the storage and fluxes of water, carbon and nitrogen within the vegetation, litter and soil components of a terrestrial ecosystem. The model permits sophisticated simulations of natural ecosystems such as forest, grassland and shrub-land. However, it has rarely been applied to agricultural ecosystems. This study was conducted for exploring the ability of the BIOME-BGC for crops in China. For this propose, we set up an eddy-covariance tower in the North China Plain in 2002 and have obtained both flux data and related data of meteorological, vegetation and soil properties. By using these observation data, we modified eco-physiological parameters in the model. Correspondence between the simulated results with observations suggested that the modified model can be used to predict crop growth as well as water (H 2 O) and carbon (CO 2) fluxes under the consideration of the effects of anthropogenic forcing. To estimate the effects of anthropogenic forcing, we executed the model simulation under two scenarios: undisturbed and disturbed. The undisturbed scenario aimed to simulate potential plant growth and functioning with natural levels of atmospheric CO 2 and nitrogen deposition, but the effects of anthropogenic forcing were simulated in the disturbed scenario. Results showed that the simulated H 2 O and CO 2 fluxes are higher in the disturbed scenario than those in the undisturbed scenario, which suggests that anthropogenic forcing had an apparent effect on the water and carbon fluxes and sequestration capacity. However, simulation also indicated that <b>nitrogen</b> application <b>from</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> is greater than the requirements of crops, which might cause water and soil pollution in the study area.

The effect of climate change leading to variability in precipitation is one of the challenges our country faces at present, which often result in floods as we recorded the June 3 twin disaster in Accra, Ghana in 2014. The review therefore seeks to assess water resources with focus on freshwater, the challenges, the quality of freshwater in terms of chemical, physical and biological variables as well as blending integrated water management with the indigenous or traditional management of water resources for sustainable development and peaceful co-existence.|$|R
40|$|Fine {{sediment}} {{is increasingly}} {{viewed as a}} pollutant in river systems causing such problems as decreasing light penetration, clogging aquatic vegetation and altering the composition of spawning gravels. It can also act as a vector for transporting various other pollutants and contaminants such as substances <b>from</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and heavy metals from urban and industrial areas. In order to reduce unnaturally high sediment inputs {{it is important to}} first establish the source of the sediment. This study uses the sediment fingerprinting approach to ascertain information on the main land use types, geological types and sub tributary areas contributing sediment to the River Leven catchment, a sub catchment of the River Tees in North East England. Arable agriculture is the land use found to contribute most sediment to the river channels of the catchment with 65 % derived from it. Urban and Historic Mining sources also make substantial contributions. Mudstone geology of the low lying middle and lower catchment are the most dominant geology types and the tributaries draining from the upland of the North York Moors contribute most to sediment found in the lower parts of the Leven. The study proves that current strategies focussing on reducing sediment from agriculture are justified. The discovery of sediment derived from historic mining sites in the more remote parts of the catchment warrants further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Inorganic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>from</b> <b>chemical</b> {{fertilizer}} and livestock waste {{is a major}} source of pollution in groundwater, surface water and the air. Commercially available in situ chemical sensors (ion selective electrodes) and physical sensors (soil temperature, moisture and EC) have been considered a potential tool for measuring and monitoring nitrate (N 03 -) and ammonium (NH 4 l in agricultural soils irrigated with dairy waste water. We found physical sensor performance to be satisfactory (with the exception of soil moisture "smart" sensors) but found that ISEs experience a suite of technical problems including interfering ions, calibration drift and temperature dependence. Through non-ideal field deployments and controlled laboratory testing, we developed a temperature correction scheme using multivariable regression to compensate for temperature ranges experienced in the field (10 °C to 30 °C). Our efforts to independently validate ISE response with ion chromatography were inconclusive. Results are presented in the context of deployment techniques (in situ versus soil lysimeters), calibration error, and temperature compensation. In general, there are many issues that currently inhibit the success of ISEs in our field tests and time intensive calibrations required to create accurate temperature corrections are prohibitive to their immediate success in environmental monitoring...|$|R

The methodology used was life cycle assessment (LCA) and the functional unit was production of 1 kg plant-available nitrogen. The environmental impact categories studied were primary energy use, global warming potential (GWP), potential eutrophication and potential acidification. Flow of cadmium to arable soil, use of non-renewable phosphate rock and potential carbon sequestration were also assessed. In addition, additional functions such as phosphorus added to arable soil, energy production, removal of <b>nitrogen</b> and phosphorus <b>from</b> wastewater streams etc. were considered. The reference scenario for all comparisons was the production and use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> In general, storage and spreading of the organic fertilisers contributed greatly to potential eutrophication and acidification, except in the case of meat meal fertiliser, which was in a pseudo-stable form. All investigated fertilisers gave rise to goal conflicts as none of the fertilisers reduced the impact for all impact categories studied. The urine fertiliser reduced the largest amount of impact categories and added the least amount of cadmium to arable soil. Meat meal reduced, or had similar results as the reference scenario, for all impact categories except primary energy use and potential eutrophication. For digested food waste, <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use was an environmentally better option for all impacts.
