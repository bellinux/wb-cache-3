2500|$|Recent major biographers of Frederick, {{including}} Alings, Blanning, Burgdorf and Hahn, are unequivocal {{that he was}} predominantly homosexual, {{and that}} his sexuality was central to his life and character.

This story is doubted by Wolfgang Burgdorf, who is of the opinion that [...] "Frederick had a physical disgust of women" [...] and therefore [...] "was unable to sleep with them". After one particular defeat on the battlefield Frederick bluntly wrote: [...] "Fortune has it in for me; she is a woman, and I am <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> inclined." ...|$|E
