5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1652, Bern devalued its copper Batzen by 50% to adjust its face value to its intrinsic value to combat the inflation. The authorities set a term of only three days to exchange the copper coins at the old rate against more stable gold or silver money. <b>Not</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> could thus {{take advantage of this}} exchange offer, and for most—and in particular the rural population—half their fortunes just vanished. The other cantons soon followed suit and similarly devalued the Bernese copper money. The situation was most dire in the Lucerne Entlebuch valley, where the Bernese Batzen were in widespread usage. The financial situation of many a peasant became unsustainable. Insider deals of the ruling magistrates of Lucerne furthered the unrest among the population. The peasants of the Entlebuch valley, led by Hans Emmenegger from Schüpfheim and Christian Schybi from Escholzmatt, sent a delegation to Lucerne to demand remedies, but the city council refused to even hear them. The enraged peasants organized a general assembly (Landsgemeinde) {{of the population of the}} valley at Heiligkreuz, in spite of such assemblies being illegal as the authorities' laws of the time denied the freedom of assembly. The assembly, which took place after the mass on February 10, 1653, decided to suspend all tax payments until the authorities in Lucerne fulfilled their demands by reducing taxes and abolishing some of them altogether, such as the taxes on salt, cattle, and horse trades.|$|E

25|$|Many {{temperate}} {{fish have}} specific local diet requirements, while others, will eat {{just about any}} crustacean or frozen foods.

It takes experience before one can successfully gauge the compatibility of the fish and invertebrates in one's area.

Somewhat pedantic and conservative, Sir Pitt does nothing to help Rawdon or Becky even when they fall on hard times.

In addition, through the several trades that brought in Fraser Clair, Shayne Fryia, and goaltender David Chant as well as the great play of rookie Jan Platil the Colts looked to make a deep run into the playoffs the following season.|$|E
25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, and the hope was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said {{that it was a good}} idea to show up with your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> would attend.|$|E

He would then take his goods to sell at the Sungei Road Thieves' Market. Within seven years, he had saved enough money to rent a shop space nearby, and expanded his business to sell bigger used items like computers, refrigerators, videotape recorders and television sets, in addition to old clothes, shoes and records. In 1993, he registered his second-hand goods trading business and began to focus his business in exporting used computer parts, as there were <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> doing that back then, and his business thrived.
