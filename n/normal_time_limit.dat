40|$|Neuromotor {{function}} was assessed in 94 children of normal intelligence with Tourette syndrome, Tourette syndrome and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or ADHD only, using the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs (PANESS). Time to complete six motor movements was analyzed separately by side (left and right) and complexity (simple and patterned). All groups performed faster on their preferred, dominant side. Although all groups took longer to complete patterned versus simple movements, {{the group with}} ADHD had a larger discrepancy for complexity {{than the other two}} groups. The speed for simple and patterned tasks was at or faster than age expectations for 54 % of tasks in the group with Tourette syndrome but only 15 % of tasks in the other two groups. More children in the group with Tourette syndrome (76 %) than the groups with Tourette syndrome with ADHD (54 %) or ADHD only (65 %) performed movements within <b>normal</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for age. Findings suggest that Tourette syndrome is not associated with motor slowing. (J Child Neurol 1997; 12 : 438 - 442). Correct responses on timed tasks require the active inte-gration of at least two components of executive function: memory search and response preparation. When compar-ing executive dysfunction in different groups it is essentia...|$|R

50|$|A {{retained}} placenta is a placenta that doesn't undergo expulsion {{within a}} <b>normal</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> Risks of retained placenta include hemorrhage and infection. If the placenta fails to deliver in 30 {{minutes in a}} hospital environment, manual extraction may be required if heavy ongoing bleeding occurs, and very rarely a curettage is necessary {{to ensure that no}} remnants of the placenta remain (in rare conditions with very adherent placenta, placenta accreta). However, in birth centers and attended home birth environments, it is common for licensed care providers to wait for the placenta's birth up to 2 hours in some instances.|$|E
50|$|Capablanca {{excelled in}} simple {{positions}} and endgames, and his positional judgment was outstanding, {{so much so}} that most attempts to attack him came to grief without any apparent defensive efforts on his part. However, he could play great tactical chess when necessary - most famously in the 1918 Manhattan Chess Club Championship tournament (in New York) where Marshall sprang a deeply analyzed prepared variation on him, which he refuted while playing under the <b>normal</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> (although ways have since been found to strengthen the Marshall Attack). He was also capable of using aggressive tactical play to drive home a positional advantage, provided he considered it safe and {{the most efficient way to}} win, for example against Spielmann in the 1927 New York tournament.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{assesses the}} impact of the fixed-rate full-allotment {{procedure}} implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB) in October 2008 on the functioning of the interbank money market. More specifically, our work examines whether the excess liquidity positions of financial institutions observed during the fixed-rate full-allotment period have altered the activity and the liquidity of the overnight segment of the euro area money market. In <b>normal</b> <b>times,</b> the <b>limited</b> amount of excess liquidity makes the dynamics of the money market insensitive to it. In contrast, the introduction of the fixed-rate full-allotment procedure – as one prominent unconventional measure of the ECB – has made the dynamics of the money market growingly dependent on the time-varying level of excess liquidity in the euro area...|$|R

The bill was introduced to parliament on 13 December 2012 and passed the House of Commons on 28 January 2013. The House of Lords Constitution Committee opposed the government's plans to fast-track the bill, which led to the government's decision to observe <b>normal</b> legislative <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> in the House of Lords. The act received Royal Assent on 25 April 2013, passing into law, but its provisions altering the law of succession would not come into force until a time to be formally appointed by the Lord President of the Council (another office held by Clegg).

This tournament included most of the world's top players (Garry Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik and Gata Kamsky were the only notable absentees), and Adams won short matches against Tamaz Giorgadze, Sergei Tiviakov, Peter Svidler, Loek van Wely and Nigel Short, before coming up against Anand in the final round. Their four games at <b>normal</b> <b>time</b> controls were all drawn, as were four rapidplay games at quicker <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> before Anand won the sudden-death game, thereby eliminating Adams from the competition.|$|R

Witnesses to the incident said the two men both made threats, with Waterman producing a gun and pointing it at Sinatra. Sinatra walked out of the casino and returned to his Palm Springs home without fulfilling the rest of his three-week engagement there. Waterman was booked on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, but was released without bail. The local district attorney's office declined to file charges against Waterman for pulling the gun, stating that Sinatra had refused to make a statement regarding the incident.

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Two looks at the extension of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R

To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino.

In the no <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up message).
