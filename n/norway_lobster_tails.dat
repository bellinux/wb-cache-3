40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the microbial quality of whole Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> <b>tails</b> to optimize handling conditions. This was done by assessing the total viable count (TVC) and characterizing the dominant microbiota. The cultivable microorganisms were quantified via classical microbiological plating methods. To characterize as many bacterial species present as possible, we performed advanced molecular identification techniques (PCR-DGGE). The initial TVC of fresh Norway lobster meat was high (3. 0  log cfu/g) as compared to fish. No significant difference between whole Norway lobster and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> <b>tails</b> could be found during the storage period. From day 6 of storage, a significant difference between Plate Count Agar (PCA) and Marine Agar (MA) was observed. The microbiota of Norway lobster was dominated by members of the Gram-negative genera such as Psychrobacter spp., Pseudoalteromonas spp., Pseudomonas spp., Luteimonas spp., and Aliivibrio spp. From these bacteria, mainly Psychrobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. remained present until the end of the storage period. These are known spoilage organisms in fishery products. Other known spoilage organisms of crustaceans such as Photobacterium spp. could not be identified...|$|E
40|$|Three fishing methods, creeling, {{conventional}} trawling, and species-selective trawling {{are used}} to target Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), economically {{the second most important}} species in Swedish west coast fisheries. To evaluate overall resource use and environmental impact caused by producing this seafood we followed the production chain starting from the fishery itself, through seafood auctioning, wholesaling, retailing, to the consumer using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. That portion of the life cycle occurring on land was assumed to be identical for Norway lobsters regardless as to how they were caught. The functional unit was 300 g of edible meat (i. e., <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> <b>tails),</b> corresponding to one kilogram of whole, boiled Norway lobsters. Major {{differences were found between the}} fishing methods with regard to environmental impact: creeling was found to be more efficient than conventional trawling in all traditional impact categories and in the two additional fishery-related categories seafloor impact and discarding. Species-selective trawling was considerably more resource efficient than was conventional trawling due to both less discards and less landed by-catch; however, selective trawling nevertheless used mor...|$|E
40|$|The quality {{deterioration}} of <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) <b>tail</b> meat was monitored during ice storage. The K-value started at 0. 7 % and reached {{a value of}} 39. 7 % on day 14. Muscle pH followed a sigmoidal pattern that reached a plateau on day 6. Bacterial load and trimethylamine (TMA) increased only after a lag phase to reach considerable levels by day 14 (5. 3 log cfu and 10. 2 mg (100 g) − 1, respectively). These analytical data were compared with sensory data. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that laboratory measures were correlated positively with the smell strength of cooked product (increasingly strong) and negatively with the smell character of raw and cooked product (sour-ammoniacal in raw and neutral in cooked products), flavour and aftertaste (both increasingly bland–bitter). The effects of icing delays {{on the quality of}} tail meat were also evaluated. Changes in K-values, microbial load, muscle pH and TMA indicated that the delay to icing should be no more than 4 h (at 16 °C) to ensure that quality is not compromised during subsequent post-harvest storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of phenolase activation in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> was studied. It {{was found that}} phenolase activation in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> requires a protease. Trypsin and a bacterial protease from Streptomyces griseus, accelerate {{the rate of increase}} of phenolase activity in crude phenolase preparations from <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster,</b> but have little effect on the enzyme after being partially purified by acetone precipitation. It was also found that the process requires another factor(s), which has low molecular weight and is probably located in a subcellular fraction mainly containing the microsomes. Therefore the increase of phenolase activity appears to be a multiple component process and protease alone does not activate the phenolase activity in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of blackspot development in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) was studied. A linear relationship was observed between phenolase activity {{and rate of}} colour development in homogenates. It was found that tyrosine could significantly influence the rate of colour development. Production of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) during colour development was demonstrated using an HPLC method. The production of DOPA, i. e. tyrosinase activity, {{and the rate of}} colour development in homogenates of <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> were found to be directly related to the phenolase activity as measured using catechol oxidase activity. It is proposed that tyrosine is the initial substrate for blackspot development in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> and that the process is an enzymatically controlled oxidation.

40|$|Phenolase {{activation}} in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) {{was found}} to be a result of proteolysis.

The three protease activities identified in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> all affected the phenolase-activation process. Protease III, a metal-dependent serine protease, was involved in the activation process, but proteases I and II, two thiol proteases, also affected the activation process by apparently degrading the phenolase present.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the effects on melanosis development in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) of treatment by dusting with a commercial sulphite-based product and of spraying with a formulation containing 4 -hexylresorcinol (0. 1 % and 0. 05 %), in combination with organic acids and chelating agents. The following tests were performed during chilled storage: polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, melanosis score, colour parameters, tyrosine and tyramine content, as the main substrate of PPO. Differences among treatments were evaluated by means of statistical analyses (ANOVA, principal components and discriminant analyses). All formulations diminished PPO activity during storage successfully. The melanosis score was higher in sulphite-treated <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters,</b> and a formulation with 0. 05 % 4 -hexylresorcinol was enough to prevent the appearance of melanosis for 12 days. The tyrosine content decreased during storage, but the tyramine content was insignificant.

40|$|Several antimelanosis {{formulations}} {{were used}} to compare the sensorial quality loss of fresh <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> during ice-chilled storage, by applying a designed grading system based on an overall sensory score (quality index). A first experiment was conducted with <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> treated conventionally with a commercial sulfite-based product. A subsequent experiment was done using known concentrations of sulfites and 4 -hexylresorcinol (4 -HR). The presence of antimelanotics was responsible for a limited perception of changes in melanosis and yellow/greenish discolorations in the head during the first 7 days of storage, especially in the lots treated with 4 -HR. <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> treated with 4 % commercial sulfites was considered unacceptable at around 9 days of storage. However, 4 -HR-based formulations delayed the rejection point up to day 13 and 14 when using concentrations of 0. 05 and 0. 1 % of 4 -HR, respectively. © 2007, The Author(s); Journal compilation © 2007, Blackwell Publishing.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in cod end mesh size from 55 to 60 and 70 mm and a change of mesh configuration from diamond to square mesh on the size selectivity for rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> Nephrops norvegicus captured off the Portuguese south coast were evaluated. The results were analysed taking into account between-haul variation in selectivity, and indicate a significant increase in L- 50 for rose shrimp with an increase in mesh size or {{with the use of a}} square mesh cod end, while for <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> only mesh configuration was found to affect this parameter. Two other important external variables were identified; the trawling depth and the cod end catch, which influence between-haul variation, by increasing the selection range for rose shrimp and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster,</b> respectively. The results obtained suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55 mm would be advisable for rose shrimp in order to respect the minimum landing size of 24 mm carapace length presently established for this species. Moreover, trawling for rose shrimp should be avoided at depths above 200 m, in order to avoid catches consisting almost exclusively of juveniles. Such an increase in mesh size would have a minor impact in terms of losses of individuals above the minimum landing size for <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> and would contribute to reducing the amount of discards in this fishery.
