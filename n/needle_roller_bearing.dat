5000|$|A <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> is {{a special}} type of roller bearing which uses long, thin {{cylindrical}} rollers resembling needles.

5000|$|The SB.1 glider was {{designed}} to be an inexpensive, simple machine, constructed primarily of spruce with reinforced sections using light alloy steel. The all-important wing controls had [...] "elevons" [...] pivoted on long, tapered light-alloy tubes extending from {{the leading edge of the}} tip, just inside the fixed part of the wing (illustrated by photographs in the Short SB.4 Sherpa article). The pivoting mechanism had a double-ball bearing unit on the inboard end with main loads transferred to a <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> at the outboard end of the fixed wing. Anti-balance tabs were fitted along trailing edges along with small pneumatically actuated flaps under the inboard sections. When the elevons were rotated in the same direction they functioned as elevators; when rotated in opposite directions they functioned as ailerons.|$|E
5000|$|Today, the Triumph Vitesse is much sought-after car by enthusiasts; parts {{supply is}} excellent, and the cars have a {{reputation}} for near [...] "bullet-proof" [...] mechanics. This is not completely warranted. The gearbox of the 2 litre suffered from wear of the output shaft [...] "nose" [...] that mates with the input shaft. It was under engineered from the first and frequently wore through the hardened surface necessitating a rebuild with metal spraying and resurfacing. Nowadays it is possible to buy 'Heavy-duty' mainshafts for the overdrive gearboxes with a bigger 18mm diameter tip and a much stronger <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> This upgrade is based on the re-designed 4-speed gearbox for later TR7 and Dolomite 1850 models, which are basically the same gearbox. The differentials were never up to the power of even the 2 litre and would not stand regular 0-60 blasts without either crown wheel tooth loss or shearing of half shafts. The idiosyncratic threaded front suspension setup is also an area where incorrect maintenance (grease instead of gear oil or no regular lubrication) leads to dramatic failures.|$|E
50|$|The Trabant 601 was {{a modern}} {{automobile}} when introduced in 1963, with 150 Pre-Production examples. The body was modified {{from the previous}} P50/P60 variants of the Trabant, with a heavy emphasis {{on the front and}} roof area. The back of the car was also modified with different taillights and a higher trunk loading height as compared to previous models. Overall the design was praised, particularly on the then modern double trapezoid design. Originally production was planned to run from 1967 to 1971, but in practice continued until 1990.The original engine was only 17 kW (23 hp), but in 1969 a new version was offered with a 19.1 kW (26 hp) engine. In 1974 a <b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> was added to the connecting rod, allowing for a 50/1 lubricant to be used. Through the addition of a 2-stage carburetor in 1984, the fuel consumption was brought down by 1/100 l/km. With these additions, the top speed measured was measured to be 107 km/h. Even with these improvements the fuel consumption could still rise rapidly with extended acceleration or when towing a trailer. The P601 also had an overrunning clutch when running in 4th gear.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} certain phenomena {{that take place}} in the <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> The friction that generates the anti-torque of a friction pair is the major factor that influences the needle bearing’s wear. In the needle bearing there occur two predominant types of friction: the rolling friction and the sliding friction, and both are subject to examination. The study presents recordings and analysis of the movements of all needle bearing’s rolling elements. The examination was carried out on a special examination stand that precisely emulates the real conditions of the needle bearing’s work. Carefully prepared examination methods enable recording and analyzing frictions in the bearing, estimating a sphere within which the load is shifted, and calculating the coefficient of friction...|$|E
40|$|A <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> is {{a bearing}} which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings {{are used to}} reduce friction of any rotating surface. Needle bearings have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by thrust needles. Complement bearings have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. The bearings have the largest number of rolling elements and also have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for compact designs. Needle roller bearings have relatively small diameter cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger than their diameter. As compared to other types of rolling bearings, needle roller bearings possess a small cross-sectional height and significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their volume. Also, because the inertial force acting on them is limited, needle bearings are an ideal choice for applications with oscillating motion. These bearings also work well in compact and lightweight machine designs and they serve as a ready replacement for sliding bearings. Needle bearings features are great rigidity, smaller cross-section, higher loadcarrying capacity, and has lower inertia forces that facilitate to size and weight reductions in machinery. Needle bearings are designed to stand in oscillation, performwell under any conditions, and interchange with the sliding of bearings...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing concern {{regarding}} the increasing prices and requirements of energy around the globe. One of the largest and cost effective ways to tackle this issue is by improving the energy efficiency of components/systems. This leads to a reduced total cost of ownership of machines, lower fossil fuel dependency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In this thesis two critical high-dynamic components, namely bearings and wet clutches are subjected to detailed energy analysis. Bearings are commonly used component in machines/systems, whereas the wet clutches find application in most of the transmission devices. In addition, these components are considered as significant contributors to the overall energy losses in machines/systems. In view of the critical nature of these two components with regard to energy losses, research is still ongoing to understand the loss mechanisms and to improve the energy efficiency of these components. The <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> lubricated with a solid-grease is popularly used in applications where there is a demand for high load-carrying capacity, low space requirements and where access to bearings are difficult for maintenance purpose. Nevertheless an appropriate model for calculating the energy losses in needle roller bearings lubricated with solid-grease does not exist. In case of the wet clutch, the mechanisms causing energy losses differ according to the state (engaged or disengaged) of the clutch. When a wet clutch undergoes engagement, the frictional effect (asperity contact torque) is mostly dominant and governs the energy losses. On the other hand, when the wet clutch is in disengaged condition, the viscous effect responsible for producing drag torque is considered as energy loss. The energetic behavior of wet clutches can be examined through modeling and dedicated experiments. For modeling wet clutch engagement cycles, the required characteristics/parameters of the friction model for capturing the dynamic friction phenomena along with the realization of variation in normal force as well as ATF (automatic transmission fluid) temperature observed in wet clutches are unknown. On the other hand, the existing models as well as the experimental data related to drag torque in disengaged wet clutches do not consider the real operating conditions such as variable ATF flow rate and rotational states of the disks for the higher clutch speed range. To overcome these short-comings, this thesis aims to study the energy losses in these two critical components through model development and experimental characterization. This work is helpful in building energy efficient machines/systems. The first contribution redefines the parameters of the Palmgren and SKF® models for predicting power losses in needle roller bearings lubricated with solid-grease. The updated models are applicable for both constant and varying speed profiles under constant loading conditions. In addition, a generic methodology has been proposed in order to verify and update the state-of-the-art models for predicting the power losses of any bearing type with any lubrication condition. The second contribution proposes an extended Reset-Integrator friction model for investigating the energetic (power and energy flow) behavior of wet clutches. The adaptation includes the experimentally determined stribeck function, viscous effect and the delay in actuation pressure signal. The friction torque generated by the extended model is dependent on the relative velocity, normal load and the ATF temperature. The model is validated with experimental results in both the time and the frequency domain. The developed model {{can also be used to}} study wet clutch vibration characteristics. By further analyzing the sets of experimental results, it is confirmed that the amplitude of shudder vibration is independent of the amplitude of applied contact pressure fluctuation. The third contribution through experiments and modeling provides a global view on the performance and energetic behavior of wet clutches with degradation and different initial driving energy levels. For this purpose, experiments are performed using an advanced SAE# 2 test setup designed and built by our industrial collaborator, Dana Spicer Off Highway, Belgium. The simulation model incorporates an existing adapted form of the GMS friction model (for studying effects of degradation) and the developed extended Reset-Integrator friction model (for studying effects of initial driving energy levels). On the basis of the obtained results, some important conclusions are drawn regarding the design aspects of wet clutches such as COF (coefficient of friction), engagement duration, engagement torque, power and energy. Experimental characterization of drag torque in disengaged wet clutches is carried out, constituting a fourth contribution. For this purpose, experiments are performed using an advanced SAE# 2 test setup designed and built by our industrial collaborator, Dana Spicer Off Highway, Belgium considering real operating conditions of wet clutches. By analyzing the obtained experimental results, the relationship between the amount by which the parameters such as ATF flow rate, ATF temperature, disk size and disks rotational states are varied and the corresponding change in the drag torque is established. In addition, a general description of the qualitative behavior of the drag torque in function of clutch speed is proposed and the associated physical phenomena are explained. A mathematical model based on continuity and Navier-Stokes equations, considering laminar flow in the gap between the disks, is developed as the fifth contribution to estimate the drag torque in disengaged wet clutches. The model validation results suggest that the model is capable of predicting the drag torque under real clutch conditions of variable flow rate and disks rotation states for the higher clutch speedrange. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use {{very long}} and thin cylinders. Often {{the ends of the}} rollers taper to points, and these are used to keep the rollers captive, or they may be {{hemispherical}} and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since the rollers are thin, the outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, the small-diameter rollers must bend sharply where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.|$|R
