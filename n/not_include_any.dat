BBC Pilot includes 2.2 million catalogue records and 225,000 playable programmes, but unlike BBC Redux it does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> broadcasts beyond 2011.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{suggests}} a southern, presumably Kentish, origin for the seax because its inscription only comprises the original twenty-eight {{letters of the}} Anglo-Saxon futhorc, and does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> of the additional letters in use in Northumbrian runic inscriptions at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the United Nations General Assembly {{adopted the}} Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The Convention outlawed {{discrimination}} against women, but did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> {{mechanism by which}} this prohibition could be legally enforced.|$|E

The cabinet did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> natively anglophone member. Orban's salary was €18,233.38 (approx. US$23,631, c.2007) a month plus housing allowance.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> geographical boundaries for Palestine. Following {{the end of}} the war, three documents – the declaration, the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence and the Sykes-Picot Agreement – {{became the}} basis for the negotiations to set the boundaries of Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The discography of Screaming Trees, an Ellensburg, Washington-based rock band, {{consists}} of seven studio albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays (EP), and six singles, though this does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> solo material {{recorded by the}} individual members of Screaming Trees.|$|E

5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5000|$|If {{more than}} two clubs are tied, the higher {{percentage}} of available points earned in games among those clubs, and <b>not</b> <b>including</b> <b>any</b> [...] "odd" [...] games, are {{used to determine the}} standing.|$|R

5|$|Gravitationally rounded {{objects in}} the Solar System have a rounded, {{ellipsoidal}} shape due to the forces of their own gravity (hydrostatic equilibrium) and their sizes range from dwarf planets and moons to the planets and the sun. This list does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> small Solar System bodies, but it does include a sample of planetary-mass objects whose shape {{has yet to be}} accurately determined. The Sun's orbital characteristics are listed in relation to the Galactic Center, while all other objects are listed in order of their distance from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The NPVIC does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event}} that the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established rules governing recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. Proponents of the compact argue that the need for a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} fleet did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> minibuses, {{a large number}} of Mercedes-Benz vehicles were introduced from September 1986 on a high-frequency route in central and northern Glasgow; it did not prove profitable and was converted to full-size operation a year later, with many of the minibuses transferred to other SBG subsidiaries. Another unusual vehicle in the Kelvin fleet was the only Leyland Lynx bought by Scottish Bus Group, which was delivered new in 1989. Six rare Leyland Lion double-deckers were ordered in 1988, but owing to a large cut in Kelvin's peak vehicle requirement they did not enter service with the company and were instead sent to Clydeside Scottish.|$|E
50|$|While the French {{army has}} <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>any</b> {{grenadiers}} since 1870, the grenade badge {{is still a}} distinctive mark of the Foreign Legion, the National Gendarmerie and the French Customs which was a military unit until 1940.|$|R
50|$|Westkapelle-Binnen is {{a former}} {{municipality}} in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It existed until 1816, when it merged with Westkapelle-Buiten en Sirpoppekerke to form the new municipality of Westkapelle. The municipality consisted only of the village of Westkapelle, <b>not</b> <b>including</b> <b>any</b> surrounding countryside.|$|R

5|$|Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen {{visited the}} Soviet Union in May 1965, in which Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin warned against the {{installation}} {{and stated that}} the Soviet Union would build a counter-station. In June, the Soviet Consul in Barentsburg came on an inspection to the installation, and on 2 July a Soviet helicopter crashed at the construction site after having, presumably unintentionally, touched a mast. Soviet demands to have permanent Soviet inspectors of the facility were rejected. The Svalbard Treaty does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> verification procedure, and as such no signatories {{have the right to}} conduct inspections.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> of the practical sections that had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> activity in Washington. Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E

Its Macintosh products, including DoubleTalk, CopyAgent and RAM Doubler, were discontinued.|$|R
50|$|In March 2006, {{the monthly}} cost of FTTH was 1.990 ISK (approx 26 US dollars), <b>not</b> <b>including</b> <b>any</b> services. This was {{somewhat}} {{more expensive than}} having a phone line in the house {{which at the time}} cost 1.340 ISK (approx 18 US dollars) but because the service providers need less equipment to provide services on the FTTH network the total price of services (access network price+service price) was similar. By June 2009, the monthly cost of FTTH had risen to 2.390 ISK (approx 19 US dollars at the time), <b>not</b> <b>including</b> <b>any</b> services. By comparison, having a phone line in the house had dropped to 1.147 ISK (approx $9 US dollars) by that time. Still total service prices for consumers has remained similar.|$|R

5|$|The six {{works on}} the ballot for each {{category}} are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit {{on the number of}} stories that can be nominated. With the exception of 1956, {{the first years of the}} awards did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> recognition of runner-up novels, but since 1959 all of the candidates have been recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works in each category. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and take place in a different city around the world each year.|$|E
5|$|To get to Europe, Trotter {{posed as}} a seaman seeking work in New York, {{and got a}} job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the {{principal}} peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Low Fell has a {{population}} of 8,643. 51% of the population are female, slightly below the national average, whilst 49% are male. Only 1% of the population are from a Black or other Minority Ethnic Group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. Of the BME group in the settlement, 40% are from the Asian or AsianBritish ethnic group. Low Fell has a very low proportion of lone parent households at some 4% of all households in the settlement. This is the lowest figure in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead and compares very favourably with a Borough average of 11.5% and a national average of 9.5%. Some 26% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life indicators to indicate deprivation, does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>any</b> part of Low Fell in any of the areas marked as deprived.|$|E
