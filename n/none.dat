40|$|One-third of {{all adults}} {{under the age}} of thirty in the United States of America are ‘nones’. <b>Nones</b> include atheists, agnostics, and those who answer “nothing in particular” to {{religious}} survey questions. In this article the authors examine the rise of the <b>nones,</b> drawing upon the work of Mary Eberstadt, Charles Taylor, and Joseph Bottum. We classify the <b>nones</b> into three groups: naturalists, transcendent spiritualists, and non-transcendent spiritualists. After discussing various challenges for evangelization among the <b>nones,</b> we propose some ideas to address these challenges. Here we draw upon the work of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Jacques Maritain, and Mariano Artigas. Finally, we discuss some cultural concerns and problems that would probably result if the rise of the <b>nones</b> is left unaddressed...|$|R
