5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation,</b> the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.

40|$|We {{compared}} the incidence and site of impingement of a flexometallic tracheal tube {{with those of}} the re-usable intubating laryngeal mask (ILMA) tube in 60 anaesthetised patients undergoing <b>nasotracheal</b> fibreoptic <b>intubation</b> for oral surgery. A two-scope technique was used, observing the site of impingement with one scope whilst intubating with the other. The tubes were 6. 0 -mm in females and 6. 5 -mm in males. Impingement occurred with 10 (33 %) flexometallic and 2 (7 %) ILMA tubes (p < 0. 032). In all but one case, the impingement was posterior to the right arytenoid cartilage. When impingement was observed, a single disempaction with a 90 degrees anticlockwise rotational manoeuvre overcame impingement in every case except one, allowing successful intubation. We conclude that the incidence of impingement of the tracheal tube, and therefore of potential laryngeal trauma from <b>nasotracheal</b> fibreoptic <b>intubation,</b> is significantly greater with the flexometallic tube than with the ILMA tube...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: (1) to characterise the {{clinical}} features of acute epiglottitis in adults in Hong Kong; (2) to identify predictors for airway intervention and uneventful recovery without {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) admission. Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) was also applied in risk stratification. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 122 consecutive laryngoscopically confirmed cases admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital from 1998 to 2007. Results: The mean patient age was 51 years (range 18 - 84 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 1. 9 to 1. Sore throat, dysphagia and odynophagia were the commonest symptoms and the median MEWS on presentation was 1 (range 0 - 10). Nine patients (7. 4 %) required airway intervention (5 orotracheal <b>intubations,</b> 2 <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> and 2 tracheostomies) and one patient died. Univariate analysis showed that recurrent attack (OR 35. 0, 95 %CI 2. 77 - 442. 69, p= 0. 013), dyspnoea (OR 17. 41, 95 %CI 2. 09 - 144. 79, p= 0. 001), stridor (OR 30. 0, 95 %CI 2. 42 - 372. 65, p= 0. 016) and MEWS {{equal to or greater}} than 4 (OR 5. 81. 95 %CI 1. 16 - 29. 17, p= 0. 049) were significantly associated with airway intervention. Only stridor remained a reliable predictor in multivariate analysis (OR 88. 46, 95 %CI 5. 48 - 1427. 45, p= 0. 001). Performance of MEWS in prediction for airway intervention was evaluated with the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under curve (AUC) was 0. 71 (95 %CI 0. 503 - 0. 909). Forty-five patients did not require ICU admission (36. 9 %). Multiple logistic regression showed that absence of hoarseness (OR 3. 10, 95 %CI 1. 10 - 8. 79, p= 0. 033), absence of fever (OR 3. 2, 95 %CI 1. 25 - 8. 16, p= 0. 015) and MEWS < 1 (OR 7. 07, 95 %CI 1. 31 - 38. 07, p= 0. 023) were predictors of uneventful recovery without ICU care. Conclusion: A selective approach should be adopted in airway management but those with stridor on presentation should have their airway secured without delay. MEWS cannot replace clinical judgement but a low MEWS on presentation may help in identifying low risk patients who can be managed safely without ICU admission.

25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} (usually simply {{referred to}} as intubation), an invasive medical procedure, is the placement of a flexible plastic catheter into the trachea.

30|$|We herein report {{anesthetic}} management during {{aortic valve}} replacement for aortic valve regurgitation {{in a patient}} with adult mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS type 2) (Hunter syndrome). This disorder is rare and related to the accumulation of a mucopolysaccharide in lysosomes. It affects various organs, including the airways, heart, and central nerves. In children with MPS type 2, the risk of airway obstruction during anesthesia/sedation is high, {{and the degree of}} difficulty increases with aging. The patient described herein was a 33 -year-old male without mental retardation. Before surgery, trismus, megaloglossia, and the disturbance of cervical vertebral excursion were noted, suggesting difficulties with ventilation/intubation. Anesthesia was induced under sedation/spontaneous respiration. A laryngeal deployment was conducted using a video laryngoscope; however, the Cormack grade was III. <b>Nasotracheal</b> fiber <b>intubation</b> was performed, and airway obstruction occurred. A muscle relaxant was administered, facilitating ventilation. However, subglottic stenosis, which was not detected before the surgery, made the tracheal tube insertion difficult. Aortic valve replacement was performed without complications. A detailed postoperative examination of the airways revealed oropharyngeal soft tissue outgrowth, narrowing of the upper airway, subglottic stenosis, and displacement/circumflex of the airway axis. Either awake intubation or rapid induction can be selected for this patient; however, either way have risks of airway obstruction. It is important that strategies under light anesthesia or incomplete neuromuscular blockade should be avoided for such our patient as suggested in the JSA airway management guidelines. A preoperative multidisciplinary airway assessment and simulation are important.|$|R
30|$|The {{management}} {{protocol for}} all patients, {{regardless of the}} type of tube used, was very similar. Unless the patient had stridor or severe narrowing of the airway, <b>nasotracheal</b> or orotracheal <b>intubation</b> was performed. After oral cancer surgery, tracheostomy was performed by making a midline, 2.5 -cm transverse incision at the lower neck. Then, the strap muscles were separated, and the thyroid isthmus was divided. Tracheostomy was performed by creating a window-type opening between the third and fourth tracheal rings. Additionally, the trachea was sutured to the skin (traction suture). After dilating the openings, a tracheostomy tube of the appropriate width and length was inserted by guidance of an inner obturator. The tracheostomy tube was inserted atraumatically by the lubricated end of the tube. When the cuff was promptly inflated, the end-tidal carbon dioxide and breath sounds were assessed. A single or double cannula tracheostomy was used depending on the attending surgeon’s preference. Patients were routinely managed in an intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively.|$|R

We evaluated the success rate of AWS intubation and the incidence of difficult <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> using a modified intubation difficulty scale (IDS) to examine pre-operative characteristics and intubation profiles. Categories were difficult intubation (IDS C 5), mildly difficult (IDS = 1 – 4), and intubation without difficulty (IDS = 0).

40|$|Introduction: Blind <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>{{intubation}}</b> is an intubation method without {{observation of}} glottis {{that is used}} when the orotracheal intubation is difficult or impossible. One of the methods to minimize trauma to the nasal cavity is to soften the endotracheal tube through warming. Our aim {{in this study was}} to evaluate endotracheal intubation using endotracheal tubes softened by hot water at 50 °C and to compare the patients in terms of success rate and complications. Methods: 60 patients with ASA Class I and II scheduled to undergo elective jaw and mouth surgeries under general anesthesia were recruited. Results: success rate for Blind <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> in the control group was 70 % vs. 83. 3 % in the study group. Although the success rate in the study group was higher than the control group, this difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusion: In conclusion, our study showed that using an endotracheal tube softened by warm water could reduce the incidence and severity of epistaxis during blind nasotracheal intubation; however it could not facilitate blind <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Airtraq {{laryngoscope}} {{is a new}} intubation {{device that}} provides a non–line-of-sight view of the glottis. We evaluated this device by comparing the ease of <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> on a manikin {{with the use of}} Airtraq versus the Macintosh laryngoscope with and without Magill forceps. <b>Nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> on a manikin was performed by 20 anesthesiologists and 20 residents with the Airtraq or Macintosh laryngoscope. The mean (± SD) time required for <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> by the residents was significantly shorter with the Airtraq laryngoscope than with the Macintosh laryngoscope (16 ± 7 sec vs 22 ± 10 sec; P <. 001), but no difference in intubation time was observed between Airtraq (15 ± 11 sec) and Macintosh (13 ± 6 sec) laryngoscopy by the anesthesiologists. The Magill forceps was used more frequently to facilitate intubation with the Macintosh laryngoscope than with the Airtraq laryngoscope in both groups of operators 7 (P <. 001). The Airtraq laryngoscope scored better on the visual analog scale than did the Macintosh laryngoscope in both groups of operators (P <. 05). The Airtraq laryngoscope offers potential advantages over standard direct laryngoscopy for <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Ambu® aScop 2 (aScope 2) {{is a new}} {{disposable}} flexible videoscope, {{that has}} several advantages compared with the reusable devices. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of this device in awake <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> for patients with anticipated difficult airway and to compare the use of facilitated technique with the conventional technique in an attempt to fasten the <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> and to increase the likelihood of success. Methods: Fifty adult patients aged 18 – 45 years of ASA I–III with anticipated difficult intubation were randomly allocated into two groups of awake <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> either by the conventional technique of videoscopic <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> (C group) or by facilitated technique (F group) where a lubricated nasal tube was introduced first into nasopharynx till the mark 18 in males and 16 in females acting as a conduit for the aScope, then the aScope 2 was inserted through it to visualize the vocal cords and then advanced into the trachea, finally the nasal tube railroaded over the aScope. Times needed to visualize vocal cords (Tvc), to complete the endotracheal intubation (Tti) and the sum of both were recorded. Also number of attempts, the need of facilitating maneuver, success rate and any complications were compared. Results: The overall success rate of aScope-guided intubation was 84 % and 92 % in the control and the facilitated groups respectively with a higher 1 st attempt success rate in the facilitated group. Both Tvc and total <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> time were significantly shorter in facilitated group (156  ±  0. 81 and 198. 6  ±  0. 82  s) compared to (201. 6  ±  1. 15 and 244. 8  ±  1. 15  s) in control group. Conclusion: The aScope 2 provided a high success rate in awake <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> in patients with anticipated difficult airway and the use of a facilitated technique shortened the time needed to perform successful videoscopic intubation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Truview™ EVO 2 laryngoscope, {{with its}} unique optical lens system and blade tip angulation, has proved its {{usefulness}} in providing adequate laryngeal exposure and intubation via the oral route. However, the same {{has not been}} evaluated for <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation.</b> Aim: We evaluated the suitability of the Truview™ EVO 2 laryngoscope for <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation.</b> Methods: Fifty ASA grade I and II elective surgical patients were studied. Patients aged below 15 years or having difficult airway were excluded. Under standard anesthesia protocol, <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> was performed using a Truview™ EVO 2 laryngoscope and, in cases of inability to complete intubation in three attempts, the Macintosh laryngoscope was used. Time taken for intubation, use of Magill′s forceps and need for optimization maneuvers were noted. The primary outcome was percentage of successful intubation, while hemodynamic changes and duration of intubation were taken as secondary outcomes. Results: Majority (94 %) could be intubated successfully with the Truview™ EVO 2 laryngoscope. Average time taken for intubation was 50. 1 s. The hemodynamic changes were not clinically significant. Regression analysis revealed lack of association between duration of intubation and hemodynamic changes. There were no serious complications. Conclusion: The Truview™ EVO 2 laryngoscope is a useful tool in performing <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>intubation,</b> ensuring {{a high level of}} success rate among patients with normal airway anatomy...|$|E
