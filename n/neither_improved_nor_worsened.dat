40|$|Short chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFAs) {{produced}} by intestinal microbes mediate anti-inflammatory effects, but whether they impact on antimicrobial host defenses remains largely unknown. This {{is of particular}} concern {{in light of the}} attractiveness of developing SCFA-mediated therapies and considering that SCFAs work as inhibitors of histone deacetylases which are known to interfere with host defenses. Here we show that propionate, one of the main SCFAs, dampens the response of innate immune cells to microbial stimulation, inhibiting cytokine and NO production by mouse or human monocytes/macrophages, splenocytes, whole blood and, less efficiently, dendritic cells. In proof of concept studies, propionate <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsened</b> morbidity and mortality parameters in models of endotoxemia and infections induced by gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Candida albicans. Moreover, propionate did not impair the efficacy of passive immunization and natural immunization. Therefore, propionate has no significant impact on host susceptibility to infections and the establishment of protective anti-bacterial responses. These data support the safety of propionate-based therapies, either via direct supplementation or via the diet/microbiota, to treat non-infectious inflammation-related disorders, without increasing the risk of infection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Short-term {{consumption}} of a high-fat diet impairs exercise capacity in both rats and humans, and increases {{expression of the}} mitochondrial uncoupling protein, UCP 3, in rodent cardiac and skeletal muscle via activation of the transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Unlike long-chain fatty acids however, medium-chain fatty acids do not activate PPARα and do not increase muscle UCP 3 expression. We therefore investigated exercise performance and cardiac mitochondrial function in rats fed a chow diet (7. 5 % kcal from fat), a long-chain triglyceride (LCT) rich diet (46 % kcal from LCTs) or a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) rich diet (46 % kcal from MCTs). Rats fed the LCT-rich diet for 15 days ran 55 % less far than they did at baseline, whereas rats fed the chow or MCT-rich diets <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsened</b> in their exercise capacities. Moreover, {{consumption of}} an LCT-rich diet increased cardiac UCP 3 expression by 35 % and decreased oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, whereas consumption of the MCT-rich diet altered neither UCP 3 expression nor oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. Our {{results suggest that the}} negative effects of short-term high-fat feeding on exercise performance are predominantly mediated by long-chain rather than medium-chain fatty acids, possibly via PPARα-dependent upregulation of UCP 3. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a study comparing B-mode acquisition and targeting (BAT) ultrasound alignments based on CT data in the postoperative setting. CT scans were obtained with a Primatom CT-on-rails on nine patients. Two CT scans were obtained each week, while setup error was minimized by BAT ultrasounds. For the first three patients, a direct comparison was performed. For the next six patients, a template based on the shifts from the week 1 CT during treatment was used for subsequent setup. Comparison of isocenter shifts between the BAT ultrasound and CT {{was made by the}} difference, absolute difference, and improvement (using CT alignments as the reference technique). A total of 90 image comparisons were made. The average interfraction motion was 3. 2 mm in the lateral, 3. 0 mm in the longitudinal, and 5. 1 mm in the AP direction. The results suggest that the CTbased ultrasound templates can improve the localization of the prostate bed when the initial displacements are greater than 4 mm. For initial displacements smaller than 4 mm, the technique <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsened</b> target localization. However, ultrasound alignments performed without the use of a template deteriorated patient positioning for two out of three patients, demonstrating that the use of a CT template was beneficial even at small initial displacements...|$|E

Since A 1 receptors are highly concentrated in the cortex of the cerebellum, we hypothesized that caffeine could potentially affect learning tasks that require the cerebellar cortex, such as eyeblink conditioning. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of low (5 mg/kg) and high (50 mg/kg) doses of caffeine, injected intraperitoneally before training, on eyeblink conditioning in mice. The results show that, at the dosages we used, caffeine affects neither the rate of acquisition, nor the timing of the onset or peak of the conditioned blink responses.

In this paper, we propose an adaptation scheme to tune a statistical MT system to a translation project using small amounts of post-edited texts, like those generated by a single user in even just one day of work. The same scheme can be applied at the larger scale in order to focus general purpose models towards the specific domain of interest. We assess our method on two domains, namely information technology and legal, and four translation directions, from English to French, Italian, Spanish and German. The main outcome is that our adaptation strategy can be very effective provided that the seed data used for adaptation is enough related to the remaining text to translate; otherwise, MT quality does <b>neither</b> <b>improve</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsen,</b> thus showing the robustness of our method...|$|R

Thus, experimentally diabetic rats were treated with P. nitens leaf extract, to observe the effects on biochemical and toxicological marker variables. Streptozotocin-diabetic rats (50 mg/kg body weight) were given ethanolic extract of the leaves (76 mg suspended in 0. 5 mL of 10 % aqueous glycerine per rat) (DP) by gavage, twice a day for 32 days. Diabetic controls were given 0. 5 mL of 10 % glycerine (DG), insulin (2. 5 U in 0. 3 mL s. c.) (DI) or 0. 5 ml water (DW). Initial glycemia was 537. 11 +/- 10. 35 mg/dL. Each week or fortnight after the treatment glucose, urea and protein contents were determined in the urine and glycemia and alkaline phosphatase activity in the serum.

40|$|Infection {{with the}} {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma cruzi {{results in a}} robust and multifaceted immune response that controls parasite load but is unable to completely clear infection, resulting in parasite persistence and a chronic illness known as Chagas' disease in humans. The severity of Chagas' disease is correlated with persistent parasitism of muscle, neuronal, and gut tissues. The natural immunomodulatory function of endogenous CD 4 + CD 25 + regulatory T cells (Treg cells) to limit hyperactive immune responses may be exploited by microbes to persist despite host responses. In this study, we show that Treg cells are not necessary for T. cruzi evasion of immune responses during acute or chronic infection. In vivo anti-CD 25 monoclonal antibody-mediated depletion of Treg cells from mice prior to challenge with a lethal strain or prior to and during acute infection with a nonlethal strain of parasite <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsened</b> the outcome of immune responses: differences in parasitemia, kinetics of antigen-specific CD 8 + T-cell expansion, and CD 8 + T-cell effector function (both in vivo and ex vivo) were of similar magnitudes for both depleted and control groups. Furthermore, depletion of CD 25 + cells from chronically infected mice did not enhance immune responses of muscle-derived CD 8 + T cells, nor could FoxP 3 mRNA/scurfin-expressing leukocytes be isolated from muscle tissue.

Methods and results: Data were obtained prospectively from the SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Register) and the RIKS-HIA (Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions) about 94 consecutive patients with CS due to STEMI. Patients were classified into levosimendan-mandatory and levosimendan-contraindicated cohorts. Inotropic support with levosimendan was mandatory in all patients between January 2004 and December 2005 (n = 46). After the SURVIVE and REVIVE II studies were presented, levosimendan was considered contraindicated and was not used in consecutive patients between December 2005 and December 2006 (n = 48). The cohorts were similar with respect to pre-treatment characteristics and concomitant medications. There was no difference in the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation, in-hospital cardiac arrest and length of stay at the coronary care unit. There was no difference in adjusted mortality at 30 days and at one year.

Methods: A consecutive series of 9600 patients who underwent CABG {{using a variety of}} revascularization methods between 1971 and 1992 were followed with 99. 9 % success. A multivariable time-related analysis was performed. Patient-specific predictions and nomograms were constructed from it to explore and validate the influences and interdependences of patient-variables with variations in details of the procedure. Results: The 1 -, 10 - and 20 -year risk-unadjusted survival was 97, 81 and 50 % respectively. Patient-variables influencing early survival included severity of symptoms, patient presentation and extent of coronary disease, while late survival was influenced importantly by left ventricular function and cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidity. Technical details of the operation influencing early survival included use of endarterectomy, while details such as use of arterial grafting, extensiveness of sequential grafting, completeness of revascularization and extent of grafting to small coronaries influenced late survival to a highly variable degree. Conclusion: The early survival is <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsened</b> by single, multiple, sequential or complete arterial coronary reconstruction. The late survival is modestly improved with the use of an arterial graft to a major vessel, preferably but not exclusively to the anterior descendens, except for patients with limited life-expectancy. Differences in time-related survival with and without an arterial graft are nearly the same across all levels of ejection fraction. No late beneficial or detrimental effect was identified with more extensive use of arterial reconstructive surgery in multisystem disease. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerotic disease {{progression}} is mediated in part, by immunological mechanisms. In recent years, interest has increased towards {{the prospect of}} modulating these immune mechanisms through vaccination to ameliorate the course of disease. Patients with lupus are at a significantly higher risk for accelerated atherosclerosis and related complications. The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the outcome of immunization in mouse models of lupus, and lupus with accelerated atherosclerosis. MATERIALS/METHODS: Atherosclerosis-prone apoE^-/- mice and autoimmune gld mice were previously crossed to generate the gld. apoE^-/- mouse. Mice were treated with an apoB- 100 -derived vaccine, Alum (adjuvant control), or PBS control. The antibody response was determined by quantifying the amount of circulating anti-apoB 100. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were analyzed. Kidney tissue from gld and gld. apoE^-/- mice was processed and histologically analyzed, using glomerular tuft size as a measure of renal disease and by extension, autoimmune disease severity. Results: Immunization led to a pronounced initial antibody response that was decreased by the endpoint of the study. No significant differences in serum triglyceride or cholesterol were observed regardless of treatment. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in glomerular tuft size. Conclusion: The data suggests that immunization with an apoB- 100 - derived vaccine <b>neither</b> <b>improves</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsens</b> autoimmune disease severity in the gld. apoE^-/- mouse model. It also appears that immunization is tolerated in the autoimmune background. While further study is necessary to determine the efficacy of immunization in reducing atherosclerotic disease in this model, this may be a possible therapy to lower incidence of atherosclerosis in lupus patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis has been to investigate novel host material configurations for high-power end-pumped Er-Yb co-doped, or Yb doped microchip lasers and try to increase their performance. In Er-Yb co-doped systems, the main limitation is the thermal shortcomings of the phosphate glass host material. The thesis presents some novel results {{that contribute to the}} search for a crystalline replacement. In Yb doped systems, most end-pumped schemes reported have been using relatively low-power single-emitter diodes. The thesis presents experiments with Yb:KGW microchips end-pumped by high-power diode bars. Another common limitation of end-pumped Yb microchip lasers is the thermal lens that destabilizes the cavity and decreases the beam quality. The approach to reduce the thermal lens by using an athermal propagation direction has been evaluated and the results are presented in the thesis. In the search for a crystalline host material for Er-Yb systems, borates have been found increasingly interesting. Consequently, we started out by investigating Gadolinium-calcium-oxoborate, GdCOB, which could be grown in platinum crucibles. It was found that the cw performance of such monolithic microchips is quite comparable to glass hosts in terms of slope efficiency, but the threshold is significantly larger. As for Q-switched performance, which is essential to most Er-Yb applications, the first efficient Q-switched results with a crystalline host is presented in the thesis. Similar to the cw regime, the slope efficiencies are comparable to glass, while the threshold is quite high. However, the perhaps most important parameter, maximum output power before thermal fracture, is <b>neither</b> significantly <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> <b>worsened</b> compared with phosphate glass. This is believed to be due to higher threshold and a stronger thermal expansion that negates the benefit of a thermal conductivity that is only 2 - 3 times higher. To find a host material that could withstand higher pump powers, we turned our attention to the double-tungstates KGW and KYW, which have higher thermal conductivity and higher cross-sections. They have, however, energy level lifetimes which differ significantly from glass or borates and as a consequence, a thorough spectroscopic investigation has been undertaken to optimize dopant concentrations. Laser experiments on crystals with dopant concentrations based on this investigation are expected in the near future. When pumping Yb:KGW with a high-power diode bar, we achieved output powers of 9 – 12. 4 W under different experimental conditions with incident powers of 18. 3 – 26 W. The incident power of 26 W in one design was enough to fracture the crystal. Using a crystal cut for propagation along an athermal direction and comparing it with an identical b-cut crystal, we found that the thermal lens in the athermally oriented crystal was about a factor two weaker at the same absorbed power.

40|$|Abstract. When {{constructing}} biologically inspired algorithms, important {{properties to}} consider are openness, diversity, interaction, structure and scale. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the property of diversity. Introducing diversity into biologically inspired paradigms is a key feature of their success. Within the field of Artificial Immune Systems, little {{attention has been paid to}} this issue. Typically, techniques of diversity introduction, such as simple random number generation, are employed with little or no consideration to the application area. Using function optimisation as a case study, we propose a simple immune inspired mutation operator that is tailored to the problem at hand. We incorporate this diversity operator into a well known immune inspired algorithm, aiNet. Through this approach, we show that it is possible to improve the search capability of aiNet on hard to locate optima. We further illustrate that by incorporating the same mutation operator into aiNet when applied to clustering, it is observed that performance is <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> sacrificed. ...|$|R
40|$|Learning and {{teaching}} experiment {{was designed to}} incorporate SRS Student Response System to measure and assess student engagement in higher education for level 5 engineering students. The SRS system was based on getting an immediate student feedback to short quizzes lasting 10 to 15 minutes using Socrative software. The structure of the questions was a blend of true or false, multiple choice and short answer questions. The experiment was conducted through semester 2 of yearlong engineering module. The outcome of the experiment was analyzed quantitatively based on student performance and qualitatively through student questionnaire. The results indicate that using student paced assessments method using Socrative enhanced students performance. The results showed that 53 % of the students improved their performance while 23 % <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> underperformed. Qualitative data showed students felt improvement in their learning experience. Overall results indicate positive impact using this technology {{in teaching and learning}} for engineering modules in higher educatio...|$|R

Res. 19 (3) : 677 – 683. 2005. —The {{purposes of this}} study were to clarify the effects of static stretching for 30 seconds and dynamic stretching on leg extension power. Eleven healthy male students took part in this study. Each subject performed static stretching and dynamic stretching on the 5 muscle groups in the lower limbs and nonstretching on separate days. Leg extension power was measured before and after the static stretching, dynamic stretching, and nonstretching. No significant difference was found between leg extension power after static stretching (1788. 5 ± 85. 7 W) and that after nonstretching (1784. 8 ± 108. 4 W). On the other hand, leg extension power after dynamic stretching (2022. 3 ± 121. 0 W) was significantly (p < 0. 01) greater than that after nonstretching. These results suggest that static stretching for 30 seconds <b>neither</b> <b>improves</b> <b>nor</b> reduces muscular performance and that dynamic stretching enhances muscular performance...|$|R

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} revolutionary crew-vehicle interface technologies that strive to proactively overcome aircraft safety barriers {{that would otherwise}} constrain the full realization {{of the next generation}} air transportation system. A piloted simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the complementary use of Synthetic and Enhanced Vision technologies. Specific focus was placed on new techniques for integration and/or fusion of Enhanced and Synthetic Vision and its impact within a two-crew flight deck during low-visibility approach and landing operations. Overall, the experimental data showed that significant improvements in situation awareness, without concomitant increases in workload and display clutter, could be provided by the integration and/or fusion of synthetic and enhanced vision technologies for the pilot-flying and the pilot-not-flying. Improvements in lateral path control performance were realized when the Head-Up Display concepts included a tunnel, independent of the imagery (enhanced vision or fusion of enhanced and synthetic vision) presented with it. During non-normal operations, the ability of the crew to handle substantial navigational errors and runway incursions were <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> adversely impacted by the display concepts. The addition of Enhanced Vision may not, of itself, provide an improvement in runway incursion detection without being specifically tailored for this application...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{pilot study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{feasibility}} and effectiveness of a falls-prevention programme for older people with dementia from predominantly an Italian background. The study had a single group pretest- posttest design and enrolled 64 community-dwelling older people with dementia; 6 -month follow-up data were available for 32 participants. The falls-prevention programme was embedded in a healthy lifestyle dementia respite programme, which combined day respite with preventative health programmes. A comprehensive falls risk assessment was conducted for each client to develop an individualised falls and injury management plan that included a tailored exercise programme to improve strength and balance. Outcome measurements were fall status, cognitive function (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), balance (Berg Balance Scale, BBS) and aerobic capacity (6 -minute walk test). There {{were no significant differences}} between baseline and 6 -month measures for the number of fallers, BBS, MMSE or 6 -minute walk test (n = 32; p > 0. 05), indicating that participants <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> declined significantly. A feasible method of delivering falls prevention services to older people with dementia has been developed. There is a need for further investigation to establish the effectiveness of this method...|$|R
40|$|Rule-Based Forecasting (RBF) is {{an expert}} system that uses {{judgment}} to develop and apply rules for combining extrapolations. The judgment comes from two sources, forecasting expertise and domain knowledge. Forecasting expertise is based on {{more than a half}} century of research. Domain knowledge is obtained in a structured way; one example of domain knowledge is managers = expectations about trends, which we call “causal forces. ” Time series are described in terms of 28 conditions, which are used to assign weights to extrapolations. Empirical results on multiple sets of time series show that RBF produces more accurate forecasts than those from traditional extrapolation methods or equal-weights combined extrapolations. RBF is most useful when it is based on good domain knowledge, the domain knowledge is important, the series is well behaved (such that patterns can be identified), there is a strong trend in the data, and the forecast horizon is long. Under ideal conditions, the error for RBF’s forecasts were one-third less than those for equal-weights combining. When these conditions are absent, RBF <b>neither</b> <b>improves</b> <b>nor</b> harms forecast accuracy. Some of RBF’s rules can be used with traditional extrapolation procedures. In a series o...|$|R

My pillow was then softened by the hand of affection, and all the little cares which were put in exercise to soothe the languor or pain were more flattering and pleasing than {{the consequences of the}} illness were disagreeable. It was a new sense to be watched and attended, and I {{used to think}} that the Malade imaginaire gained something by his humour. It is different in the latter stages. The old post-chaise gets more shattered and out of order at every turn; windows will not be pulled up; doors refuse to open, or being open will not shut again--which last is rather my case. There is some new subject of complaint every moment; your sicknesses come thicker and thicker; your comforting or sympathising friends fewer and fewer; for why should they sorrow for the course of nature? The recollection of youth, health, and uninterrupted powers of activity, <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> enjoyed, is a poor strain of comfort. The best is, the long halt will arrive at last, and cure all.|$|R
