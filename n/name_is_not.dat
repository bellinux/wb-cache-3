5|$|Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{recorded}} {{in any of}} the early inventories, the style of her dress has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of van der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E

5|$|Charles Scott {{was born}} in 1739, {{probably}} in April, {{in the part of}} Goochland County, Virginia, that is now Powhatan County. His father, Samuel Scott, was a farmer and member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. His mother, whose <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, died most likely around 1745. Scott had an older brother, John, and three younger siblings, Edward, Joseph, and Martha. He received only a basic education from his parents and in the rural Virginia schools near his home.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Lee (II) (born May 15, 1995 in Tala, Jalisco, Mexico) is a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked {{professional}} wrestler {{currently working}} for the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) portraying a tecnico ("Good guy") wrestling character.

Rædwald used the letters R and E when naming two of his own sons, (as did his own father when he and his younger brother Eni were named), which {{suggests}} that Eorpwald was the younger sibling and would only have become Rædwald's heir after his elder brother Rægenhere was slain in battle in 616.|$|E

5|$|In the Prose Edda, Sif {{is named}} {{as the mother}} of the goddess Þrúðr by Thor and of Ullr with a father whose <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recorded. The Prose Edda also recounts that Sif once had her hair shorn by Loki, and that Thor forced Loki to have a golden {{headpiece}} made for Sif, resulting in not only Sif's golden tresses but also five other objects for other gods.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of Eardwulf's family, though his father, also named Eardwulf, {{is known to}} have been a nobleman. Eardwulf was married by the time he became king, though his wife's <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recorded. It is possible he later wed an illegitimate daughter of Charlemagne. In 798, early in his reign, Eardwulf fought a battle at Billington Moor against a nobleman named Wada, who had been one of those who killed King Æthelred. Wada was defeated and driven into exile. In 801, Eardwulf led an army against Coenwulf of Mercia, perhaps because of Coenwulf's support for other claimants to the Northumbrian throne.|$|E

5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route421 (NY421) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located within Adirondack Park in the southeastern corner of St. Lawrence County, New York, in the United States.

5|$|The {{first episode}} starts with Kills furiously {{walking with a}} {{revolver}} in direction of a blonde man; she later ties him up on a bed, as he screams and tries to resist.

During the second episode, Kills assassinates another man and takes his photograph; the next episode, she is arrested by a group—played by Far East Movement—who threaten her. She manages to strangle {{the leader of the}} group, and later leaves a message for her anonymous friend, warning him that her face is being distributed on wanted posters.|$|E
5|$|Although Germanus's <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Anglo-Saxon, Byrhtferth, a {{contemporary}} {{who wrote the}} Vita Oswaldi, which contains much information on Germanus, states {{that he was a}} native of Winchester. Germanus accompanied Oscytel, the Archbishop of York, and Oswald of Worcester, on their trip to Rome in about 957, purportedly to collect Oscytel's pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. This journey, however, has been challenged by the historian Donald Bullough, who argues that no previous archbishops of York had collected their palliums in person. He also points out that this story is only related in the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis, the chronicle of the Ramsey Abbey. According to the Ramsey story, Oscytel and Oswald returned to England, but Germanus remained on the continent and became a monk at Fleury Abbey in France. Another story has Oswald journeying to Fleury on his own, with Germanus arriving at Fleury after Oswald had been resident at Fleury {{for a number of years}} prior to 958.|$|E

5|$|Although {{some historians}} have {{identified}} Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> found in the Club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp is {{sometimes}} known as Walter de Beauchamp of Elmley, to distinguish {{him from the}} members of the Beauchamp family of Bedford. He married the daughter of Urse d'Abetot, who is usually named Emeline, although her <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> given in contemporary records. Urse d'Abetot was the Sheriff of Worcestershire from around 1069 to around 1108. Beauchamp may have been a tenant of his father-in-law prior to his marriage. Nothing is known for sure of Beauchamp's background, and he first witnessed a royal charter sometime between 1108 and 1111. Some documents suggest that his father may have been named Peveral de Beauchamp and that he had a brother named William Peveral de Beauchamp, but the only identifiable Peveral is younger than Walter.|$|E
