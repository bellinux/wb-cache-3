5|$|Government {{estimates}} from 2003 put the literacy rate at 98.6 percent, with <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sexes. Educational standards have been traditionally high, although {{still far from}} European benchmarks and in continuing deterioration for the past decade. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring {{in the world in}} terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had deteriorated. State expenditures for education are far below the European Union average. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. Bulgaria ranked 45th out of 72 countries surveyed. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. The State provides free education in primary and secondary public schools. The educational process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. High schools can be technical, vocational, general or specialised in a certain discipline, while higher education consists of a 4-year bachelor degree and a 1-year master's degree.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, there was <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

25|$|In {{multiple}} studies, neuroticism {{has been}} shown to have an equal, if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than extraversion. One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability (neuroticism). The results showed <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, neuroticism appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well-being.|$|E
25|$|Dating {{violence}} is fairly prevalent within adolescent relationships. When surveyed, 10-45% of adolescents reported having experienced physical {{violence in the}} context of a relationship while a quarter to a third of adolescents reported having experiencing psychological aggression. This reported aggression includes hitting, throwing things, or slaps, although most of this physical aggression does not result in a medical visit. Physical aggression in relationships tends to decline from high school through college and young adulthood. In heterosexual couples, there is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rates of male and female aggressors, unlike in adult relationships.|$|E

25|$|Slovenia {{is among}} the European {{countries}} with the most pronounced ageing of population, ascribable to a low birth rate and increasing life expectancy. Almost all Slovenian inhabitants older than 64 are retired, with <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> genders. The working-age group is diminishing in spite of immigration. The proposal to raise the retirement age from the current 57 for women and 58 for men was rejected in a referendum in 2011. In addition, the difference among the genders regarding life expectancy is still significant. The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2014 was estimated at 1.33 children born/woman, which {{is lower than the}} replacement rate of 2.1. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (in 2016, 58.6% of all births were outside of marriage).|$|E
25|$|Although SDN is much {{related to}} sexual partner {{preferences}} in males, {{it does not}} show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite {{for the expression of}} male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preferences in females. One piece of evidence comes from the study on female Japanese macaque, which routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrust), compete for, and even prefer certain female sexual partners over certain males. The part of the brain examined is the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), a homologue of SDN-POA. Comparison of the AHdc nucleus volumes between Japanese macaque and rhesus macaque (a closely related sister species of Japanese macaque) shows that there is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> volume of AHdc in more male-typical macaques and that in female-typical macaques.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Nancy Drew {{has gone through}} many permutations over the years. The Nancy Drew Mystery series was revised beginning in 1959; with commentators agreeing that Nancy's character changed significantly from the original Nancy of the books written in the 1930s and 1940s. Commentators also often see {{a difference between the}} Nancy Drew of the original series, the Nancy of The Nancy Drew Files, and the Nancy of Girl Detective series. Nevertheless, some commentators find <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> different permutations of Nancy Drew, finding Nancy to be simply a good role model for girls. Despite revisions, [...] "hat hasn't changed, however, are [...] basic values, her goals, her humility, and her magical gift for having at least nine lives. For more than six decades, her essence has remained intact." [...] Nancy is a [...] "teen detective queen" [...] who [...] "offers girl readers something more than action-packed adventure: she gives them something original. Convention has it that girls are passive, respectful, and emotional, but with the energy of a girl shot out of a cannon, Nancy bends conventions and acts out every girl's fantasies of power." ...|$|E
