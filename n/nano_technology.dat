2500|$|In February 2011, {{the airline}} painted eight of its {{aircraft}} with a lightweight, thin [...] "revolutionary <b>nano</b> <b>technology</b> coating" [...] polymer. It works by reducing build-up of debris and reduces drag {{across the surface}} of the aircraft, thus reducing the fuel bill. It was estimated the airline could save 1–2% annually, equating to a £14million reduction in fuel costs. The coating has already been used on US military aircraft and if successful easyJet would apply the paint to its whole fleet.|$|E
