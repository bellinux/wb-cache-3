5|$|Rademacher {{envisioned the}} {{founding}} of a European bank that would ultimately liquidate all European Jewish assets {{to pay for the}} plan. This bank would then play an intermediary role between Madagascar {{and the rest of the}} world, as Jews would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> interact financially with outsiders. Göring's office of the Four Year Plan would oversee the administration of the plan's economics.|$|E
5|$|The Nafana {{people say}} that they come from a village called Kakala in Ivory Coast. Their oral history says {{that some of their}} people are still there, and if they go back they will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave again. They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from Begho (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} borrow from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only {{as part of the}} British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 it was {{announced}} that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place. The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it {{was announced}} that alcohol would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.|$|E

5|$|Official scorers {{are only}} {{occasionally}} terminated, {{but there have}} been cases when a scorer was replaced after making decisions which displeased the home team. In 1992 the Seattle Mariner players signed a petition to have their official scorer replaced, and in 2001 the management of the Boston Red Sox ordered that a rookie scorer <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> score another game after pitcher Hideo Nomo lost a no-hitter on a close play in right field that was ruled a hit rather than an error.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
5|$|The {{salary of}} the mayor was set at $100,464 in 2003. In March 2012, the city's Salary Setting Commission {{proposed}} that the mayor be paid $235,000, but the city council unanimously rejected the recommendation, instead keeping the salary at the 2003 level. In March 2014, the Salary Setting Commission recommended no pay increase for the mayor or city council. Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> benefit from the increase. This recommendation {{was approved by the}} city council in a 5–3 vote in favor of the changes.|$|E

5|$|Wales did not field an {{international}} team until the IRFB, {{supported by the}} RFU, recommended that the WFU be readmitted into the organisation in February 1898. The WFU agreed that they would in future abide by all IRFB by-laws, and that Gould <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> play in any future internationals. Gould accepted the ruling but returned to rugby as a referee and Welsh international selector. The compromise prevented a long term split in the sport, and by 1901 the IRFB added laws to the game banning professionalism to clarify their authority on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{revived the}} scheme of his predecessor, Baldwin of Forde, to found a church in Canterbury that would be secular and not monastic. He promised that the new foundation's canons would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> vote in archiepiscopal {{elections}} nor would the body of Saint Thomas Becket ever be moved to the new church, but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy. The dispute {{from the time of}} Baldwin of Forde flared up again, with the papacy supporting the monks and the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope Innocent III ruled for the monks and ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2009 International Bowl following a 7–5 regular season where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No.12 and undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from the university to be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two African-American members of the team would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> play because of segregation, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50years later.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman {{into a public}} limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of the}} restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E

5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} to perceived discrimination against First Nations people by the Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria to seek redress. The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after {{the charges against him}} were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake {{on the part of the}} Company's chief Factors.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> go with her.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E
