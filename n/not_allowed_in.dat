5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E

Trapping is <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> Oregon, where western painted turtle populations are in decline, and in Missouri, where there are populations of both southern and western subspecies. In Canada, Ontario protects both subspecies present, the midland and western, and British Columbia protects its dwindling western painted turtles.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor is}} elected in citywide {{election}}. Elections follow a two-round system. The {{first round of}} the election is called the primary election. The top-two candidates from the primary election advance to a runoff election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.|$|E
5|$|A Bowls club is in Chew Stoke, cricket {{pitches and}} teams in Chew Magna and Blagdon. There are {{football}} {{teams in the}} valley including Chew Valley Football Club and Bishop Sutton F.C..

Both Chew Valley Lake and Blagdon Lake provide extensive fishing under permit from Bristol Water. The River Chew and most of its tributaries also have fishing but this is generally under licences to local angling clubs. Chew Valley Sailing Club is situated on Chew Valley Lake and provides dinghy sailing at all levels and hosts national and international competitions. Swimming is <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> the lakes and there are no swimming pools in the valley; however these are available locally in Bristol, Bath, Cheddar and Midsomer Norton.|$|E

5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E
5|$|Rubin {{studied for}} her Ph.D. at Georgetown University, the only {{university}} in Washington, DC that offered {{a graduate degree}} in astronomy. She was 23 years old and pregnant when she began her doctoral studies, and the Rubins had one young child at home. She began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended her to George Gamow, her eventual doctoral advisor. Her dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades. Throughout her graduate studies, she experienced discouraging sexism, including an incident where she {{was not allowed to}} meet with her advisor in his office, because women were <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> that area of the university.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondent}} Michael Alvarado {{agreed to}} help his friend Paul Soto steal a truck {{in the parking lot}} of a shopping mall in Santa Fe Springs, California. Soto pulled out a gun and approached the driver of the truck, demanding the keys, while Alvarado hid by the driver's side door. The driver refused and was shot and killed by Soto. Afterwords, Alvarado helped hide the gun. Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective Cheryl Comstock led the investigation of the crime. During the investigation Comstock contacted Alvarado's parents, saying that she wished to speak with Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station to be interviewed. Comstock brought Alvarado into an interview room and questioned him for two hours. Alvarado's parents asked to be present during the interview but were <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> by police. Alvarado admitted during questions that he had helped his friend try to steal the truck and that he had helped hide the gun.|$|E

5|$|Although still {{abundant}} at Cocos Island {{and other}} relatively pristine sites, grey reef sharks {{are susceptible to}} localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate, specific habitat requirements, and tendency to stay within a certain area. The IUCN has assessed the grey reef shark as Near Threatened; this shark is taken by multispecies fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal. Another threat is the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson et al. (1998) reported, in the Chagos Archipelago, grey reef shark numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14% of 1970s levels. Robbins et al. (2006) found grey reef shark populations in Great Barrier Reef fishing zones had declined by 97% compared to no-entry zones (boats are <b>not</b> <b>allowed).</b> <b>In</b> addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as fishing zones, illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures. One possible avenue for conservation is ecotourism, as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark-watching ventures, and profitable diving sites now enjoy protection in many countries, such as the Maldives.|$|E
