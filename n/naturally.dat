5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur <b>naturally,</b> {{but may also}} be used as biological pesticides. When <b>naturally</b> occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.|$|E

5|$|There are 35 known {{isotopes}} of molybdenum, {{ranging in}} atomic mass from 83 to 117, {{as well as}} four metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur <b>naturally,</b> with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these <b>naturally</b> occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of wild red-billed chough arrived <b>naturally</b> in Cornwall in 2001, and nested in the {{following}} year. This was the first English breeding record since 1947, and a slowly expanding population has bred every subsequent year.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one <b>naturally</b> {{occurring}} radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur <b>naturally,</b> and all isotopes of francium are radioactive. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no <b>naturally</b> occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|Any {{astatine}} {{present at}} {{the formation of the}} Earth has long since disappeared; the four <b>naturally</b> occurring isotopes (astatine-215, -217, -218 and -219) are instead continuously produced {{as a result of the}} decay of radioactive thorium and uranium ores, and trace quantities of neptunium-237. The landmass of North and South America combined, to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contains only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time (around 3.5 × 10−10 grams). Astatine-217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium-237. Primordial remnants of the latter isotope—due to its relatively short half-life of 2.14 million years—are no longer present on Earth. However, trace amounts occur <b>naturally</b> as a product of transmutation reactions in uranium ores. Astatine-218 was the first astatine isotope discovered in nature. Astatine-219, with a half-life of 56 seconds, is the longest lived of the <b>naturally</b> occurring isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is {{the rarest}} <b>naturally</b> {{occurring}} element. The {{total amount of}} astatine in the Earth's crust (quoted mass 2.36 × 1025 grams) {{is estimated to be}} less than one gram at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from <b>naturally</b> occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium did occur <b>naturally</b> in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur <b>naturally,</b> although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most <b>naturally</b> diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic {{table in a}} new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist. These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional <b>naturally</b> occurring elements. It is often stated that the last <b>naturally</b> occurring element to be discovered was francium (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939. However, plutonium, produced synthetically in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a <b>naturally</b> occurring element in 1971.|$|E

5|$|<b>Naturally</b> {{occurring}} dysprosium {{is composed}} of seven isotopes: 156Dy, 158Dy, 160Dy, 161Dy, 162Dy, 163Dy, and 164Dy. These are all considered stable, although 156Dy decays by alpha decay with a half-life of over 1×1018years. Of the <b>naturally</b> occurring isotopes, 164Dy is the most abundant at 28%, followed by 162Dy at 26%. The least abundant is 156Dy at 0.06%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Naturally</b> {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of <b>naturally</b> occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Naturally</b> {{occurring}} oxygen {{is composed}} of three stable isotopes, 16O, 17O, and 18O, with 16O being the most abundant (99.762% natural abundance).|$|E
5|$|<b>Naturally</b> {{occurring}} tungsten {{consists of}} five isotopes whose half-lives are {{so long that}} they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year. The other <b>naturally</b> occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be at least 4×1021 years.|$|E
