The first was to {{evaluate}} the correlation between antegonial <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> on panoramic and cephalometric radiographs. The second was to compare development of the antegonial notch with vertical growth in various patient groups. Methods: Longitudinal cephalograms were collected for 43 open bite (OB), 61 Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), 13 idiopathic condylar resorption (ICR), and 104 matched controls, along with 55 pairs of panoramic and cephalometric radiographs. <b>Notch</b> <b>depth,</b> mandibular plane angle and vertical facial dimensions were measured {{during a period of}} 5. 2 - 9. 5 years. Results: Antegonial <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> measured from panoramic radiographs was well correlated with cephalometric measurements. However, the regression equation cannot be validated due to inherent magnification and distortion on both image methods. At T 1, <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> was greater in patient groups than in controls. With the exception of the ICR group, <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> did not change significantly during growth. <b>Notch</b> <b>depth</b> also could not be used to predict vertical growth patterns. The ICR group was unique in having greater <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> than OB at T 1, in showing poor growth (sometimes decrease) of posterior facial height, and in having increased mandibular plane angles over time. In controls, antegonial <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> was positively correlated with vertical dimensions and mandibular plane angle. Conclusions: Panoramic radiographs cannot be substituted for cephalograms for estimating antegonial <b>notch</b> <b>depth.</b> Except in ICR, <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> is established early and maintained throughout the growth period, and therefore is not a good predictor of future vertical facial growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} {{parameters and}} fracture relational curves {{of the concrete}} containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash with different relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> of the notched beam specimens were measured by means of three-point bending method. The {{results indicate that the}} relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> of the notched specimens has great effect on ac, KICini, KICun, GF, CMODc, and the fracture relational curves of the concrete containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash. There is a tendency of increase in ac and CMODc with the increase of relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth,</b> while KICini, KICun, and GF are decreasing gradually with the increase of relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> of the notched beam specimens. Besides, when the relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> increases from 0. 2 to 0. 5, the nonlinear stage of the curve becomes shorter and shorter, and the descent stage of the curve becomes sharper and sharper. The fracture parameters of ac, KICini, KICun, GF, and CMODc and the fracture curves are sensitive to the relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth,</b> while CTODc may be not sensitive to the relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> of the specimens of the concrete containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of specimen size on fracture toughness of mild steel. Fracture toughness {{is an indication of}} the amount of stress required to propagate a pre-existing flaw. It is a very important material property since the occurrence of flaws is not completely avoidable in the processing, fabrication, service of a material or component. In this experiment, the specimen size was chosen as a main parameter to analyse the fracture toughness of mild steel. The specimen size was divided into two parameter to be investigated, there is thickness and <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> of the specimen. The specimen geometry was referred to the ASTM E 399 - 74 standard and the test applied for the fracture toughness is single edge notch bending. From the test results, when the thickness of the specimen increase the fracture decreases until the thickness reach the critical dimension and the fracture was become constant. For the <b>notch</b> <b>depth,</b> when the <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> decreases the fracture of the specimen also decreases until the <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> reach the critical dimension and the fracture toughness was become constant. The thickness and <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> of the specimen is main parameter to analyze the fracture toughness of the material or specimen because each of the specimens will reach the critical dimension and constant the fracture toughness value...|$|E
40|$|Purpose It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that femoral notching in total knee arthroplasties weakens the cortex of the femur, which can predispose to femoral fractures in the postoperative period. Some authors suggest that patients who sustain inadvertent notching should have additional {{protection in the}} postoperative period, and consideration {{should be given to}} the use of prophylactic femoral stems. In this case, a question can be raised: Is the use of femoral stem in an anterior femoral notching an effective way to reduce the fracture risk? We hypothesized that for a larger notch, the use of a femoral stem does not decrease considerably the stress-riser at the notch edge, and the use of stem is not enough {{to reduce the risk of}} fracture. Methods In the present in vitro study, twelve synthetic femurs were selected and used for the experiments under two load scenarios. Femoral components with and without femoral stems were implanted in femurs with different notch sizes to predict experimentally the strain levels at the notch edge with the use of fiber Bragg gratings and at notch region with strain gauges. Results Despite the global strain reduction in stemmed condition, at the notch edge, the strain behavior was dissimilar for the different <b>notch</b> <b>depths.</b> For <b>notch</b> <b>depths</b> lower than 5 mm, the use of stem reduces the strain level at the notch edge to values below the intact femur condition, while for depths greater or equal to 5 mm, the strain levels at the notch edge were higher than the intact femur condition with values ranging from ? 10 to ? 189 %. Conclusions The present study suggests the use of a prophylactic stem for <b>notch</b> <b>depths</b> greater than 5 mm. For <b>notch</b> <b>depths</b> below 5 mm, the fracture risk due to strain increase at the notch edge seems to be low in the stemless condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The stress {{concentration}} phenomenon around holes in rotated components is discussed. Firstly, {{finite element analysis}} of a simplified model of turbine disc flange is carried out, and then a method is developed by designing an intended-cut notch on the model to reduce the stress around the pin hole. Furthermore, two characteristic parameters which determine {{the configuration of the}} notch, namely <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> and arc length parameter, are investigated by changing the notch dimensions. The results show that this method can reduce the stress around the hole significantly, <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> and arc length have an important impact on the {{stress concentration}} factor (SCF), the SCF decreases with the increase of <b>notch</b> <b>depth,</b> and increasing the arc length within a critical scope results in the decrease of the SCF...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} the {{occurrence}} of distal femoral fracture after total knee arthroplasty include osteopaenia, osteoporosis, anterior femoral notching, total knee revision arthroplasty and severe neurological disorders. Some investigators suggest that patients who sustain inadvertent notching should have additional protection in the postoperative period, and that consideration {{should be given to}} the use of prophylactic femoral stem extensions as a way to bypass the stress-riser of the anterior notch. In this particular case, one question concerning the structural aspects of the use of prophylactic femoral stems in inadvertent notching can be raised, namely, what is the range of notch size where the use of a femoral stem can be useful to reduce fracture risk? The insight offered by the present study through the use of finite element models suggests an increase of risk of supracondylar fracture for <b>notch</b> <b>depths</b> greater than 4 mm. The use of a femoral stem reduces the peak strains within the notch region and consequently reduces the risk of bone fracture, however the use of a stem also reduces strains in the other bone regions, which can promote osteopaenia. The use of prophylactic stems for <b>notch</b> <b>depths</b> greater than 4 mm is helpful and should be considered in cases where the bone quality is good. In the cases of a notch deeper than 4 mm in patients with evident signs of osteopaenia, the use of a stem should be avoided {{and it seems to be}} prudent to protect such a patient’s implant from bearing weight...|$|R

Bilateral audiograms from 1, 000, 001 veterans were obtained from Department of Veterans Affairs archives; after “cleaning” algorithms were applied, 744, 553 participants (mean age = 63. 5 yr) were included in the 4, 000 Hz notch analysis (group 1) and 539, 932 participants (mean age = 62. 2 yr) were included in the 3, 000, 4, 000, and/or 6, 000 Hz notch analysis (group 2). A notch was defined when the threshold at the notch frequency (3, 000, 4, 000, or 6, 000 Hz) minus the 2, 000 Hz threshold and the threshold at the notch frequency minus the 8, 000 Hz threshold both were greater than or equal to 10 dB.

These equations are replaced by a system of simultaneous algebraic equations and solved by a successive approximation method employing Prandtl-Reuss incremental plasticity relations. The method is first applied to number of elasto-static problems and the results compared with available solutions. Good agreement is obtained in all cases.

40|$|AbstractThe {{determination}} of the failure load for brittle or quasi-brittle specimens containing a re-entrant corner has been faced by several authors, whose approaches {{are available in the}} Scientific Literature. However, up to now, little {{attention has been paid to}} the presence of a minimum, i. e. an angle at which the critical load attains its minimum value. Even if the minimum was detected in several experiments, it was not highlighted or it was considered as a mere consequence of the scattering of experimental data. Restricting the analysis to a sharp V-notched infinite slab under a remote tensile load, the problem is fully investigated in this paper. It is shown that a minimum, more or less pronounced according to the brittleness number, is always present. It means that the edge crack is not the most dangerous configuration, although the notch opening angle providing the minimum failure load tends to vanish for large <b>notch</b> <b>depths</b> as well as for very brittle materials...|$|R

Then, the evolution of the FPZ was quantitatively described. It was found that length of the FPZ is not a material parameter; it is greatly influenced by the specimen size. But in a relative sense, the influence of the specimen size can be eliminated. Also, the evolution of the FPZ in specimens of different sizes is almost the same. When the crack length is small, the FPZ increases linearly with the crack extension. As the crack extends to half of the ligament, the FPZ reaches its maximum size. Thereafter, the FPZ moves ahead and shrinks, but the ratio of its length to {{the length of the}} residual ligament remains constant, approximately equal to 0. 77...|$|R

Excessive forces, vibrations, and surface contact involved with these methods can cause undesirable side-wall chipping and microcracking, which often translates to inoperable devices. Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) offers an alternative technique for die separation with less mechanical force. The DRIE process may be used to either introduce notches in one uniform step that allow for die separation via fracture in three-point bending, or to directly separate the dies by etching completely through the substrate. This work presents an analysis of the stress concentrations due to DRIE etched notches and the bending stress required to achieve die separation. The defect rate and die strength associated with DRIE-based die separated is compared with traditional saw methods for a variety of <b>notch</b> <b>depths.</b> Results indicate that the DRIE-based separation technique offers modest advantages over the traditional methods, but can also greatly reduce strength if the protective mask is over etched. It will also show that shallow trenches formed by a mechanical dicing saw resulted in stronger die than deeper trenches...|$|R

Persistent slip bands developed at the surface of the specimens led to the crack initiation. At lower stress levels, shallow persistent slip bands were found at the surface of the specimens, and the fatigue limit was obtained. Notched specimens showed lower fatigue lives. Notched specimens with higher stress concentration factor (Kt) showed higher fatigue strength reduction factor (Kf). It was found that shallow <b>notches</b> of <b>depth</b> ~ 100 [*]µm may reduce the fatigue life substantially...|$|R
