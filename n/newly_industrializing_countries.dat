40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} for the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> toward trade liberalization is that technology spillover from exporting the high-tech intermediate goods will benefit the final goods production in other developing countries. Furthermore, those developing countries will then compete with the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> in exporting the final goods to other countries. This paper establishes a three-country theoretical model that has considered those “side effects” mentioned above to simulate the effects of trade liberalization on a <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country,</b> which has the comparative advantage in producing high-tech intermediate goods. The model shows that when the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> liberalizes the export of the high-tech intermediate goods to the developing country, the latter’s export of the final good to the third country becomes more competitive and the global welfare level goes up. However, the welfare level for the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> might go down since its export of the final good is hampered. To partially internalize the benefit from the specialization, the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> can also liberalize the import of the final good from the developing country at the same time. The model also shows that when both countries play a simultaneous move game on their respective trade policies, there are many possible policy combinations that are welfare-improving for both countries compared to the Nash equilibrium outcome. This suggests that instead of letting both countries interact strategically without negotiation, the role of some trade agreements would be crucial...|$|R

50|$|The modern arms {{industry}} {{emerged in the}} second half of the nineteenth century as a product of the creation and expansion of the first large military-industrial companies. As smaller countries (and even <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>countries</b> like Russia and Japan) could no longer produce cutting-edge military equipment with their indigenous resources and capacity, they increasingly began to contract the manufacture of military equipment, such as battleships, artillery pieces and rifles to foreign firms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Advances in {{the space}} industry, with its {{implications}} on science, economy and well-being of citizens, is mostly chosen {{as one of the}} priority areas for development by developing <b>countries</b> and <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries.</b> However, there is already an over-capacity in the global space industry and there are doubts on necessity of additional capacity establishment by developing <b>countries</b> and <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries.</b> Drawing on the experience of internationalization of an Italian Small Medium Enterprise, this chapter provides some insights over the challenges experienced by developing <b>countries</b> and <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> to attract foreign investments for the establishment of the industry.

50|$|International {{division}} of labor. Through mechanization and productivity increases achieved by capitalist production, {{the allocation of}} human labour between agriculture, manufacturing industries, and services (the so-called primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors of the economy) is altered nationally and internationally. In developed capitalist countries, the agricultural labour force has shrunk to {{only a tiny fraction}} of the total workforce, and manufacturing industries remain only as a minor part of total production; the large majority of workers are employed in service industries. This contrasts with less-developed countries, which retain a large agricultural workforce, and <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>countries,</b> which feature a large manufacturing workforce. Marx did not analyze the implications of these long-term effects of the expansion of production by means of capital accumulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{expected}} {{real interest}} rate can vary considerably from year to year. The {{real interest rate}} on short term loans is strongly influenced by the monetary policy of central banks. The real interest rate on longer term bonds {{tends to be more}} market driven, and in recent decades, with globalized financial markets, the real interest rates in the industrialized countries have become increasingly correlated. Real interest rates have been low by historical standards since 2000, due to a combination of factors, including relatively weak demand for loans by corporations, plus strong savings in <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>countries</b> in Asia. The latter has offset the large borrowing demands by the US Federal Government, which might otherwise have put more upward pressure on real interest rates.|$|E
50|$|Ecologists {{also note}} that Marxist {{theories}} of value caused large-scale environmental problems in the industrialization of the Soviet Union China and other countries ruled by communist parties; thus, whether or not an economy is a market economy or a state economy {{does not seem to}} make much difference, the problem is rather with the values of human cultures themselves or with industrialization processes as such. This more complex debate cannot be dealt with in this article; it may be noted only that <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>countries</b> to a large extent imitated technical methods used in industrialized countries, and that Marx can hardly be held responsible for all the things done in his name—he had explicitly referred to problems of environmental despoilation quite a number of times, including in Das Kapital. He never dealt systematically with socialist economics, amongst other things because he lacked an evidential basis for theorizing about that.|$|E

5000|$|The decades {{from the}} 1960 saw an {{economic}} {{decline in the}} output of the more developed nations of Europe, particularly those in France and the UK. These nations' position in output of refined raw materials, e.g. steel, and in finished goods fell in contrast to Asia countries. Several Asian nations made use of comparative advantage and specialized in producing certain goods, utilizing comparably cheaper labor forces. First this occurred in Japan and the four [...] "Asian Tigers" [...] (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore); by the latter half 1980s the shift of industrial production began occurring in the <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>countries.</b> First, the shift occurred in cheaper, lower technology products, such as textiles. Then, this shift occurred in higher-technology goods, such [...] "durables" [...] as refrigerators or automobiles. The shift of international industrial production out of Europe is a key outcome of globalization.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1970s, {{the world}} economy had {{undergone}} significant changes and Latin American countries were seeing the limits of inward turning development, which had been based on pessimism about the potential of export-led growth. In the developed world, rising wages made seeking lower-wage locations to build factories more attractive. Multinational corporations (MNCs) had movable capital to invest in developing countries, particularly in Asia. Latin American countries took note as these <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>countries</b> experienced significant growth in GDP. As Latin American countries became more open to foreign investment and export-led growth in manufacturing, the stable post-war financial system of the Bretton Woods agreements, which had depended on fixed exchange rates tied {{to the value of}} the U.S. dollar was ending. In 1971, the U.S. ended the U.S. dollar's convertibility to gold, which made it difficult for Latin American countries, as well as other developing countries to make economic decisions. At the same time, there was a boom in commodity prices, particularly oil as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC limited production while demand continued to soar, resulting in world wide price rises in the price per barrel. With the rise in oil prices, oil producing countries had considerable capital to invest and international banks based in the U.S. expanded their reach, investing in Latin America.Latin American countries took on debt to fuel the economic growth and integration into a globalizing market. The promise of export earnings using borrowed money enticed many Latin American countries to take on loans, valued in U.S. dollars, that could expand their economic capacity. Creditors were eager to invest in Latin America, since in the mid-1970s real interest rates were low and optimistic commodity forecasts made lending a rational economic decision. Foreign capital poured into Latin America, linking developed and developing countries financially. The vulnerabilities in the arrangement were initially ignored. [...] Mexico in the early 1970s saw economic stagnation. With the discovery of huge oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico in the mid-1970s, Mexico appeared {{to be able to take}} advantage of high oil prices to spend on industrialization as well as fund social programs. Foreign banks were eager to lend to Mexico, since it seemed to be stable, had effectively a one-party political system that had kept social unrest to a minimum. Also reassuring to international lenders was that Mexico had maintained a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar since 1954. President José López Portillo (1976-82) broke with long-standing treasury practice of not taking on foreign debt, and borrowed extensively in U.S. dollars against future oil revenues. With the subsequent crash of the price of oil in 1981-82, Mexico's economy was in shambles and unable to make payments on the loans. The government devalued its currency, placed a 90-day moratorium on payment of the principal on external public debt, and finally López Portillo nationalized banking in the country and exchange controls on currency were imposed without warning. International lending institutions were themselves vulnerable when Mexico defaulted on its debt, since Mexican debt accounted for 44% of the capital of the nine largest U.S. banks..|$|E
