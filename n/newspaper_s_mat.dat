In this paper, we build a on eptual onne tion between the <b>s</b> hema <b>mat</b> hing problem SMP and the fuzzy onstraint {{optimization}} problem FCOP. In parti ular, we propose {{the use of}} the fuzzy onstraint optimization problem as a framework to model and formalize the <b>s</b> hema <b>mat</b> hing problem. By formalizing the SMP as a FCOP, we gain many benets. First, we ould express it as a ombinatorial optimization problem with a set of soft onstraints whi h are able to ope with un ertainty in <b>s</b> hema <b>mat</b> hing. Se ond, the a tual algorithm solution be omes independent of the on rete graph model, allowing us to hange the model without ae ting the algorithm by introdu ing a new level of abstra tion. Moreover, we ould dis over omplex mat hes easily. Finally, we ould make a trade-o between <b>s</b> hema <b>mat</b> hing performan e aspe ts. Key words: <b>s</b> hema <b>mat</b> hing, onstraint programming, fuzzy onstraints, obje tive fun tion 1. Introdu tion. The deep Web (also known as Deepnet or the hidden Web) refers to the World Wide Web ontent that is {{not a part of the}} surfa e Web. It is estimated that the deep Web is several orders of magnitude larger than the surfa e Web [4 ℄. As the number of deep Web sour es has been in reasing as the eorts needed to enable users to explore and integrate these sour es be ome essential. As a result software systems have been developed to open the deep Web to users. <b>S</b> hema <b>mat</b> hing is the ore task of these systems. <b>S</b> hema <b>mat</b> hing is the task of identifying semanti orresponden es among elements of two or mor...|$|R

Driveshafts used in atherectomy medical devices are often comprised of coiled or braided metal wires. These constructions {{are designed to}} tolerate delivery through tortuous vessels and can endure high speed rotation used during activation of the atherectomy treatment. This research investigated polymer driveshaft designs, which were comprised of polymer inner and outer layers, and coiled or braided stainless steel wires. The polymer driveshaft materials included polyimide, nylon 12, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Mechanical testing of polymer driveshafts was conducted to determine material response in bending, tension, compression, and torsion. The polymer driveshaft test results were then compared with current coiled metal wire driveshaft constructions. The investigation identified polymer driveshaft options that could feasibly work in an atherectomy application...|$|R

In this study, {{the effects of}} on-track dwell time on a hard disk drive (HDD) multidentate perfluoropolyether media lubricant were investigated. It was found that increasing dwell times increase the magnitude of lubricant depletion to a point, after which the depletion does not increase with increasing dwell time. Light interference with the media and high skew angles were shown to increase depletion. Once the dwell is complete, {{it was found that}} the lubricant reflows into the depletion region. This reflow was shown to be accelerated by increasing humidity and temperature. The rates for both depletion and reflow were measured and used to develop a simple model. This model was used to predict the final depletion depth for a sample that experienced a sequence of on- /off- track dwell steps. Experimental verification of this model found that it is reasonably accurate, especially for short dwell times and long off-track reflow periods...|$|R

The phase transition condition for the orientation map turns out to be of different form than of the corresponding low-dimensional map. 1 Introduction The high-dimensional self-organizing map (SOM) and the low-dimensional selforganizing feature (SOFM) map have been used to model a variety of selforganizational paradigms in the brain and in technical applications [1].
