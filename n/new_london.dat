5|$|In 1854, a {{connecting}} {{track was}} opened through downtown Norwich, allowing trains from the Norwich and Worcester Railroad {{to connect to}} steamers at <b>New</b> <b>London</b> rather than Allyn's Point. Use of the connection stopped in November 1855, but was continuous after April 1859. After {{the completion of the}} <b>New</b> <b>London</b> & Stonington to Groton Wharf in 1858, ferry service ran from <b>New</b> <b>London</b> to Groton to allow through railroad service. The NH station was soon too small to handle large passenger loads, and the Bureau of Railroad Commissioners was petitioned for a new station as early as 1859.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, the <b>New</b> <b>London</b> Northern Railroad succeeded the <b>New</b> <b>London,</b> Willimantic, and Palmer. That year, the {{railroad}} constructed a freight depot and steamboat wharf (likely {{also used for}} passenger trains) along Water Street. The depot burned on May 8, 1864, but was rebuilt on the same site.|$|E

5|$|In July 1995, Governor Rowland {{signed a}} bill {{ordering}} various studies, including one that analyzed extending service to <b>New</b> <b>London</b> as had been originally planned. Before the study was completed, ConnDOT unilaterally decided to implement <b>New</b> <b>London</b> service, which the report commended.

5|$|The New Haven and <b>New</b> <b>London</b> Railroad was {{merged with}} the <b>New</b> <b>London</b> and Stonington in 1857 to form the New Haven, <b>New</b> <b>London</b> and Stonington Railroad. The line was leased by the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (NYP) in 1859. The NYP bought the section east of Groton {{outright}} in 1864; the section from <b>New</b> <b>London</b> westward was spun off as the Shore Line Railway. In 1870, the Shore Line was leased by the New York and New Haven Railroad, which itself {{became part of the}} New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1872. At some point during this series of events, the 1852-built station was replaced by a larger, two-story structure, which was also used by some through trains from the north.|$|E
5|$|Union Station is {{the sixth}} {{railroad}} station to serve <b>New</b> <b>London.</b> When the <b>New</b> <b>London,</b> Willimantic, and Palmer Railroad opened in 1848, an existing building on Water Street a block east of Federal Street was {{converted into a}} station. A two-story Greek Revival depot was built near the modern location in 1852 {{with the arrival of}} the New Haven and <b>New</b> <b>London</b> Railroad (NH). The <b>New</b> <b>London,</b> Willimantic, and Palmer continued to use its older station for some time, although a track was built to join the two railroads.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the <b>New</b> <b>London</b> Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from <b>New</b> <b>London</b> for the unusually low price of $15,000, with the understanding that the railroads would build a structure more suitable for the bustling city.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012, Governor Dannel Malloy {{announced}} that 5 weekend round trips would {{be extended to}} <b>New</b> <b>London</b> beginning in April 2013. However, the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the marine industry over mandated closings of the Old Saybrook – Old Lyme bridge. Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings {{was approved by the}} state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Because Shore Line East service to <b>New</b> <b>London</b> is limited, Amtrak honors monthly Shore Line East passes on select intercity trains between <b>New</b> <b>London</b> and New Haven.|$|E

5|$|In a 2007 report, ConnDOT {{outlined}} {{plans to}} turn SLE into a full-service bidirectional regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to <b>New</b> <b>London.</b> This involves incremental improvements, {{similar to those}} that have already been put into place. One of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations, which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. <b>New</b> <b>London,</b> Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E
5|$|Noted American {{architect}} Henry Hobson Richardson, {{known for}} his public buildings including several Boston and Albany Railroad depots, {{was hired by the}} Central Vermont in September 1885 to design the new station. Richardson likely obtained the commission through his friend and former classmate James A. Rumrill, who was a director of the railroad. <b>New</b> <b>London</b> was the last of many railroad stations worked on by Richardson before his death in 1886, though numerous others were designed by his students (including the nearby <b>New</b> <b>London</b> Public Library designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge). Many of Richardson's later attributed works were designed primarily by his office staff, but the quality of the design indicates that it was closely supervised by Richardson. Richardson's biographer, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, considered <b>New</b> <b>London</b> to be his best station design.|$|E

5|$|The major {{obstacle}} preventing full <b>New</b> <b>London</b> service is the {{bridge over the}} Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The drawbridge section is closed for {{a certain period of}} time to allow trains to pass, which prevents large boats from passing under. The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service, which would mandate more bridge closings. The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic over the bridge to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018, although it was revised in 2010 and 2013. Since 2003, <b>New</b> <b>London</b> had been served by cross-honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE roundtrips.|$|E
5|$|Around 1912, <b>New</b> <b>London</b> {{citizens}} successfully {{petitioned the}} Public Utilities Commission for {{the installation of}} a footbridge connecting the station to the ferry docks {{in order to improve}} pedestrian safety. At the time, with no bridge crossing the river below Norwich, the ferries were heavily used. The footbridge, constructed of steel with a canopy to keep out rain, was constructed soon after.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{many of the}} 1970s repairs were {{beginning}} to wear down, and the city put aside its plans for the maritime museum. The <b>New</b> <b>London</b> Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara Timken and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the <b>New</b> <b>London</b> Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration of the waiting room to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, mechanical systems were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed. The baggage room was restored for Greyhound use. Amtrak and Greyhound rent space from the company for offices and passenger waiting areas.|$|E
