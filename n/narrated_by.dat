40|$|In the {{graduation}} thesis, I {{focus on the}} discussion of the ten folk tales of the contemporary Slovene youth author Anja Štefan from the collection Za devetimi gorami: slovenske ljudske pravljice. The purpose of the thesis was to establish children’s understanding of the folk tale’s content, and the way they accept the fairy tale <b>by</b> reading or <b>narrating.</b> The research included children aged from four to six years, and the methods of observation with attendance and semi-structured interview were used. With the questionnaire, I established opinion/point of view of educators about {{the discussion of the}} folk tales: how often educators present authorial and folk tale, and which technique of passing the story they use mostly. I established that children understand the content of the folk tale, but it is necessary to discuss the content and the message of the fairy tale. Furthermore, I established that educators place great importance to the discussion of folk tales due to the richness of Slovene tradition and passing it on from one generation to another. What is more, the majority of the educators repeatedly present authorial fairy tale as a folk tale, and they include all techniques of discussing a story in their work (reading, reading <b>by</b> illustrations, <b>narrating</b> <b>by</b> illustrations, <b>narrating</b> with puppets, <b>narrating</b> <b>by</b> heart) ...|$|R
