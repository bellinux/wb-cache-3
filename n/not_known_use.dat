An alternative theory links the name to a mythic ancient king called Bolor Shah, who had first united the region and from whom local rulers in turn often claimed descent.|$|E
50|$|Ventilation System: A {{system of}} local and/or general exhaust is {{recommended}} to keep employee exposures {{as low as}} possible. Local exhaust ventilation is generally preferred because it can control the emissions of the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion of it into the general work area. Please refer to the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, A Manual of Recommended Practices, most recent edition, for details. Personal Respirators (NIOSH Approved): For conditions of use where exposure to dust or mist is apparent and engineering controls are not feasible, a particulate respirator (NIOSH type N95 or better filters) may be worn. If oil particles (e.g. lubricants, cutting fluids, glycerine, etc.) are present, use a NIOSH type R or P filter. For emergencies or instances where the exposure levels are <b>not</b> <b>known,</b> <b>use</b> a full-face positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator.Skin Protection: Not required.Eye Protection: Not required. Optionally use chemical safety goggles where dusting or splashing of solutions is possible.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Several {{mathematical}} {{models have}} been proposed for the modelling of someone's degrees of belief. The oldest is the Bayesian model that uses probability functions. The upper and lower probabilities (ULP) model, Dempster's model, the evidentiary value model (EVM) and the probability of modal propositions somehow generalize the Bayesian approach. The transferable belief model (TBM) is based on other premises and uses belief functions. None of these models is THE best: {{each has its own}} domain of application. We spell out through examples what are the underlying hypotheses that lead to the selection of an adequate model for a given problem. We give indications on how to choose the appropriate model. The major discriminating criterion is: if there exists a probability measure with known values, use the Bayesian model, if there exists a probability measure but with some unknown values, use the ULP models, if the existence of a probability measure is <b>not</b> <b>known,</b> <b>use</b> the TBM. Dempster's model is essentially a special case of ULP model. The EVM and the probability of modal propositions (provability, necessity [...] .) corresponds to a special use of the Bayesian model. Keywords: belief functions, Dempster-Shafer theory, belief modelling, upper and lower probabilities, transferable belief model. 1...|$|E

40|$|Background: The optimum {{management}} of ligamentous injuries of the elbow is <b>not</b> <b>known.</b> <b>Use</b> of dynamic external fixators has been advocated {{to stabilize the}} joint while maintaining motion, {{but there are no}} published data to corrob-orate their efficacy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that a laterally applied unilateral dynamic ex-ternal fixator is capable of stabilizing and restoring normal kinematics to elbows with varying degrees of soft-tissue injury. Methods: Six fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities, from donors who were an average of seventy-six years of age at the time of death, were tested in a custom apparatus with an electromagnetic tracking device to analyze the kine-matic behavior. Testing began with an injury of either the lateral or the medial collateral ligament, which was followed by a second test with an injury to the ligament on the contralateral side of the joint. In each test, the varus-valgus dis-placement and the forearm rotatory displacement were measured through the arc of elbow flexion under three load-ing conditions (hand weight alone, hand weight plus 3. 5 N, and hand weight plus 7 N). After each test (with each injury), a unilateral external fixator was applied from the lateral aspect of the elbow, and the same measurements were conducted under the three loading conditions across the elbow joint. Results: With varus stress testing, both after injury of the medial collateral ligament alone and after injury of the lat-eral collateral ligament and extensor mass alone, the laterally applied unilateral dynamic external fixator was capabl...|$|E
