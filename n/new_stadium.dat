5|$|Before the 2007 Major League Soccer season, {{construction}} was completed on a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> at Exhibition Place in Toronto {{at a cost}} of $62.5million. On September 20, 2006, MLS's official website announced that BMO Financial Group had purchased the naming rights for the <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> It is the largest soccer-specific stadium in Canada. It is owned by the City of Toronto, while MLSE, the team's owner, operates it.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Sunderland's planned <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> {{was on the}} {{shortlist}} for Euro 96 venues, as England {{had been}} named as hosts of the competition in May 1992. However, it soon become clear that a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> in Sunderland would not be ready {{in time for the}} tournament.|$|E
5|$|Off the field, the Mariners' AL West {{championship}} {{as well as}} its memorable run in {{the postseason}} served as a catalyst for public funding for a new ballpark. Less than two weeks before the tiebreaker, the residents of King County, Washington (whose county seat is Seattle) voted against a sales tax increase to fund a <b>new</b> <b>stadium,</b> but shortly after their ALDS victory, the Washington State Legislature reconvened and approved a separate funding package for a <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>stadium,</b> now called Safeco Field, opened in July 1999.|$|E
50|$|Many criticisms exist {{regarding}} the use of stadium subsidies. First, critics argue that <b>new</b> <b>stadiums</b> generate little to no new spending (consumption). Instead, what fans spend in and around the stadium are substitutes for what they would otherwise spend on different entertainment options. Thus, this argument contends, <b>new</b> <b>stadiums</b> do not cause economic growth or lead to increased aggregate income. Because there is not an increase in consumption related to <b>new</b> <b>stadiums,</b> it is not worth the cost for cities to subsidize their construction.|$|R
50|$|Linda C Banowati, Operational Director of Mata Elang management, {{said they}} {{are in the process of}} {{building}} two <b>new</b> <b>stadiums</b> outside Ancol Beach City.

5|$|Plans {{to develop}} a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> and {{training}} facilities near Westhill, close to the newly developed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, were announced in May 2016. The site's training facilities {{are scheduled to be}} operational by 2018, while the stadium could be ready ahead of the 2019–20 season. The <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> is expected to have a similar capacity to Pittodrie Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, Aberdeen {{has been}} {{examining}} {{a move to}} a <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> Plans for a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> began when the club indicated that further development of Pittodrie Stadium was not possible due {{to the age of}} the ground and the restrictions from surrounding land. Aberdeen City Council approved an initial project in May 2009, to be situated near Loirston Loch in the south of the city, subject to planning permission. In August 2010, a planning application for the <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> was submitted to the council, which was approved the following February.|$|E
5|$|Carisbrook, the city's former main rugby union venue and {{a former}} Test cricket ground, is at {{the eastern end of}} the suburb between The Glen and the Hillside Railway Workshops. It was the home of Otago Rugby Union until a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> opened in North Dunedin (the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza) in 2011. The <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> is the new home of the Otago Rugby Union and Highlanders Super Rugby franchise, and met with some {{opposition}} within Dunedin, with objections focusing largely on the cost. The future of Carisbrook looks bleak, and many of the former facilities {{are in the process of}} being dismantled or removed.|$|E
50|$|The move fueled a {{proliferation}} of 12 <b>new</b> <b>stadiums</b> throughout the NFL. Using the NFL-City of Cleveland agreement's promise to supply a team to Cleveland by 1999, several NFL franchises coerced their respective cities to build <b>new</b> <b>stadiums</b> with public funds. Such franchises include the Broncos, Eagles, Seahawks, Buccaneers, Bengals, Lions, Cardinals and Colts.|$|R

5|$|Gamla Ullevi was {{demolished}} on 9 January 2007 to make {{place for}} a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> with the same name, Gamla Ullevi, with a capacity of 18,800. The <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> was completed in late 2008, but not opened until {{the start of the}} 2009 season. During construction, IFK Göteborg played the 2007 and 2008 seasons at Nya Ullevi. On 11 April 2009 IFK Göteborg played their first game on the new Gamla Ullevi stadium and won against Djurgården with 6–0 in front of 18,276 spectators.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, Portsmouth F.C. {{announced}} plans {{to move away from}} Fratton Park to a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> situated on a piece of reclaimed land beside the Historic Dockyard, nicknamed Portsmouth Dockland Stadium. The £600 million mixed-use development, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, would also include 1500 harbourside apartments as well as shops and offices. The scheme attracted criticism due to its large size and location, with some officials saying that it would interfere with harbour operations. The £600 million project for a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> was rejected by the city council due to the financial crisis of 2008.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to build}} a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> in Malmö {{originated}} in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö IP to be too small for major events. However, the city council could not agree where to build the <b>new</b> <b>stadium,</b> and the matter was dropped for the time being. It was not until Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup that the question resurfaced. The location of the stadium was a main subject of discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, while others thought that the stadium should be located in central Malmö, near the neighbourhood of Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954.|$|E

50|$|Lucchino {{is known}} for having {{initiated}} the trend of building baseball-only facilities with an old-fashioned charm and smaller seating capacities. Under his watch, both teams built <b>new</b> <b>stadiums,</b> pioneering Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Petco Park. Since then, about one-half of Major League Baseball’s 30 teams followed this lead and built <b>new</b> <b>stadiums</b> with the old-style look and feel.|$|R

5|$|Starting {{with the}} 2012 season, the Highlanders {{moved into the}} Forsyth Barr Stadium, opened in August 2011. It was built to replace their {{original}} home of Carisbrook, which was no longer suitable for international rugby, or as a venue for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The Carisbrook Stadium Trust was established in 2006 to manage the planning and construction of a <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> {{is not on the}} current Carisbrook site, but instead near the University of Otago and Otago Harbour. It is a roofed, all weather stadium with a rectangular configuration, and permanent seating capacity of 25,000 that could be expanded to 30,748 if necessary.|$|E
5|$|The club {{also agreed}} new {{sponsorship}} deals; in September 2000, Granada Media Group purchased a 5% stake in Arsenal for £47million. As {{part of the}} acquisition, Granada became the premier media agent for Arsenal, handling advertising, sponsorship, merchandising, publishing and licensing agreements. The club's managing director Keith Edelman confirmed {{in a statement that}} the investment would be used directly to fund for the <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> The collapse of ITV Digital (part-owned by Granada) in April 2002 coincided with news that the company was tied in to pay £30million once arrangements for the <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> were finalised.|$|E

5|$|The {{options for}} the <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E

5|$|York City F.C. ceased {{ownership}} of their Bootham Crescent {{ground in the}} summer of 1999, after the club's real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. The club secured a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) to buy the ground in February 2004. The terms of this loan required the club to identify a site for a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> were in place, the loan would turn into a grant to assist in funding the relocation.|$|E
50|$|The boom in {{television}} rights following {{the creation of}} the Premier League in 1992 allowed a number of clubs to further expand their stadiums, or even move to new ones. Realising the commercial possibilities of <b>new</b> <b>stadiums,</b> many ambitious outfits constructed purpose-built stadiums often on the outskirts of cities or in urban regeneration areas. It has become common for clubs to tie these <b>new</b> <b>stadiums</b> in with residential or leisure complexes.|$|R
50|$|Inevitably, {{there was}} a great deal of {{speculation}} about the status of stadium construction in the run-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the requirement that all the FIFA World Cup host stadiums had to be completed by January 2010.
