40|$|In the Radar signal processing, {{waveform}} design plays major role. The {{target range}} and Doppler resolution {{depends on the}} selection of the waveform. In the waveform design, pulse compression techniques are being implemented for better resolution and accuracy measurements of range and velocity of targets. Hence radar detector requires sophisticated signal processor. Presently, there are so many radar codes are being developed. Barker codes (Bi-phase codes) are being implemented by using sinusoidal waveforms. In this paper, we developed Barker codes by using non-sinusoidal waveforms like Gaussian function. The performances of <b>nonsinusoidal</b> <b>signals</b> are evaluated by using Barker codes(in terms of PSLR,ISLR). By using some performance factor, these two techniques are compared and results are presented...|$|R

This is a useful tool for the analysis of physiologic signals such as the electrocardiogram and blood pressure. We demonstrate the method on several biomedical signals...|$|R
40|$|The ULF magnetospheric indices S gr, S geo, T gr, and T geo are {{examined}} and correlated with solar wind variables, geomagnetic indices, and the multispacecraft‐averaged relativistic‐electron flux F in the magnetosphere. The ULF indices are detrended by subtracting off sine waves with 24 h periods to form S grd, S geod, T grd, and T geod. The detrending improves correlations. Autocorrelation‐function analysis {{indicates that there}} are still strong 24 h period <b>nonsinusoidal</b> <b>signals</b> in the indices which should be removed in future. Indications are that the ground‐based indices S grd and T grd are more predictable than the geosynchronous indices S geod and T geod. In the analysis, a difference index ∆ S mag [*]≈[*] S grd − 0. 693 S geod is derived: the time integral of ∆ S mag has the highest ULF index correlation with the relativistic‐electron flux F. In systems‐science fashion, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to correlate the relativistic‐electron flux simultaneously with the time integrals of (a) the solar wind velocity, (b) the solar wind number density, (c) the level of geomagnetic activity, (d) the ULF indices, and (e) the type of solar wind plasma (coronal hole versus streamer belt) : The time integrals of the solar wind density and the type of plasma have the highest correlations with F. To create a solar wind‐Earth system of variables, the two indices S grd and S geod are combined with seven geomagnetic indices; from this, CCA produces a canonical Earth variable that is matched with a canonical solar wind variable. Very high correlations (r corr [*]=[*] 0. 926) between the two canonical variables are obtained. Key Points ULF indices contain <b>nonsinusoidal</b> periodic <b>signals</b> in universal time ULF indices are not the strongest correlator with radiation belt electron fluxes ULF indices were integrated into a mathematical system science of magnetospher...|$|R

The generalization {{of the concept of}} symmetrical components is discussed together with their derivation in both time- and frequency domain. The main conclusion of the paper is that an orthogonal decomposition of periodic <b>nonsinusoidal</b> three-phase <b>signals</b> into positive sequence, negative sequence and zero-sequence components is not possible, but that an additional current and voltage component should be introduced which is called the residual component...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The nonsinusoidal {{communication}} systems have some properties {{which are very}} suitable {{for a lot of}} application such as radars, remote synchronization systems and radio navigation. More specifically, the nonsinusoidal radars utilize very narrow radio pulses. This leads to radical improvement of the most important radar parameters as range resolution, abilities for recognizing of targets and discovering small objects on background of large obstacles. With regard to positive features of nonsinusoidal radars, they are in very rapid progress in both theoretical and practical aspects recently. Despite of taken efforts, some important problems in the design of nonsinusoidal radars are still open. Due to this reason our paper aims to suggest an effective computer algorithm for synthesis of <b>nonsinusoidal</b> radar <b>signals...</b>|$|R

Parameters will be estimated up to mth significant harmonic component. It also gives an approach for the case of less than mth significant harmonic components. The estimator will track the signal's fundamental frequency, amplitudes, and phases while these parameters are changing slowly over time. The amplitudes are estimated as if the fundamental frequency estimate is correct; the frequency and the phases of the signal are estimated as if the amplitude estimation is correct. This thesis also contains tracking and the capture behavior of the filter. [URL] Junior Grade, Turkish Nav...|$|R
40|$|We develop theorems of {{a general}} nature that apply to the {{analysis}} of AM-FM signals of the form a(m) exp[jOE(m) ] or a(m) cos[OE(m) ] and to their behavior both in linear systems and in simple nonlinear systems comprised of products of linear elements. Such product-systems include interesting nonlinear demodulation operators, such as the Teager [...] Kaiser operator. Expressions for the approximate system responses to AM-FM signals are derived by making an analogy to the eigenfunction interpretation of sinusoids in linear systems; for the case of sinusoidal signals, the approximations are exact. These expressions are collectively called quasieigenfunction approximations (QEA's). For <b>nonsinusoidal</b> AM-FM <b>signals,</b> the approximations have errors that are tightly bounded by functionals that express the smoothness of the AM and FM information signals and the durations of the involved system impulse responses. The bounds are independent of the bandwidths of the AM and FM functions. Two general applications are considered. First, the approximations are found to be useful for analyzing discretetime nonlinear energy operators, including the Teager-Kaiser operator. Next, the approximation theorems lead to the selection of an optimal class of bandpass filters for use in a discrete multiband AM-FM demodulation system. The filter class selected is optimal in the sense of achieving the lower bound of a novel discrete uncertainty principle...|$|R
5000|$|In {{electronics}} a {{relaxation oscillator}} is a nonlinear electronic oscillator circuit {{that produces a}} <b>nonsinusoidal</b> repetitive output <b>signal,</b> such as a triangle wave or square wave. The circuit consists of a feedback loop containing a switching device such as a transistor, comparator, relay, op amp, or a negative resistance device like a tunnel diode, that repetitively charges a capacitor or inductor through a resistance until it reaches a threshold level, then discharges it again. [...] The period of the oscillator depends on the time constant of the capacitor or inductor circuit. [...] The active device switches abruptly between charging and discharging modes, and thus produces a discontinuously changing repetitive waveform. [...] This contrasts with the other type of electronic oscillator, the harmonic or linear oscillator, which uses an amplifier with feedback to excite resonant oscillations in a resonator, producing a sine wave. [...] Relaxation oscillators are used to produce low frequency signals for applications such as blinking lights and electronic beepers and in voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters and switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters, and function generators.|$|R
