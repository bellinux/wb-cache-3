2500|$|On 15 April {{at a rally}} by Bakiyev {{in front}} of a 1,000 {{supporters}} gunshots were heard, although Bakiyev was reported to have safely left the scene. Some claimed that the firing came from his own bodyguards {{in order to keep the}} peace and avoid a confrontation with opponents. Later in the day Bakiyev was reported to have flown into exile to the Kazakhstani city of Taraz. it was said that he would continue negotiations on a settlement to the crisis from exile. The interim government responded to this by calling his departure a [...] "deportation," [...] saying he had allegedly submitted a request to resign amid reports indicating that Baktybek Kaliyev, a former defence minister, had been arrested. The interim government also said it would seek Bakiyev's transfer to a Kyrgyz or international court for trial at a later date. Kazakhstan, as the chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, confirmed Bakiyev's departure saying it was an important step towards preventing civil war. It added that joint efforts between themselves and Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama had fostered such an agreement. Bakiyev submitted a hand-written resignation letter saying [...] "I tender my resignation in these tragic days as I understand the full scale of my responsibility for the future of the Kyrgyz people." [...] The interim president allegedly said [...] "he had become a source of instability ... they could no longer tolerate that." [...] She added that most of his entourage was still in the country and that she would press ahead with bringing Bakyiev to trial. On 20 April, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko said his country had afforded Bakiyev and three members of his family [...] "the protection of our state, and personally of the president." [...] On 21 April, in a statement from Minsk, Bakiyev said he still considers himself the country's president and pledged to do all he can to return the country to its [...] "constitutional field." [...] He then upped the ante by saying, [...] "I do not recognise my resignation. <b>Nine</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> the people of Kyrgyzstan elected me their president and there is no power that can stop me. Only death can stop me." [...] He then called on the international community not to support the interim government. [...] "Everyone must know the bandits who are trying to take power are the executors of an external force and have no legitimacy. I call on leaders of the international community: do not set a precedent and do not recognise this gang as the legitimate authorities." [...] Russia consequently rejected this assertion on the grounds that he had already tendered his resignation saying [...] "this document cannot be rejected by a verbal [...] statement." [...] He also accused the Russians of being annoyed with his allowing the Manas air base to continue operating for the Americans and NATO to supply their forces in the Afghan war. [...] On 23 April, Bakiyev backtracked on his vow to return to power, but claimed his resignation is invalid because the new government is failing to protect his family as was promised.|$|E

40|$|From <b>nine</b> to 18 <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> 66 {{patients}} were given 67 randomly matched cadaveric kidneys with cyclosporin A and steroid therapy. Nine of the recipients were undergoing retransplantation. The over-all kidney survival rate {{to date has}} been 77. 6 per cent, and 78. 8 per cent of the recipients are dialysis-free. The patient mortality in this learning phase was 13. 3 per cent. Nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and other side-effects of cyclosporin A could usually {{be dealt with by}} dosage adjustments, making feasible the chronic use of this agent. One B-cell immunoblastic sarcoma was encountered which was monoclonal. It was not responsible for death. Another patient had a perforation of the intestine from a lymphoproliferative reaction in which the B cells were polyclonal. After jejunal resection a year ago, there were no further complications. This lesion was not classified as a lymphoma. Both lymphoproliferative lesions were associated with a rise in antibody to viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus. Results of this study have verified the effectiveness and relative safety of cyclosporin A with steroids for immunosuppression in human recipients of cadaveric kidneys...|$|R

It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained, but these most excited my curiosity--the last in especial, from the immensely important character of its consequences.|$|E

6000|$|... 8. I {{was early}} {{this morning with the}} Secretary, and talked over this matter. He hoped that when it was {{reported}} this day in the House of Lords, they would disagree with their Committee, and so the matter would go off, only with a little loss of reputation to the Lord Treasurer. I dined with Mr. Cockburn, and after, a Scotch member came in, and told us that the clause was carried against the Court in the House of Lords almost two to one. I went immediately to Mrs. Masham, and meeting Dr. Arbuthnot (the Queen's favourite physician), we went together. She was just come from waiting at the Queen's dinner, and going to her own. She had heard nothing of the thing being gone against us. It seems Lord Treasurer had been so negligent that he was with the Queen while the question was put in the House: I immediately told Mrs. Masham that either she and Lord Treasurer had joined with the Queen to betray us, or that they two were betrayed by the Queen: she protested solemnly it was not the former, and I believed her; but she gave me some lights to suspect the Queen is changed. For yesterday, when the Queen was going from the House, where she sat to hear the debate, the Duke of Shrewsbury, Lord Chamberlain, asked her whether he or the Great Chamberlain Lindsey(13) ought to lead her out; she answered short, [...] "Neither of you," [...] and gave her hand to the Duke of Somerset, who was louder than any in the House for the clause against peace. She gave me one or two more instances of this sort, which convince me that the Queen is false, or at least very much wavering. Mr. Masham begged us to stay, because Lord Treasurer would call, and we were resolved to fall on him about his negligence in securing a majority. He came, and appeared in good humour as usual, but I thought his countenance was much cast down. I rallied him, and desired him to give me his staff, which he did: I told him, if he would secure it me a week, I would set all right: he asked how; I said I would immediately turn Lord Marlborough, his two daughters,(14) the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, and Lord Cholmondeley,(15) out of all their employments; and I believe he had not a friend but was of my opinion. Arbuthnot asked how he came not to secure a majority. He could answer nothing but that he could not help it, if people would lie and forswear. A poor answer for a great Minister. There fell from him a Scripture expression, that [...] "the hearts of kings are unsearchable."(16) I told him it was what I feared, and was from him the worst news he could tell me. I begged him to know what he had to trust to: he stuck a little; but at last bid me not fear, for all would be well yet. We would fain have had him eat a bit where he was, but he would go home, it was past six: he made me go home with him. There we found his brother and Mr. Secretary. He made his son take a list of all in the House of Commons who had places, and yet voted against the Court, in such a manner as if they should lose their places: I doubt he is not able to compass it. Lord Keeper came in an hour, and they were going upon business. So I left him, and returned to Mrs. Masham; but she had company with her, and I would not stay.--This is a long journal, and of a day that may produce great alterations, and hazard the ruin of England. The Whigs are all in triumph; they foretold how all this would be, but we thought it boasting. Nay, they said the Parliament should be dissolved before Christmas, and perhaps it may: this is all your d----d Duchess of Somerset's doings. I warned them of it <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> and a hundred times since: the Secretary always dreaded it. I told Lord Treasurer I should have the advantage of him; for he would lose his head, and I should only be hanged, and so carry my body entire to the grave.|$|E
