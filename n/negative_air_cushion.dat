40|$|Calculations {{were made}} to {{determine}} the feasibility of applying the <b>negative</b> <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> (NAC) principle to the mooring of airships. Pressures required for the inflation of the flexible trunks are not excessive {{and the maintenance of}} sufficient hold down force is possible in winds up to 50 knots. Fabric strength requirements for a typical NAC sized for a 10 -million cubic foot airship were found to be approximately 200 lbs. /in. Corresponding power requirements range between 66 -HP and 5600 -HP. No consideration was given to the internal airship loads caused by the use of a NAC and further analysis in much greater detail is required before this method could be applied to an actual design, however, the basic concept appears to be sound and no problem areas of a fundamental nature are apparent...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{applications}} of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are briefly reviewed in airships and tethered aerostats. The stress distributions of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are simulated by {{finite element analysis}} software according to its load-carrying characteristics. Three kinds of interlayer forms are proposed and simulated thereafter. A best form of interlayer has been obtained via comparing the different analyzing results. In addition, an empirical formula is proposed for the differential pressures and load {{at the top of}} the <b>air</b> <b>cushions,</b> with experiments in which two kinds of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are designed and their load carrying abilities are evaluated. Some advices are then provided for the designing and using of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> at the end of this paper...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a current}} {{need for the}} {{development}} of new computational tools to model the seakeeping performance of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles in support of the US Navy’s Landing Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and possibly {{the development of a new}} connector as part of the Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC) program. Much of the existing simulation capability for <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles was developed in the 1960 ’s, 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s to support the design of the LCAC and are coefficient-based models derived from small-scale experiments. The general utility of these simulations is limited in the design of new <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles, especially for innovative concepts or new components for increased performance capability. Advances in computing power and algorithms for free surface flows have made possible the development of new simulation tools to quantitatively assess design modifications and complement model tests of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles. In this paper we describe the formulation, implementation and verification of a new computational model, called ACVSIM, to simulate the dynamics of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles operating in waves. The primary components of ACVSIM include a high-order Rankine panel method for the hydrodynamic solution, an immersed boundary model for the solution of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> dynamics, and a structural dynamics model of the bag-and-finger skirt system. Several semi-empirical models for other force components, such as the aerodynamic drag, are planned for a future release of the code...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was {{to conduct}} a {{stability}} analysis of Herand power plant. Herand is a hydropower plant under planning by Herand Kraft, and it is planned to have a generator of 27 MVA. The size of the power plant puts it under the requirements in Norway stating that all generators above 10 MVA must have frequency regulation {{and be able to}} operate in an isolated grid. This paper presents a conducted analysis of Herand that examines whether the plant will be able to meet these requirements, and maintain a stable regulation system. The conducted analysis was based on control theory. A block diagram was set up from differential equations for each element in Herand power plant. The transfer function of the system was found, and by the use of Simulink and Matlab, as well as an analytical approach, the Amplitude - Phase - Frequency (APF) diagrams were found. The focus in the analysis was three dynamic aspects; the mass oscillations between inlet and <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> surge chamber, water hammer occuring in the penstock following a regulation when including the elastic property of the penstock, and regulation stability. The challenge for Herand when it comes to obtaining acceptable frequency regulation is concerning the topography at the location. The penstock will be long, and an <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> surge chamber will be implemented upstream of the turbine to enhance stability. An objective of this paper was to find the optimal dimensions of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> surge chamber, and to examine whether Herand then will have acceptable regulation stability. The conducted simulations showed that Herand power plant will have a stable regulation system when implementing an <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> surge chamber. The elastic frequency will lie above the crossover frequency, hence the controller will not attempt to regulate the pressure surges. The system will be unstable without an <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> surge chamber. The Thoma critical area was calculated to find the minimum required surface area of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> that will result in stable mass oscillations. The total volume of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> surge chamber used in the simulations was 712. 26 m 3. Up- and downsurge from the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> surge chamber was also avoided with the calculated volume...|$|R
