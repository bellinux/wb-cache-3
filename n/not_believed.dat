5|$|A survey {{completed}} in November 2009 found 50 types {{of trees in}} the gardens. Bats {{were found in the}} coach house during an ecological survey, but were <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to be roosting there long-term. Species of birds observed in the gardens have included song thrush, jay, wren, robin, kingfisher and tawny owl. Mammals regularly observed include hedgehogs, grey squirrels and foxes. Butterflies including the holly blue and painted lady have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such {{as white}} peacocks, swans and geese, are <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> {{to be true}} albinos, as {{they do not have}} red eyes, rather, their {{colouration}} is suggested to be the expression of a white fur or feather gene, not a lack of melanin.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is an {{abundant}} and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation {{in most of}} southern Africa. It is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to be threatened, and accordingly is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN's Red List. It can be an agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} pintail {{has a large}} range, estimated at , and a population estimated at 5.3–5.4 million individuals. It is therefore <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to meet the IUCN Red List threshold criterion of a population decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations, and is evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe. Over its range as a whole, the species is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} an {{extensive}} range of about 10million km2 (3.8million square miles). It {{has a large}} population, including an estimated 1120million individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E

[...] "I'll <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it!" [...] he cried again; and now his voice had lost its passionate vehemence, and was sunk almost to a moan.|$|R

5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> {{to be a threat}} to the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, hunting was {{restricted}} to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The take is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years {{it would take to}} reach a formal agreement.|$|E
5|$|Chroniclers Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto were {{generally}} unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but {{more tolerant of}} the earliest years of John's reign. Accounts of the middle and later years of his reign are limited to Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall, neither of whom were satisfied with John's performance as king. His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death: Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. The latter claimed that John attempted to convert to Islam, but this is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> by modern historians.|$|E

5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E
5|$|Hilary Russell, a prefect and predatory lesbian, lusts after Mary Beech, the school's cricket captain. On a night {{expedition}} {{in pursuit}} of Mary, Hilary catches Margaret Tattenham, a junior, {{in the act of}} replacing the £5 note in Miss Holden's room. Margaret says she originally took the money as a prank; Hilary agrees not to report her to Miss Holden in return for sexual favours, to which Margaret reluctantly consents. The following morning, Hilary denounces her anyway; Margaret responds by revealing Hilary's sexual harassment but is <b>not</b> <b>believed,</b> and is taken to the punishment room where Marie's absence is revealed.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} by Swami Vivekananda states [...] "As certain religions of {{the world}} say {{that a man who}} does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the Vedanta says, a man who does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in himself is an atheist. <b>Not</b> <b>believing</b> in the glory of our own soul is what the Vedanta calls atheism." ...|$|R

5|$|On 11 March 2007 a {{shooting}} incident occurred at around 2.45am following {{a performance by}} Pretty Ricky at the university. A 21-year-old student at the university, who was employed as security staff at the event, received gunshot wounds to his abdomen and was taken to hospital where his condition was <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to be life-threatening. Six others were also injured during what {{was described as a}} scuffle that broke out after CS gas (tear gas) was sprayed following the event.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough has an {{extensive}} though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10millionsquare kilometres (0.4–3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN Red List {{does not}} {{distinguish}} the hooded crow from the carrion crow, {{but the two}} species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10millionkm2 (3.8million mi2), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so are evaluated as Least Concern. The carrion crow/hooded crow hybrid zone is slowly spreading northwest, but the hooded crow has {{on the order of}} three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia).|$|E
5|$|The first {{attestation}} of the Latin term {{is attributed}} to a charter of Duke Trpimir from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved, leading to doubts over {{the authenticity of the}} claim. The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm. The inscription is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879–892, during Branimir's rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{geographical}} range {{of at least}} 10millionkm2 (3.8millionmi2) and a large population including an estimated 970,000–2,000,000 individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but {{there is evidence of}} an overall increase. This owl is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> to meet the IUCN Red List criterion of declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern. This species has expanded its range in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Ukraine, and populations are stable or increasing in most European countries. Declines have occurred in Finland, Estonia, Italy and Albania.|$|E
