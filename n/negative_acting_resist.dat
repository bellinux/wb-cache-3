40|$|AbstractMouse mammary {{tumour virus}} (MMTV) encodes a viral {{superantigen}} (Sag) and a <b>negative</b> <b>acting</b> factor (Naf) which share {{parts of their}} coding sequence. Using 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE), we could show that at least 10 different cellular proteins were differentially expressed in Naf positive cells. Also, luciferase reporter expression was down-regulated in Naf expressing cells independent of the promoter used and further experiments suggested that this effect was {{due in part to}} a decrease in cellular growth rates. Although in Naf positive cells expression of the major sag containing transcript was strongly induced by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, the hormone analogue neither influenced luciferase expression nor mRNA expression of selected cellular proteins identified by 2 D-DIGE. Taken together, these data support the previous finding that Naf and Sag have separable activities and suggest that Naf {{may play a role in}} modulating host cell gene expression during MMTV infection...|$|R

40|$|Cysteine-rich {{intestinal}} protein (CRIP) is an intestinal Zn(2 +) -binding protein {{containing a}} single {{copy of the}} double Zn(2 +) -finger arrangement known as the LIM motif. CRIP is developmentally regulated and can be induced by glucocorticoid hormones during the early suckling period. In this report we show that CRIP mRNA levels are induced by dexamethasone in cultured rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC- 6). Analysis of the 2644 bp of the 5 '-flanking region of the CRIP gene revealed that the CRIP promoter lacks classical CAAT and TATA boxes but contains GC-rich regions in the proximal end of the promoter that probably function in transcription initiation. In addition to binding sites for transcription factors such as Sp- 1, AP- 2, OCT and GATA- 2, there are multiple glucocorticoid-response elements. CRIP promoter constructs fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transfected into IEC- 6 cells confirmed glucocorticoid responsiveness {{and the presence of}} <b>negative</b> <b>acting</b> elements.

There are only few classes of polymers combining excellent electrical properties with high thermal and mechanical stability. Polyimide is well known for over 30 years. To reduce the processing steps forming vias photosensitive polymers were developed.

30|$|Low {{frequency}} firing {{is modeled}} by Type 1 neurons with a SNIC, but, {{because of the}} vertical slope of the square-root-like f–I curve, low f only occurs over a narrow range of I. When an adaptive current is added, however, the f–I curve is linearized, and low f occurs robustly over a large I range. Ermentrout (Neural Comput. 10 (7): 1721 - 1729, 1998) showed that this feature of adaptation paradoxically arises from the SNIC {{that is responsible for}} the vertical slope. We show, using a simplified Hindmarsh–Rose neuron with <b>negative</b> feedback <b>acting</b> directly on the adaptation current, that whereas a SNIC contributes to linearization, in practice linearization over a large interval may require strong adaptation strength. We also find that a type 2 neuron with threshold generated by a Hopf bifurcation can also show linearization if adaptation strength is strong. Thus, a SNIC is not necessary. More fundamental than a SNIC is stretching the steep region near threshold, which stems from sufficiently strong adaptation, though a SNIC contributes if present. In a more realistic conductance-based model, Morris–Lecar, with <b>negative</b> feedback <b>acting</b> on the adaptation conductance, an additional assumption that the driving force of the adaptation current is independent of I is needed. If this holds, strong adaptive conductance is both necessary and sufficient for linearization of f–I curves of type 2 f–I curves.|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of selection, {{both positive and}} <b>negative,</b> <b>acting</b> on a DNA sequence or class of nucleotide sites requires comparison with a reference sequence that is unaffected by selection. In Drosophila, recent findings of widespread selective constraint, as well as adaptive evolution, in both coding and noncoding regions highlight the difficulties in choosing such a reference sequence. Here, we investigate the utility of short intron sequences as a reference for the {{detection of}} selection. For a set of 119 Drosophila melanogaster genes containing 195 short introns (≤ 120 bp), we analyzed polymorphism and divergence at 1) 4 -fold synonymous sites, 2) all sites of introns ≤ 120 bp, 3) all sites of introns ≤ 65 bp, 4) bases 8 – 30 of introns ≤ 120 bp, and 5) bases 8 – 30 of introns ≤ 65 bp. The last class of sites shows the highest levels of both interspecific divergence and intraspecific polymorphism, suggesting that these sites are under the least selective constraint. Bases 8 – 30 of introns ≤ 65 bp also have the lowest ratio of divergence to polymorphism, which may indicate that a small proportion of substitutions in the other classes of sites are the result of adaptive evolution. Although there is little signal of selection on the primary sequence of short introns, patterns of insertion–deletion polymorphism and divergence suggest that both positive and negative selection act to maintain an optimal intron length...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{membrane}} {{recycling is}} an important process necessary for maintaining membrane composition. The motor protein myosin Vb regulates plasma membrane recycling through its association with Rab 11 a. Overexpression of the tail of myosin Vb disrupts trafficking out of plasma membrane recycling systems and leads to the accumulation of Rab 11 a in both polarized and non-polarized cells. We have investigated the association of Rab 11 family interacting protein 2 (Rab 11 -FIP 2) with myosin Vb as an adapter protein between Rab 11 a and myosin Vb. Immunofluorescence studies indicated a colocalization of endogenous Rab 11 -FIP 2 with green fluorescent protein-myosin Vb tail overexpressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Yeast two hybrid assays showed that amino acids 129 - 356 of Rab 11 -FIP 2 were important for binding to myosin Vb tail. In vitro association assays and co-transfection experiments in both MDCK and HeLa cells confirmed this result but further refined the binding site to amino acids 129 - 290 of Rab 11 -FIP 2. Like myosin Vb, functional studies indicated that Rab 11 -FIP 2 is also important for normal plasma membrane recycling. Green fluorescent protein-Rab 11 -FIP 2 (129 - 512), which lacks its amino-terminal C 2 domain, functioned as a dominant <b>negative</b> <b>acting</b> truncation that caused accumulation of Rab 11 a and disrupted IgA trafficking in MDCK cells and transferrin trafficking in HeLa cells. The ternary association of myosin Vb and Rab 11 -FIP 2 with Rab 11 a suggests that a multimeric protein complex is involved in vesicle trafficking through plasma membrane recycling systems...|$|R
40|$|Muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor genes {{are members of}} the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. Each member of this family studied to date appears to have a distinct expression profile, however the mechanisms determining these expression patterns remain largely unknown. We have previously isolated a genomic clone containing the M 1 muscarinic receptor gene and determined its gene structure [Pepitoni, Wood and Buckley (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17112 - 17117]. We have now identified DNA elements responsible for driving cell specific expression in transient transfection assays of immortalized cell lines. A region of the gene spanning 974 nucleotides and containing 602 nucleotides of the first exon is sufficient to drive specific expression in cell lines. Like the M 4 and M 2 gene promoters, the M 1 promoter contains an Sp 1 motif which can recruit transcription factor Sp 1 and at least one other protein, although this site {{does not appear to be}} functionally important for M 1 expression in our assay. We have identified a region within the first exon of the M 1 gene that regulates expression in cell lines, contains several positive and <b>negative</b> <b>acting</b> elements and is able to drive expression of a heterologous promoter. A polypyrimidine/polypurine tract and a sequence conserved between M 1 genes of various species act in concert to enhance M 1 transcription and are able to activate a heterologous promoter.

40|$|The {{fire ant}} Solenopsis invicta and its close {{relatives}} display an important social polymorphism involving differences in colony queen number. Colonies are headed by either a single reproductive queen (monogyne form) or multiple queens (polygyne form). This variation in social organization {{is associated with}} variation at the gene Gp- 9, with monogyne colonies harboring only B-like allelic variants and polygyne colonies always containing b-like variants as well. We describe naturally occurring variation at Gp- 9 in fire ants based on 185 full-length sequences, 136 of which were obtained from S. invicta collected over much of its native range. While there is little overall differentiation between most of the numerous alleles observed, a surprising amount {{is found in the}} coding regions of the gene, with such substitutions usually causing amino acid replacements. This elevated coding-region variation may result from a lack of <b>negative</b> selection <b>acting</b> to constrain amino acid replacements over much of the protein, different mutation rates or biases in coding and non-coding sequences, <b>negative</b> selection <b>acting</b> with greater strength on non-coding than coding regions, and/or positive selection acting on the protein.

40|$|Using a {{suite of}} {{simulations}} with the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPIOM) at resolutions of about 0. 1 °, 0. 4 ° and 1. 5 °, we study the impact of resolved and parameterized vertical eddy fluxes on the long-standing biases obtained when running MPIOM at low resolutions. In the 0. 1 ° simulation, the eddy heat and salt fluxes have three features in common. First, their horizontal area averages are both upward, counteracting the downward fluxes due to time-mean circulations. Second, their divergences at intermediate depths are both <b>negative,</b> <b>acting</b> to cool and to freshen water masses, thereby reducing the major long-standing warm and saline biases of the low-resolution MPIOM at these depths. Third, both the heat and salt budgets are dominated by {{a balance between the}} divergence of eddy flux and that of mean flux. The vertical profiles of the tendency forcing due to parameterized eddies resemble those due to resolved eddies. This resemblance does not guarantee a bias reduction, as the tendency forcing terms are much less well compensated in the 0. 4 °- and 1. 5 °-simulation than in the 0. 1 °-simulation. When concentrating on the eddy-induced transports, we identify two situations in which the eddy effect is not appropriately represented by the GM-parameterization. One emphasizes the importance of the mean tracer distribution and the other the importance of the simulated isoneutral slope in determining the eddy-induced transports. Given the mean salinity distribution in the Southern ocean, characterized by a tongue of fresh Antarctic Intermediate Water, the salinity advection via eddy-induced transport tends to strengthen, rather than to weaken, the saline biases. Due to the density biases in a widened region of the Agulhas current in the low-resolution runs, the isoneutral slope vectors are erroneous and the large parameterized eddy-induced transports do not occur where they should. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
