25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} was not <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing.</b> The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, {{with all its}} detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E

40|$|My thesis imagines {{an island}} {{populated}} by Nozick’s libertarians and Rawls’ ‘left-liberals’ and considers one particular social contract proposal (‘the Minimum Agreement’) {{that both sides}} could theoretically endorse. This is a dual-contract agreement in which both sides endorse Nozick’s minimal state (‘tier one’) and then a voluntary Rawlsian association within it (‘tier two’). This approach {{can be described as}} ‘outcome orientated’, because each side endorses the other’s institutions as a means to an end, rather than because they necessarily sympathise with the moral imperatives underpinning the other side’s institutions. Therefore, the obligations arising from both tiers of the agreement have to be legal rather than moral. By demonstrating that a political consensus between left-liberals and libertarians is at least logically possible (even if unlikely), we can reject Rawls’ argument {{that it is necessary to}} exclude libertarians from his pluralistic and liberal society. My argument proceeds from the unlikely assumption that all libertarian castaways are willing to join the Rawlsian free association in tier two, as long as this means they don’t have to give up being libertarians. I then argue that: (i) whilst it is relatively simple to render Nozick’s theory into purely legal terms, it is harder to separate the moral from the political in Rawls’ political liberalism; (ii) the unique circumstances of the island environment place greater pressure on the left-liberals to compromise to reach a consensus on a single social contract; (iii) the left-liberals will have to relax Rawls’ pre-contractual assumptions of an overlapping consensus of ‘reasonable’ agents, as a result of which the outcome of the Minimum Agreement may in fact be a modus vivendi. This prompts two questions: (1) would the libertarians evolve into ‘true left-liberals’, as Gauthier’s theory of morals by agreement suggests? (2) Is <b>a</b> modus vivendi <b>necessarily</b> such <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing...</b>|$|R

At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age — the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British nuclear weapons tests). In short, Quatermass II was the perfect cold-war drama." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{financial}} markets have been highlighted by large-scale financial failures due to incompetence and fraud, such as Barings, Daiwa, Allied Irish Banks, UBS, Société Génerale, and more recently JP Morgan. While previous research has focussed on market and credit risk, {{and even if the}} focus was on operational risk it concentrates on the market reaction to operational losses, the current research addresses the root of the problem. The current research explores the final notices issued by the FSA (now FCA and PRA) of over £ 1, 000, 000 from 2008 - 2013 in order to find a common theme in the operational risks of the financial institutions. In order to categorise the final notices a framework by McConnell (2008) has been adopted. With the help of this framework the risks are more accurately distinguished in either an incident, individual, institution, or industry area. The data analysis the frequently breached principles outlined by the FSA ‘principles for business’. The results from this allow the accurate categorisation of each case, and allow us to see where financial institution most often commit operational risks. The findings indicate {{that the vast majority of}} operational risks occur on an institutional level; however, the findings also show that no cases were attributed to solely the incident or industry area. Furthermore, two subcategories have been created in order to place the cases more accurately, these subcategories are a combination of the already existing areas; the individual and institution area, and the industry and institution area. This makes the tally for institutional area increase, and results in only 3 cases involving no institutional factors whatsoever. With these results suggestions to minimise the frequency and severity of operational risks are made in the form of adopting either a new regulatory body, which has already happened. The further suggestions include adopting a Dodd-Frank Act stress testing similar approach to risk management of financial institutions, or applying the Enterprise Wide Risk Management (EWRM) framework in order to stop risks in the earlier stages. However, it is important to consider the definition of risk, as it is not <b>necessarily</b> deemed <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing,</b> especially for financial institutions who most take some risks in order to maintain competitive and profitable, the suggestions are therefore recommendations on determining what the good, and the bad risks are...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{assurance}} {{is increasingly}} becoming {{an important aspect}} of higher education institutions in developing countries, as expressed in the development of relevant policies, structures and systems at national and institutional levels. This thesis critically examines the nature of quality assurance policies and practices in selected universities in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as well as the factors that shape these policies. Through a close examination of these policies and practices, the thesis explains why some universities realise better quality than others, even though they fall within the same geographical region and share relatively similar historical legacies. Although this study was largely qualitative, it did not preclude quantitative dimensions. Integrating the two approaches made it possible not only to triangulate data, but also to engage in multidimensional analysis of some of the phenomena under investigation. While debates in the literature locate quality assurance within internal and external discourses, this does not sufficiently explain the tensions that were observed amongst the various stakeholders within institutions, especially between management and academic staff. The manner in which institutional policies were developed, the role academic staff played in the process, and the reporting lines associated with institutional quality assurance arrangements, are reflected in staff perceptions on whether or not they regarded the policies as internal to the academic community {{and the extent to which}} they own the policies. The main contribution of this thesis to debates on quality assurance is its revelation of the complexities that arise in institutional policy making as a result of the highly differentiated nature of the academy. This aspect points at the need for institutions to pay particular care in adopting most appropriate strategies that privilege the organic development of policies within institutions. On the whole, institutions were mainly preoccupied with developing quality assurance policies and systems that are comparable to international standards, hence the heavy reliance on external/international expertise in doing so. Whilst this is not <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> iii <b>bad</b> <b>thing,</b> the quality assurance systems that were developed did not take into account the contextual peculiarities of the studied institutions. A direct consequence of this was the development of policies and mechanisms that are more concerned with standardisation of procedures than with enhancement of academic practice. Such quality assurance systems have not resulted in the self-improvement of institutions. The establishment of quality assurance policies and the putting in place of structures and procedures are necessary but not sufficient conditions for enhancing academic practice in universities...|$|R
40|$|Study question: Is {{the fear}} for {{designer}} babies a convincing {{argument against the}} development of stem cell derived (SCD-) gametes? Summary answer: Although SCD-gametes can facilitate the creation of designer babies, this need not undermine the entire enterprise of in vitro gamete derivation. What is known already: The dawn of new reproductive techniques is often accompanied by fears for eugenic practices, the creation of so-called designer babies in particular. The reproductive use of SCD-gametes feeds similar worries, {{in view of the}} possibility to select and design embryos with desired nondisease related traits. While such practices have a negative moral connotation, it should be investigated whether or not this moral worry is justified, both in terms of the scientific possibilities (state of the art), and the moral wrongness of selecting and or editing embryos in function of non-disease related traits. Study design, size, duration: A literature study was performed to delineate how the terms ‘eugenics’ and ‘designer baby’ are used and how they relate to each other. Next, claims in the scientific and ethical literature about how SCD-gametes may be used for eugenic purposes were inventoried. These claims were critically evaluated for scientific accurateness. Finally, we question whether the claimed possibility of selecting or genetically designing future offspring based on non-disease related traits is <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> morally <b>bad</b> <b>thing.</b> Participants/materials, setting, methods: Literature study, conceptual analysis, normative analysis. Main results and the role of chance: A first possibility is to produce large numbers of gametes (especially oocytes) and embryos to select genetic traits. Second, stem cells could be edited via CRISPR/Cas 9 and differentiated into gametes. Third, SCD-gamete technology could be used to recombine SCDgametes with other gametes and derive gametes from the resulting embryos (and so on) to shape the genome through selective breeding, by combining desirable traits that arise in different embryos. Fourth, at present somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is hindered by the short supply of human oocytes. This could be overcome by means of SCD-gametes. By facilitating SCNT, SCD-gamete technology could ease the creation of embryos with the same genome as someone with a desirable genotype. A last possibility would be to create gametes from persons with desired traits (e. g. via induced pluripotent stem cells) and make these available via gamete banks. Each of these scenarios is premised upon further scientific developments. Given the rapid advance in CRISPR/Cas 9, it might become possible to edit embryos so that SCD-gamete technology will be neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition to genetically design offspring. If SCD-gamete technology would become safe, it might nevertheless facilitate eugenic purposes, of which the moral wrongness remains contested. Limitations, reasons for caution: Gamete derivation from human stem cells is still in the research phase. The question of the moral wrongness of enhancement and eugenics is explored but not ‘answered’, as it is a fundamentally normative question. Similarly, ‘designer baby’ is a stipulative concept, as it is contested which interventions amount to ‘designing’. Wider implications of the findings: The causal link between SCD-gamete technology and eugenics/designer babies is weak and speculative. Moreover, the wrongness of such an evolution is contested.
