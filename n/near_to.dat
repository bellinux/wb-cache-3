5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point <b>near</b> <b>to</b> the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses <b>near</b> <b>to</b> the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E
