5|$|A <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> is {{a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the <b>neutron</b> <b>star,</b> forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E

40|$|Double {{neutrons}} {{are especially}} {{important because they}} give most accurate informations on the masses of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> Observations on double <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> show that all masses of the <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are below 1. 5.

40|$|Several aspects {{related to}} {{astrophysics}} of isolated <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are discussed. We {{start with an}} introduction into the “new zoo” of young isolated <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> In addition to classical radio pulsars, now we know several species (soft gamma-ray repeators, anomalous X-ray pulsars, central compact objects in supernova remnants, close-by cooling <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> - aka “Magniﬁcent seven”, - RRATs, and some others). All these types are brieﬂy discussed. In the second lecture a description of magneto-rotational evolution of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> is given. Finally, in the third lecture we discuss population synthesis of isolated <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> In some details we discuss population synthesis of young isolated radio pulsars and young close-by cooling <b>neutron</b> <b>stars...</b>|$|R
40|$|Antikaon {{condensation}} and deconfinement {{phase transition}} in <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are investigated in a chiral hadronic model (also referred {{as to the}} FST model) for the hadronic phase and in the MIT bag model for the deconfined quark matter phase. It is shown {{that the existence of}} quark matter phase makes antikaon condensation impossible in <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> The properties of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are sensitive to the bag constant. For the small values of the bag constant, the pure quark matter core appears and hyperons are strongly suppressed in <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> whereas for the large bag constant, the hadron-quark mixed phase exists in the center of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> The maximum masses of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> with the quark matter phase are lower than those without the quark matter phase; meanwhile, the maximum masses of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> with the quark matter phase increase with the bag constant...|$|R
5|$|Stellar {{encounters}} are {{not very}} common in the disk of the Milky Way, where the Sun is, but in the dense core of globular clusters they occur frequently. At {{some point during the}} 10 billion years, the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> is thought to have encountered and captured the host star of the planet into a tight orbit, probably losing a previous companion star in the process.|$|E
5|$|Such mergers were theorized {{to produce}} kilonovae, and {{evidence}} for a kilonova associated with GRB 130603B was seen. The mean duration of these events of 0.2 seconds suggests (because of causality) a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms; less than 0.2 light-seconds (about 60,000km or 37,000 miles—four times the Earth's diameter). This further suggests a very compact object as the source. The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> initially swallowed by a black hole {{in less than two}} seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> material (no longer neutronium) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, {{over a longer period of}} time. A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The infalling matter {{produced}} {{complex and}} spectacular effects. The infalling matter 'spun up' the <b>neutron</b> <b>star,</b> {{due to the}} transfer of angular momentum, {{and for a few}} hundred million years, the stars formed a low-mass X-ray binary, as the infalling matter was heated to temperatures high enough to glow in X-rays.|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} {{sequences of}} rapidly rotating <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> in dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, employing two equations {{of state for}} the nuclear matter. We analyze the dependence of the physical properties of these <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling strength. For a given equation of state we determine the physically relevant domain of rapidly rotating <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> which is delimited by the set of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> rotating at the Kepler limit, the set of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> along the secular instability line, and the set of static <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> As compared to Einstein gravity, {{the presence of the}} Gauss-Bonnet term decreases this domain, leading to lower values for the maximum mass as well as to smaller central densities. The quadrupole moment is decreased by the Gauss-Bonnet term for rapidly rotating <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> while it is increased for slowly rotating <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> The universal relation between the quadrupole moment and the moment of inertia found in General Relativity appears to extend to dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with very little dependence on the coupling strength of the Gauss-Bonnet term. The <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> carry a small dilaton charge. Comment: 24 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{summarize}} the current observational evidence for associations between supernova remnants and <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> including radio pulsars, proposed "inactive" young <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> "anomalous" X-ray pulsars, and soft gamma-ray repeaters, {{and argue that}} the paradigm that all young <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are Crab-like requires reconsideration...|$|R
50|$|The Magnificent Seven is the {{informal}} {{name of a}} group of isolated young cooling <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> at a distance of 120 to 500 parsecs from Earth.

5|$|The massive-star model {{probably}} {{does not explain}} all types of gamma-ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short-duration gamma-ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and no massive stars, such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy halos. The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars. According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other because gravitational radiation releases energy until tidal forces suddenly rip the neutron stars apart and they collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma-ray bursts, including the merger of a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> and a black hole, the accretion-induced collapse of a <b>neutron</b> <b>star,</b> or the evaporation of primordial black holes.|$|E
5|$|Coma Berenices also {{contains}} the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> RBS 1223 and the pulsar PSR B1237+25. RBS 1223 {{is a member}} of the Magnificent Seven, a group of young neutron stars. In 1975, the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet, the white dwarf HZ 43, was discovered in Coma Berenices. In 1995, there was a very rare outburst of the WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova AL Comae Berenices. A June 2003 outburst from GO Comae Berenices, an SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova, was photometrically observed.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed.|$|E
50|$|After {{spinning}} {{for several}} million years pulsars are drained {{of their energy}} and become normal <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> Few of the known existing <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are pulsars.

40|$|Abstract. Six of {{the eight}} double <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> known in the Galactic disk have low orbital eccentricities (< 0. 27) {{indicating}} that their second-born <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This {{is similar to the}} case of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of the second-born <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> in five of the six low-eccentricity double <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are remarkably low (between 1. 18 and 1. 30 M⊙). It is argued that these low-mass, low-kick <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> were formed by the electron-capture collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than about 3. 5 M⊙, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the electron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary systems, and not in single stars...|$|R
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b> Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E
5|$|Typical pulsar periods {{for young}} pulsars {{are of the}} order of one second, and they {{increase}} with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion. The pulse period of PSR B1620-26 is a few milliseconds, providing strong evidence for matter transfer. It is believed that as the pulsar's red giant companion expanded, it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe, so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|Very {{massive stars}} can undergo core {{collapse}} when nuclear fusion becomes unable {{to sustain the}} core against its own gravity; passing this threshold {{is the cause of}} all types of supernova except Type Ia. The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> with little radiated energy.|$|E

5|$|While a {{high school}} student in his second-year at a school in West Virginia in 2009, Bolyard found a {{rotating}} radio transient, a form of <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b> Bolyard accomplished this through analysis of observations while a member of the Pulsar Search Collaboratory, an initiative aimed at allowing youth access to the Robert C.

5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b> Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible {{in the night sky}} for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E
50|$|In August 2002, LIGO {{began its}} search for cosmic {{gravitational}} waves. Measurable emissions of gravitational waves are expected from binary systems (collisions and coalescences of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> or black holes), supernova explosions of massive <b>stars</b> (which form <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> and black holes), accreting <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> rotations of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> with deformed crusts, and {{the remnants of}} gravitational radiation created by {{the birth of the}} universe.

50|$|In {{addition}} to radio emissions, <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> {{have also been}} identified {{in other parts of}} the electromagnetic spectrum.

The majority of <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> detected, including those identified in optical, X-ray and gamma rays, also emit radio waves; the Crab Pulsar produces electromagnetic emissions across the spectrum. However, there exist <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> called radio-quiet <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> with no radio emissions detected.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two {{classes of}} <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> may {{exist in the}} galactic halo: <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> {{originating}} in the disk with high velocities and <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> originating in globular clusters (via Type II supernovae and/or accretion induced collapse).
