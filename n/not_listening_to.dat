The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public.|$|E

25|$|Martin became {{involved}} in a diplomatic row with the United States administration after accusing, with Bill Clinton, the US of <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> global environmental concerns. Martin rejected the US Ambassador David Wilkins' rebuke and stated that he was standing up for Canada's interests over softwood and other issues. Wilkins, Conservative Leader Stephen Harper, and NDP leader Jack Layton accused Martin of orchestrating a row with the US in order to garner public support during an election campaign and noted that Canada's record in cutting carbon dioxide emissions is worse {{than that of the}} US.|$|E
25|$|Later, Smith and Pocahontas {{meet with}} Grandmother Willow {{and plan to}} bring peace between the colonists and the tribe.

Enraged, Kocoum attacks and {{attempts}} to kill Smith, but Thomas intervenes with his musket and kills Kocoum, who destroys Pocahontas' necklace in the process. Smith commands Thomas to leave just before the tribesmen come and capture Smith while Kocoum's body is taken away. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan declares war on the English, beginning with Smith's execution at sunrise. Pocahontas tries to convince him otherwise, but Powhatan refuses to listen, as he is furious with Pocahontas for <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> his orders {{to remain in the}} village.|$|E

Sosa then {{receives}} a call {{from one of his}} men, who says Tony's mansion is on fire and being seized by law enforcement, his drug empire reduced to nothing, and he is confident Tony is dead. Meanwhile, hiding in a safehouse in the Miami glades, Tony laments the deaths of his friend Manny and sister Gina, chastises himself for <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the advice of others due to his bull-headedness, determines to quit cocaine, and vows revenge on Sosa.|$|E
25|$|Schumacher and Benetton, {{along with}} three other drivers, were summoned to a FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting on July 26 to discuss his black flag at the British Grand Prix. It was {{announced}} at the meeting that Schumacher was disqualified from the race, thus losing his six points he earned from finishing second in the race, and in addition he was handed a two race ban. This meant Schumacher would miss his home race, the German Grand Prix, along with the Hungarian Grand Prix, unless he chose to appeal the decision. In addition to the punishment handed to Schumacher, Benetton were fined a total of $600,000—$500,000 for <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the Stewards' at the British race, and $100,000 for not sending copies of their engine management system when immediately requested. At the council meeting, the governing body also announced that no evidence had been found to suggest Benetton were using illegal electronic systems, but did say that an illegal system did exist, which could be activated at any time. Benetton and Schumacher appealed the decision made by the FIA, allowing the German to race at his home Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing for The Observer, Anthony Sampson {{thought the}} book had [...] "sparkle", adding that [...] "it is often {{difficult}} to remember that we are <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> his old hero Mr. James Bond." [...] Sampson noted that the book included [...] "several yarns which are worthy of the best spy-stories". The reviewer for The Economist enjoyed the book, but considered that while many of the stories [...] "make good reading... they are not new". For The New York Times, John Barkham thought that Fleming's foray into non-fiction produced [...] "mixed results". Although he found the subject interesting, the basis in interview resulted in a [...] "choppy book" [...] that was [...] "no more than an interim report".|$|E
500|$|Milian {{believed}} that the public expected [...] "a certain thing" [...] from her when she first appeared with Ja Rule, however she wanted to record the type of music she was signed to do. She said that [...] "AM to PM" [...] was a [...] "cool record", {{but it was not}} what the public expected. Milian felt that her record label was confused as to how they wanted her image to be portrayed; one second she was young and singing [...] "AM to PM", and next she was a grown woman singing [...] "Get Away". She realized that the change confused the audience, and that [...] "nobody was buying it". To explain that she was serious about her musical career, Milian approached the executives at Island Def Jam, and [...] "cussed them all out", telling them that they were <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "Slaughter", Ndegéocello tried to weave {{together}} sonic influences from the producers Trevor Horn and RZA, {{as well as}} the bands Yes, Sade, and The Human League: [...] "That's what I tried to achieve in this particular recording: some sonic tapestries that people, even if they're <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the lyrics, could just feel or hear, or just have a deep, inner dialogue with." [...] She covered Ready for the World's 1986 song [...] "Love You Down", deconstructing it into what Village Voice critic Eugene Holley Jr. described as [...] "a stripper's classic". Songs such as [...] "Mass Transit" [...] and [...] "White Girl" [...] featured Ndegéocello's characteristic ska and reggae influenced basslines; Holley argued that Caribbean riddims and country-rock guitar grooves underpinned the music, serving as a backdrop for Ndegéocello's contralto singing throughout Devil's Halo. In the opinion of Ed Potton from The Times, her voice [...] "resided somewhere between Sade and PJ Harvey".|$|E

500|$|Ruby's {{credibility}} builds throughout Season 3. In [...] "Sin City", she restores {{power to}} the Colt for the Winchesters to use in their war against demons. The episode [...] "Malleus Maleficarum" [...] provides her backstory, revealing {{that she had been}} a witch during the Plague who sold her soul to a demon. She confides in Dean that, unlike other demons, she still remembers {{what it is like to}} be human, citing this trait as the reason she is helping the brothers against other demons. She returns in [...] "Jus in Bello" [...] to save the brothers from an attacking horde of demons. Upon learning that they have lost the Colt, she decides to perform a spell that will destroy all the demons in the area, including herself. However, because the spell requires a human virgin's heart, Dean does not allow her to perform it. Although the plan he comes up with instead saves himself and his brother, the people they leave behind get killed by demons pursuing Sam and Dean, which Ruby uses to rebuke the brothers for <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the album was mixed to generally positive. Imran Ahmed of the New Musical Express predicted that based on the record, [...] "genius can't {{be more than a}} few albums away". Contrastingly, entertainment.ie writer Andrew Lynch suggested that Milian needed original ideas. Milian believed that the public expected [...] "a certain thing" [...] from her when she first appeared with Ja Rule, however she wanted to record the type of music she was signed to do. She said that [...] "AM to PM" [...] was a [...] "cool record," [...] but it was not what the public expected. Milian approached the executives at her record company, Island Def Jam, and [...] "cussed them all out", telling them that they were <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> her. She felt that she had gained their respect by explaining that she was serious about her musical career. In the following years, she was featured on the track [...] "It's All Gravy", a duet with British rapper Romeo, which was a UK top ten hit; provided the theme song for the hit Disney Channel animated series Kim Possible, [...] "Call Me, Beep Me!"; and collaborated with Hilary Duff on Duff's Christmas album Santa Claus Lane (2002), on the song [...] "I Heard Santa on the Radio".|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, who {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, {{thought she might}} be more forgiving in hindsight as she knows that the follow-ups to [...] "Datalore" [...] were great episodes. She thought it was reminiscent of the evil twin of Captain James T. Kirk in [...] episode [...] "" [...] and the mirror universe version of Spock seen in [...] "". She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending to do, and that the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one is smart enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines of would-be teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers <b>not</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> him. Quite simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless." [...] He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E
