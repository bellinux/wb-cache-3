40|$|Background Helopanoplia distincta is an extinct {{soft-shelled turtle}} (Pan-Trionychidae) {{for which the}} type {{specimen}} is a fragmentary costal and the inguinal <b>notch</b> <b>portion</b> of the left hypoplastron from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Lance Formation of Wyoming, USA that bear a distinct surface sculpture pattern consisting of raised tubercles. Over {{the course of the}} past few decades, a number of additional, fragmentary specimens from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Hell Creek Formation of Montana and North Dakota have been referred to this taxon based on the presence of these tubercles, but a more complete understanding of the anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of this distinctive soft-shelled turtle is still outstanding. Methods We here figure and describe shell remains of eight fossils referable to Helopanoplia distincta from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana and North Dakota that, in combination, document nearly all aspects of the shell morphology of this taxon. We furthermore explore the relationships of this fossil turtle by inserting it into a modified phylogenetic analysis of pan-trionychid relationships. Results The new fossil material thoroughly supports the validity of Helopanoplia distincta. In addition to its unique surface sculpture pattern, this turtle can be diagnosed relative to all other named pan-trionychids by the presence of a distinct corner along the margin of costals II, the complete covering of costal ribs I–VI by metaplastic bone, midline contact of the main plastral elements, hyoplastral shoulder, presence of a lateral, upturned margin on the hyo/hypoplastron that is covered dorsally and laterally by sculptured metaplastic bone, a single, lateral hyoplastral process, and the apomorphic presence of fine scallops along the margin of costals VIII, formation of a laterally embraced, rounded nuchal, anteriorly rounded costals I, distally expanded costals II, and narrow costals VII. A phylogenetic analysis places Helopanoplia distincta as sister to the clade formed by Plastomenus thomasii and Hutchemys spp., thereby confirming its identity as a plastomenid. The vast majority of Helopanoplia distincta material has been recovered from fine-grained overbank deposits, thereby supporting the hypothesis that this turtle favored ponded waters...|$|E

40|$|A Shuttle type of {{aircraft}} (10) with an escape hatch (12) has an arcuately shaped pole housing (16) attachable to an interior wall and ceiling with its open end adjacent to the escape hatch. The pole housing 16 contains a telescopically arranged and arcuately shaped primary pole member (22) and extension pole member (23) which are guided by roller assemblies (30, 35). The extension pole member (23) is slidable and extendable relative to the primary pole member (22). For actuation, a spring actuated system includes a spring (52) in the pole housing. A locking member (90) engages both pole members (22, 23) through <b>notch</b> <b>portions</b> (85, 86) in the pole members. The locking member selectively releases the extension pole member (23) and the primary pole member (22). An internal one-way clutch or anti-return mechanism prevents retraction of the extension pole member from an extended position. Shock absorbers (54) (150, 152) are for absoring {{the energy of the}} springs. A manual backup deployment system is provided which includes a canted ring (104) biased by a spring member (108). A lever member (100) with a slot and pin connection (102) permits the mechanical manipulation of the canted ring to move the primary pole member. The ring (104) also prevents retraction of the main pole. The crew escape mechanism includes a magazine (60) and a number of lanyards (62), each lanyard being mounted by a roller loop (68) over the primary pole member (22). The strap on the roller loop has stitching for controlled release, a protection sheath (74) to prevent tangling and a hook member (69) for attachment to a crew harness...|$|R
50|$|In 1922, when Connecticut first {{numbered}} {{its state}} highways, {{the route of}} the old turnpike was designated as State Highway 168. Modern Route 87 was established in 1932 as a renumbering of old State Highway 168 and originally ended in Bolton like the old turnpike, approximately at the current intersection of US 6 and US 44. In 1934, the Bolton <b>Notch</b> to Andover <b>portion</b> became part of U.S. Route 6A (later to become US 6) and Route 87 was truncated to its current northern end.|$|R
5000|$|Often, owners may {{desire to}} lower their vehicle {{to such an extent}} that they must cut away {{portions}} of the frame for more clearance. A reinforcement member commonly referred to as a C-notch is then bolted or welded to the vehicle frame in order to maintain structural integrity. Specifically on pickup trucks, this process is termed [...] "notching" [...] because a <b>portion</b> (<b>notch)</b> of the cargo bed may also be removed, along with the wheel wells, to provide maximum axle clearance. For some, it is desirable to have the vehicle so low that the frame rests on the ground when the air bags are fully deflated. Owners generally choose between having their cars 'tuck' their wheels into the arches when their air suspension is fully lowered or alternatively they can choose to go for 'fitment' which in partnership with stretched tyres sees the arch itself fit in between the tyre and rim.|$|R
40|$|Mouse Notch 1, {{which plays}} an {{important}} role in cell fate determination in development, is proteolytically processed within its transmembrane domain by unidentified γ-secretase-like activity that depends on presenilin. To study this proteolytic event, we established a cell-free Notch cleavage assay system using the membrane fraction of fibroblast transfectants of various Notch constructs with deletion of the extracellular <b>portion</b> (<b>Notch</b> ΔE). The cytoplasmic <b>portion</b> of <b>Notch</b> 1 ΔE was released from the membrane upon incubation at 37 °C, which was inhibited by the specific γ-secretase inhibitor, MW 167, or by overexpression of dominant negative presenilin 1. Likewise, other members of mouse Notch family were proteolytically cleaved in a presenilin-dependent, MW 167 -sensitive manner in vivo as well as in the cell-free Notch ΔE cleavage assay system. All four members of the mouse Notch family migrated to the nucleus and activated the transcription from the promoter carrying the RBP-J consensus sequences after they were released from the membrane. These results demonstrate the conserved biochemical mechanism of signal transduction among mammalian Notch family members...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this report}} were to describe the occurrence and features of dynamic ventrorostral displacement of the dorsal laryngeal mucosa (VRDDLM) {{in a group of}} Thoroughbred horses presented for investigation of poor performance and/or abnormal respiratory noise. Records from 600, dynamic, endoscopic examinations of the upper respiratory tract of horses were reviewed. Horses with VRDDLM were identified as those in which the dorsal laryngeal mucosa progressively obscured the interarytenoid <b>notch</b> and dorsoaxial <b>portion</b> of the corniculate processes of the arytenoid cartilages during high-speed exercise. The condition was recognised in 12 horses. Concurrent abnormalities of the respiratory tract of eight horses were also identified and included, axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds, vocal cord prolapse, unilateral and bilateral ventromedial luxation of the apex of the corniculate process of the arytenoid cartilage, and intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate. VRDDLM is a rare abnormality of the upper portion of the respiratory tract of horses that may be associated with abnormal respiratory noise and potentially poor performance. The significance of the condition is not known, but the presence of this condition in combination with other, obstructive diseases of the equine airway warrants further investigation...|$|R
