5|$|With new constitutions {{in place}} for the territories, {{elections}} were held throughout 1961–62, with Welensky's UFP being beaten in each one.

In Northern Rhodesia, neither the UFP <b>nor</b> <b>the</b> two African nationalist parties held a majority, but the African nationalists united to push for independence. Welensky hoped to get a display of confidence in federation, so he dissolved parliament in mid-1962 and held elections.
