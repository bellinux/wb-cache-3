50|$|Mosman Park was {{established}} {{with the first}} survey of town lots in 1889 as Buckland Hill, taking {{its name from the}} prominent local hill that was a major maritime <b>navigation</b> <b>mark</b> for shipping from the earliest days of colonization.|$|E
50|$|A sea mark, also seamark and <b>{{navigation}}</b> <b>mark,</b> {{is a form}} of aid to {{navigation and}} pilotage aid which identifies the approximate position of a maritime channel, hazard and administrative area to allow boats, ships and seaplanes to navigate safely.|$|E

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was maintained}} by Coast Guard personnel {{stationed at the}} Marquette Harbor Light until {{some time in the}} 1970s, when the Breakwater Light was automated. It continues to serve as an aid to <b>navigation,</b> <b>marking</b> the offshore end of the breakwater.|$|R

50|$|Irish Lights is {{also the}} body {{that serves as the}} General Lighthouse Authority for the island of Ireland plus its {{adjacent}} seas and islands.

50|$|Moulin de Rozel was a mill {{built in}} 1799 and {{dismantled}} in 1916, later converted to an artillery observation post by the Germans in {{the occupation of}} the Channel Islands now a Jersey listed building, it {{also serves as a}} marine <b>navigation</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} is 25 m {{high and}} 12 m broad. Nowadays {{it has no}} importance as a <b>navigation</b> <b>mark</b> and therefore the light is not very strong (ca. 4000 candela). It was totally turned off 1990-93. The interval of the light is intermittent: 4 seconds on, 1 second off, repeated.|$|E
5000|$|Whitefish Point is {{the nearest}} <b>navigation</b> <b>mark</b> to the {{wreckage}} of the ore freighter SS Edmund Fitzgerald, which sank in 1975.

More vessels have been lost in the Whitefish Point area than any other part of Lake Superior.|$|E
50|$|Trinity House of Deptford {{was founded}} in 1514 to look after <b>navigation</b> <b>marks</b> in the Thames Estuary. Similar organisations were founded at other places later.

Trinity House now looks after most of the marks in England and Wales, with the Northern Lighthouse Board in Scotland and the Commissioners of Irish Lights {{for the whole of}} Ireland.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of a single set of international rules and practices, there existed separate practices and various conventions and informal procedures in different parts of the world, as advanced by various maritime nations. As a result, there were inconsistencies and even contradictions that gave rise to unintended collisions. Vessel navigation lights for operating in darkness as well as <b>navigation</b> <b>marks</b> also were not standardised, giving rise to dangerous confusion and ambiguity between vessels at risk of colliding.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the village}} land was {{acquired}} by compulsory purchase in 1938 to build an RAF Coastal Command Station, RAF St Eval. Many buildings were demolished leaving only the Norman church, the Vicarage, and Trevisker Farm. These buildings were effectively surrounded by RAF activity, and during World War II were taken over for RAF use, with the church tower used as an observation post and <b>navigation</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

5000|$|His widow had an obelisk, {{known as}} the [...] "Pain de Sucre" [...] (Sugarloaf) due to its shape and {{frequent}} re-painting in white, erected to his memory {{and that of the}} sailors who perished with him. It stands above the sea on the crest of a low hill in Sainte-Adresse, now a suburb of Le Havre, and doubled as a <b>navigation</b> <b>mark</b> helping other sailors avoid the hazards in the approach to the port.|$|E
50|$|The total {{waterway}} {{length is}} 227 km, of which 48 km are man-made. The current flows north from Lake Onega to the White Sea, and all <b>navigation</b> <b>marks</b> are set according to it. Once in Lake Onega, ships can exit the southwest shore through the Svir River (and its two locks) to reach Lake Ladoga and then proceed down the Neva River to Saint Petersburg and the Baltic Sea. Alternatively, from Lake Onega river ships can sail eastward into the Volga-Baltic Waterway.|$|R
5000|$|The light {{station was}} {{authorized}} and established in 1850, {{and was the}} principal aid to <b>navigation</b> <b>marking</b> the entrance to Rockport harbor, which was then a major shipbuilding and lime rock processing center. The light was originally mounted {{on top of the}} keeper's house, with a fourth-order Fresnel lens installed in 1856. The light was deactivated in 1859 but restarted in 1861. In 1874-75 the present tower was built, with the oil house added in 1904. [...] The property was sold by the United States Coast Guard in 1932, with the light deactivated in 1934. [...] The light station is in private ownership.|$|R
50|$|The Indiana Harbor East Breakwater Light is {{an active}} aid to <b>navigation</b> that <b>marks</b> {{the end of a}} {{breakwater}} {{on the east side of}} the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal where it enters Lake Michigan.|$|R
50|$|St. Severin is a Lutheran parish {{church in}} Keitum {{on the island}} of Sylt, {{northern}} Germany. It was named after the 4th-century bishop Severin of Cologne. Built in the Romanesque style and first documented in 1240, the church stands back from the town at a higher elevation. Tests have shown that the roof of the church can be dated to 1216, making it the oldest religious building in Schleswig-Holstein. The tower was built around 1450 and served as a <b>navigation</b> <b>mark</b> for seafarers as well as a prison.|$|E
5000|$|Peeler Bluff (...) is a {{prominent}} rock bluff along {{the middle of}} the west coast of McNamara Island. The island lies within the northern edge of Abbot Ice Shelf, but Peeler Bluff is a conspicuous <b>navigation</b> <b>mark</b> from seaward. This area was explored by personnel aboard the USS Glacier and Staten Island in February 1961. Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Lieutenant Commander James C. Peeler, U.S. Navy, who camped here, February 7-9, 1961, and obtained position data for the bluff and other points in the vicinity.|$|E
50|$|He had a son, John Marshall (born 1944), {{with his}} {{longtime}} friend and mistress, Renée (née Gilbert), whose later married name was Taylor. Renée was the sister of the British film director Lewis Gilbert. During the war years, they lived coincidentally in flats in the White House in Albany Street near Regent's Park in London (now a hotel). The White House was a favourite location to live during the war years. It {{was built in the}} shape of a white cross and was such a good <b>navigation</b> <b>mark</b> for the Luftwaffe, that it was rumoured that there were standing orders to avoid bombing it - hence its popularity with celebrities and the wealthy.|$|E
5000|$|Sections 8, 9 and 11 {{relate to}} {{the powers of the}} General Lighthouse Authorities; their area of operation, their ability to enter into {{commercial}} agreements; and their use of electronic aids to <b>navigation</b> to <b>mark</b> wrecks.|$|R

50|$|Fortification towers often {{served as}} {{important}} <b>navigation</b> <b>marks</b> whereby sailors aiming {{to reach the}} Beirut harbor would set a course that kept Burj al-Musallah in line with Burj al-Kashef on Martyrs’ Square. Both were demolished in 1892. The southeastern tower of the Crusader castle was separated from the land by a 14-meter-wide moat. The Crusader commander, Jean d’Ibelin, took control of Beirut in 1197 and undertook renovation works on the castle. When Mamluk troops captured the city from the Crusaders in 1291, they partly demolished the fortifications. Bombardments by a Russian fleet in 1827 and a British fleet in 1840 gave the final blow to the damaged castle. It became militarily obsolete and was never rebuilt.|$|R
