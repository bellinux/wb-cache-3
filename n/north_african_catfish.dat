5000|$|Formerly {{called the}} “Zaire” (Kongo nzere, [...] "the river that {{swallows}} all rivers"), the Congo's origin is {{traced to the}} Chambeshi (discovered by Livingstone) in Zambia. The Kalambo River has one of Africa’s highest waterfalls (250 meters) at the Zambia/Tanzania border. The Chambeshi contributes to the Bangweulu Swamp, home to both the black lechwe and the Bemba people. (Livingstone died there searching for the Nile source.) Other denizens include the oribi, tsessebe (relative of the gnu), African lungfish and the stork-like shoebill. The Luapula and Lualaba Rivers are followed, as is the Lake Tanganyika effluent river, the Lukuga. Tanganyika provides habitat for Limnocnida (freshwater jellyfish), the Bichir (a primitive fish), water cobra, the spotted-necked otter and diverse populations of cichlids. The abandoned “country estate” of Col. Stewart Gore-Browne (incorrectly called “Henry” in the series) — known as Shiwa Ngandu — is visited. It is in northern Zambia. The Congo’s course is picked up again far downstream where it forms {{a part of the}} border between Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo. The wider river here hosts elephant-snout fish, <b>north</b> <b>African</b> <b>catfish,</b> and the water chevrotain. “Bai” (Biaka, “glades”) provide habitat for elephant, hippo and the western lowland gorilla, which numbers as many as 50,000 within the Odzala National Park. River martins swarm massively. The Congo is so wide here that it forms an effective barrier between two related species of ape: the common chimp on the north bank and the bonobo (pygmy chimp) on the south. The sequence makes another huge jump here, to the Livingstone Falls just below Kinshasa. Finally, Gabon's Loango National Park is visited — the last place where large African animals may still be seen wild on a seashore.|$|E

40|$|A {{putative}} FSH receptor (FSH-R) cDNA was cloned from <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> testis. Alignment of the deduced {{amino acid}} sequence with other (putative) glycoprotein hormone receptors {{and analysis of the}} <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> gene indicated that the cloned receptor belonged to the FSH receptor subfamily. Catfish FSH-R (cfFSH-R) mRNA expression was observed in testis and ovary; abundant mRNA expression was also detected in seminal vesicles. The isolated cDNA encoded a functional receptor since its transient expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK-T) 293 cells resulted in ligand-dependent cAMP production. Remarkably, <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> LH (cfLH; the catfish FSH-like gonadotropin has not been purified yet) had the highest potency in this system. From the other ligands tested, only human recombinant FSH (hrFSH) was active, showing a fourfold lower potency than cfLH, while hCG and human TSH (hTSH) were inactive. Human CG (as well as cfLH, hrFSH, eCG, but not hTSH) stimulated testicular androgen secretion in vitro but seemed to be unable to bind to the cfFSH-R. However, it was known that hCG is biologically active in <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> (e. g., induction of ovulation). This indicated that an LH receptor is also expressed in <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> testis.

40|$|There was {{considered}} production efficiency of {{three kinds of}} feeds with a partial substitute of fish meal specified to intensive culturing of "catfishes" in <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> in semioperational conditions of RAS in present BSc. thesis. There were made use of feeds by the Dutch company Coppens (CATCO SELECT - 13 EF, CATCO GROWER - 12 EF) and feed by the Hungarian company Haltáp. The individual feeds differed particularly from the contents of fat and from the contents and the origin of a proteinous component. The temperature {{in the course of}} the whole experiment was 24. 5 ? 0. 95 °C (mean ? S. D.), pH was 7. 2 ? 0. 34 and the content of dissolved oxygen was 2. 4 ? 0. 34 mg ? 1 O 2. The experiment was divided into three particular feeding periods 20 days at a time and it took 63 days in total. The size of optimal relative daily ration served to fish along the line of the experimental attempt made in the event of feed SELECT - 13 EF 1. 40 ? 0. 29 % (mean ? S. D.), GROWER - 12 EF 1. 28 ? 0. 21 % and Haltáp 1. 94 ? 0. 06 %. Next production parameters were followed in the course of own attempt: individual weight, stocking density of tank, specific growth rate (SGR), food conversation ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), gonadosomatic index (GSI), Fulton's coefficient of condition and utilisation rate. Average stocking density of fish in tank was 53. 49 ? 0. 36 kg ? m- 3 at the start of the experiment and 168. 75 ? 12. 23 kg ? m- 3 at the end. Average individual weight of fish at the beginning of the experiment was 269. 64 ? 10 g and by the end 642. 85 ? 55 g. In the course of testing it came to average increase in individual weight approximately 2. 4 times. Resulting mortality along the line of the experimental period was on level 1. 25 %. The hightest achieved SGR was discovered at the group feeded by feed SELECT - 13 EF (1. 58 ? 0. 41 % ? d- 1), the group feeded by feed Haltáp came after (1. 38 ? 0. 38 % ? d- 1). The most favourable values FCR were achieved by use of feed SELECT - 13 EF (0. 83 ? 0. 02), the group feeded by feed GROWER - 12 EF (87 ? 0. 01) followed, the worst result was achieved by use of feed Haltáp (1. 37 ? 0. 13). The most favourable values PER were achieved at fish feeded by feed SELECT - 13 EF (2. 89 ? 0. 08), feed GROWER - 12 EF (2. 54 ? 0. 04) followed and the worst results were found out by use of feed Haltáp (1. 65 ? 0. 14). GSI was growing on average five times higher values (2. 65 ? 1. 34) at females than at males (0. 53 ? 0. 26). The difference of achieved GSI depending on used feed was not found. Fulton's coefficient of condition acquired average value at females 1. 09 ? 0. 10 and at males 1. 06 ? 0. 07. Average value of utilisation rate acquired at females 39. 96 ? 1. 26 % and at males 40. 46 ? 2. 33 %. The lowest expense per weight gain (evaluated for increase of 1 kg) were noticed at feed Haltáp (41. 33,- CZK), feed SELECT - 13 EF (41. 98,- CZK) came after and feed GROWER - 12 EF proved to be (44. 02,- CZK) the worst. The review of analyses of organoleptic qualities (consistence, smell, taste and aftertaste) and the preferential analyses did not show any significant, demonstrable influence of used feed on quality of gained flesh.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the effects of {{stocking}} density on the behaviour of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> have shown that at low densities, especially directly after restocking of tanks, increased aggression might occur. This aggression may directly affect the welfare of the fish. In addition, the resulting skin damage may also lead to the release of chemical alarm cues from the skin of the fish, possibly acting as a secondary stressor in a farming situation. Moreover, in a recirculation aquaculture system, a build-up of chemical alarm cues might occur. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of a single chemical alarm cue administration on the behaviour and growth performance of group-housed <b>African</b> <b>catfish.</b> Furthermore, the effects of a single passage over a biofilter on the behavioural response of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> to chemical alarm cues were tested. Although <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> responded to chemical alarm cues with a short-term 35 % increase in the number of active fish, no long-term effects were observed on both behaviour and growth performance of the fish. Furthermore, the results indicated that a single passage over a biofilter did not strongly alter the response of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> to the alarm cue, indicated by a 25 % increase in the number of active fish. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that chemical alarm cues, at the concentration applied in this study, cannot be considered a stressor for <b>African</b> <b>catfish,</b> although the effects of higher cue concentrations need further study.

Furthermore, the changing impact of stocking density on welfare indicators at different stages throughout the growth cycle (from 10 – 1500 g) of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> is discussed. In Phase 2 a, 15 groups of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> (102. 1 ± 3. 49 g) were assigned to one of five final densities (67, 133, 267, 533, and 1067 fish/m 3). In Phase 2 b, 12 groups of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> (1044. 6 ± 31. 6 g) were assigned to one of four final densities (67, 155, 244, and 333 fish/m 3). Welfare was studied by recording both growth, physiological and behavioural parameters. A combination of univariate and multivariate analysis was applied in order to acquire an integrated and objective reflection of the effects of stocking density on a range of welfare indicators. Within the size and density ranges used, welfare was not impacted negatively by increasing density. In Phase 2 a, fish welfare improved with increasing density while in Phase 2 b no effects of stocking density were found. These results also show that the effects of stocking density are not uniform throughout the growth cycle. These differences need to be taken into account by husbandry practices to assure that high welfare standards are maintained throughout the life cycle of the fish being cultured...|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, {{extensive}} farming of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> {{over the past}} decades has increased the utilization of fishmeal as the preferred aquafeeds owing to its highly nutritional properties. However, various pressures {{have been put on}} the fish farming industry to switch to more sustainable diet {{in order to reduce the}} dependency on fishmeal as the sole fish feed. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to evaluate the potential of cricket in diets for <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> in terms of growth performance, nutrient and amino acids digestibility, immunostimulant properties and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Four feeding trials were conducted to determine the use of cricket meal in <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> diet. Cricket meal was capable of serving as an alternative protein replacement for fishmeal in the diet of farmed <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> up to 100 % without negatively affecting body composition and feed utilisation. Besides, fish fed cricket meal exhibited significantly higher nutrient and amino acids digestibility than fishmeal-fed fish. Mortalities at 12 days post-challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila was significantly decreased at dietary of 35 % and 40 % crude protein (CP) compared to control (fishmeal diet). From the pathogenic test, Aeromonas hydrophila isolation shows the highest count in the intestine of the control group while the lowest in the liver of the fish fed with 35 % CP diet suggesting that dietary cricket meal enhanced the innate immune system and survivability of <b>African</b> <b>catfish.</b> Antioxidant activity of catalase was higher in 100 % cricket meal substitution with 35 % CP compared with fish fed other diets while glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed an increasing trend with higher incorporation of cricket meal although no significant difference was observed between all diets. These results signify that cricket meal could be a potential alternative for fishmeal as a protein source in <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> diet without having any adverse health effect while at the same time improving growth and feed efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that in <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> Clarias gariepinus feed intake (IF) is stimulated by the {{presence}} of conspecifics resulting in higher IF and growth rate. The feeding duration and the frequency of feeding acts were lower in isolated fish as compared with non-isolated fish, indicating a decreased feeding motivation when fish are held individually. Isolation per se, however, seems not to act as a stressor in the short-term or to affect the stress response, probably because periods of isolation are part of the <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> lifestyl...|$|R
40|$|The {{threshold}} concentration for NH 3 in rearing {{water of}} <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> (Clarias gariepinus) was assessed. <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> {{with an initial}} mean (SD) weight of 141. 0 (24) g were exposed to five different Tamm [sum of NH 3 and NH 4 +] concentrations: 0. 37 (Control), 1. 06, 2. 12, 5. 16 and 19. 7 mM, which concurs with NH 3 concentrations of 4 (Control), 14, 38, 176 and 1084 µM. Plasma concentrations of NH 4 +, cortisol, glucose and lactate, plasma osmolality, gill morphology, branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity, feed intake and specific growth rate were monitored. No effect of water NH 3 on plasma NH 4 + concentrations was detected. Feed intake and specific growth rate were severely affected at exposure to water NH 3 concentrations above 90 µM (calculated EC 10 values: 89 and 122 µM). No major disturbances in physiological blood parameters were observed at these NH 3 concentrations, but gill morphology (a remarkably sensitive stress indicator) deteriorated significantly. Based on the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval for EC 10, we advise for <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> not to exceed a water NH 3 concentration of 24 µM (0. 34 mg NH 3 -N/L). This finding is relevant for design and management of <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> production systems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the addition of a probiotic Bacillus on culture medium through growth rate and histopathological change in <b>African</b> <b>Catfish</b> who was infected by Aeromonas hydrophila. The study consisted of five treatments such as the addition of probiotic Bacillus ND 2, Bacillus P 4 I 2, Bacillus ND 2 + Bacillus P 4 I 2 (Kom), positive control (K+) and negative control (K-) (without probiotic addition). <b>African</b> <b>Catfish</b> (13. 354 ± 2. 8 g) was maintained in 15 aquariums (40 L in volume) with 30 fishes each for 30 days. Probiotic bacteria was applied in water once a day, whereas pathogenic bacteria A. hydrophila  (103 CFU/mL) were added once in earlier treatment (except for the negative control) as assumption that A. hydrophila will shape up quorum sensing in unfortunate condition. The result showed that the highest spesific growth rate in the treatment of Bacillus ND 2 probiotics (1, 708 ± 0. 114 %). Histopathology showed that damaged of liver dan kidney in probiotics treatment were lightner than positive control (K+).   The addition of Bacillus P 4 I 1 (104 CFU/mL) efective to increased the spesific growth rate of <b>African</b> <b>Catfish</b> and prevent the damage of liver and kidney of <b>African</b> <b>Catfish</b> was infected by Aeromoniasis...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{fermentation}} of two Non-Digestible Oligosaccharide (NDO) preparations, Arabinoxylan- Oligosaccharides (AXOS) and Oligofructose (OF), {{and their respective}} monomeric sugars, xylose and fructose, were investigated by hindgut microbiota of two major aquaculture fish species, Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) and <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> (Clarias gariepinus). Inocula from the hindgut of both fish species were incubated for 48 h in bottles containing 1. 0 % of one of four substrates, i. e. AXOS, OF, xylose or fructose. Amounts and profiles of produced Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) differed between the two fish species and substrates. The hindgut microbiota of Siberian sturgeon has a higher fermentation capacity than the microbiota from <b>African</b> <b>catfish.</b> Xylose was much easier fermented than AXOS by microbiota from Siberian sturgeon whereas OF was quicker fermented than fructose with <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> inoculum. The SCFAs were dominated by acetic acid for both fish species and for all substrates. Fermentation of OF and fructose by hindgut microbiota of Siberian sturgeon also yielded high amounts of butyric and branched-chain fatty acids after 48 h incubation. Results {{of this study suggest}} that AXOS, OF, and their monomeric sugars have an impact on microbial fermentation activity of hindgut microbiota from Siberian sturgeon and <b>African</b> <b>catfish</b> in a substrate and species dependent manner...|$|R
