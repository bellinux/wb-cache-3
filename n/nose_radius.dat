Recently obtained experimental data for O and N atom recombination probabilities on candidate material surfaces above 1000 K are used to assess nonequilibrium effects for a range of <b>nose</b> <b>radii</b> and a specific space shuttle re-entry trajectory.

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the onset of boundary-layer {{transition}} is critical for hypersonic flight vehicles. The development of prediction methods depends on a thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that cause transition. In order to improve the understanding of hypersonic boundary-layer transition, tests were conducted on a large 7 ° half-angle cone at Mach 10 in the Arnold Engineering Development Complex Wind Tunnel 9. Twenty-four runs were performed at varying unit Reynolds numbers and angles of attack for sharp and blunt nosetip configurations. ^ Heat-transfer measurements {{were used to determine}} the start of transition on the cone. Increasing the unit Reynolds number caused a forward movement of transition on the sharp cone at zero angle of attack. Increasing nosetip radius delayed transition up to a radius of 12. 7 mm. Larger <b>nose</b> <b>radii</b> caused the start of transition to move forward. At angles of attack up to 10 °, transition was leeside forward for <b>nose</b> <b>radii</b> up to 12. 7 mm and windside forward for <b>nose</b> <b>radii</b> of 25. 4 mm and 50. 8 mm. ^ Second-mode instability waves were measured on the sharp cone and cones with small <b>nose</b> <b>radii.</b> At zero angle of attack, waves at a particular streamwise location on the sharp cone were in earlier stages of development as the unit Reynolds number was decreased. The same trend was observed as the nosetip radius was increased. No second-mode waves were apparent for the cones with large nosetip radii. As the angle of attack was increased, waves at a particular streamwise location on the sharp cone moved to earlier stages of growth on the windward ray and later stages of growth on the leeward ray. ^ RMS amplitudes of second-mode waves were computed. Comparison between maximum second-mode amplitudes and edge Mach numbers showed good correlation for various nosetip radii and unit Reynolds numbers. Using the e N method, initial amplitudes were estimated and compared to freestream noise in the second-mode frequency band. Correlations indicate that freestream noise likely has a significant influence on initial second-mode amplitudes. ...|$|R

This ratio and the individual heating rates are smaller for cylindrically-blunted wedges with small <b>nose</b> <b>radii,</b> relative to the spherically-blunted cones (at the same radius).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify the influence of effusion mass fluxes and various <b>nose</b> <b>radii</b> on the boundary layer instability for a hypersonic ﬂow and predict the transition location. The laminar-turbulent boundary layer transition for hypersonic vehicles is of great importance, because it can signiﬁcantly increase the frictional resistance and the heat transfer coefficients. Effusion cooling uses various mass flows blown out through a porous ceramic for cooling the surface. This type of cooling is also called effusion. The investigations were carried out for Ma = 10 hypersonic flow past a 7 ° half angle blunted. The numerical stability analysis is performed with the DLR Code NOLOT which solves the equations of the linear stability theory. The critical N-factors are assessed by means of previous experiments at the HEG wind tunnel in Göttingen.

50|$|The {{operating}} principle {{is that the}} one follower spans the pair of closely spaced lobes. Up to the angular limit of the <b>nose</b> <b>radius</b> the follower 'sees' the combined surface of the two lobes as a continuous, smooth surface. When the lobes are exactly aligned the duration is at a minimum (and {{equal to that of}} each lobe alone) and when at the extreme extent of their misalignment the duration is at a maximum. The basic limitation of the scheme is that only a duration variation equal to that of the lobe nose true radius (in camshaft degrees or double this value in crankshaft degrees) is possible. In practice this type of variable cam has a maximum range of duration variation of about forty crankshaft degrees.|$|E

50|$|An {{equilibrium}} real-gas model {{assumes that}} a gas is chemically reactive, but also assumes all chemical reactions have {{had time to}} complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature (this is called thermodynamic equilibrium). When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions. Direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer heating. It is caused mainly from isentropic heating of the air molecules within the compression wave. Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heating. The distance from the shock wave to the stagnation point on the entry vehicle's leading edge is called shock wave stand off. An approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the <b>nose</b> <b>radius.</b> One can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8 km/s and a <b>nose</b> <b>radius</b> of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds. This is roughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to approach chemical equilibrium in a shock layer for a 7.8 km/s entry into air during peak heat flux. Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle's stagnation point, the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and not in a state of equilibrium. The , which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium. The time required for the shock layer gas to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer's pressure. For example, {{in the case of the}} Galileo Probe's entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39 km/s during peak heat flux).|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of modelling non-equilibrium real gas effects is radiative heat flux. If a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed (hyperbolic trajectory, lunar return) and has a large <b>nose</b> <b>radius</b> then radiative heat flux can dominate TPS heating. Radiative heat flux during entry into an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from asymmetric diatomic molecules; e.g., cyanogen (CN), carbon monoxide, nitric oxide (NO), single ionized molecular nitrogen etc. These molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating ambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into new molecular species. The newly formed diatomic molecules initially {{have a very high}} vibrational temperature that efficiently transforms the vibrational energy into radiant energy; i.e., radiative heat flux. The whole process takes place in less than a millisecond which makes modelling a challenge. The experimental measurement of radiative heat flux (typically done with shock tubes) along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady Schrödinger equation are among the more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering. Most of the aerospace research work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the 1960s, but largely discontinued after conclusion of the Apollo Program. Radiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure Apollo's success. However, radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide (Mars entry) is still barely understood and will require major research.|$|E

A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (AMaRV).

However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.AMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a [...] "split-windward flap") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's sides. Hydraulic actuation was used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interception. The McDonnell Douglas DC-X (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the Lockheed Martin X-33.|$|E
40|$|Receptivity and {{stability}} of hypersonic boundary layers are numerically investigated for boundary layer flows over a 5 -degree straight cone at a free-stream Mach number of 6. 0. To compute the shock and the interaction of shock with the instability waves, we solve the Navier-Stokes equations in axisymmetric coordinates. The governing equations are solved using the 5 th-order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for space discretization and using third-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. After the mean flow field is computed, disturbances are introduced at the upstream end of the computational domain. Generation of instability waves from leading edge region and receptivity of boundary layer to slow acoustic waves are investigated.

The lower dimensional accuracy at the larger <b>nose</b> <b>radius</b> can be related to the higher radial force and vibration, which enhance because of the larger contact area between the cutting tool and the workpiece surface.|$|E
