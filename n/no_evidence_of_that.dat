25|$|After the shuttle's breakup, {{there were}} some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved, but <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has ever surfaced. Security {{surrounding}} the launch and landing {{of the space shuttle}} had been increased because the crew included the first Israeli astronaut. The Merritt Island launch facility, like all sensitive government areas, had increased security after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{study of}} SOSUS {{data from the}} time of the {{incident}} has given rise to doubts of whether or not flooding preceded the reactor scram, as no sound of the high pressure water impacting the compartments of the submarine could be detected on instrument recordings from SOSUS at the time, which would have been a significant sonic event, and <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> can be found in the recorded data.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{think there}} is any {{evidence}} that there have been any renditions carried out in the country of Syria. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> And I think we have to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E
50|$|Another {{complaint}} was {{the absence of}} the play-within-the-play. Though much is made <b>of</b> <b>that</b> play's immense impact, there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> what <b>that</b> play actually says, proclaims, describes, or portrays that would produce such an effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{murder was}} {{probably}} ordered by Raffaele Cutolo {{and the death}} sentence was passed by Carmela Provenzano, the wife of senior NCO figure Pasquale D'Amico, but there are <b>no</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> The murder <b>of</b> Turatello was done {{without the consent of}} the Sicilian Mafia, and as Turatello was a close friend of Luciano Leggio and Frank Coppola, it was an insult to their honor. As a result, the murder brought severe repercussions on the main hitman, Pasquale Barra, and would lead to his defection from the NCO and becoming a pentito. After Turatello's death, his successor Angelo Epaminonda also became a pentito.|$|R
50|$|Theacrine has {{demonstrated}} clinical safety and non-habituating effects in healthy humans over 8 weeks of daily use {{at up to}} 300 mg/day. Moreover, there was <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> tachyphylaxis <b>that</b> is typical <b>of</b> neuroactive agents such as caffeine and other stimulants.|$|R
6000|$|That {{evening the}} first mate said to Stephen: “The captain {{has been telling}} us about that bag of money you got hold of, Steve, and we all think that your offer to treat {{it as if it}} were prize-money is a very kind one, but we agree with him that it would be a mistake. In the first place, the money wouldn’t go far. In any matter of that sort the ship, that is to say the owners, take a large share to begin with, the {{officers}} take some shares, and the men’s shares would not come to a pound a head. A pound a head would only suffice for them to have a drunken spree on shore, but they are just as well without that, and, as the captain says, it is astonishing what little things upset sailors’ minds. They might take it into their head that as you got two hundred pounds in that hut there might be a lot more, and they would be wanting to land and to turn the village upside down, and there would be bloodshed and all sorts of trouble. The old saying, ‘Least said, soonest mended’, comes in here strongly. We have, so far, got on very well with the natives this voyage, and I hope that we shall continue to do so to the end. I quite allow that we should all of us be glad to give a sharp lesson to that village ashore. They have been plundering, and I have no doubt murdering, the crew of some ship. Still, we have <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> and we can’t attack the village on mere supposition. They have been friendly enough with us, partly because we have been here before, and the captain gets on well with them, but more because they are perfectly well aware that we are always on guard, and that there is no chance whatever of their catching us asleep. In nine cases out of ten it is the carelessness and over-confidence of sailors that tempt the natives to take advantage of it; they would never have shown you these things if they had had any idea of attacking us.” ...|$|E
50|$|Merah {{said he was}} a mujaheed {{and claimed}} ties to al-Qaeda, but French {{authorities}} found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> and denied his claim.|$|E
50|$|Harkins married Salina Gardner and Lily Folsom, Daughter of Chief David Folsom and Rhoda Nail. It is {{said that}} he also married Laris Narcissy Leflore and had two children, but <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has been found.|$|E
50|$|Members of the Pakkoku clan of Burma tattoo {{themselves}} with ink mixed with cobra venom on their upper {{body in a}} weekly inoculation which may {{protect them from the}} snake, though there is <b>no</b> scientific <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
50|$|Burrow Hall {{was built}} over {{the site of the}} Roman Fort or Forts of GALACUM (also called CALACUM), the {{earliest}} of which are of the Flavian period. The principal remains are thought to be under the Main Hall, although archaeological work during the renovations in 2014 uncovered <b>no</b> significant <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{chief of}} the Organisation of American States {{observer}} team, Enrique Correa <b>of</b> Chile, said <b>that</b> there were was <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> fraud and <b>that</b> the voting appeared to go smoothly.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Germany {{occupied}} Denmark, but {{the stamp}} program gives <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> A new series depicted Christian X full-face {{instead of in}} profile, and continued in use after the war. However mail was subject to German postal censorship.|$|E
5000|$|Hobsbawm {{alleged that}} Rudé's thesis advisor, (Alfred Cobban, a {{political}} conservative), blocked any chances Rudé {{may have had}} at getting an appointment at a University, but Friguglietti says there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> [...] Feeling shunned in Britain, Rudé began looking to opportunities abroad.|$|E
50|$|After Coleman {{left the}} bar, some {{cocktail}} historians have said {{she worked in}} the hotel's flower shop. However, in 2016, Susan Scott, the archivist at the Savoy said she found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> In Coleman's later life she took a part-time job managing the staff in the ladies' cloakroom at The Berkeley hotel.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory work is {{examining}} sea buckthorn oil for its potential properties, {{although there is}} <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> as <b>of</b> 2017 <b>that</b> it has any effect on human health.|$|R
50|$|Krásný Buk was {{probably}} {{founded in the}} second half of the 13th century. From 1263 its owners could have been the Markwartitz family, but there is <b>no</b> definite <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> At the start of the 14th century the castle belonged to Henry of Leipa, who sold it on in 1319 to the Bohemian king, John of Luxembourg.|$|R
5000|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> Berlinski {{composed in}} Leipzig {{except in a}} comment made by Ann Williams Frohbieter in her doctoral thesis at Rice University where she said:"Berlinski was in danger not only {{because he was a}} Jew, but also because, in his early college days, he had composed music for a political cabaret...writing music of a satirical nature." ...|$|R

50|$|The Aragonese {{family name}} Lascorz may be {{connected}} to counts of Ribargorza who were Lords of Lascorz in the 12th century. However, Eugenio Lascorz decided that Lascorz was a bastardized form of Lascaris, a family that provided the Byzantine emperors in exile (the so-called Nicaean Empire) in 1204-61, and began to claim that he was descended from them. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind of connection.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} market {{structure}} {{for real estate}} brokerage services across six large metropolitan areas, by collecting more than 300, 000 real estate listings and computing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for each neighborhood. When we divide neighborhoods based on income, house value, and race, we find <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> redlining; <b>that</b> is, the market structure for brokerage services {{is at least as}} competitive in less advantaged neighborhoods as it is in more advantaged ones. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1946, {{following}} {{the end of}} World War II, Du Pont requested an investigation by GHQ (the General Headquarters of Allied Powers) of Toray's infringement of Du Pont's nylon patents but GHQ found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> infringement, certifying <b>that</b> Toray's nylon technology was its own.|$|R
40|$|A {{flock of}} 4287 heavy hybrid turkey hens were accidentally fed broiler premix {{containing}} salinomycin sodium and suffered a 34. 5 % death loss. Measures taken to ensure food safety {{for the remaining}} flock and consumer food safety included feed record studies, on-farm veterinary consultation, diagnostic laboratory studies, and CgFARAD and CFIA consultation. The remaining turkeys were processed 3 weeks after the initial toxicosis with <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> lesions <b>that</b> would render the product unfit for human consumption...|$|R
50|$|The name of {{the village}} hints at a Roman camp, though <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has been found, but the major Roman Ribchester to Carlisle road runs {{to the east of}} the village and a {{cross-stone}} was ploughed up and reerected in the 19th century. A stone circle can be seen to the east, on top of a ridge on the flanks of Brownthwaite Pike.|$|E
5000|$|His {{wife was}} Helena Magnusdotter, {{daughter}} of Birgitta Knutsdotter of the Algotssöner family and Magnus Gislason, PC, Lord of Aspnäs, who also bore spar as his Coat of Arms, {{and is therefore}} also dubbed as [...] "Sparre" [...] (Sparre of Aspnäs) in genealogies. Magnus Gislason's line and Gustav/Arvid line {{may well have been}} of the same origin, but there exists <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hiking as an {{activity}} started in its true sense circa 1930, {{the year in}} which a group of friends climbed the Gjeravica mountain in Peć. This {{was the first time that}} a peak in Kosovo was climbed (there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that).</b> Even though people started to show interest shortly after, many mountains were near border areas and people needed special permission to visit them due to the political issue at the time.|$|E
50|$|Dentdale {{was first}} {{settled in the}} 10th century when Norse invaders first entered the dale. The dale was also known to the Romans {{although}} there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> settlement during <b>that</b> period. The dale {{was one of the}} last of the Yorkshire Dales to be Enclosed in 1859.|$|R
5|$|Once {{again in}} Buenos Aires, San Martín {{and his wife}} {{attended}} to the first official performance of the Argentine National Anthem, on 28 May 1813 at the Coliseo Theater. Oral tradition {{has it that the}} premiere took place on 14 May 1813 at the home of aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, with San Martín also attending, but there is <b>no</b> documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> The lyrics <b>of</b> the new anthem included several references to the secessionist will of the time.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} {{windmills}} located within Little Thurlow however the only remains {{lay in the}} form of the names of the houses; 'Mill house' and 'Mill View'.

50|$|A later {{study using}} more data {{than in the}} Olivieri study found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> {{long-term}} therapy with deferiprone caused progression of hepatic fibrosis. Cumulative worldwide experience has confirmed Koren's position on deferiprone, indicating that deferiprone is safe and effective for some patients. As {{a direct result of}} Olivieri’s public media campaign, approval for the medication was stalled, meaning that North American children continued to be denied a medication which had since been approved around the world in dozens of countries and could be the only hope for survival for some children.|$|E
5000|$|In {{discussing}} Cygnus X1 {{with the}} press in the early 1970s, Kristian had described himself as an [...] "ultra-conservative" [...] {{on the question of}} black holes. [...] However, with the publications of his team's findings together with those of another team at Caltech in 1978, Kristian publicly affirmed that black holes were the most plausible explanation: [...] "If there wasn't much mass there, then we would be seeing some evidence of the structure coming apart. But there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> So something has to be there, holding it all together." ...|$|E
40|$|Research into immune {{defense has}} been {{considerably}} enriched by the increasing focus on innate immunity. This type of immunity {{is still considered}} to lack specific memory, largely because there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> mechanisms <b>that</b> could provide such memory (such as acquired immunity). However, recent experimental data demonstrate specific memory phenomena in invertebrates: these organisms are thought to rely solely on innate defense. Here, I argue that a clear definition of the terms 'specificity' and 'memory', together with dissection of the evolutionary roots of immune defense, show us that innate immunity should not be, and is probably not, necessarily free of specific memory...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Kennedy {{on appeal}} {{reversed}} more than 50% {{of the cases}} for repayments from MPs that Sir Thomas Legg had demanded. He found that in most cases there was <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing, and <b>that</b> it was unfair to call MPs who had not broken the existing rules things such as [...] "tainted" [...] or having [...] "breached the requirements of propriety".|$|R
50|$|On 23 March, {{coalition}} jets launched air-strikes against Gaddafi {{forces at}} the eastern gate. People fleeing the city stated that only {{the center of the}} city remained in rebel hands while the suburbs were under government control.
