2500|$|Like most Muscat varieties, Muscat of Alexandria {{is notable}} {{for being a}} {{desirable}} raisin and table grape. This {{is due in part}} to the grape's high tolerance of heat and drought conditions.

This is partly because Muscat of Alexandria is very vigorous and prone to produce high yields that can be easily overcropped as well as a more assertive aroma profile due to a higher concentration of the monoterpene geraniol, which produces a geranium scent, and lower concentration of <b>nerol</b> which a more fresh, sweet rose aroma.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the origin}} and type of {{manufacturing}} method of rosewater obtained from the sepals and petals of Rosa × damascena from Central Iran through steam distillation, the following monoterpenoid and alkane components could be identified with GC-MS: mostly citronellol, nonadecane, geraniol and phenyl ethyl alcohol, and also henicosane, 9-nonadecen, eicosane, linalool, citronellyl acetate, methyleugenol, heptadecane, pentadecane, docosane, <b>nerol,</b> disiloxane, octadecane, and pentacosane.Usually, phenylethyl alcohol {{is responsible for the}} typical odour of rose water but not always present in rosewater products.|$|E
50|$|Isoprenoid monoterpens {{are present}} in grape, above all acyclic linalool, geraniol, <b>nerol,</b> citronellol, homotrienol and {{monocyclic}} α-terpineol, mostly occurring as glycosides. Carotenoids accumulate in ripening grape berries. Oxidation of carotenoids produces volatile fragments, C13-norisoprenoids. These are strongly odoriferous compounds, such as β-ionone (aroma of viola), damascenone (aroma of exotic fruits), β-damascone (aroma of rose) and β-ionol (aroma of flowers and fruits). Tetrahydro-β-carbolines are indole alkaloids occurring in grape to a low amount and contributing to its antioxidant power. Melatonin, an alkaloid, has been identified in grape.|$|E
50|$|Myrcene is an {{important}} intermediate used in the perfumery industry. It has a pleasant odor, but is rarely used directly. It is also unstable in air, tending to polymerize.

It is thus more highly valued as an intermediate for the preparation of flavor and fragrance chemicals such as menthol, citral, citronellol, citronellal, geraniol, <b>nerol,</b> and linalool. Myrcene is converted to myrcenol, another fragrance found in lavender, via uncatalyzed hydroamination of the 1,3-diene followed by hydrolysis and Pd-catalyzed removal of the amine.|$|E

In addition to the original track, Tito re-recorded the song with Jenni Rivera, La India, and Yolandita Monge separately. For his recording with La India, the song was recorded in salsa. Tito's duets with India and Rivera were included on the special edition of the album, El Patrón: La Victoría.|$|E

Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance binding studies described here suggest that the monoterpenoids, <b>nerol</b> and geraniol, are substrates of avocado cytochrome P- 450 (spectral dissociation constant of 7. 2 and 35 micromolar, respectively).

40|$|Spores of Penicillium digitatum ATCC 201167 {{transform}} geraniol, <b>nerol,</b> citral, and {{geranic acid}} into methylheptenone. Spore extracts of P. digitatum convert geraniol and <b>nerol</b> NAD+-dependently into citral. Spore extract also converts citral NAD+-dependently into geranic acid. Furthermore, a novel enzymatic activity, citral lyase, which cofactor-independently converts citral into methylheptenone and acetaldehyde, was detected. These result show that spores of P. digitatum convert geraniol via a novel biotransformation pathway. This {{is the first}} time a biotransformation pathway in fungal spores has been substantiated by biochemical studies.
