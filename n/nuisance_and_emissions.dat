40|$|In {{this article}} we assess the {{contributions}} of the authors in this special issue. A conceptual model is used to identify the relevant components for the impact of land use on travel behavior and the relationships that should be addressed in empirical research on the effects of land use on travel behavior. The following conclusions are drawn. Firstly, very limited {{attention has been paid to}} the policy reasons behind why land-use policies could be used to influence travel behavior. These reasons include effects on the environment, such as noise <b>nuisance</b> <b>and</b> <b>emissions,</b> and safety and accessibility. Secondly, the indicators used for travel behavior are trip frequencies and travel distances by mode. Hardly any attention has been paid to other travel behavior indicators, such as route choice and time of day, which migh also have an impact on effects such as noise nuisance, concentrations of pollutants and safety. Thirdly, with respect to land use little attention has been paid to the decomposition of the total effects of land use on travel behavior into direct and indirect effects. Indirect effects of land use include effects via self-selection processes of individuals and households. Fourthly, the behavioral mechanisms and related theories for travel behavior have received almost no attention in the literature reviewed by the authors of the contributions. Fifthly, the use of more advanced techniques such as Structural Equations Models and Multi-level Regression may contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of land use on travel behavior. Sixthly, all the authors of the contributions conclude that land use has an impact on travel behavior, though only a modest one. Finally, several policy recommendations have been made, related to land-use policies that might have an impact on travel behavior. These recommendations mainly focus on mixed use and high-density designs, transit-oriented developments and transit, bike and pedestrian-oriented designs. A broader evaluation of all relevant effects of land-use alternatives is required for policy conclusions, however, including effects on costs, accessibility impacts, and consumer preferences with regard to residential, job and other locations...|$|E
40|$|In Europe {{and around}} the world, field studies {{conducted}} in areas surrounding the odour source are used for evaluating the odour <b>nuisance</b> <b>and</b> for <b>emission</b> studies. In Europe, the Standards of the Association of German Engineers (VDI) - VDI 3940 series - for grid and odour-plume measurements are used. Carrying out this type of research allows {{for the assessment of}} olfactory air quality in a ‘quantitative’ analysis by characterizing a particular odour in terms of its impact and its frequency. In addition, in order to analyse and visualize the distribution of odours occurring in a certain area, by using the results of field studies, the Geographical Information System (GIS) tools may be applied. The research methodology, including the results of field measurements and geostatistical analysis in the assessment of odour nuisance, could be very important tools for the determination and spatial interpolation of odour intensity distributions and studying the range of odorous plumes. This paper presents the results of field measurements and geostatistical analysis conducted for selected municipal, industrial and agricultural sectors objects...|$|R
40|$|At South East Water {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WwTPs) in Victoria, Australia, biosolids are stockpiled for three years {{in compliance with the}} State guidelines to achieve the highest pathogen reduction grade (T 1), suitable for unrestricted use in agriculture and landscaping. However, extended stockpiling is costly, may increase odour <b>nuisance</b> <b>and</b> greenhouse gas <b>emissions,</b> <b>and</b> reduces the fertiliser value of the biosolids. A verification programme of sampling and analysis for enteric pathogens was conducted at two WwTPs where sludge is treated by aerobic and anaerobic digestion, air drying (in drying pans or solar drying sheds) and stockpiling, to enumerate and, if present, monitor the decay of a range of enteric pathogens and parasites. The sludge treatment processes at both WwTPs achieved T 1 grade biosolids with respect to prescribed pathogenic bacterial numbers (3 log 10 enteric virus reduction after a storage period of one year. No Ascaris eggs were detected in the influent to the WwTPs, confirming previous studies that the presence of helminth infections in Victoria is extremely low and that Ascaris is not applicable as a control criterion for the microbiological quality of biosolids in the region...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{has been}} focussed, both in man and {{experimental}} animals, {{on the effects}} of inhalation of the gas monomer, vinyl chloride. Recently, note is being taken of the possible effects of the inhalation of the polymer in man. The particles in question are those produced commercially as paste polymer or dispersion polymer or having an average diameter of 0. 15 micrometers, and accounting for more than 10 % of the production in Britain. There are now strict regulations for the control of the monomer gas, but the particles are regarded as <b>nuisance</b> dust <b>and</b> their <b>emission</b> is not covered by specific legislation. Our studies on rats, where both inhalation and implantation methods of exposure have been used, and examination of tissue from human cases exposed to paste polymers, indicate that these small particles can only be regarded as evidence of exposure, and on present evidence there is no indication of causation of significant pulmonary disease. Techniques have been developed by which these particles can be demonstrated in ordinary histological preparations and by transmission electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the barrier properties against water vapor and oxygen, inorganic-organic polymers can also function as protection layers against unwanted migration of chemical substances in two ways. First, hybrid polymers prevent components from migrating out of polymer substrates. This is of special interest for polymeric materials containing substances like plasticizing agents, unreacted monomers or catalysts. Thus the olfactory <b>nuisance</b> <b>and</b> the toxicological <b>emission</b> are decreased. The plastics are also prevented from becoming prematurely brittle. Second, the coated materials are also protected against the interaction of dyes or dirt staining the material. These functions {{can be achieved by}} thermally or UV curable coating materials, synthesized by the sol-gel technique. Since several polymer materials show only a low heat resistance (e. g. PVC, polyolefines), this publication is focussed on the development of new migration barriers based on photochemically curable sols. Another advantage of the UV process in comparison to thermal treatments are the short curing times and low power consumption which make this process even more attractive for industrial applications. The coatings were characterized by IR and solid state NMR spectroscopy. The migration barrier properties were tested according to industrial standards. Due to the choice of specific functional groups, these hybrid polymers can be further modified in order to combine the migration barrier function with additional properties: scratch and abrasion resistance, hydrophobicity, antistatic effects. Examples of feasible combinations of properties are also given...|$|R

40|$|Original title: Overlast en verloedering ontsleuteld. At {{the start}} of 2008 the Dutch {{government}} presented its 'Public <b>Nuisance</b> <b>and</b> Urban Decay Action Plan' (Actieplan overlast en verloedering). Its objective: to reduce public <b>nuisance</b> <b>and</b> physical decay by a quarter in 2010 compared with 2002. The measures {{set out in the}} Action Plan target <b>nuisance</b> (<b>and</b> crime) perpetrated by young people, nightlife nuisance, nuisance in the residential setting and physical decay in the residential environment. The raft of measures is wide-ranging, varying from mediation in conflicts between neighbours, the deployment of special investigation officers, changes in the licensing laws, to professionalisation of youth welfare services and the creation of special 'campuses' for at-risk young people who are out of work and have no training. Why does the government use these measures specifically, and to what extent is this a well-founded choice? Following on from the publication of the report Social safety unlocked (Sociale veiligheid ontsleuteld), SCP subjected the Public <b>Nuisance</b> <b>and</b> Urban Decay Action Plan to scrutiny. Assumptions made in the Action Plan were reconstructed and confronted with empirical findings on the effectiveness of different measures in reducing <b>nuisance</b> <b>and</b> decay. This approach will enable better substantiated policy choices {{to be made in the}} future...|$|R
