500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is <b>no</b> <b>laughing</b> <b>matter,</b> whatever you may think of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|E
500|$|The rest of {{the family}} tries to pass the time by playing charades and various other games. They are unable to keep {{themselves}} entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual. But, having dealt with their abuse for years, Meg finally turns on them, starting with Chris for mistreating her with hurtful comments. Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss what just happened. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a [...] "lightning rod" [...] to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize to her family and lies that she was taking her own problems out on everyone, restoring their egos and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: [...] "Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use, but the simple fact is, it's <b>no</b> <b>laughing</b> <b>matter.</b> To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs." ...|$|E

When he saw them coming, he realized that what he had thought was a joke had become <b>no</b> longer a <b>laughing</b> <b>matter</b> for him. He was too frightened to run, so he scrambled up a tree. He quite forgot that Mr. Panther and Mr. Lynx could climb just as fast as he. Up the tree after him they scrambled, and he crept as far out as he could get {{on one of the}} branches. Mr. Panther didn't dare go out there, so he just shook the branch. He shook and shook and shook and shook, and the first thing old Mr. Possum knew, he was flying through the air down to where the others were all ready to pounce on him.|$|R

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to {{research on the}} complex relation between dying in a digital game and player experience. In this article, we extend recent findings (Ravaja, Turpeinen, Saari, Kelti-kangas-Järvinen, 2 ̆ 6 amp; Puttonen, 2008) indicating that player death may induce positive affect. The study explored whether smiling upon dying in a game should be attributed to transient relief experiences or, instead, related to being challenged to try harder. Facial expressions were recorded while players experienced frequent deaths and occasionally reached safe zones in a shooter game. Players, indeed, smiled after dying, as testified by deactivation of the corrugator supercilii and activation of the zygomaticus major. Although retrospective subjective evaluations showed player-death events were appraised negatively, importantly, zygomaticus major activation decreased with repeated player-deaths. Moreover, safe zones {{did not result in}} patterns of facial electromyography activity indicating pleasure, countering a transient relief explanation. We propose that, as part of the ongoing game, player death reinforces the sense of challenge that the game offers. While dying may not be fun in itself, being challenged may initially be experienced as enjoyable and, therefore, evoke a smile. Without clear progress in the game and a lost sense of challenge, however, dying is <b>no</b> longer a <b>laughing</b> <b>matter...</b>|$|R
