25|$|Resistive {{opto-isolator}} (RO), {{also called}} photoresistive opto-isolator, vactrol (after a genericized trademark introduced by Vactec, Inc. in the 1960s), analog opto-isolator or lamp-coupled photocell, is an optoelectronic device {{consisting of a}} source and detector of light, which are optically coupled and electrically isolated from each other. The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a miniature incandescent lamp, or sometimes a <b>neon</b> <b>lamp,</b> whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of cadmium selenide (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS). The source and detector are coupled through a transparent glue or through the air.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neon</b> <b>lamps</b> {{or light}} {{emitting}} diodes are commonly used for low-intensity strobe applications, <b>Neon</b> <b>lamps</b> were more common before the development of solid-state electronics, but are being replaced by LEDs in most low-intensity strobe applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{breakdown}} {{feature of}} <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> {{allows them to}} be used as very simple voltage regulators or overvoltage protection devices. In the 1960s General Electric (GE), Signalite, and other firms made special extra-stable <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> for electronic uses.|$|R
50|$|Cold-cathode lamps include cold-cathode {{fluorescent}} <b>lamps</b> (CCFLs) and <b>neon</b> <b>lamps.</b> <b>Neon</b> <b>lamps</b> primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light; CCFLs use a discharge in mercury vapor {{to develop}} ultraviolet light, {{which in turn}} causes a fluorescent coating {{on the inside of}} the lamp to emit visible light.|$|R
25|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), and is a variant of the <b>neon</b> <b>lamp.</b> Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|E
2500|$|An {{inductor}} is {{very common}} in line-frequency ballasts to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a fluorescent lamp, <b>neon</b> <b>lamp,</b> or high intensity discharge (HID) lamp.

2500|$|Around 1917, Daniel McFarlan Moore, {{then working}} at the General Electric Company, {{developed}} the miniature <b>neon</b> <b>lamp.</b> The glow lamp has a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for signage; the difference was sufficient that a separate US patent was issued for the lamp in 1919. A Smithsonian Institution website notes, [...] "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called [...] "coronal discharge." [...] Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as electronic components, and as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) starting in the 1970s." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{small size}} of the {{negative}} glow region of a <b>neon</b> <b>lamp,</b> and the flexible electronic properties that were exploited in electronic circuits, led {{to the adoption of}} this technology for the earliest plasma panel displays. The first monochrome dot matrix plasma panel displays were developed in 1964 at the University of Illinois for the PLATO educational computing system. They had the characteristic color of the neon lamp; their inventors, Donald L. Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and Robert H. Wilson, had achieved a working computer display that remembered its own state, and did not require constant refreshing from the central computer system. The relationship between these early monochrome displays and contemporary, color plasma displays and televisions was described by Larry F. Weber in 2006, [...] "All plasma TVs on the market today have the same features that were demonstrated in the first plasma display which was a device with only a single cell. These features include alternating sustain voltage, dielectric layer, wall charge, and a neon-based gas mixture." [...] As in colored neon lamps, plasma displays use a gas mixture that emits ultraviolet light. Each pixel has a phosphor that emits one of the display's base colors.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1920s, when {{amplification}} made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird {{employed the}} Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype {{in a little}} village called Santa Cruz {{on the island of}} Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named [...] "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.|$|E

25|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{miniature}} <b>neon</b> glow <b>lamp,</b> developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting. While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small indicator lights. Through the 1970s, <b>neon</b> glow <b>lamps</b> were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the <b>neon</b> glow <b>lamp</b> developed into contemporary plasma displays and televisions.|$|R

50|$|Secondary emission: An electron, atom or {{molecule}} {{colliding with}} {{the surface of}} the cathode with enough energy can knock electrons out of the surface.

50|$|Once the <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> {{has reached}} breakdown, it can support a large current flow. Because of this characteristic, {{electrical}} circuitry {{external to the}} <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> must limit the current through the circuit or else the current will rapidly increase until the lamp is destroyed. For indicator-sized lamps, a resistor typically limits the current. In contrast, larger sized lamps often use a specially constructed high voltage transformer with high leakage inductance or other electrical ballast to limit the available current (see neon sign).|$|E
