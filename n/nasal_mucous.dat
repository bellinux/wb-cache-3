50|$|Rhinorrhea can be {{a symptom}} of other diseases, such as the common cold or influenza. During these infections, the <b>nasal</b> <b>mucous</b> {{membranes}} produce excess mucus, filling the nasal cavities. This is to prevent infection from spreading to the lungs and respiratory tract, where it could cause far worse damage. It has also been suggested that rhinorrhea {{is a result of}} viral evolution, and may be a response that is not useful to the host, but which has evolved by the virus to maximise its own infectivity. Rhinorrhea caused by these infections usually occur on circadian rhythms. Over the course of a viral infection, sinusitis (the inflammation of the nasal tissue) may occur, causing the mucous membranes to release more mucus. Acute sinusitis consists of the nasal passages swelling during a viral infection. Chronic sinusitis occurs when one or more nasal polyps appear. This can be caused by a deviated septum as well as a viral infection.|$|E
50|$|Usually air is {{breathed in}} and out through the nose. The nasal {{cavities}} (between the nostrils and the pharynx) are quite narrow, firstly by being divided in two by the nasal septum, and secondly by lateral walls that have several longitudinal folds, or shelves, callednasal conchae, thus exposing a large area of <b>nasal</b> <b>mucous</b> membrane to the air as it is inhaled (and exhaled). This causes the inhaled air to take up moisture from the wet mucus, and warmth from the underlying blood vessels, so that the air is very nearly saturated with water vapor and is at almost body temperature {{by the time it}} reaches the larynx. Part of this moisture and heat is recaptured as the exhaled air moves out over the partially dried-out, hygroscopic, cooled mucus in the nasal passages, during breathing out. The sticky mucus also traps much of the particulate matter that is breathed in, preventing it from reaching the lungs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nasal</b> <b>mucous</b> {{membrane}} {{lines the}} nasal cavities, and is intimately {{adherent to the}} periosteum or perichondrium of the nasal conchae. It is continuous with the skin through the nares, and with the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx through the choanae. From the nasal cavity its continuity with the conjunctiva may be traced, through the nasolacrimal and lacrimal ducts; and with the frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses, through the several openings in the meatuses. The mucous membrane is thickest, and most vascular, over the nasal conchae. It is also thick over the septum; {{but it is very}} thin in the meatuses {{on the floor of the}} nasal cavities, and in the various sinuses. It is one of the most commonly infected tissues in adults and children. Inflammation of this tissue may cause significant impairment of daily activities, with symptoms such as stuffy nose, headache, mouth breathing, etc.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the regeneration process of the nasal mucosa after a surgically created mucosal defect in the rabbit nasal septum, and to evaluate the effects of different interventions. Methods: A 7  mm-diameter circular mucosal defect was made in the septum of forty New Zealand white rabbits. The rabbits were divided into four groups (ten rabbits in each group) according to the type of intervention; no treatment (control), silastic sheet (SS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and silastic sheet and hyaluronic acid (SS + HA) group. The diameter of the defect, mucosal thickness, epithelial thickness, and ciliated cell count were evaluated every week for five weeks. Results: The average diameter of the defect in the control group were 5. 1, 3. 65, 1. 2, 0. 75, and 0. 05  mm at postoperative 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks. In the SS group, the diameter decreased to 4. 35, 2. 1, 0. 35, 0. 15, and 0  mm at postoperative 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, respectively, in which the mean diameter of the postoperative week 2 was significantly smaller compared to control (3. 65  mm vs. 2. 1  mm, P =  0. 039). For the HA group and SS + HA group, the diameter of the defect did not show a significant difference from the control group during the five weeks. The mucosal thickness, epithelial thickness, and ciliated cell count of the regenerated mucosa were not significantly different among the groups.

We feel that this term should be restricted to the association of chronic sinusitis with bronchiectasis or adult pulmonary mucoviscidosis.

In the outbreak described here, the affected population was approximately eight million hens, with flock sizes ranging from 100, 000 to 2, 900, 000 chickens. The average mortality ranged from 1 to 6 %, and morbidity was around 90 % (most of the twenty seven farms {{of the area}} were positive for ILT virus). Three multi-age laying farms from one company were selected for this report. Clinical signs included prostration, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, occasional swelling of the paranasal sinuses and bloody <b>mucous</b> <b>nasal</b> discharge. Severely affected chickens presented with dyspnea, gasping and became cyanotic before death. At necropsy, these chickens had fibrinous exudate blocking the larynx and the lumen of cranial part of the trachea. In addition, conjunctivitis with intense hyperemia, edema and sinuses with caseous exudate were present. On histopathology, there were marked necrosis and desquamation of respiratory ephitelium and conjunctiva with numerous syncytial cells formation and fibrinous exudate. Moderate to marked non suppurative (especially lymphocytes and plasma cells) infiltration in the lamina propria also was observed. Sixteen out of 20 examined chickens, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in the syncytial cells.
