5000|$|Originally {{built to}} {{accommodate}} the adventurous traveler of the 1930s and 1940s, motels were marketed as driver-friendly—motorists could drive right up to their rooms. Ironically, what was originally a selling point {{is now one of}} the most detrimental aspects of motels, from a crime prevention standpoint. Direct access to rooms allows problem guests and visitors to come and go without being seen by motel personnel. Regardless of size, motels with unimpeded pedestrian and vehicle access to rooms can be difficult to manage, and may have a relatively high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>calls</b> if they serve a risky clientele.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other {{lifeboat}} stations, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>calls</b> has increased significantly since the 1960s {{due to the}} rise in leisure craft and swimmers. A-504, the first large ILB, rescued 65 people in 172 services during its 13 years at Weston-super-Mare; the other ILBs have now made well over than 1,000 service launches. Weston-super-Mare is the busiest RNLI station {{on the south side}} of the Bristol Channel. In 2010 it was called into action on 47 occasions, rescuing 27 people and also a dog which had fallen down a cliff; in 2011 there were 42 launches totalling 133 hours at sea and resulting in the rescue of 19 people.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a tree-rewriting framework for modeling documents evolving through service calls. We {{focus on the}} automatic verification of properties of documents that may contain data from an infinite domain. We establish the boundaries of decidability: while verifying documents with recursive calls is undecidable, we obtain decidability as soon as either documents are in the positive-bounded fragment (while calls are unrestricted), or {{when there is a}} bound on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>calls</b> (bounded model-checking of unrestricted documents). In the latter case, the complexity is NexpTime-complete. Our data tree-rewriting framework resembles Guarded Active XML, a platform handling XML repositories that evolve through web services. The model here captures the basic features of Guarded Active XML and extends it by node renaming and subtree deletion. Digital Object Identifier 10. 4230 /LIPIcs. FSTTCS. 2010. 469...|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} the number of services and applications in the telecommunication networks a new service architecture has been proposed and specified. The consortia that initiated the new service architecture is called Parlay. Since then, there has been a continued development and 3 GPP the standardization group for 3 G networks, is now cooperating with Parlay. 3 GPP and Parlay are together specifying the Parlay/OSA standard. However, the aim with the new service architecture is to make the art of service development so easy that any software developer should be a potential application developer for telecommunication networks. It is foreseen to be a dramatic increase of new services, but {{it has been shown that}} it is still complex to create new applications. Parlay X is a standard which is an extension of Parlay/OSA, initiated to allow access to the telecommunication network capabilities via web services. The Parlay X architectures include an Application Server (AS), which translates the web service calls to Parlay/OSA commands. A typical AS is a distributed environment sensitive to overload. In this paper we propose and investigate an overload control mechanisms for an AS. The methods have been implemented in a real AS to evaluate the performance. Parlay X is a contract driven architecture, where different service providers have different constraints about minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>calls</b> served per second and maximal delays of different services.

40|$|A major copier machine {{company in}} Hong Kong {{presently}} faces the problem <b>of</b> providing effective <b>servicing</b> and repairing support to its four service regions. Due to {{the shortage of}} skilled technicians and the variety of jobs to be handled by technicians of differing skill levels, its Service Department appears to be understaffed, experiencing substantial daily backlogs. This study concentrates on a new perspective of operation: the assignment of technicians at each skill level to specialize in a single type of job {{in one of the}} four regions. The objective is to maximize the overall daily <b>number</b> <b>of</b> completed <b>service</b> <b>calls.</b> A mathematical model is developed to handle this specialized allocation problem, where the average travel time (forming part of the coefficient of one of the model's variables) <b>of</b> a technician <b>servicing</b> a type <b>of</b> job in a region is dependent on the decision variables - the composition of the whole team.

Once an item in the field fails, it is returned to one of the bases and replaced by a ready-for-use item from the spare parts stock, if available. The returned failed item is either repaired at the base or shipped to and repaired at the central facility. In the case of local repair, the item is added to the local base stock as a ready-for-use item after repair. If a repair at the central facility is needed, the base orders an item from the central spare parts stock to replenish its local stock, while the failed item is added to the central stock after repair. Orders are satisfied on a first-come-first-serve basis while any requirement that cannot be satisfied immediately either at the bases or at the central facility is backlogged. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the wide}} {{adoption}} of handheld devices (e. g. smartphones, tablets) a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> location-based <b>services</b> (also <b>called</b> LBSs) have flourished providing mobile users with real-time and contextual {{information on the}} move.

A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> solutions have been proposed {{in the past few years}} to protect users location information while still allowing them to enjoy geo-located services. Among the most robust solutions are those that apply the popular notion of differential privacy to location privacy (e. g.

While these theoretical guarantees are attracting, it might be difficult for end users or practitioners to assess their effectiveness in the wild. In this paper, we carry on a practical study using real mobility traces coming from two different datasets, to assess the ability of Geo-Indistinguishability to protect users' points of interest (POIs). We show that a curious LBS collecting obfuscated location information sent by mobile users is still able to infer most of the users POIs with a reasonable both geographic and semantic precision. This precision depends on the degree of obfuscation applied by Geo-Indistinguishability. Nevertheless, the latter also has an impact on the overhead incurred on mobile devices resulting in a privacy versus overhead trade-off. Finally, we show in our study that POIs constitute a quasi-identifier for mobile users and that obfuscating them using Geo-Indistinguishability is not sufficient as an attacker is able to re-identify at least 63 % of them despite a high degree of obfuscation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} closed loop two-echelon epairable item systems with repair facilities both at a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> local <b>service</b> centers (<b>called</b> bases) {{and at a}} central location (the depot). The goal {{of the system is}} to maintain a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> production facilities (one at each base) in optimal operational condition. Each production facility consists <b>of</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> identical machines which may fail incidentally. Each repair facility may be considered to be a multi-server station, while any transport from the depot to the bases is modeled as an ample server. At all bases {{as well as at the}} depot, ready-for-use spare parts (machines) are kept in stock. Once a machine in the production cell of a certain base fails, it is replaced by a ready-for-use machine from that base’s stock, if available. The failed machine is either repaired at the base or repaired at the central repair facility. In the case of local repair, the machine is added to the local spare parts stock as a ready-for-use machine after repair. If a repair at the depot is needed, the base orders a machine from the central spare parts stock to replenish its local stock, while the failed machine is added to the central stock after repair. Orders are satisfied on a first-come-firstserved basis while any requirement that cannot be satisfied immediately either at the bases or at the depot is backlogged. In case of a backlog at a certain base, that base’s production cell performs worse. To determine the steady state probabilities of the system, we develop a slightly aggregated system model and propose a special near-product-form solution that provides excellent approximations of relevant performance measures. The depot repair shop is modeled as a server with state-dependent <b>service</b> rates, <b>of</b> which the parameters follow from an application of Norton’s theorem for Closed Queuing Networks. A special adaptation to a general Multi-Class Marginal Distribution Analysis (MDA) algorithm is proposed, on which the approximations are based. All relevant performance measures can be calculated with errors which are generally less than one percent, when compared to simulation results. The approximations are used to find the stock levels which maximize the availibity given a fixed configuration of machines and servers and a certain budget for storing items...|$|R
