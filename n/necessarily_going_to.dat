40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at four {{important}} aspects of Vandevelde’s criticisms of Gadamer. First is his position on Gadamer’s claim that his hermeneutics is a “philosophical hermeneutics” and not a methodology. Second is Vandevelde’s view of interpretation as <b>necessarily</b> <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> the author’s intention, and the status of the “mental state” of the author. Is it relevant to interpretation? Is it really accessible? Gadamer, because of his roots in Heidegger, offers a hermeneutics altogether free of intentionality. Third, while Vandevelde sees interpretation as an act of man, Gadamer sees understanding as an event that happens to the interpreter in which he or she participates. Finally, we shall consider the fundamentally different views of language in the two thinkers and the effect of this on their two views of interpretation. In this we find the basis for the many contrasts between the approaches of Vandevelde and Gadamer to interpretation. ...|$|R

40|$|Fear {{extinction}} {{refers to}} the ability to adapt as situations change by learning to suppress a previously learned fear. This process involves a gradual reduction in the capacity of a fear-conditioned stimulus to elicit fear by presenting the conditioned stimulus repeatedly on its own. Fear extinction is context-dependent and is generally considered to involve the establishment of inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex over amygdala-based fear processes. In this paper, we review research progress on the neural basis of fear extinction with a focus {{on the role of the}} amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. We evaluate two competing hypotheses for how the medial prefrontal cortex inhibits amygdala output. In addition, we present new findings showing that lesions of the basal amygdala do not affect fear extinction. Based on this result, we propose an updated model for integrating hippocampal-based contextual information with prefrontal–amygdala circuitry. In the presence of threatening or painful stimuli, the brain learns and stores information about other stimuli present so that these can be used as warning signals in future situations. However, the things that are dangerous today are not <b>necessarily</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be harmful, and it is important to be able to adapt as situations change...|$|R

I loved Salem. I was blown away by how visually beautiful it is. The history of the witch burnings is fascinating. It was a special ceremonial journey."

40|$|In the 1930 s {{many people}} leaving the United Kingdom's {{depressed}} areas {{in search of}} work were drawn to Coventry. Companies involved {{in the manufacture of}} motor cars, electrical goods, artificial silk and machine tools were typical of those located in the city. Most incomers found work: unemployment remained at a low level whilst the city's population exploded. The city boundaries were extended, and Coventry was rapidly suburbanised in response to the heightened demand for accommodation. Private developers noted with surprise how few of the new houses were built to let. The 1936 edition of Home Market placed Coventry first on its national index of purchasing power. From the middle of the decade, the city was closely associated with rearmament and four shadow factories provided further employment opportunities. This research addresses changes in the processes and practices of (primarily non-food) shopping amongst prosperous working-class Coventry people in the 1930 s. It assesses the development of new spending patterns In relation to new products and services, and examines the role played by gender in determining the who, what, when, where and why of shopping. The thesis asks how these men and women negotiated financial power and consumer choice between them and discovers that the families who benefitted most from new material opportunities were those which placed a value on togetherness'. A range of source material is utilised to interrogate and contextualise oral testimony, and to explore the development of local retail provision. relationship is established between the city's manufacturing, retail and domestic environments. The research suggests that men spent slightly more time in the home, and women slightly less during this period. It also asserts that going shopping was not necessarily about acquiring goods; that acquir 1 ng goods did not <b>necessarily</b> involve <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the shops; and that the shopper was not always a woman...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSocial media {{steps over}} {{traditional}} outlets to offer faster news delivery sprinkled with opinions, commentary and perspectives on business activity. It {{has become the}} need of the hour for financial services organizations to set a policy concerning social media. Getting it wrong could mean significant reputational damage, ignoring it could mean being left behind. Those financial services institutions embracing social media {{are better able to}} pick up on customer complaints circulating in the online world, and respond before reputational damage occurs. Clearly social media is about socializing in communities online. Social media is collective rather than monologue. Many people talking to many and being able to do so when they want, where they want, and how they want. Connecting through emails, blogs, wikis, web, video and photo sites, social media isn’t <b>necessarily</b> about <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a particular place. It's more about coming together and networking and connecting in a new, more equal and progressive way. To be ‘best able to connect’ means to move toward a sophisticated, responsive distribution mindset. To be where people are and to participate in a way that speaks to them directly. To do that means to be in people's personal environments – Facebook, MySpace, Linkedin, Twitter, etc. Ignoring the power of online word-of-mouth is no longer an option in today's interconnected world. The ability of consumers to influence corporate behavior and impact business planning in unanticipated and, at times, unwelcome ways has grown exponentially. One ‘entertaining’ complaint from an irate customer going viral can escalate into a full-blown crisis in less than 24 hours. In this environment, understanding what customers feel, think and say about company – in real time – is ever more critical. Financial services companies need to harness the great power of social media in order to enhance customer service, manage their reputation and obtain a competitive advantage. Social media humanizes customer service, brings businesses closer to their stakeholders, and makes information more accessible...|$|R
