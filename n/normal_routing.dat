50|$|Arc Routing is {{the process}} of {{selecting}} the best path in a network based on the route. Contrary to <b>normal</b> <b>routing</b> problems, which usually involve mapping a route between nodes, arc routing focuses more heavily on the route itself. The goal of many arc routing problems is to produce a route with the minimum amount of dead mileage, while also fully encompassing the edges required. Examples of arc routing applications include garbage collection, road gritting, mail delivery, network maintenance, and snowploughing.|$|E

5000|$|Ingraham International School is {{a public}} high school, serving grades 9-12 in the Haller Lake {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, Washington. Opened in 1959, the school is named after Edward Sturgis Ingraham, the first superintendent of the Seattle Public Schools.

Ingraham is one of several Seattle high schools offering an International Baccalaureate diploma and classes for high school students in 11th and 12th grades. Since the 2011 school year, Ingraham has also offered an accelerated model of the International Baccalaureate program (IBx), modeled on a similar program in Bellevue School District, allowing students in Seattle Public Schools' highly capable cohort (formerly Accelerated Progress Program). The IBx program was established to provide an alternative to the <b>normal</b> <b>routing</b> to Garfield High School, for the highly capable students. In 2013, Ingraham officially became an International Pathway school, continuing the immersion languages of Spanish and Japanese from Hamilton International Middle School, along with John Stanford and Mcdonald International Schools.

40|$|Recently great {{attention}} has been given to point-of-failure swap rerouting, an efficient technique for routing in presence of transient failures. According to this technique, a message follows the <b>normal</b> <b>routing</b> table information unless the next hop has failed; in this case, it is redirected towards a precomputed link, called swap; once this link has been crossed, <b>normal</b> <b>routing</b> is resumed. The amount of precomputed information required in addition to the routing table is rather small: a single link per each destination. Several efficient serial algorithms have been presented to compute this information; none of them can unfortunately be efficiently implemented in a distributed environment. In this paper we present protocols, based on a new strategy, that allow the efficient computation of all the optimal swap edges under several optimization criteria...|$|E

Measurements are used both to construct the virtual links of the overlay and to establish the link costs for use in a link-state routing protocol. The overlay attempts to forward certain packets over the least congested rather than the shortest path. We present simulation results showing that contrary to common belief overlay networks are not always bene cial and can be detrimental...|$|R

In such a case, the MN will receive out-of-order packets, which is <b>normal</b> in dynamic <b>routing.</b>|$|R
