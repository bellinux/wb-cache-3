A sodium-bearing waste simulant was adjusted to represent an evaporator feed in which the acid from the distillate is concentrated, neutralized, and recycled back through the evaporator. The advantage to this flowsheet is that a single remote-handled transuranic waste form is produced in the evaporator bottoms without the generation of any low-level mixed secondary waste. However, use of a recycle flowsheet in sodium-bearing waste evaporation results in a 50 % increase in remote-handled transuranic volume in comparison to a <b>non-recycle</b> flowsheet...|$|R
40|$|Experiments for the {{determination}} of vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data with a <b>Non-Recycle</b> Flow Still (NFS) are described. Due to short residence times, the NFS is especially suited for systems with thermally unstable components and for reactive mixtures. VLE data of the latter are necessary for modeling reactive distillation processes. With the NFS isobaric data both at atmospheric and at reduced pressure can be gained. The potential of this technique is demonstrated and validated with the well-known, non-reactive systems methanol-ethanol and ethanol-water. The other (mainly reactive) binary mixtures investigated stem from two esterification systems (methyl formate and ethyl acetate production) and one etherification system (tert-amyl methyl ether production). The NRTL equation is used for modeling of the VLE data. The data acquired with the NFS are compared with literature data (whenever possible) or with results of group contribution methods. (orig.)

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{performance}} of a multiple stage crosscurrent tower packed with Pall rings was characterized with and without a recycle loop on the gas stream. The column used 12 baffles. The absorption system studied was the transfer of oxygen from an oxygen-enriched air stream into a water stream which is a relatively insoluble combination. A literature survey summarized the work done to date with crosscurrent columns. The column and associated equipment were described {{as well as the}} experimental procedure. The mass transfer data were summarized and sample calculations given. The <b>non-recycle</b> experiments were performed for liquid to gas flowrate ratios ranging from 15 to 25 at varying liquid flowrates. An efficiency term which compared oxygen concentration change in the liquid phase with the concentration driving force was used to evaluate the data. In terms of efficiency, two operating ranges existed in the column which agreed with earlier studies. Efficiencies were highest when the column was operated in the crosscurrent region and efficiencies increased with decreasing liquid to gas flowrate ratios. A correlation was developed between the liquid to gas flowrate ratio and the transition flowrate. The recycle experiments were performed for the recycle ratios of 0, 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5 with varying oxygen flowrates. A term which determined the relative percentage change in the oxygen concentration of the liquid was used to evaluate the data. It was determined that using a recycle loop with the gas stream increased the {{performance of}} the column and decreased the usage of oxygen...|$|R

The glucose concentration was determined in enzymatic hydrolysis by HPLC. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were chosen for ethanol production. The production of ethanol was carried out with all the pretreated papers in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. During hydrolysis, the pretreated papers have reached the highest results in the combination with microwave + H 2 SO 4 + NaOH. <b>Non-recycled</b> workbook was the only exception, where the highest concentration of glucose has been obtained by the pretreatment of microwaves + H 2 SO 4.

40|$|Plastic {{is one of}} the raw {{materials}} for product manufacturing. Due to its advantageous including flexibility, relatively low cost and flexibility, it is widely applied {{in a wide range of}} products, such as shopping bags, containers, electronic equipment cases, etc. As plastic products are usually in short-term use, in proportion, a huge amount of plastic waste generates in the world every day, the same case happens in Hong Kong. Landfill expansion in the coming years is a hot social and environmental issue in Hong Kong. Plastic waste, which is a recyclable material, is the second highest component of municipal solid waste (MSW) being disposed into the landfill by weight in 2013. Plastic recycling business is facing difficulties in high operating cost and low revenue of recycled plastic pellets due to the dropping of oil price in recent years. Besides, the incentives for public to do plastic clean recycling is low. These factors discourage plastic recycling practices in Hong Kong and cause a large proportion of <b>non-recycled</b> plastic waste being dumped into the landfill every day. Since plastic is derived from petrochemicals, it usually has a comparable heating value with fuels, which is favorable in carrying out waste-to-energy (WTE) process and too valuable to throw away. Overseas countries apply WTE to recover the energy of plastic waste via thermochemical process. In some countries, plastic waste can be 100 % recycled and recovered in energy with landfill ban. In this research, the feasibility of WTE and its role in plastic waste management is studied. It was found the application in WTE for the treatment of plastic waste mixed with MSW is technically feasible. It is a significant means in waste management to relieve the space occupying by MSW in landfill and generate energy from waste by energy recovery technologies, for example, incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, etc. The result of study shows that, WTE is a financially feasible and eco-efficient means in <b>non-recycled</b> plastic waste treatment. WTE fills the gap between recycling and disposal in local plastic waste management. Public accepts the development of WTE for the treatment of <b>non-recycled</b> plastic waste in Hong Kong. Also, citizens welcome such measures to reduce the space of plastic waste occupied in landfill and the generation of energy in terms of electricity from plastic waste. Limitations of development of such facilities in Hong Kong are discussed. Location of the proposed facilities is always a controversial topic. Recommendations are given to deal with the possible difficulties encountered in the development of WTE for the non-separated and <b>non-recycled</b> plastic waste. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E

40|$|Soil water {{retention}} {{refers to the}} relationship between the amount of soil water and the energy with which it is held. This relationship is important for characterizing water movement through granular materials. In this project, we generated soil moisture retention data of 18 <b>non-recycled</b> and 7 recycled materials used in pavement construction. The results showed that {{water retention}} of <b>non-recycled</b> materials was nearly similar. The major differences among the curves were in the inflection points (air entry values) and in the water contents either near saturation or at 15, 300 cm of suction. Using this database, we also developed Pedo-transfer functions that can predict (1) water retention or (2) the parameters of functions that describe water retention from easily measurable properties of the pavement materials. Water retention of concrete with and without shingles was only slightly different. This is partially because shingle chips imbedded in the concrete were large. Traditionally, the influence of matric suction has not been directly considered in pavement design.

40|$|Observations by Fermi LAT {{enabled us}} to explore the {{population}} of <b>non-recycled</b> gamma-ray pulsars with the set of 89 objects. It was recently noted that there are apparent differences in properties of radio-quiet and radio-loud subsets. In particular, average observed radio-loud pulsar is younger than radio-quiet one and is located at smaller galactic latitude. Even so, the analysis based on the full list of pulsars may suffer from selection effects. Namely, most of radio-loud pulsars are first discovered in the radio-band, while radio-quiet ones are found using the gamma-ray data. In this work we perform a blind search for gamma-ray pulsars using the Fermi LAT data alone using all point sources from 3 FGL catalog as the candidates. Unlike preceding blind search, the present catalog is constructed with novel semi-coherent method and covers {{the full range of}} characteristic ages down to 1 kyr. The search resulted in the catalog of 40 <b>non-recycled</b> pulsars, 26 of which are radio-quiet. There are no statistically significant differences in age and galactic latitude distributions for the radio-loud and radio-quiet pulsars, while the rotation period distributions are marginally different with 2. 4 σ pre-trial statistical significance.

Yard trimmings (defined here to include leaves, grass clippings, and brush), food scraps, <b>non-recycled</b> paper, food and seafood processing by-products, livestock manures, dead chickens, municipal sewage sludge, and other clean, source separated decomposable organic materials provide ingredients for the enterprising composter. Researchers are documenting the feasibility of composting an ever increasing array of materials (e. g., Brinton and Seekins, 1988 : Seekins, 1986). It is often reported that composting yard trimmings, food scraps, and <b>non-recycled</b> paper can deal with 30 - 60 percent of the municipal solid waste stream.

40|$|Mechanical {{recycling}} of plastics {{has continued to}} grow in the United States, with 2. 1 million tons of plastics recycled in 2009. This includes recovery of used plastics from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, non-bottle rigid containers, and some flexible packaging. However, despite the efforts of many communities to source-separate plastics, less than 15 % of the U.

Therefore, while continuing its efforts to increase plastics recycling, the American Chemistry Council (ACC) is also seeking ways to recover more of the energy value of <b>non-recycled</b> plastics (NRP) in the form of electricity, heat, or petrochemical feedstock. Landfilling of NRP constitutes a loss of a valuable energy resource.
