40|$|International audienceExtended {{formulations}} entail {{working in}} an extended variable space which typically results in a tighter formulation for mixed integer programs. The Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition paradigm and the resulting column generation reformulation is a special case where one expresses global solutions as a combination of solutions to identified subproblems. Extended formulations present {{the advantage of being}} amenable to a direct handling by a MIP solver and a rich variable space in which to express cuts or branching constraints; but their size blows rapidly too large for practical purposes. Column generation reformulation on the other hand requires a branch-and-price solver based on a specific oracle for the subproblems and efficient stabilization strategies to accelerate convergence. The combination of these two paradigms offers a truly practical approach to well-structured applications, where formulation size is handled dynamically, stabilization is less of an issue thanks to <b>natural</b> <b>recombinations</b> of subproblem solutions, and inherent stage-by-stage approximation strategies provide primal heuristic solutions.

40|$|Abstract Background HIV- 1 is a {{retrovirus}} {{with high}} rate of recombination. Increasing experimental studies in vitro indicated that local hairpin structure of RNA was associated with recombination by favoring RT pausing and promoting strand transfer. A method to estimate the potential to form stem-loop structure by calculating the folding of randomized sequence difference (FORS-D) {{has been used to}} investigate the relationship between secondary structure and evolutionary pressure in some genome. It showed that gene regions under strong positive "Darwinian" selection were associated with positive FORS-D values. In the present study, the sequences of HIV- 1 subtypes B' and C, both of which represent the parent strains of CRF 07 _BC, CRF 08 _BC and China URFs, were selected to investigate the relationship between <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> and secondary structure by calculating the FORS-D values. Results The apparent higher negative FORS-D value region appeared in the gag - pol gene region (nucleotide 0 – 3000) of HIV- 1 subtypes B' and C. Thirteen (86. 7 %) of 15 mosaic fragments and 17 (81 %) of 21 recombination breakpoints occurred in this higher negative FORS-D region. This strongly suggested that <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> did not occur randomly throughout the HIV genome, and that there might be preferred (or hot) regions or sites for recombination. The FORS-D analysis of breakpoints showed that most breakpoints of recombinants were located in regions with higher negative FORS-D values (P = 0. 0053), and appeared to have a higher negative average FORS-D value than the whole genome (P = 0. 0007). The regression analysis also indicated that FORS-D values correlated negatively with breakpoint overlap. Conclusion High negative FORS-D values represent high, base order determined stem-loop potentials and influence mainly the formation of stem-loop structures. Therefore, the present results suggested {{for the first time that}} occurrence of <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> was associated with high base order-determined stem-loop potential, and that local base order might play a key role in the initiation of <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> by favoring the formation of stable stem-loop structures. </p...|$|E

Starting from full-length cDNA clones of both viruses, we have generated two reciprocal Sindbis-Ross River chimeric viruses {{in which the}} structural and nonstructural regions have been exchanged. These chimeric viruses replicate readily in several cell lines. Both chimeras grow more poorly than do the parental viruses, with the chimera containing Sindbis virus nonstructural proteins and Ross River virus structural proteins growing considerably better in both mosquito and Vero cell lines than the reciprocal chimera does. The reduction in replicative capacity {{in comparison with the}} parental viruses appears to result at least in part from a reduction in RNA synthesis, which suggests that the structural proteins or sequence elements within the structural region interact with the nonstructural proteins or sequence elements within the nonstructural region, that these interactions are required for efficient RNA replication, and that these interactions are suboptimal in the chimeras. The chimeras are able to infect mice, but their growth is attenuated. Western equine encephalitis virus, a virus widely distributed throughout the Americas, has been previously shown to have arisen by <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> between two distinct alphaviruses, but other naturally occurring recombinant alphaviruses have not been found.

The significance of human coronaviruses studies re-emerged after the SARS pandemic. Two novel human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL 63 and HCoV-HKU 1, were identified after the SARS pandemic. Up till now there are a total of five human coronaviruses being identified. After the discovery of HCoV-HKU 1 in 2005, molecular epidemiology and genome studies identified the first <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> in human coronaviruses, which has led to the generation of different genotypes. A similar phenomenon was also observed in HCoV-OC 43 in a subsequent study, resulting in the emergence of a novel genotype associated with pneumonia. Although HCoV- 229 E has been discovered for over forty years, information regarding its evolution and epidemiology is little and scattered. In this study, 32 HCoV- 229 E strains were collected from nasopharyngeal aspirates over a period of 8 years (from April 2004 to January 2012). Three genes, including RdRp (RNA-dependent-RNA polyermase), S (spike) and N (nucleocapsid), were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic studies showed the existence of genetic drift among six chronological groups, including group 1 from 1979 to 1982, group 2 from 1982 to 1984, group 3 from 1990 to 1992, group 4 from 2001 to 2005, group 5 from 2005 to 2008 and group 6 from 2011 to 2012. One particular strain in 2006, HCoV- 229 E-HK 06 - 24 displayed an incongruent position between the S and N gene, suggesting a possible recombination between group 4 and group 5. Additionally, five strains from 2011 to 2012 showed incongruent positions in RdRp comparing to other strains, which are suspected to be novel group 6. This study revealed the first evidence for a possible <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> event in HCoV- 229 E.

40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a {{prototype}} member of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV- 1), which causes severe and contagious {{disease in the}} commercial poultry and wild birds. Despite extensive vaccination programs and other control measures, the disease remains endemic around the globe especially in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Being a single serotype, genotype II based vaccines remained most acceptable means of immunization. However, the evidence is emerging on failures of vaccines mainly due to evolving nature of the virus and higher genetic gaps between vaccine and field strains of APMV- 1. Most of the epidemiological and genetic characterizations of APMVs are based on conventional methods, which are prone to mask the diverse population of viruses in complex samples. In this study, we report {{the application of a}} simple, robust, and less resource-demanding methodology for the whole genome sequencing of NDV, using next-generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Using this platform, we sequenced full genomes of five virulent Malaysian NDV strains collected during 2004 - 2013. All isolates clustered within highly prevalent lineage 5 (specifically in lineage 5 a); however, a significantly greater genetic divergence was observed in isolates collected from 2004 to 2011. Interestingly, genetic characterization of one isolate collected in 2013 (IBS 025 / 13) shown <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> between lineage 2 and lineage 5. In the event of recombination, the isolate (IBS 025 / 13) carried nucleocapsid protein consist of 55 - 1801 nucleotides (nts) and near-complete phosphoprotein (1804 - 3254 nts) genes of lineage 2 whereas surface glycoproteins (fusion, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) and large polymerase of lineage 5.

40|$|Abstract. The within-species genetic {{variation}} due to recombinations {{leads to a}} mosaic-like structure of DNA. This structure can be modeled, e. g. by parsing sample sequences of current DNA {{with respect to a}} small number of founders. The founders represent the ancestral sequence material from which the sample was created in a sequence of recombination steps. This scenario has recently been successfully applied on developing probabilistic Hidden Markov Methods for haplotyping genotypic data. In this paper we introduce a combinatorial method for haplotyping that is based on a similar parsing idea. We formulate a polynomial-time parsing algorithm that finds minimum cross-over parse in a simplified ‘flat’ parsing model that ignores the historical hierarchy of recombinations. The problem of constructing optimal founders that would give minimum possible parse for given genotypic sequences is shown NP-hard. A heuristic locally-optimal algorithm is given for founder construction. Combined with flat parsing this already gives quite good haplotyping results. Improved haplotyping is obtained by using a hierarchical parsing that properly models the <b>natural</b> <b>recombination</b> process. For finding short hierarchical parses a greedy polynomial-time algorithm is given. Empirical haplotyping results on HapMap data are reported. ...|$|E

In this study, we use a minimally modified full length HIV- 1 genome and high throughput sequence analysis to study recombination in gag and pol in T cells. We find that recombination is favoured at a number of recombination hotspots, where recombination occurs six times more frequently than at corresponding coldspots. Interestingly, these hotspots occur near important features of the HIV- 1 genome, but do not occur at sites immediately around protease inhibitor or reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug resistance mutations. We show that the recombination hot and cold spots are consistent across five blood donors and are independent of co-receptor mediated entry. Finally, we check common experimental confounders and find that these are not driving the location of recombination hotspots.

For genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which are free of <b>natural</b> <b>recombination,</b> single instances of sample mix-up involving different branches of the mtDNA phylogeny would give rise to reticulate patterns and should therefore be detectable. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have developed a strategy for comparing new complete mtDNA genomes, one by one, to a current skeleton of the worldwide mtDNA phylogeny. The mutations distinguishing the reference sequence from a putative recombinant sequence can then be allocated to two or more different branches of this phylogenetic skeleton. Thus, one would search for two (or three) near-matches in the total mtDNA database that together best explain the variation seen in the recombinants. The evolutionary pathway from the mtDNA tree connecting this pair together with the recombinant then generate a grid-like median network, from which one can read off the exchanged segments.

50|$|The partial filling of {{the states}} {{at the bottom of}} the {{conduction}} band can be understood as adding electrons to that band.The electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the <b>natural</b> thermal <b>recombination)</b> but they can move around for some time.The actual concentration of electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical ideal gas, where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic dispersion relation, and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different effective mass.Because the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the Drude model, and introduce concepts such as electron mobility.|$|R
