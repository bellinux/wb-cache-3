30|$|Sulfur {{assimilation}} is upregulated by TERF 1 {{as shown}} by the two GO term, “sulfur compound biosynthetic process” and “sulfur compound metabolic process”, are significantly enriched for the upregulated proteins in TERF 1 tobacco. The enriched proteins for the sulfur metabolism correlates with the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (No. 2 and <b>No.</b> 143, <b>Additional</b> file 5 : Table S 3), thiamine (vitamin B 1) (<b>No.</b> 158, <b>Additional</b> file 5 : Table S 3), biotin (vitamin H) (<b>No.</b> 35, <b>Additional</b> file 5 : Table S 3). Accumulation of SAM provides substrates for the biosynthesis of plant hormones, polyamines, and defense metabolites (Kusano et al. 2010). Acetyl CoA carboxylase is significantly upregulated by TERF 1 (No. 22 and <b>No.</b> 23, <b>Additional</b> file 5 : Table S 3) and biotin is an important co-factor for it (Nikolau et al. 2003), which contribute to the significant upregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis as shown in Table  1. Biosynthesis of thiamine contributes to the carbon fixation shown in Additional file 7 : Table S 5, glycolysis and citric acid cycle (Martinis et al. 2016).|$|R

The crew abandoned the heavily damaged Japanese carrier at nightfall and she sank soon after. Amatsukaze and Tokitsukaze rescued Ryūjōs survivors and the aircrews from her returning strike force, who ditched their aircraft in the ocean nearby. After the rescue operations were complete, both Japanese destroyers and Tone rejoined Nagumo's main force.|$|E
