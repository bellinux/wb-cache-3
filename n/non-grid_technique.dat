40|$|Optimization of X-ray {{beam tube}} {{potential}} (kVp) in radiological examinations can minimize patient dose. This research aims {{to investigate the}} effect of tube potential variation on gonad doses to patients during posteroanterior (PA) chest radiography examinations. This study was carried out using a Toshiba general purpose X-ray unit and a Rando phantom. Dose measuring equipment included an ion chamber system, a dose-area product (DAP) meter and a thermoluminescent dosemeter (TLD) reader system with high sensitivity TLD pellets of LiF:Mg,Cu,P for low level gonad dose measurement. PA chest exposures of the phantom to produce a constant exit dose were made using a standard low tube potential (range 60 - 100 kVp) <b>non-grid</b> <b>technique</b> and a high tube potential (range 95 - 150 kVp) grid technique. Entrance surface doses (ESDs) and DAPs were {{also included in the}} measurements. Effective doses (EDs) were computed from ESD and DAP measurements using NRPB-SR 262 and Xdose software. Results show that with the low tube potential technique both ovary dose and testes dose increase with increasing tube potential; statistically significant correlations of r= 0. 994 (p= 0. 0006) and r= 0. 998 (p= 0. 001), respectively, were found. For both organs, doses increase at a rate of approximately 2 % per kVp. With the high tube potential technique there is insignificant correlation between gonad doses and tube potential. When comparing patient doses from typical exposures made at 70 kVp (low tube potential <b>non-grid</b> <b>technique)</b> with doses from exposures made at 120 kVp (high tube potential grid technique), the high tube potential technique delivers significantly higher values for ESD, and ovary, testes and effective doses by factors of 1. 7, 5. 2, 5. 5 and 2. 7, respectively.
