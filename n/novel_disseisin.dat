5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin,</b> mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

25|$|Cokayne's {{involvement}} with Cromwell then drew {{him into the}} affairs of Lincolnshire. Walter Tailboys, a neighbour and client of Cromwell, together {{with some of his}} relatives and friends, had initiated an assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin.</b> Eight plaintiffs and four defendants were named, although others were involved, and a number of tenements were at stake on or close to the Lincolnshire coast, at Theddlethorpe, Mablethorpe, Saltfleetby, Strubby, Carlton, Gayton and Withern, suggesting a contest between groups of property speculators. The plaintiffs had triumphed at the initial hearing and the defendants had decided to come to terms. They promised to accept the judgement and make a quitclaim, but wanted to limit their losses. Both sides seem to have recruited guarantors among serving MPs: the 1431 parliament, which was Cokayne's tenth, was assembling as the legal process continued. The defendants obtained recognizances to guarantee their quitclaim from John Culpepper, just elected MP for Rutland, and from Thomas Strange, a Midlands landowner. Cokayne agreed to enter into a recognizance of £1000 in Derbyshire to guarantee that Tailboys would press the issue no further after the judgement had been affirmed. This was matched by Sir Richard Stanhope, then serving as MP for Nottinghamshire, whose wife Maud was Lord Cromwell's daughter. It was later alleged that about this time Cromwell had illegally tried to recruit Cokayne, Vernon and others into his affinity by offering them his livery.|$|E
500|$|The tort of {{nuisance}} {{has existed}} since {{the reign of}} Henry III, with few changes, {{and most of them}} merely technical. It originally came from the Latin nocumentum, and then the French nuisance, with Henry de Bracton initially defining the tort of nuisance as an infringement of easements. The tort was in line with the economic status quo of the time, protecting claimants against their neighbours' rights to develop land, and thus has been described as [...] "rural, agricultural, and conservative". There were initially four remedies for nuisance; the assize of nuisance, similar to the assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin,</b> which was limited to situations where the defendant's actions interfered with the claimant's seisin; the action guod permittat prosternere, where the land in question was alienated; the writ of trespass; and the [...] "action upon the case for nuisance", which became the main remedy. This was because it was far faster than the other writs and actions, and unlike them did not require that both parties be freeholders. It was, however, limited to damages, and unlike the other remedies did not allow for abatement.|$|E
500|$|The {{administration}} of justice was of particular importance to John. Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II, including <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin</b> and mort d'ancestor. These processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases, which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords. John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs, and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194, creating {{a new class of}} borough coroners. John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, by fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself. John continued to try relatively minor cases, even during military crises. Viewed positively, Lewis Warren considers that John discharged [...] "his royal duty of providing justice... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly endebted". Seen more critically, John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees, rather than a desire to deliver simple justice; John's legal system also only applied to free men, rather than to all of the population. Nonetheless, these changes were popular with many free tenants, who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons, against whom such cases were often brought. John's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves, especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice.|$|E
2500|$|After the Norman Conquest, fines {{were paid}} only to courts or the king, and {{quickly became a}} revenue source. A wrong became known as a tort or trespass, and there arose a {{division}} between civil pleas and pleas of the crown. The petty assizes (i.e. of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin,</b> of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The trespass action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for slander, breach of contract, or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts {{so that in the}} 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made de cursu (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the [...] "appeal of felony", or assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin,</b> or replevin. Later, after the Statute of Westminster 1285, in the 1360s, the [...] "trespass on the case" [...] action arose for when the defendant did not direct force. As its scope increased, it became simply [...] "action on the case". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case.|$|E
2500|$|Burley {{was closely}} {{involved}} in a particularly protracted and complex feud at Shrewsbury, involving the politicians Nicholas Gerard and Urian St Pierre. This began in 1407 with St Pierre buying from feoffees property, mainly valuable urban plots in Abbey Foregate and elsewhere, that Gerard was hoping to inherit from his grandfather. It led to three assizes of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin</b> and a violent attack by Gerard on his opponent on Castle Street. Finally they compromised, with St Pierre handing over the property, but Gerard compensating him by resigning in his favour the constableship of Shrewsbury Castle – a post he finally acquired on 15 February 1413. The legal costs to the borough, including fees to Burley, the serjeant-at-law and the attorney, came to [...] £2 10s.|$|E

5000|$|Henry {{therefore}} promulgated various assizes (i.e. {{courts that}} convened {{in a town}} periodically, rather than being permanently established). The primary and most general one, the Assize of Clarendon was issued in 1166. Others, the [...] "petty" [...] assizes known respectively as the assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin,</b> of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment gave more specific relief. The most popular one became the assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin,</b> which in Law French meant something close to the [...] "assize of recent dispossession". Those who had been recently put out of their lands could recover the beneficial use of them by resort to this assize, {{which led to a}} then innovative method of trial. Twelve [...] "of the more lawful men" [...] of the locality were summoned by the king's sheriff to determine, upon their own knowledge, who was entitled to the property. This innovative method of proceeding, the origin of the civil petit jury at common law, was aimed at the chaos introduced into property rights by crusade and civil war.|$|E
50|$|In English law, the Assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin</b> ("recent dispossession") was {{an action}} to recover lands {{of which the}} {{plaintiff}} had been disseised, or dispossessed. The action became extremely popular due to its expediency. Rather than dealing {{with the issue of}} lawful possession, it simply asked whether a dispossession had taken place, in which case the property was restored to the plaintiff, and the question of true ownership was dealt with later.|$|E
50|$|Robert was a King's {{clerk and}} royal {{justice in the}} reign of Henry II. Some of the cases {{in which he was}} {{involved}} are known.

A {{few months later}} Ralph de Coven and Roger de Eyton sued William (and his wife Maud), and the Bishop of Hereford over the advowson of the Church of Broseley. On 10 July 1260 Robert de Beysin’s had a suit of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin</b> against William Devereux and his wife, Matilda, concerning the manor of Billingsly. Robert de Beysin {{took advantage of the}} political upheavel occurring in England during this time to use armed men to seize and hold the manor of Billingsly, which remained in the custody of William Devereux, and on 20 March 1261 the king commanded the sheriff of Shropshire to remove Robert and restore the manor to Devereux. Beysin came of age in 1263, and on 22 September an Inquiry Post-mortem was made into his father, Adam de Beysin’s estates which identified his wardship with William Devereux.

50|$|A {{dispute between}} Ipstones and the Swynnerton {{family had been}} {{simmering}} alongside his rise to relative political prominence. He had occupied Tean and Hopton in 1381, claiming them in his mother's right, and simply expelling the occupant, Maud or Matilda Swynnerton, a granddaughter of Sir Nicholas Beck, and thus his own cousin once removed. Maud was backed by her father-in-law, Sir Richard Peshale, who had a grudge against the Ipstones family, {{dating back to the}} death of his father Adam at the hands of the elder John Ipstones in 1346. Moreover, the Peshales were clients of the Earls of Stafford, suspicious of Gaunt since he intervened to get Sir John Holland restored to favour after he murdered the son of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1386. There was a third dimension to the conflict within the Corbet family, as Sir Richard Peshale's brother and henchman Hamon Peshale was married to Alicia Harley, a first cousin of Elizabeth Corbet, and part of the group within the Corbet family which had opposed Ipstones earlier. Sir Richard arraigned an Assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin</b> relating to the estates at Tean and Hopton, and also tenements at Blythewood, which was authorised by the king at Reading on 12 August. The justices nominated for the trial were Robert Tresilian, who was to be lynched during the rule of the Lords Appellant, and David Hanmer, the father-in-law of Owain Glyndŵr. At the same time the king authorised Maud's own assize concerning the carucate of land and messuage at Blythewood. The case was heard at Stafford during Michaelmas term. Ipstones' contended that the assize could not go ahead because Maud was illegitimate, presumably implying that her parents were within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity. Maud stated that she was under age and that Ipstones had accepted a writ that called her John Swynnerton's daughter, implying that he recognised her legitimacy. Henry Brown, a clerk of the court, was appointed to represent Maud. After several adjournments, both parties at last appeared in court about a year later, when it was decided the question of Maud's legitimacy would have to be settled. However, this was an ecclesiastical matter, so a mandate was sent to the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield to investigate and judge the issue, reporting back at Easter 1383. Maud did not appear in court for four successive days and her suit was dismissed.|$|E
50|$|The priory, {{like other}} monastic houses, was not immune from {{the changes in}} the {{economic}} climate and generally sought to adjust. For example the expanding population and rising market of the 13th century meant that pasture land was brought under increasingly close management, which posed dangers for small landholders and tenants, like White Ladies. The priory must have acquired a small estate at Rudge, near Pattingham but within Shropshire, some time before 1292 as in that year Prioress Sarra (Sarah) sued William de Rugg, the lord of the manor for denying her use of common pasture. Unlike some of the other cases brought to court, this was not a fictitious issue intended to create a record. The jury found that William had contravened his tenants' historic rights and deprived them of pasture they required for their animals through enclosures designed to improve his estate. He counter-sued the prioress and others for breaking down his fence. However, Sarah and the other tenants won their cases. It seems that White Ladies was dogged in defending common pasture. In 1305 the prioress of the time, possibly still Sarah, arraigned an assize of <b>novel</b> <b>disseisin</b> to assert her rights against William Wycher, who seems to have been particularly aggressive in enclosing commons after taking control through marriage of the manor of Blymhill, which neighboured the priory demesne. The situation changed greatly after the agrarian crisis of 1315-22 and even more so after the onset of the Black Death in Shropshire during Spring 1349. The overall result was to encourage leasing of demesnes, a trend that affected monastic estates as much as those of lay landholders. This persisted {{for more than a century}} and, when prices began to rise in the 16th century, White Ladies, like other religious houses, found itself with most of its land on long term leases at low fixed rents, leaving it barely able to meet outgoings. When the priory property was sold in 1540, some of these long leases were revealed: a lease of 1471 in the reign of Edward IV, was for 99 years, so would not expire until well into the reign of Elizabeth I. Unable to adjust its rents upwards to allow for inflation, the priory had little left to pay for repairs and the condition of the buildings suffered.|$|E
