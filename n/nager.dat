Larry <b>Nager</b> of The Cincinnati Enquirer awarded the album {{two out of}} four stars and wrote that James {{had the ability to}} make [...] "the ultimate blue Christmas disc" [...] but failed to do so. <b>Nager</b> complimented [...] "Merry Christmas, Baby" [...] but considered the performance to be a [...] "rare bit of juke joint" [...] among [...] "supper club sounds" [...] that left him [...] "wanting more".|$|E
500|$|Larry <b>Nager</b> of The National Enquirer {{commented that}} [...] " [...] packed more {{technical}} wizardry than Harry Potter, but almost no actual singing". He summarized his review saying [...] "If it wasn't quite a real concert, {{it was a}} great show." [...] Ann Powers of The New York Times said the show was [...] "dazzling" [...] and commented that the performance did not suffer from music being its least important element, adding [...] "This dream extravaganza perhaps unwittingly suggested that the Britney we know is herself a dream, an artist whose genius is not for singing [...] but for teasing out the cravings and fears that haunt the modern world. Ms. Spears now wants to awaken to an adult persona, but she may find that the netherworld of desire is her natural home." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News compared it to tours of other teenage artists, saying [...] "her latest 90-minute extravaganza had to be the costliest, most elaborate and, to be honest, least tacky to date". He was also impressed with the stage, calling it [...] "the largest proscenium I've ever seen at a pop show." [...] Camille Lamb of The Daily Collegian named the show [...] "an elaborate, highly homogenized display of capitalism at its finest". She also said the show fulfilled its expectations, saying [...] " [...] a teenage fantasy to a tangible reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Usher's stage {{performances}} {{have been}} complimented by critics for being [...] "packed with high-octane choreography {{held together by}} sleek, masterful showmanship", and his engaging skill with audiences being [...] "enough {{to pull off a}} one-man show". His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry <b>Nager</b> of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television." ...|$|E

40|$|Background Distraction osteogenesis (DO) {{was first}} applied {{on the human}} craniofacial {{skeleton}} in 1992 by McCarthy et al. 1 who performed lengthening of the mandible in patients with hemifacial microsomia and <b>Nager’s</b> syndrome. Further advances in this field have since then led to {{the widespread use of}} this modality for the treatment of numerous congenital and acquired craniofacial skeletal anomalies. In 2001, a review by Swennen et al 2 concluded that up to year 1999, this form of treatment was gaining intense popularity but that the main drawbacks included insufficient data on long term results and relapse. A systematic review of the last decade on functional outcomes and long term complications following distraction osteogenesis of the facial skeleton is presented. Methods A structured systematic literature search, with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria from relevant computer databases and journals were performed. The journals were evaluated and critically appraised by 2 reviewers separately in 3 rounds. Papers were categorized according to the level of evidence, the quality of methodology and the specific field of functional outcomes and long term complications. Results were then categorized according to the type of distraction movements, ie maxillary advancement and mandibular lengthening. Results A total of 42 papers comprising of 16 studies for maxillary advancement and 26 studies for mandibular lengthening were included in this review. Maxillary advancement was found to be beneficial in patients with cleft maxillary hypoplasia in terms of achieving aesthetic outcome but the risk for velopharyngeal insufficiency remains uncertain. The achieved maxillary advancement was stable if performed on adult patients while a recurrence of midface retrusion was noted if DO was performed on growing patients. Overcorrection was recommended in these cases to an estimated value of 20 - 50 %. Mandibular lengthening was 99 % successful in relieving respiratory obstruction in patients with isolated Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) or syndromic micrognathic infants preventing the need for tracheostomy in the long term, and in 89 % successfully decannulating infants with pre-existing tracheostomy. However, feeding and growth outcomes after airway obstruction was relieved remain unknown due to lack of sufficient evidence. Unilateral mandibular DO was successful in achieving aesthetic symmetrical facial balance in patients with hemifacial microsomia however a total loss of corrected distraction length was noted by the end of growth period if DO was performed during growth. Conclusions DO achieved stable results in terms of lengthening the maxilla and mandible but was also noted to cause restricted growth potential of the distracted bone. Hence, the benefits of performing DO during active growth should be weighed against the likely need for a second surgery due to a growth deficit of distracted bone and future surrounding bone growth. However DO in adults remains an alternative to conventional orthognathic surgery and choice of treatment should be patient centred. published_or_final_versionDental SurgeryMasterMaster of Dental Surger...|$|R
40|$|The Government {{has placed}} an {{emphasis}} on encouraging the participati on of farmers in the planning and implementation of agricultural development, {{as part of its}} new agricultural development strategy. This involves the establishment of formal me chanisms for consultation with representatives of farmers, agricultural workers, and local go vernment bodies. Project TCP/TRI/ 6752 was intended to prepare guidelines for the promoti on of farmers' participation through formal consultation, to organize training courses in integrated cooperative management for extension workers and related personnel, and to prepa re an action plan to improve the operational efficiency of agricultural cooperativesThe project provided the services of two experts, a farmers' partici pation specialist for one month, and an integrated cooperative specialist for a further four months. A series of workshops with representatives of farmers' organizations was organiz ed, so as to discuss organizational and procedural mechanisms that would facilitate formal consultation between the Government and farmers. As a result of these workshops, guidelines for the promotion of participation were submitted to the Government and were already bei ng implementedFour one-week training courses on integrated cooperative management for extension and agricultural officers of the Ministry of Food Production, Marine E xploitation, Forestry and Environment were organized, as a six-week training course on the pl anning and implementation of integrated cooperative projects. Participants in the latter c ourse prepared five proposals for commodity-based projects, which were believed to be economica lly viable, and to have considerable potential {{for the development of the}} agricultural secto r. It was recommended that the Government take steps to review and implement these project s as soon as possibleIn consultation with officers of the Government and with representat ives of farmers, the outline of an action plan to improve the operational efficiency of integrated commodity-based cooperatives was developed and submitted. The action plan conta ined a proposal to create a National Agricultural Cooperative Development Council (NACD C), whose purpose would be to coordinate and direct the efforts of the various organ izations involved in agricultural development. Equally important was the proposal to est ablish a Cooperative Projects Planning Division within the Ministry of Food ProductionFinally, the regular training of farmers, cooperative leaders and ma <b>nagers,</b> and extension officers was recommended. For this, and for the implementation of the five pilot projects, the Government was likely to need further technical assistance and the support of external donors. It was recommended that the Government adopt the following pri orities: firstly, the development of national policies and institutions to support cooper ative development; secondly, the earmarking of government funds to each project; and thirdly, the preparation of the technical assistance and investment projects that will be necessary, and their submission to potential donor...|$|R
