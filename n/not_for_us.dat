5|$|During this period, Castillo Armas {{had begun}} to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited {{material}} success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, {{the same day that}} he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that if it were <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.|$|E

25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|Árbenz was {{initially}} confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory {{of a small}} garrison of 30 soldiers over the 180-strong rebel force outside Zacapa strengthened his belief. However, the CIA's psychological warfare made the army unwilling to fight Castillo Armas. Gleijeses stated {{that if it were}} <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>US</b> support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the US would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win. On 17June the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, known as the Pacto de Las Tunas, three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, [...] "despondent, with a terrible sense of defeat".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, apostle Spencer W. Kimball began preaching against racism. In 1972, he said: [...] "Intolerance by church members is despicable. A special problem exists {{with respect to}} black people because they may not now receive the priesthood. Some members of the Church would justify their own un-Christian {{discrimination}} against black people because of that rule {{with respect to the}} priesthood, but while this restriction has been imposed by the Lord, it is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to add burdens upon the shoulders of our black brethren. They who have received Christ in faith through authoritative baptism are heirs to the celestial kingdom along with men of all other races. And those who remain faithful to the end may expect that God may finally grant them all blessings they have merited through their righteousness. Such matters are in the Lord's hands. It is for us to extend our love to all." [...] In a study covering 1972 to 1996, church members in the United States has been shown to have lower rates of approval of segregation than others from the United States, as well as a faster decline in approval of segregation over the periods covered, both with statistical significance.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Arab–Israeli conflict, in a January 2012 Republican debate, Romney said, [...] "Well, {{the reason}} that there’s not peace between the Palestinians and Israel is because there is — in the {{leadership}} of the Palestinian people are Hamas and others who think like Hamas, who have as their intent the elimination of Israel. And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state." [...] Romney added, [...] "There are some people who say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel." [...] Despite his pessimism about a two-state solution being achieved in the short term, Romney has defended the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict as an ideal that ought {{to be included in the}} Republican Party platform.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 8 {{contains}} {{references to}} and quotes {{from many of}} the works Blake was exposed to and influenced by at a young age. These references include allusions to Saint Jerome, John Taylor's Urania, or his Heavenly Muse (1630), Abraham Cowley's translation of Anacreon's lyric poem [...] "The Grasshopper" [...] (1656), Henry Wotton's Reliquae Wottonianae (1685), John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Joseph Addison's Cato, a Tragedy (1712), Edward Young's Night-Thoughts (1742) and James Hervey's Meditations and Contemplations (1746) and Theron and Aspasio (1755). The Jerome reference is found in Steelyard's comment [...] "Says Jerome happiness is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> poor crawling reptiles of the earth Talk of happiness & happiness its no such thing – every person has a something." [...] The Taylor reference is Steelyard’s poem; [...] "Hear then the pride & knowledge of a Sailor/His sprit sail fore sail main sail & his mizen/A poor frail man god wot I know none frailer/I know no greater sinner than John Taylor." [...] Although Alicia Ostriker feels this is a reference to the preacher John Taylor, David Erdman argues that the lines closely parallel the opening of the poem Urania , and as such, the reference is more likely to the poet than the preacher. The Cowley reference is found in the poem [...] "Phebe drest like beauties Queen", which contains the lines [...] "Happy people who can be/In happiness compard with ye." [...] Erdman believes this to be derived from the lines in Cowley's translation of Anacreon, [...] "Happy Insect! What can be/In Happiness compar'd to thee?" [...] The Wotton reference is found in Steelyard's [...] "My crop of corn is but a field of tares;" [...] John Sampson believes this to be reference to the Chidiock Tichborne poem [...] "Elegy" [...] (1586), which Blake could have been familiar with from Wotton's Reliquae. Locke is mentioned when Scopprell picks up one of Steelyard's books and reads the cover, [...] "An Easy of Huming Understanding by John Lookye Gent." [...] Addison is referred to indirectly when Steelyard attributes the quote [...] "the wreck of matter & the crush of worlds" [...] to Edward Young, when it is actually from Addison's Cato. Both the reference to Young and Hervey's Meditations are found in the opening sentence of the chapter; [...] "Steelyard the Lawgiver, sitting at his table taking extracts from Herveys Meditations among the tombs & Youngs Night thoughts." [...] The Theron reference is found when Steelyard announces to Obtuse Angle that he is reading the book.|$|E
