In line with these requirements, the methodology of using noise modelling and simulation techniques in conjunction with Demographic Distribution Database (D 3) and Digital Terrain Elevation Database (DTED), allows the development of novel approaches and algorithms for aircraft trajectory optimisation {{in the present and}} likely future airspace scenarios and, in particular, in proximity of airports and densely populated areas.

Based on the statuary requirements prescribed, the aircraft trajectories are optimised to minimize the effects of noise around the airports considering both population and digital terrain data. The key mathematical models for noise and trajectory optimisation are presented. The objective of the noise modelling process is to describe the noise parameters currently adopted for airport design and operations, and to predict values for all relevant future scenarios.

40|$|Hazardous <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> {{and hearing}} loss have been {{documented}} among farmers and farm workers for many years. However, {{little is known about}} the <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> during specific agricultural work tasks and their effect on hearing loss. The objective of this dissertation was to assess the effects of specific agricultural tasks on hearing loss and their contribution to total <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> Three studies were conducted to accomplish this objective. The first study examined associations between hearing sensitivity among rural residents (nfarmer = 960, nnon-farmers = 608) and self-reported years of participation in 12 agricultural tasks. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations between agricultural activities and hearing loss 3 ̆e 25 dB. Linear regression analysis was used to examine associations between agricultural tasks and mean decibels of hearing loss. The results indicated farmers have greater hearing loss than non-farmers. However years of participation in specific agricultural tasks was poorly associated with hearing loss. This result suggests that self-reported years engaging in specific agricultural activities may be a poor surrogate for true <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> In the second study <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> (personal dosimetry) and corresponding task data (direct observation) were collected on 18 grain farms, and mean <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> (dBA) were calculated for specific agricultural tasks. <b>Noise</b> <b>exposures</b> ranged from 78. 6 dBA to 99. 0 dBA across all tasks. The <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> for each task varied greatly (large standard deviation and maximum exposure) with most of the variability within the farms. Although specific tasks with intense <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> were identified, most comparisons of mean <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from one task to another were not statistically different and intense exposures were present for nearly all tasks. Therefore, controlling noise only for those tasks with the greatest mean <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> may not completely eliminate hazardous exposures or the hearing loss risk. For the third study, estimates of 8 -hr time-weighted-average (TWA) <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> were calculated using time-at-task observations from one population of farmers and prior dosimeter measured mean task-based <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from an independent population of farmers. Additionally, dosimeter measured daily <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from the independent population of farmers were also analyzed to identify significant determinants of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> Simple linear regression analysis was used to compare estimated and actual dosimeter-measured 8 -hr TWA <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> The <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> determinants were identified by conducting multivariable linear mixed-effects regression analysis on the one-minute noise measurements from the dosimeter measured daily <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> The results indicated the estimated and measured 8 -hr TWA <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> varied considerably. Therefore, the estimates were not considered reliable. Furthermore, task, number of noise sources and work area were found to have a statistically significant association with <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> In summary, hearing loss and <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> among agricultural populations are complex and cannot be completely explained by examining agricultural tasks only. More detailed evaluations of tasks are needed to increase the understanding of hearing loss and <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> in this dynamic work environment...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{aircraft}} <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> {{in children}} {{is associated with}} impairment of reading and long-term memory. Most studies have not differentiated between day or nighttime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> It has been hypothesized that sleep disturbance might mediate the association of aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and cognitive impairment in children. This study involves secondary analysis of data from the Munich Study and the UK Road Traffic and Aircraft <b>Noise</b> <b>Exposure</b> and Children′s Cognition and Health (RANCH) Study sample to test this. In the Munich study, 330 children were assessed on cognitive measures in three measurement waves a year apart, {{before and after the}} switchover of airports. Self-reports of sleep quality were analyzed across airports, aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and measurement wave to test whether changes in nighttime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> had any effect on reported sleep quality, and whether this showed the same pattern as for changes in cognitive performance. For the UK sample of the RANCH study, night noise contour information was linked to the children′s home and related to sleep disturbance and cognitive performance. In the Munich study, analysis of sleep quality questions showed no consistent interactions between airport, noise, and measurement wave, suggesting that poor sleep quality does not mediate the association between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and cognition. Daytime and nighttime aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was highly correlated in the RANCH study. Although night <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was significantly associated with impaired reading and recognition memory, once home night <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was centered on daytime school <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> night <b>noise</b> had no additional effect to daytime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> These analyses took advantage of secondary data available from two studies of aircraft noise and cognition. They were not initially designed to examine sleep disturbance and cognition, and thus, there are methodological limitations which make it less than ideal in giving definitive answers to these questions. In conclusion, results from both studies suggest that night aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> does not appear to add any cognitive performance decrement to the cognitive decrement induced by daytime aircraft noise alone. We suggest that the school should be the main focus of attention for protection of children against the effects of aircraft noise on school performance...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> is associated with blood pressure changes and ischemic heart disease risk, but epidemiologic evidence is still limited.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 43 epidemiologic studies published between 1970 and 1999 that investigate the relation between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (both occupational and community) and blood pressure and/or ischemic heart disease (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 410 – 414). We studied a wide range of effects, from blood pressure changes to a myocardial infarction. With respect to the association between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and blood pressure, small blood pressure differences were evident. Our meta-analysis showed a significant association for both occupational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and air traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and hypertension: We estimated relative risks per 5 dB(A) noise increase of 1. 14 (1. 01 – 1. 29) and 1. 26 (1. 14 – 1. 39), respectively. Air traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was positively associated with the consultation of a general practitioner or specialist, the use of cardiovascular medicines, and angina pectoris. In cross-sectional studies, road traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> increases the risk of myocardial infarction and total ischemic heart disease. Although we can conclude that <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> can contribute to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, the evidence for a relation between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and ischemic heart disease is still inconclusive because of the limitations in exposure characterization, adjustment for important confounders, and the occurrence of publication bias.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{existence}} of an association between child blood pressure (BP) and exposure to domestic jet aircraft noise in the context of the construction of a new parallel north-south runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The baseline study was commissioned and funded by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), with measurements conducted in 1994 and 1995. A follow-up longitudinal component to the study was subsequently commissioned and funded by the FAC in 1997, and measurements conducted in the same year. As the same individuals were measured and re-measured over changing conditions of <b>exposure</b> to aircraft <b>noise,</b> the quasiexperimental nature of the study allowed inferences to be made regarding <b>exposure</b> to aircraft <b>noise</b> and child BP. The main hypotheses for testing were that BP, and within-subject longitudinal changes in BP, are positively related to domestic jet aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and longitudinal changes in domestic jet aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> respectively. Subsidiary hypotheses tested for evidence of short- and long-term BP adaptation effects where BPs were related to prior changes to aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> A sample of 75 primary schools within a 20 km radius of Sydney Airport under various <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> conditions, both existing and those projected with the advent of the new runway, participated in the study. The baseline cohort comprised 1, 230 Year 3 / 4 children attending the schools in 1994 and 1995, and the follow-up participants comprised 628 of the original baseline sample re-measured in 1997. Study participants were enrolled by active parental consent. The baseline response rate was approximately 40 % of children in the participating schools. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure readings of the children were taken using automated BP measuring equipment along with anthropometric measurements (heights, weights, skinfold thicknesses and waist measurements). Parental surveys captured items pertaining to the child�s ethnic background as measured by the country of birth of the child and parent(s), residential address and housing structure, child eating habits and activity levels, along with family and child history of high blood pressure. Aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> data were collected by the National Acoustic Laboratories and processed into the energy-averaged noise metric used in Australia for aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> assessment called the Australian <b>Noise</b> <b>Exposure</b> Index (ANEI). Mean exposures for a given calendar month were used in the analysis. ANEI values were geocoded to exact geographic locations using digitised street maps from which values for each house and school address, also geocoded, were interpolated. A child BP measured in a given month was matched to a aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> value both at their school and residential address for that month for analysis. After adjusting for confounding and other factors, the cross-sectional relationship between BP and aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was found to be inconsistent. SBP was nonsignificantly negatively associated with school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at baseline (0. 05 mmHg/ANEI, cluster-sampling-adjusted p> 0. 05), but positively and non-significantly associated with school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at follow-up (0. 05 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05). As for SBP, baseline DBP was significantly negatively related to school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at (0. 09 mmHg/ANEI, p 0. 05). Within-subject BP changes, occurring from baseline to follow-up, regressed on corresponding longitudinal changes in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> produced inconsistent results. SBP change was positively and non-significantly (0. 027 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05) associated with corresponding school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> change, while SBP change was negatively associated total aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> change (statistically nonsignificant, 0. 06 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05). DBP changes were similarly and nonsignificantly related to corresponding aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> changes. Some evidence for short-term BP adaptation to recent changes in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was found. Consistent negative associations between systolic and diastolic BP and recent changes in school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> were found. This association was statistically significant at study baseline (SBP: 0. 19 mmHg/ANEI, p 0. 05). In the presence of inconsistent cross-sectional BP-aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> associations, this finding is consistent with evidence of a homoeostatic BP response to recent changes in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> where resting BP returns to pre-existing levels unrelated to aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> The public health implication of this finding appears to be benign...|$|R

40|$|Several {{case reports}} {{suggest that some}} {{individuals}} are susceptible to hearing loss from opioids. A combination of <b>noise</b> and opium <b>exposure</b> is possible in either occupational setting such as military service or recreational settings. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency of the U. S. Department of Justice, prescriptions for opiate-based drugs have skyrocketed in the past decade. Since both opium and noise independently can cause hearing loss, {{it is important to}} know the prevalence of hearing loss among individuals who are exposed to opium or both opium and noise. The purpose of this research was to evaluate auditory sensitivity in individuals with a history of opium abuse and/or occupational or nonoccupational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> Twenty-three men who reported opiate abuse served as participants in the study. Four of the individuals reported no history of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> 12 reported hobby-related <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> 7 reported occupational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> including 2 who also reported hobby-related <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> Fifty percent (2 / 4) of the individuals without any <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> had a hearing loss confirming previous reports that some of the population is vulnerable to the ototoxic effects of opioids. The percentage of population with hearing loss increased with hobby-related (58 %) and occupational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (100 %). Mixed MANOVA revealed a significant ear, frequency, and <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> interaction. Health professionals need to be aware of the possible ototoxic effects of opioids, since early detection of hearing loss from opium abuse may lead to cessation of abuse and further progression of hearing loss. The possibility that opium abuse may interact with <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> in determining auditory thresholds needs to be considered in noise exposed individuals who are addicted to opiates. Possible mechanisms of cochlear damage from opium abuse, possible reasons for individual susceptibility, and recommendations for future studies are presented in the article...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Conclusions {{that can}} be drawn from earlier studies on noise and children's blood {{pressure}} are limited due to inconsistent results, methodological problems, and the focus on school <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of aircraft and road traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on children's blood pressure and heart rate. METHODS: Participants were 1283 children (age 9 - 11 years) attending 62 primary schools around two European airports. Data were pooled and analysed using multilevel modelling. Adjustments were made for a range of socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: After pooling the data, aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at school was related to a statistically non-significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at home was related to a statistically significant increase in blood pressure. Aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> during the night at home was positively and significantly associated with blood pressure. The findings differed between the Dutch and British samples. Negative associations were found between road traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and blood pressure, which cannot be explained.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} acoustic injury on the cochlea by assessing auditory brain-stem response (ABR) threshold shifts, outer hair cells, {{and the number of}} synaptic ribbons before and after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> The ABR threshold was elevated immediately after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> but recovered over time; 14 days after noise exposure,the ABR threshold was approximately 15 dB higher than before exposure. There were few damaged outer hair cells. The number of synapses directly under inner hair cells markedly decreased immediately after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> but then exhibited early signs of recovery. Twenty-four hours after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> the number of synapses was higher than before exposure. Subsequently, synapse number decreased.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the effect of Carbogen (95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2), 5 % CO 2 /air, and 100 % oxygen on cochlear threshold shifts caused by noise was undertaken. Five groups of eight pigmented guinea pigs were exposed to 105 dB broad band noise for 6 h per day for five consecutive days with each group receiving the various gaseous mixtures either during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> or for 1 h immediately after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> A control group received the same <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> but respired air. Auditory threshold shifts, {{as measured by the}} auditory evoked brainstem response, were measured at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 kHz. Recordings were taken pre-exposure and at Day 1, 3, 5, and Weeks 2 and 3 after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> Carbogen, given during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> resulted in a trend toward less post <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> threshold shift (as compared to controls) which reached statistical significance by Week 3 at all frequencies except 2 and 20 kHz. Subjects given Carbogen after exposure also showed a general trend toward decreased noise induced threshold shifts, as compared to controls, but this was not statistically significant. The mixture of 5 % CO 2 /air given during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> yielded no difference in threshold shifts as compared to controls. When 100 % oxygen was administered during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> a marked decrease in noise induced threshold shifts could be seen as compared to controls, with differences reaching statistical significance by day 5 at most frequencies. These results indicate that oxygen (i. e. cochlear-oxygenation) is a more important factor than CO 2 (i. e., as a vasodilator) in protection of the cochlea from noise induced damage...|$|R
40|$|Background. Due to {{concerns}} regarding {{safety and health}} in the work environment of the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN), a questionnaire-based survey was conducted (2002 – 2003) to assess work-related risk factors and health problems among Navy personnel. Results from this questionnaire study showed <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> as an important risk factor, and impaired hearing as an important health problem among Navy personnel. Also foreign navy studies point at <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> as a prevalent risk factor and hearing loss as a common health complaint among navy personnel. However, the literature concerning <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and hearing loss in the navy is sparse and the issue has not been systematically investigated. The RNoN has experienced several accidents at sea. These accidents {{have been found to}} be associated with cognitive requirements regarding navigational task performance. Prior literature has indicated deleterious effects of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on cognitive performance. Thus, an association between RNoN navigation accidents and impaired cognitive performance due to <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> has been questioned. However, research on <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and cognitive performance in naval and maritime settings is limited and shows contradicting results. Objectives. The main objective of this thesis was to gain more knowledge regarding the effects of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> among navy personnel. The specific objectives of paper I were to assess the prevalence of hearing loss among Navy personnel and to examine the association between work on board vessels in the RNoN and hearing loss among Navy personnel. In paper II we aimed at investigating the incidence of significant threshold shift (STS) among Navy personnel between 2012 and 2014 and to identify determinants of STS among Navy personnel. The objective of paper III was to assess cognitive performance subsequent to <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> among Navy personnel on board RNoN vessels. Material and methods. 938 officers, enlisted and civilian Navy personnel from 48 vessels were invited to participate in a study on the relationship between noise and hearing loss. The study was conducted between 2012 and 2014 and comprised two examinations per person, i. e. at baseline and follow-up. Two separate questionnaires on <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and health were prepared, one for each examination. Hearing was assessed by pure tone audiometry. At baseline, hearing loss was defined as hearing thresholds ≥ 25 dB in either ear at 3000, 4000 or 6000 Hz. At follow up, impaired hearing was defined as a STS, i. e. an average change in hearing thresholds between the two examinations ≥ + 10 dB at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz in either ear. Two to five Navy personnel on board 24 RNoN vessels were selected to participate in a study on the effects of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on cognitive performance. <b>Noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was assessed by personal noise dosimeter measurements, while cognitive performance was evaluated by using a visual attention test in which response time (RT) was measured. In order to assess possible confounding factors, the participants completed a log book. Results. The prevalence of hearing loss among Navy personnel at baseline was 31. 4 %. Work on board RNoN vessels was significantly associated with reduced hearing after adjusting for age, gender and otitis as an adult. The incidence of STS from baseline to follow-up was 23. 0 %. The <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> determinants ‘current <b>exposure</b> to loud <b>noise</b> > 15 hours/week during work on board’ and ‘number of gun shots during the last year’ were significantly associated with a higher risk of STS. A significantly increased RT was found among participants with the highest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (> 85. 2 dB(A)) and the next highest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (77. 1 – 85. 2 dB(A)) compared to participants with the lowest exposure ( 15 hours/week on board RNoN vessels. We also found a significant association between STS and number of gun shots during the last year. The Navy personnel with the highest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> performed poorer on a cognitive performance test than personnel with the lowest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> It is likely that <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on RNoN vessels causes hearing loss and affects cognitive performance among the Navy personnel on board...|$|R
