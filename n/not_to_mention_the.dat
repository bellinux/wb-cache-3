5|$|Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) offer Pembleton (Andre Braugher) a {{promotion}} to lieutenant and the vacant shift commander position working alongside Gee (Yaphet Kotto). Pembleton asks for {{time to consider}} it, and the duo ask him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> offer to Gee. Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the discussion was nothing. After discussing the offer with his wife Mary (Ami Brabson), Pembleton decides {{not to take the}} job and confesses to Gee, who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him sooner. The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which he seldom does.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led {{to a loss of}} nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express {{was a special}} target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.|$|E

5|$|The exact terms {{by which}} Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The {{existence}} of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> occupation of {{a part of his}} country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> {{millions of}} dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|With {{financial}} success came more clients {{and opportunities to}} serve his community. Tucker received many cases in debt collection, and he was appointed trustee of the Lynchburg Female Academy and vestryman at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. Tucker was also elected {{to serve in the}} United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825, representing the Lynchburg area in the 16th, 17th, and 18th United States Congresses. His financial largess was short-lived, as Tucker was unable to resist the allure of society and lavish living in Washington, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> increased expenses of a larger immediate family.|$|E
50|$|In a third dissent, Justice Holmes {{noted that}} it was within the power of Congress to abolish the {{position}} of Postmaster entirely, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> set <b>the</b> position's pay and duties, {{and he had no}} problem believing Congress also {{ought to be able to}} set terms of the position's occupiers.|$|R

5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time}} in casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these literary sources, various film scholars have suggested that Méliès was heavily influenced by other works, especially Jacques Offenbach's operetta Le voyage dans la lune (an unauthorized parody of Verne's novels) and the A Trip to the Moon attraction at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The French film historian Thierry Lefebvre hypothesizes that Méliès drew upon both of these works, but in different ways: {{he appears to have}} taken the structure of the film—"a trip to the moon, a moon landing, an encounter with extraterrestrials with a deformity, an underground trek, an interview with the Man in the Moon, and a brutal return to reality back on earth"—directly from the 1901 attraction, but also incorporated many plot elements (including the presence of six astronomers with pseudo-scientific names, telescopes that transform into stools, a moonshot cannon mounted above ground, a scene in which the moon appears to approach the viewer, a lunar snowstorm, an earthrise scene, and umbrella-wielding travelers), <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> parodic tone of the film, from the Offenbach operetta.|$|E
50|$|The {{passive voice}} {{can be used}} without {{referring}} to the agent of an action; it may therefore be used when the agent is unknown or unimportant, or the speaker does <b>not</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> agent.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was for a}} reason. I did <b>not</b> want <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> name of {{the person}} who was {{actually}} in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the same position, so I used her name instead." ...|$|R

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the age of fusion–evaporation reactions to produce superheavy elements {{is coming to an end}} due to the increasingly short half-lives to spontaneous fission and the looming proton drip line, so that new techniques such as nuclear transfer reactions (for example, firing uranium nuclei at each other and letting them exchange protons, potentially producing products with around 120 protons) would be required to reach the superactinides. On the other hand, many changes in techniques have been needed to synthesise transuranium elements, from neutron capture (until Z = 100) to light-ion bombardment (until Z = 110) to cold fusion (until Z = 113) and now hot fusion with 48Ca (until Z = 118), <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> essential difference before and after uranium between finding the elements chemically or spectroscopically in nature and synthesising them. In spite of this, the rate of discovery of new elements has remained at one every two and a half years on average for the past two and a half centuries.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since {{it did not matter}} where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E

25|$|Since {{its first}} {{occupancy}} in 1869, the Istana has seen 21 terms of governorship (1869–1958), two terms of occupation by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (1959–1965) and six terms of presidential occupation (since 1965), <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Japanese occupancy between 1942 and 1945.|$|E

60|$|Uncle John and Arthur decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girls this astounding {{charge of}} Isidore Le Drieux, fearing the news {{would make them}} nervous and disturb their rest, so when the men joined the merry party in the alcove they did <b>not</b> refer <b>to</b> their late interview.|$|R
25|$|David Berkeley's live concerts, {{both those}} with a full band and the solo ones (<b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> dates {{in which he has}} {{performed}} in duo with Jordan Katz), have been praised for their gentleness and richness. Between songs he uses to tell short anecdotes usually extremely funny, witty and erudite.|$|E
25|$|Although {{volunteer}} militiamen {{were paid}} 8s per day, an unmarried private in the AIF was paid 5s {{per day in}} Australia, with an extra 2s per day after embarkation for overseas.
