40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
