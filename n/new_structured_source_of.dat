40|$|IMER, the Institute for Missiological and Ecumenical Research, was {{initiated}} in 1979, when the 20 th century missionary {{movement in the}} Dutch Reformed Church had already started to unravel. IMER’s history gives us insight into these events. IMER {{has focused on the}} missionary calling of the church and on guiding the church in its broad responsibility to Southern African society. IMER conducted a comprehensive study on the unfinished task in the eighties, from which a variety of other projects followed. The understanding of the task of mission has gradually broadened to include the church’s responsibility to the whole of life, with faith in Christ at the centre. However, as funding for the missionary movement diminished and the university had to cut down on expenses, funding for IMER dried up. IMER is now in the same position as mission itself, and even many congregations: it has to be innovative and find <b>new</b> <b>structures</b> and <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> funding to respond to the challenges of a new century.  </p...|$|R

Firms {{may choose to}} specialize on few production activities or alternatively may build expertise in many activities. There is an accompanying decision when firms sell their products: whether to serve few or many markets. We argue that the location on the specialization-diversification spectrum significantly affects how firms manage innovation. For a sample of 90 innovator ICT firms in Ankara we find that cooperation <b>structure,</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> innovation and funding of R&D display statistically significant different patterns according to the specialization-diversification taxonomy. ...|$|R

In this study, we use a numerical approach to investigate the propagation of nonlinear waves of finite deformation in polymeric structures of finite size. Insights on the dispersion properties of such systems, and their functional dependence on the strain levels, are obtained by postprocessing the time-history results obtained through time-domain simulations. In particular, we highlight the nonlinear effects of amplitude parameters on the bandgaps and wave directionality of the considered systems...|$|R

In this article we introduce a novel method to extract logical schemas from text-based collections of biomedical information. Non-structured sources equipped with a logical schema can be regarded as regular <b>structured</b> <b>sources,</b> and thus can be bridged together using the methods and tools provided by ONTOFUSION. To test the validity of this approach, we carried out an experiment with a set of five cancer databases...|$|R

The analysis of new firm formation distribution dynamics suggests that whatever changes may arise in the external shape of distribution are not significant and intra-distribution mobility is limited. ...|$|R

Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.

Class hierarchies are meant to represent <b>structures</b> used in <b>source</b> code that evolve fairly slowly (typically monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet {{and are expected to}} be evolving almost constantly.
