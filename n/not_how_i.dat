500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} execution of John Albert Taylor in 1996 (or Ronnie Lee Gardner {{that would follow}} in 2010), Parsons' execution attracted little media attention, with representatives from only 12 news organizations. Spokesperson Jack Ford called the level of interest virtually [...] "nonexistent". Deputy attorney general Reed Richards presumed that the media apathy {{was a result of}} Parsons' choice of lethal injection, which was more broadly adopted in the United States than execution by firing squad, which was unique to Utah. Parsons' court-appointed attorney Greg Sanders said that his client called himself [...] "Utah's forgotten inmate". Ernest's widow Beverley, who attended the execution, said that she was grateful for the lack of media scrutiny. Ernest's brother-in-law Jonathan Woods stated, [...] "The world is less for having lost Richard. I hope, for Parsons' sake, the world will be less for having lost him, but that is <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel." ...|$|E
500|$|One such {{relationship}} was between Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709: [...] "Nobody was so entirely, so faithfully yours ... I {{put in your}} lovers, for I don't allow {{it possible for a}} man to be so sincere as I am." [...] Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who was the subject of many of Seward's sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward's protest, Seward's poems became angry. However, Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd's beauty and their affection and friendship. As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, [...] "The roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:—You know <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> love her." [...] Wollstonecraft's first novel , in part, addressed her relationship with Fanny Blood.|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E

500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while this is <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, the British National Party, a far-right and anti-immigration {{political}} party, {{claimed that}} Minogue supported their cause following comments {{she had made}} {{in an interview with}} Britain's GQ. In the interview, Minogue was quoted saying that French National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen had [...] "struck a chord with people", and that [...] "even the street signs [...] are written in Asian". Minogue responded to the British National Party's claims in Gay Times magazine saying, [...] "I am not a racist. That is <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> live my life. I have a Jewish manager, I perform in gay clubs, I come from a multicultural background and I am very proud of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the paper's co-authors, {{paleontologist}} Philip D. Gingerich, expressed {{dissatisfaction with}} the media campaign, telling The Wall Street Journal that they had chosen to publish in PLoS ONE as [...] "There was a TV company involved and time pressure" [...] {{and they had been}} pushed to finish the study. [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> like to do science", Gingerich concluded. In an interview, Jørn Hurum said that PLoS ONE had been chosen as it was open access and the research had been funded by Norwegian taxpayers who would benefit from free access, it did not restrict the length of manuscript or number of illustrations, and [...] "PLoS ONE is the quickest way to publish a large work in the world!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bloom has {{appeared}} in numerous roles on television such as her portrayal of Lady Marchmain in Brideshead Revisited (1981). In 1996, she wrote, [...] "I still find it puzzling when I am told I played a manipulative and heartless woman; that is <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> saw her. Lady Marchmain is deeply religious, and her dilemma includes trying to raise a willful brood of children on her own, while instilling them with her rigid observance of the Catholic code. Sebastian is both an alcoholic and a homosexual, and from her point of view, {{he lives in a}} state of mortal sin. She has to fight for his soul by any means in her power, with the knowledge that her efforts may lead to his destruction. A born crusader, the Marchioness confronts her difficult choices head on; her rigidity of purpose, which I don't in any way share, is understandable in context. The aspect that rings most true is her sense of being an outsider, a Catholic in Protestant England. Not such a leap from being a Jew in Protestant England as one would imagine." ...|$|E
