25|$|A {{series of}} radical {{physical}} therapies {{were developed in}} central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg's malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (or neurosyphilis) first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927. This treatment heralded {{the beginning of a}} radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum-based culture of therapeutic nihilism in the treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, most particularly dementia praecox (increasingly known as schizophrenia from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as hereditary degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention. Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by barbiturate induced deep sleep therapy to treat dementia praecox, which was popularised by the Swiss psychiatrist Jakob Klaesi. In 1933 the Vienna-based psychiatrist Manfred Sakel introduced insulin shock therapy and in August 1934 Ladislas J. Meduna, a Hungarian <b>neuropathologist</b> and psychiatrist working in Budapest, introduced cardiazol shock therapy (cardiazol is the tradename of the chemical compound pentylenetetrazol, known by the tradename metrazol in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a psychiatric disorder. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing dementia praecox. Cardiazol shock therapy, founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between schizophrenia and epilepsy and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist Ugo Cerletti in 1938.|$|E

500|$|After her death, Schiavo's {{body was}} taken to the Office of the District 6 Medical Examiner for Pinellas and Pasco counties, based in Largo, Florida. The autopsy {{occurred}} on April 1, 2005. It revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as [...] "undetermined". The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin, M.D. In addition to consultation with a <b>neuropathologist</b> (Stephen J. Nelson, M.D.), Dr. Thogmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo's nervous system by <b>neuropathologist</b> Stephen J. Nelson, M.D., revealed extensive injury. The brain itself weighed only , only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the midbrain. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal neurons that comprise some 70% of cortical cells – critical to the functioning of the cortex – were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen {{from the front of the}} cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) – another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, [...] "irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Neuropathology is {{the study}} of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either {{surgical}} biopsies or sometimes whole brains in the case of autopsy. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. [...] In many English-speaking countries, neuropathology is considered a subfield of anatomical pathology. [...] A physician who specializes in neuropathology, usually by completing a fellowship after a residency in anatomical or general pathology, is called a <b>neuropathologist.</b> In day-to-day clinical practice, a <b>neuropathologist</b> is a consultant for other physicians. If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a biopsy [...] of nervous tissue is taken from the brain or spinal cord to aid in diagnosis. [...] Biopsy is usually requested after a mass is detected by medical imaging. With autopsies, the principal work of the <b>neuropathologist</b> is to help in the post-mortem diagnosis of various conditions that affect the central nervous system. [...] Biopsies can also consist of the skin. Epidermal nerve fiber density testing (ENFD) is a more recently developed neuropathology test in which a punch skin biopsy is taken to identify small fiber neuropathies by analyzing the nerve fibers of the skin. This test is becoming available in select labs as well as many universities; it replaces the traditional nerve biopsy test as less invasive.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{microscopic}} clumps called Nissl substance (or Nissl bodies) {{are seen}} when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic ("base-loving") dye.

Named after German psychiatrist and <b>neuropathologist</b> Franz Nissl (1860–1919), {{they are involved in}} protein synthesis and their prominence {{can be explained by the}} fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) haematoxylin [...] highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA.|$|E
