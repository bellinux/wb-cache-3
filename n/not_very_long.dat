25|$|The Countach was {{styled by}} Marcello Gandini of the Bertone design studio, the same {{designer}} and studio that designed the Miura. Gandini {{was then a}} young, inexperienced designer— not very experienced in the practical, ergonomic aspects of automobile design, {{but at the same}} time unhindered by them. Gandini again produced another striking design. The Countach shape was wide and low (74.28 inches in width and 42.05 inches in height), but <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> (162.7 in length). Its angular and wedge-shaped body was made almost entirely of flat, trapezoidal panels.|$|E
25|$|The hamster tail can be {{difficult}} to see, as it is usually <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> (about 1/6 the length of the body), {{with the exception of the}} Chinese hamster, which has a tail the same length as the body. One rodent characteristic that can be highly visible in hamsters is their sharp incisors; they have an upper pair and lower pair which grow continuously throughout life, so must be regularly worn down. Hamsters are very flexible, but their bones are somewhat fragile. They are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold.|$|E

25|$|Genetic studies led by John Doebley {{identified}} Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, {{native to}} the Balsas River valley in Mexico's southwestern highlands, and also known as Balsas teosinte, as being the crop wild relative teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize. This has been confirmed by further more recent studies, which refined this hypothesis somewhat. Archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the middle part of the Balsas River valley as the more likely location of early domestication; this river is <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long,</b> so these locations are not very distant. Stone milling tools with maize residue {{have been found in}} an 8,700-years old layer of deposits in a cave not far from Iguala, Guerrero.|$|E
25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the wreckage, the debris was gathered into piles. The matter of bringing the remains of the lost soldiers out from the scene for burial in Ottawa was discussed at length between military authorities, and {{in the end it was}} decided that they should remain in place due to the impossibility of identifying all of them. In the afternoon of the 3rd of July 1946, friends and family of the crew and passengers along with many members of the RCAF and religious authorities climbed the mountain to pay their respects to the dead and hold a funeral. Three religious services were held on that afternoon: Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. A plaque displaying the names of the victims was installed on the rock at the foot of which the remains were buried. For several years, the site would be maintained by local men paid on a small budget given by the Canadian Forces.|$|E
500|$|In December 1901, the MCC {{approved}} the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet {{to discuss the}} fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned {{for at least a}} season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack {{in the interests of the}} spirit of cricket. In the 1902 Wisden, Sydney Pardon wrote: [...] "Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as to make it clear that, if the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> ago it seemed impossible to get rid." [...] After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to be an issue in English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} runestones {{where it is}} {{declared}} that they were originally painted.

Sometimes, the original colours have been preserved unusually well, and especially if the runestones were used as construction material in churches <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> after they had been made. One runestone in the church of Köping on Öland was discovered to be painted all over, and the colour of the words was alternating between black and red.|$|E

[...] <b>Not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> after the assassination, Coretta took his place at a peace rally in New York City.

Coretta approached the African-American entertainer and activist Josephine Baker to take her husband's place as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. Baker declined after thinking it over, stating that her twelve adopted children (known as the [...] "rainbow tribe") were [...] "...too young to lose their mother". Shortly after that Mrs. King decided to take the helm of the movement herself.|$|E

2500|$|The interim SS12 was {{replaced}} by the [...] "full scale" [...] 550cc SS20 version presented on 27 October 1977, with a slight facelift consisting of a new grille, redesigned cladding around the C-pillars, and a new dashboard. The SS20 is equipped with the T5A engine (first seen in the Jimny), with 539cc it offered [...] at 5000rpm and 5.3kgm at 3000rpm, which helped bring top speed up from 105 to 110km/h (65 to 68mph). To use up leftover four-stroke engines, the SS11 received the same facelift, becoming the SS11-2. The SS11-2 was fairly short-lived, though, as the T5A engine met emissions regulations on its own and Suzuki was now able to terminate their contract with Toyota. The torque gap between the four- and the two-stroke models was widened further: while the SS11 could climb a slope of 0.34 tanα (18.8˚) the SS20 could manage 0.52 tanα (27.5˚). The production run of the SS20 was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> either, coming to an end after just over a year and a half.|$|E
