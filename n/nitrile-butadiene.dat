40|$|Abstract — Fatigue {{behaviour}} {{of rubber}} {{is a very}} important characteristic due to its extensive use in many engineering applications. In most applications, rubber is commonly subjected to fluctuating loads, which often lead to failure due to the nucleation and growth of defects or cracks. Due to their viscoelastic behavior, rubbers have a high damping ability. Very often rubbers are subjected to different frequencies in the service, such as engine mounts. The effect of frequency on the fatigue lifetime needs deep investigations. In present work, the effect of frequency on the styrene butadiene (SBR) and <b>nitrile-butadiene</b> rubber (NBR) with 0, 20, 30, 50 and 70 Phr of carbon black was investigated.

The first fiber was only decorated by the micron-sized grooves on the surface, and the second fiber was dotted by both the micron-sized grooves and nanometer-sized spheres on the surface, while the third fiber was helical and with a concave–convex surface. The biomimetic preparation mainly consisted of four steps, and the formation mechanism was described as an integrated mechanism of diffusion, coagulation, self assembly, and microphase separation. The micro/nano structures on the fibers were controlled by changing the mass ratio of UFPNBR to TPU and environment of vertical stretching.

Twelve different combinations of MFC and rubber nanoparticles were tested. Their influences on the quasi-static mechanical properties of the composites were measured performing tensile and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests.

On the other hand, the Young’s modulus can be considered unaffected. The SEM images showed that the matrix deformability became evident with increasing the MFC and NBR contents.

The liquid component consists of 90 % of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 10 % ethylene glycol dimethacryate (EGDMA as the crosslinking agent).

While slurry-based fabrication processes using polymeric binders and solvents are inevitable to produce sheet-type electrodes, these processes for ASLBs have been overlooked until now.

40|$|Poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene) or <b>nitrile-butadiene</b> rubber (NBR) is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} O-ring material in the oil extraction industry due to its excellent chemical properties and resistance to oil. However, degradation of NBR gaskets is known to occur during the well completion and oil extraction process where packers are exposed to completion fluids such as ZnBr 2 brine. Under these conditions NBR exhibits accelerated chemical degradation resulting in embrittlement and cracking. Samples of NBR, poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) and poly(butadiene) (PB) {{have been exposed to}} ZnBr 2 based completion fluid, and analyzed by ATR and diffuse reflectance IR. Analysis shows the ZnBr 2 based completion fluid promotes hydrolysis of the nitrile group to form amides and carboxylic groups. Analysis also shows that carbon-carbon double bonds in NBR are unaffected after short exposure to zinc bromide based completion fluid, but are quickly hydrolyzed in acidic bromide mixtures. Although fluoropolymers have excellent chemical resistance, their strength is less than nitrile rubber and replacing the usual gasket materials with fluoroelastomers is expensive. However, a fluoropolymer surface on a nitrile elastomer can provide the needed chemical resistance while retaining their strength. In this study, we have shown that this can be achieved by direct fluorination, a rather easy and inexpensive process. Samples of NBR O-rings have been fluorinated by exposure to F 2 and F 2 /HF mixtures at various temperatures. Fluorination with F 2 produces the desired fluoropolymer layer; however, fluorination by F 2 /HF mixtures gave a smoother fluorinated layer at lower temperatures and shorter times. Fluorinated samples were exposed to ZnBr 2 drilling fluid and solvents. Elemental analysis shows that the fluorinated layer eliminates ZnBr 2 diffusion into the NBR polymeric matrix. It was also found that surface fluorination significantly retards the loss of mechanical properties such as elasticity, tensile strength, toughness and compression set of nitrile rubber when exposed to zinc bromide fluid.

The materials and the structure are the important factors that affect the sealing properties of the packer rubber. Zhu et al. (2017) made comparisons on the mechanical performances and morphology of three kinds of rubber materials (NBR, HNBR and FKM) before and after corrosion experiments, and the results showed that the tensile properties decreased significantly and the hardness also reduced after corrosion. He et al. (2016) investigated hydrogenated <b>nitrile–butadiene</b> rubber (HNBR) with a Rubber Processing Analyzer RPA- 2000 and conducted stress–strain tests in both elongation and compression modes. In order to reflect the applications of packers, all the mechanical properties were tested at both room temperature (RT) and 150  °C. Zeng et al. (2012) carried out tests on AFLAS rubber (a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene) using a HPHT autoclave in harsh environments (60  MPa, 175  °C, test period 7  days and different corrosive gases) and analyzed the changes in properties. Atkinson et al. (2001) and Guo et al. (2011) analyzed the touch stress and pressure in the inner wall of the rubber part with nonlinear finite element analysis and optimized the rubber wall thickness through some advantaged plans to bear much stronger stress. Ma et al.

Polonsky and Tyurin (2015) came up with a new structure design for packers after discussing several designs aiming at enhancing sealing reliability and considering the packers’ working conditions.

40|$|Commodity and specialty-grade rubbers, such as styrene-butadiene (SBR) or <b>nitrile-butadiene</b> (NBR), are industrially {{produced}} in large trains of continuous reactors using an emulsion polymerization process. Both SBR and NBR systems are largely unstudied. Furthermore, {{the studies that}} have been published on NBR have been typically limited to issues concerning the characteristics of the product behaviour (i. e. oil/fuel resistance, tensile strength, hardness, compression set). In this work a detailed mathematical model has been developed in order to simulate the industrial production of NBR via emulsion copolymerization of acrylonitrile (AN) and butadiene (Bd) in batch, continuous and trains of continuous reactors. Model predictions include monomer conversion, polymerization rate, copolymer composition, number- and weight-average molecular weights, tri- and tetra-functional branching frequencies, and the number and average size of polymer latex particles. NBR is typically produced at low temperatures (5 to 10 degrees C) using a redox initiation system to generate free radicals. The system is typically composed of three phases, water, polymer particles, and monomer. Surfactants and electrolytes are used to stabilize the particle and monomer phases as polymerization proceeds. Of particular industrial importance, in today's world of tailor-made products, is detailed control over the polymerization reaction. Such control requires a deep understanding of the influence of various reactant feed rates and reactor operating conditions on the process response. In particular, policies to minimize copolymer composition drift and to control molecular weight, polydispersity and chain branching at desirable levels. The model is cast in a dynamic form using ordinary differential equations to describe the change of each species, the average number of particles, total average polymer volume, and the first three leading moments of the molecular weight distribution. With a multiphase system it is necessary to determine the concentration of each component in each phase. For this, a constant partition coefficient approach was adopted, as opposed to a purely thermodynamic approach. Particle generation was modelled considering both micellar and homogeneous mechanisms. Model parameters were obtained from the open literature or arrived at after sensitivity analysis. Simulations starting the reactors full of water, feeding all ingredients to the first reactor and using an average residence time of 60 minutes revealed considerable copolymer drift starting in the forth reactor (33 % conversion), and heightened molecular weights and chain branching once the monomer phase disappeared (50 % conversion). Further simulations revealed that both copolymer drift and the growth of molecular weight and branching could be controlled through additional feed streams of AN and chain transfer agent to downstream reactors. Furthermore, polymer productivity could be increased by appropriately splitting the total monomer feed between the first couple of reactors in the train...|$|E

This effort lead to {{the development of}} the Next Generation Solvent (NGS) with Tris (3, 7 -dimethyl octyl) guanidine (TiDG). The first deployment target for the NGS solvent is within the Modular CSSX Unit (MCU). Deployment of a new chemical within an existing facility requires verification that the new chemical components are compatible with the installed equipment. In the instance of a new organic solvent, the primary focus is on compatibility of the solvent with organic polymers used in the affected facility. This report provides the calculated data from exposing these polymers to the Next Generation Solvent. An assessment of the dimensional stability of polymers known to be used or present in the MCU, Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), and Saltstone facilities that will be exposed to the NGS showed that TiDG could selectively affect the elastomers and some thermoplastics to varying extents, but the typical use of these polymers in a confined geometry will likely prevent the NGS from impacting component performance. The polymers identified as of primary concern include Grafoil® (flexible graphite), Tefzel®, Isolast®, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) rubber, <b>nitrile-butadiene</b> rubber (NBR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), and fluorocarbon rubber (FKM). Certain polymers like NBR and EPDM were found to interact mildly with NGS but their calculated swelling and the confined geometry will impede interaction with NGS. In addition, it was found that Vellumoid (cellulose fibers-reinforced glycerin and protein) may leach protein and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) may leach plasticizer (such as Bis-Ethylhexyl-Phthalates) into the NGS solvent. Either case will not impact decontamination or immobilization operations at Savannah River Site (SRS). Some applications have zero tolerance for dimensional changes such as the operation of valves while other applications a finite dimensional change improves the function of the application such as seals and gaskets. Additional considerations are required before using the conclusions from this work to judge outcomes in field applications. Decane, a component of IsoparL that is most likely to interact with the polymers, mildly interacted with the elastomers and the propylene based polymers but their degree of swelling is at most 10 % and the confined geometry that they are typically placed in indicate this is not significant. In addition, it was found that Vellumoid may leach protein into the NGS solvent. Since Vellumoid is used at the mixer in Saltstone where it sees minimum quantities of solvent, this leaching has no effect on the extraction process at MCU or the immobilization process at saltstone. No significant interaction is expected between MaxCalix and the polymers and elastomers used at MCU, DWPF, and Saltstone. Overall, minimal and insignificant interactions are expected on extraction and immobilization operations when MCU switches from CSSX to NGS solvent. It is expected that contacting NGS will not accelerate the aging rate of polymers and elastomers under radiation and heat. This is due to the minimal interaction between NGS and the polymers and the confined geometries for these polymers. SRNL recommends the use of the HSP method (for screening) and some testing to evaluate the impact of other organic such as alcohols, glycolate, and their byproducts on the polymers used throughout the site...|$|E
