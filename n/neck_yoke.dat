50|$|Cattle crushes may {{be fully}} fixed or mobile; however, most crushes are best {{classified}} as semipermanent, being potentially movable but designed to primarily {{stay in one}} place. A cattle crush is typically linked to a cattle race (also known as an alley). The front end has a head bail (or <b>neck</b> <b>yoke</b> or head gate) to catch the animal and may have a baulk gate that swings aside to assist in catching the beast. The bail is often adjustable to accommodate animals of different sizes. This bail may incorporate a chin or neck bar to hold the animal's head still. A side lever operates the head bail to capture the animals, with the better types having a rear drop-away safety lever for easier movement of the cattle into the bail. Usually, smaller animals can walk through the head bails incorporated in crushes.|$|E
40|$|Three yoking {{systems are}} used {{globally}} {{to capture the}} power of oxen. These are the head yoke, withers yoke, and <b>neck</b> <b>yoke.</b> Each system has its strengths and weaknesses, with culture and cattle {{playing a role in}} the adoption and use of each system. The <b>neck</b> <b>yoke</b> system offers important lessons in understanding animal comfort and yoke design. Despite its success, the <b>neck</b> <b>yoke</b> should not be universally adopted, nor should it be universally promoted. However ignoring the lessons learned in North America over the last 400 years would ignore animals and teamsters who perfected this system and learned to maximize animal comfort and performance. Using history, research in Africa, as well as farm and competition experience from the United States and Canada, this paper addresses improving animal comfort, performance and welfare by understanding and appreciating yoking systems for oxen.

It is with Christians as it is with other scholars, they sometimes meet with hard lessons; but these thou must also learn, or thou canst not do thy work. The Word and Spirit of God come sometimes like chain-shot to us, as if it would cut down all; as when Abraham was to offer up Isaac, and the Levites to slay their brethren (Gen 22; Exo 32:26-28). Paul also must go from place to place to preach, though he knew beforehand he was to be afflicted there (Acts 20:23). God may sometimes say to thee, as he said to his servant Moses, 'Take the serpent by the tail'; or, as the Lord Jesus said to Peter, Walk upon the sea (Exo 4:3,4).
