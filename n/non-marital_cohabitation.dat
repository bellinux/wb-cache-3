40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore single women’s views towards the {{institution}} of marriage. This study utilized a qualitative design. In-depth face-to-face interviews with ten unmarried women living in San Bernardino County were conducted to collect the data. Participants were asked in a structured interview to provide their views towards premarital sex, <b>cohabitation,</b> <b>non-marital</b> childbearing, divorce, and same sex marriage. This study found that women’s liberal and conservative views towards premarital sex, <b>cohabitation,</b> <b>non-marital</b> childbearing, divorce, and same sex marriage did not affect a women’s desire to enter the institution of marriage. Furthermore, the study indicated that women exhibited both liberal and conservative views, regardless of religiosity. Last, this study found that women commonly exhibited the traditional view of marrying prior to starting a family, regardless of women accepting premarital sex and cohabitation. The findings of the study suggest that social workers need to have a better understanding of the diverse views and behaviors of unmarried women. The study also recommends that social workers need to increase their awareness of unmarried women’s preferred lifestyles and to diminish the stigma associated with unmarried women. Furthermore, social workers should enhance their knowledge of micro and macro services available to unmarried women including resources in family planning and women’s health...|$|R

50|$|In recent years, the {{marriage}} rate {{in many countries}} (especially in the West) has decreased. As more young people reject traditional lifestyles that include marriage, the issue arises whether the state accepts non-traditional families such as those based on <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation,</b> or whether it actively discourages non-marital childbearing. In Western countries, the former position of accepting cohabiting couples and supporting them as a legitimate form of family has been connected with a higher fertility rate (e.g. Scandinavian countries, France, where most births occur outside of marriage) while the latter (such as East Asia - Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore) has been connected with a very low fertility rate.|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{well-documented}} behavioral differences between blacks and whites, the present study uses the National Survey of Family and Households to examine racial differences in attitudes toward premarital sex, <b>non-marital</b> childbearing, <b>cohabitation,</b> and marriage.

This paper estimates the odds of approval for each area of interest, controlling for race, age, sex, income, education, and marital status. Despite the marked differences in behaviors between blacks and whites, racial differences in attitudes are small, with the exception of attitudes on non-marital childbearing. More important than race in determining attitudes are age, gender, and marital status. The importance of each of these variables depends on the issue examined. Racial differences in attitudes toward premarital sex are substantially influenced by gender and age. While whites are more likely than blacks to approve of premarital sex, white men and women tend to differ considerably in their views. Whereas young white males are more likely to approve of premarital sex than any other group, older white females are least likely to approve. On the issue of nonmarita...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} formal marriage based on its role in assigning paternity and custodial rights.

Hence, marriage is modelled as the transfer of an exogenously determined fraction of custodial rights – from the woman to her husband.

40|$|In this article, the Dutch {{approach}} to informal lifestyles will be analysed {{on the basis}} of legal developments during the period 1970 – 2006 in a number of legal areas, such as landlord and tenant law, inheritance tax law, and social security law. The debate between family function and family form is the point of departure. This is highly relevant, since the number of couples living together unmarried is steadily increasing in the Netherlands. <b>Non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> actually consists of a number of different types, including pre-marital, post-marital, and long-term cohabitation. However, surprisingly little sociological data on informal lifestyles are available, so it is diffi cult to combine sociological research with legal data. The results of the legal analyses demonstrate that the Dutch legal system has generally accepted <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> in most areas by recognizing both the emotional and economic ties between cohabiting partners. However, in the fi elds of family law, inheritance law, and criminal and criminal procedural law, informal lifestyles are mostly ignored. This is hardly acceptable, taking into account the aim of most of the provisions, which is generally not so much the recognition of the family form as such, but the recognition of the underlying family functions. In this respect, the form over function fi elds should be fundamentally reconsidered in order to do justice to the changed social reality...|$|E

40|$|As a {{minority}} group with an Islamic background the Iranian Dutch {{are known as}} 'well-integrated' citizens, based on their educational and occupational position in society. By taking a liberal stance on homosexuality, premarital sex and <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation,</b> as currently contested topics in Dutch public debates on multiculturalism, {{a considerable number of}} them claims a 'modern' attitude. This paper considers a network of young Iranian Dutch who reject what they view as restrictive sexual norms imposed {{by the rest of the}} community and instead choose to fashion an ideal queer self. According to an Iranian Dutch dominant modernity discourse, romantic premarital sexual encounters, biologically-determined homosexuality and long-term committed <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> are acceptable. However, this young and highly educated group appropriates an alternative approach. Decoupling sex from romance, engaging in same-sex practices while rejecting homosexuality as an identity category and perceiving cohabitation as a potential form of sexual limitation, enables this group to negotiate with norms of intimacy. Analysing the deployment of sexuality as practices of self-fashioning based on ethnographic data gathered between 2010 and 2013, this paper illustrates how cultural boundary-crossing in this context is at times accompanied by normative articulations of gender. It questions the predominantly celebrative interpretation of the at-the-cutting-edge configurations of the intimate life and argues for an analytical framework that seeks to unravel socio-cultural embeddedness of notions of transgression. Furthermore, it contributes to the range of studied transgressive practices of intimacy at the start of the 21 st century in which diasporic accounts are rather scarce...|$|E
40|$|Since the Second World War {{demographic}} behaviour {{has changed}} dramatically in the industrialised world. Marriage and fertility rates have declined substantially and total fertility rates have reached unprecedented low levels. All European countries (except Iceland and Turkey) now have fertility levels well below the replacement level. Divorce rates, <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> and extramarital fertility, on the other hand, have increased significantly, as has the age at first marriage and first birth. However, when and at which speed, these changes have occurred has varied greatly between different countries. The new pattern of development, genereally {{referred to as the}} "second demographic transition", appeared in Northern and Western Europe in the mid 1960 s and then spread to the Southern countries, and more recently to the Eastern parts of Europe. In this overview I discuss the demographic development in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania since the 1960 s. The issues I focus on are: transition to adulthood (mainly the act of leaving parental home), partnership and fertility. I also present different explanations for the demographic changes. Some explanations deal with economic aspects such as the increased labour force participation and autonomy of women. Regarding the rapid demographic changes in the post-socialist states in Eastern Europe most explanations focus on the economic and social hardship following the collapse of the system.

40|$|Several of {{the most}} {{striking}} trends in family structure over recent decades plausibly represent a response to uncertainty–for instance, the rapid increases in the age at which people marry, <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation,</b> and divorce. To investigate that hypothesis, this paper attempts to measure the sensitivity of family formation and dissolution decisions to a specific type of risk, earnings instability. An individual’s earnings instability is defined here as the expected standard deviation of transitory earnings shocks for a person with the individual’s demographic and occupational characteristics. Results from the PSID indicate that a one standard deviation increase in this measure of earnings risk is associated with a 70 — 90 percent decrease in the hazard that a single person will begin a marriage and a 25 — 50 percent increase in the hazard of forming a cohabitational union. These effects are 2 — 4 times larger than the effects of a standard deviation increase in actual earnings. However, earnings instability seems to matter little once a match is formed...|$|E

40|$|While {{the notion}} of {{conjugal}} or marriage-like has become legally ubiquitous in the regulation of <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> in Canada, its meaning remains elusive. A review of the case law and of spousal definitions in income security schemes reveals that {{the presence or absence}} of a sexual component to a relationship has become immaterial to, or of declining relevance in, the determination of conjugality. As a result, legal decision-makers have had to grapple with the increasing instability of the distinction between conjugal and non-conjugal relationships. The question of whether a relationship has a sexual component bears no relation to legitimate state objectives. As a result, the distinction between conjugal and non-conjugal relationships is collapsing as a coherent basis for legal policy. It thus becomes necessary to develop better ways of determining when and how adult personal relationships ought to be recognized in the law. Rather than continuing on the elusive quest for marriage equivalence, it is necessary to reformulate relational definitions to focus more precisely on the kinds of emotional and economic interdependence relevant to the objectives of particular laws...|$|E

A question that arises {{in light of this}} trend is how the diffusion of <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> may affect the quality of family relations. This article investigates how cohabitation among young people affects their level of satisfaction with their relationship with their parents. We analyse data from the recently released Generation and Gender Survey for Poland, a country with a limited degree of social acceptance of cohabitation, a high degree of attachment to the institution of marriage, and a familialistic culture. Since young adults who choose to cohabit are a rather specific group, we use statistical methods that allow us to control for both the observed and the unobserved characteristics of cohabiters. We find that young people who cohabited in their first union rated their level of satisfaction with their parental relationship lower than their peers who were married. Thus, at least {{in the context of a}} country where informal partnerships are not yet fully socially accepted or institutionally supported, the role of cohabitation in intergenerational relations may not be neutral...|$|E

In particular, there is no clear evidence whether (and how) Italian married and unmarried parents differ in childrearing practices. This paper focuses on the differences between married and cohabiting parents of pre-school children in the time dedicated to childcare and dom estic tasks, in a gender perspective, using a sample from the 2008 / 09 Time Use Survey. We expect that cohabitating parents are more egalitarian in sharing unpaid work, but we want to verify whether this is explained by the cohabitation in itself or rather by differences in individual and couple characteristics (such as labor market participation and education level). Moreover we are interested to assess qualitative differences in parenting practices also in terms of type of childcare (physical or relational).

By examining combined partnership and fertility sequences and transcending the mainly descriptive nature of trajectory-based studies, the current study expands our knowledge by including key explanatory factors, such as cohort, country, and educational level. Pooled data from the Gender and Generations Survey (N = 30, 197) is used to engage in sequence, optimal matching (OM), cluster and multinomial logistic regression analysis. Post- Communist cohorts are significantly {{more likely to engage in}} long-term cohabitation, childbearing within cohabitation or lone parenthood. Educational level operates differently across countries, with the highly educated in Romania and the Russian Federation less likely to follow certain de-standardized paths. <b>Non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> with children is associated with lower education in all countries. Strong differences emerge between the shape and stages of the SDT in Romania and Russia, with Russians having a higher probability to experience childbearing within cohabitation, opposed to Romanians who follow childless marriage patterns or adopt postponement and singlehood. The three countries differ in their advancement in the SDT and factors shaping partnering and childbearing choices.

40|$|For {{the most}} part, 'first world' legal systems {{have long since}} {{abandoned}} the criminalization of <b>non-marital</b> <b>cohabitation</b> and no longer refuse to recognize cohabitation contracts on public policy grounds. Beyond that, however, there is considerable division over whether to attach marriage-like consequences to cohabitation. Much of the debate juxtaposes respect for party autonomy and protection, with advocates for greater protection focusing on the functional similarity of cohabitation and marriage and widespread misconceptions about the legal consequences of cohabiting. The Scottish Law Commission embraced compromise in its recommendations for reform of the law on cohabitation and sought to balance protection of the vulnerable and respect for autonomy. While the legislation that resulted departed somewhat from these recommendations and suffered from defective drafting, it too took a compromise position. Using the lens of these legislative provisions, this article argues that such an approach leads {{to a loss of}} coherence in the law, judicial divergence, public confusion and creates {{a false sense of security}} among the ill-informed. In addition, it invites incremental expansion of the law without a firm policy decision being taken.
