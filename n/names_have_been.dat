5|$|Several banks (UBS, Barclays, HSBC, Deutsche Bank) {{and many}} {{high-profile}} <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{involved in a}} recently disclosed scandal concerning secret offshore financial dealings in the so-called Panama Papers scandal.|$|E
5|$|Some Tamil place <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{retained}} in these districts.

Composite or hybrid place names are also present in these districts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>name</b> Reming <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{used in the}} Philippines by PAGASA in the Western Pacific. Reming as a <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> retired by PAGASA.|$|R
50|$|Blochwich's <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> spelt {{in several}} ways, which may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{due to the}} path taken by his book from Königsberg in East Prussia in 1642 to London in 1650 and the related translations. The <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> written as Blockwich, Blockwitz, Blochwich and Blochwitz.|$|R

5|$|Antibaryons are {{not listed}} in the tables; however, they simply would have all quarks changed to antiquarks, and Q, B, S, C, B′, would be of {{opposite}} signs. Particles with † next to their <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> predicted by the Standard Model but not yet observed. Values in red have not been firmly established by experiments, but are predicted by the quark model and {{are consistent with the}} measurements.|$|E
5|$|M. inclemens {{is one of}} the 11 {{species in}} genus Maevia. The species was first called Attus inclemens, and other <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used. The two male forms look and behave so {{differently}} that they were originally considered two distinct species. In 1955 Robert Barnes chose M. inclemens, and this has become the standard name.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, no {{relevant}} information {{is found in}} the contemporary Greek Linear B records. The latter, dealing only with administrative issues of the Mycenaean palaces, are of limited value concerning the political developments of the late Bronze Age era. Moreover, although the title of the Mycenaean kings, the wanax, has been read several times in the Linear B texts, no correspondent personal <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>name</b> <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> {{related to}} the word kimme meaning “rim”, i.e., [...] "the people of the coast". Finally, since Antiquity, the <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> related {{to that of the}} Cimmerians.|$|R
25|$|Several indices {{with this}} <b>name</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> missaplied to Prostanthera junonis.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} at least thirty-two {{counties}} established by Texas law that no longer exist. These fall into five categories: judicial counties; counties established by the Constitutional Convention of 1868–69; counties never organized which were abolished by legislative act; counties whose territory is no longer considered part of the state; and counties whose <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> changed.|$|E
5|$|Within the Central Pacific basin—between 140°W and the International Date Line at 180°—four <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> retired {{since the}} {{introduction}} of a naming list for the basin in 1979. Hurricanes Iwa and Iniki were retired after impacting Hawaii, while Paka and Ioke were retired after the affecting various islands in Micronesia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{geographical}} <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> formally {{changed in}} Turkey, their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country. At times, Turkish politicians have {{also used the}} native names of cities during their speeches. In 2009, when addressing a crowd {{in the town of}} Güroymak, president Abdullah Gül used the native name Norşin. Also that year, when talking about his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the native Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.|$|E
5000|$|Casper (with {{the same}} {{sounding}} Kasper) {{is a family}} and personal name derived from Chaldean that means [...] "Treasurer".

5|$|In 1920, American {{botanist}} Paul C. Standley described {{three new}} species based on collections from Panama and Costa Rica—Ficus tuerckheimii, F. isophlebia and F. jimenezii. DeWolf {{concluded that they}} were all the same species, and Berg synonymised them with F. aurea. These <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used widely for Mexican and Central American populations, and continue to be used by some authors. Berg suspected that Ficus rzedowskiana Carvajal and Cuevas-Figueroa may also belong to this species, but he had not examined the original material upon which this species was based.|$|E
5|$|King Louis XIV {{danced in}} Isaac de Benserade's Ballet royal de Flore in February 1669 at the Tuileries, {{possibly}} in the Salle des Ballets {{located on the}} first floor of the pavilion. It has been suggested that this is when the name Pavillon de Flore came into use, although the earliest known written mention is in 1726. Pavillon de Flore is the name used today, although other <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used in between.|$|E
5|$|Later American explorers, some of {{whom were}} {{originally}} part of the Lewis and Clark expedition, journeyed into the Snake River watershed and records show a variety of <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> associated with the river. The explorer Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition named the river as Mad River. Others gave the river names including Shoshone River (after the tribe) and Saptin River. Eventually, the name Snake River was derived from an S-shaped gesture the Shoshone tribe made with their hands to represent swimming salmon. Explorers misinterpreted it to represent a snake, giving the river its present-day name.|$|E
50|$|The current <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in use since 1994.|$|R
50|$|This <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{sometimes}} used, incorrectly, in {{the scientific}} literature to refer {{to any of the}} 27 <b>names</b> that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given to species of Corsican molluscs in the genus Tacheocampylaea.|$|R
50|$|His <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> misread by copyists as Moses Kastilin.|$|R
5|$|Relationships with {{tribes to}} retain Native <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{established}} {{at the high school}} level. Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado) now uses a logo provided by the Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events.|$|E
5|$|The name {{cerebellum}} is {{a diminutive}} of cerebrum (brain); {{it can be}} translated literally as little brain. The Latin name is a direct translation of the Ancient Greek παρεγκεφαλίς (parencephalis), which {{was used in the}} works of Aristotle, the first known writer to describe the structure. No other name is used in the English-language literature, but historically a variety of Greek or Latin-derived <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used, including cerebrum parvum, encephalion, encranion, cerebrum posterius, and parencephalis.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{subspecies}} {{have been}} described, but only three are widely recognised, these differing {{largely in the}} colour of their underparts. The nominate subspecies Passer rutilans rutilans breeds in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and southeastern and central China. The subspecies intensior, described in 1922 by Walter Rothschild from Yunnan, breeds in southwest China and parts of India, Burma, Laos, and Vietnam. In {{a large part of}} Sichuan intensior intergrades with the nominate subspecies, and a number of subspecies <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed for the intergrades. The subspecies cinnamomeus, described by Gould from the northwestern Himalayas, breeds from northern Arunachal Pradesh to Nuristan in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of all Pacific typhoons {{that have}} had their names retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency. A total of 38typhoon <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> retired since the start of {{official}} tropical cyclone naming in the western North Pacific Ocean in 2000. Tropical cyclone names are retired by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in a meeting in January or February. Those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms. Several names were removed or altered naming list for various reasons other than retirement. Collectively, retired typhoons have caused over $68billion in damage (USD), as well as over 12,000deaths.|$|E
5|$|Fries himself {{declined}} {{to keep the}} genus separate, instead classifying Gomphus as a tribus (subgenus) within the genus Cantharellus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum, the species becoming Cantharellus clavatus. He recognized four varieties: violaceo-spadiceus, carneus, purpurascens and umbrinus. Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan described three taxa—Merulius clavatus carneus, M.clavatus violaceus and M.clavatus purpurascens—in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse. Many of his <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently. Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum, placing it in a series—Deformes—in the genus Craterellus.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the United States Weather Bureau in the Atlantic basin, after hurricanes Carol, Edna, and Hazel struck the Northeastern United States and caused {{a significant amount}} of damage in the previous year. Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired. Several <b>names</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> removed from the Pacific naming lists for various reasons other than for causing {{a significant amount of}} death/destruction, which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and for political reasons.|$|E
