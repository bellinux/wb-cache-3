5|$|Atari created prototypes for {{location}} testing, but {{the game}} did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II. Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the <b>new</b> <b>models</b> were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the 'Hood, a beat 'em up game. An urban legend states that when WMS Industries purchased Time Warner Interactive (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a steamroller over the Marble Madness II boards in order to clear inventory for tax purposes. In actuality, no Marble Madness II boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become collector items.|$|E

In the 1970s, he frequently used the Hammond organ, Hohner Pianet, Mellotron, RMI Electronic Piano and ARP Pro Soloist. In the 1980s, he used the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 and Prophet 10, the ARP Quadra and various Korg synthesizers. For the Turn It On Again tour in 2007, his main board was a Korg Oasys. As both a guitarist and bassist, Rutherford regularly swapped between the two roles, and his trademark instrument with Genesis, particularly through the 1970s, was a double neck guitar. In the 1980s and beyond, he favoured the Eric Clapton Stratocaster.|$|E
5|$|By 1896, {{the company}} {{produced}} one new car {{every two to}} three weeks and built vehicles on order for $2,000. As the orders increased, the company formally incorporated as Haynes-Apperson on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in capital from stock issued to Portland and Kokomo businessmen. At the end of that year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two <b>new</b> <b>models</b> were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased. Haynes-Apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.|$|E

5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the <b>new</b> <b>models.</b> Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power.

40|$|It is {{only human}} nature to be {{reluctant}} to accept something new and different. This feeling is exacerbated given {{the success of the}} Big Bang model. However, there are cogent reasons for considering this <b>new</b> <b>model.</b> Some of the advantages of this <b>new</b> <b>model</b> over the existing Big Bang model are as follows: (1) It does not violate any known laws of physics. This contrasts with the Big Bang model where all known laws of physics break down in the consideration of the universe beginning as a singular point of infinite density. (2) The cause behind the initial explosion is provided in this <b>new</b> <b>model.</b> The Big Bang model does not explain what caused the initial explosion. (3) The homogenous nature of the universe is intrinsically explained in this <b>new</b> <b>model.</b> Whereas, the Big Bang model relies on an "extraneous" concept like inflation to explain the homogeneity of the universe. (4) This <b>new</b> <b>model</b> eliminates the mystery of why there is a preponderance of matter over anti-matter. These are some of the advantages of this <b>new</b> <b>model.</b> There are others.

40|$|Multi-resolution terrain {{models are}} an {{efficient}} approach {{to improve the}} speed of three-dimensional (3 D) visualizations, especially for terrain visualization in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). As a further development to existing algorithms and <b>models,</b> a <b>new</b> <b>model</b> is proposed {{for the construction of}} multi-resolution terrain models in a 3 D GIS. The <b>new</b> <b>model</b> represents multi-resolution terrains using two major methods for terrain representation: Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) and regular grid (Grid). In this paper, first, the concepts and formal definitions of the <b>new</b> <b>model</b> are presented. Second, the methodology for constructing multi-resolution terrain models based on the <b>new</b> <b>model</b> is proposed. Third, the error of multi-resolution terrain models is analysed, and a set of rules is proposed to retain the important features (e. g. boundaries of man-made objects) within the multi-resolution terrain models. Finally, several experiments are undertaken to test the performance of the <b>new</b> <b>model.</b> The experimental results demonstrate that the <b>new</b> <b>model</b> can be applied to construct multi-resolution terrain models with good performance in terms of time cost and maintenance of the important features.

5|$|A {{cooperative}} Half-Life {{game was}} first alluded to by publisher Sierra On-Line in November 2000 with {{the announcement of}} a PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life. At the time, however, it was unclear how a cooperative version of Half-Life would be implemented; the developers, Gearbox Software, were still experimenting with finding the most balanced number of players to build a cooperative game around. By E3 2001, the game had acquired the title Decay, named after the scientific concept of exponential decay for consistency with the scientific names used by previous Half-Life titles. While the E3 convention only provided {{a demonstration of the}} main Half-Life PlayStation 2 game, further details were released relating to Decays premise and story, as well as confirming that the cooperative mode was to be designed for two players. The game's use of new model sets were also showcased. These <b>new</b> <b>models</b> were updated versions of Gearbox's High Definition pack for , featuring higher numbers of polygons and animation features such as facial expressions. The enhanced models were around twice as detailed as those in the High Definition pack, which itself was of a much higher quality than the original models in Half-Life. Media updates through the months following E3 showed various screenshots and the trailer to the game. On August 18, 2001, Sierra announced that Decay was nearly complete, and would be submitted to PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony for verification within days. The entire Half-Life for PlayStation 2 package achieved gold status on October 30, 2001, and the game was released on November 14, 2001.|$|E

In December that year, the Hercules made their first troop-carrying flights into a combat zone, {{when one of}} No.36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the commencement of the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions would be undertaken for a further five years. In 1964, the first two Dassault MirageIII fighters to be assembled in Australia were flown in pieces from France to the Government Aircraft Factories at Avalon, Victoria, by RAAF Hercules. The same year, following the entry into Australian service of the de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou with No.38 Squadron, No.486 Squadron was disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons. The RAAF's force of twelve C-130A Hercules was augmented by twelve C-130Es commencing in August 1966. No.37 Squadron, disbanded in 1948, was re-formed at Richmond to operate the <b>new</b> <b>models.</b> No.486 Squadron was also re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons. No.36 Squadron's tasking was mainly domestic and tactical in nature, while No.37 Squadron's was overseas and strategic, owing to the longer range of its C-130Es. In May 1967, three Hercules of No.37 Squadron supported Operation Fast Caravan, the deployment of 23 Mirages of No.75 Squadron to Butterworth.|$|E
