5|$|The {{relatively}} successful {{resolution of}} the crisis in the northwest did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> recover the losses in the southeast. To make matters worse, in 1369 (the date is disputed), the Ottoman Turks under Murad I conquered Adrianople (in 1363) and made it the effective capital of their expanding state. At the same time, they also captured the Bulgarian cities of Philippopolis and Boruj (Stara Zagora). As Bulgaria and the Serbian princes in Macedonia prepared for united action against the Turks, Ivan Alexander died on February 17, 1371. He was succeeded by his sons Ivan Sracimir in Vidin and Ivan Šišman in Tǎrnovo, while the rulers of Dobruja and Wallachia achieved further independence.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May, {{the first}} full day of the evacuation, one cruiser, eight destroyers, and 26 other craft were active. Admiralty {{officers}} combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically {{taking part in the}} effort. The same day, the Luftwaffe heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished. An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town. The Luftwaffe was met by 16 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft. Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo. The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans {{of the people are}} in the shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from a headache, Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains that she used to live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter that global warming is causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Thea's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground. Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground.|$|E

25|$|In October 2013, {{according}} to a Spanish news source, Contancia Mangue and Cristina Lima, another of Obiang's wives, got into a heated argument over dinner with Obiang. Mangue accused Lima, who was described as the country's second lady, of doing <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the country's women. In return Lima accused Mangue of looting the nation's wealth. Obiang reportedly intervened several times and told his wives {{to go to their}} own hometowns.|$|E
25|$|The Mormons {{began to}} move into Hancock County in 1839; at the time, most were Democratic. After the Mormons' {{expulsion}} from Missouri, Joseph Smith went to Washington, DC and met with President Martin Van Buren, seeking intervention and compensation for lost property. Van Buren said he could do <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> After returning to Illinois, Smith vowed to join the Whig Party. Most of his supporters switched with him, adding political tensions to the social suspicions in which this group were held.|$|E
25|$|After the births {{of their}} children, Victoria Eugenie's {{relationship}} with Alfonso deteriorated, {{and he had}} numerous affairs. It {{has been said that}} he had a dalliance with the Queen's cousin, Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera, but this is disputed. There is some evidence that Alfonso tried to seduce Beatrice, but she didn't give in. The king, in anger, expelled her and her husband from Spain. Then members of the king's circle spread rumours that Beatrice had been expelled because of her bad behaviour, which was not true. All this situation was very painful for the Queen, who could do <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her cousin.|$|E

25|$|Rawdon Crawley's {{elder brother}} is ignorant, boorish, and mean. He {{inherits}} the Crawley estate from his elderly father, {{and he also}} inherits from his wealthy aunt, Miss Crawley. Sir Pitt is very religious and has political aspirations, although not many people appreciate his intelligence or wisdom because there's not much there to appreciate. Somewhat pedantic and conservative, Sir Pitt does <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Rawdon or Becky even when they fall on hard times. This is chiefly due {{to the influence of}} his wife Lady Jane who dislikes Becky because of her callous treatment of her son, and also because Becky repaid Lady Jane's earlier kindness by patronising her and flirting with Sir Pitt.|$|E
25|$|Since Leopold I's {{intervention}} in the Franco-Dutch War Louis XIV had considered the Emperor his most dangerous enemy; yet the French king had little reason to fear him. Leopold I was weak, and was in grave danger along his Hungarian borders where the Ottoman Turks were threatening to overrun all central Europe from the south. Louis had encouraged and assisted the Ottoman drive against Leopold I's Habsburg lands, and had assured the Porte {{that he would not}} support the Emperor. He had also urged King Sobieski of Poland (unsuccessfully) not to side with Leopold I, and pressed the malcontent princes of Transylvania and Hungary to join with the Sultan's forces and free their territory from Habsburg rule. When the Turks besieged Vienna in the spring of 1683 Louis did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the defenders.|$|E
25|$|Lovejoy and The Observer {{continued}} to be embroiled in controversy. In April 1836, a mulatto boatman, Francis McIntosh, was arrested by two policemen and, {{en route to the}} jail, McIntosh grabbed a knife and stabbed both men. One was killed and the other seriously injured. Although McIntosh attempted to escape, he was caught and a mob tied him up and burned him to death. Some of the mob were brought before a grand jury to face charges. However, the presiding judge, Judge Lawless, neglected to convict anyone and considered the crime a spontaneous mob action without any specific people to prosecute. The Judge made remarks insinuating that abolitionists, including Lovejoy and the Observer, had incited McIntosh into stabbing the policemen. With already negative attention on him, Lawless' opinion did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Lovejoy and in May, Lovejoy decided to move the Observer to Alton, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} the lack of {{activity}} of the Dutch navy was the fact that diplomatic activity never ceased and gave the Dutch government the illusion that the war would be of only short duration. First Empress Catharine, though she refused to {{come to the aid of}} the Dutch, was very active in offering her services to mediate the dispute. Both the British and the Dutch, with varying amounts of sincerity, cooperated in these diplomatic maneuvers, which came <b>to</b> <b>nothing,</b> but <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> keep military activities at a low level while they lasted.|$|R

25|$|In the Doctor Who Past Doctor Adventures novel The Shadow in the Glass, the Sixth Doctor and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart {{discover}} {{the existence of}} a Fourth Reich led by Hitler's son, Eva Braun having been smuggled away to give birth and another woman killed in her place. At the conclusion of the novel the Fourth Reich's threat is ended when Hitler's son forces the Doctor to take him back in time to meet his father, only for Hitler to shoot his son in the head in the belief that he is nothing but a madman. The Seventh Doctor also met Hitler in the Virgin New Adventures novel , where Hitler was possessed by the powerful being known as the Timewyrm from pre-WW2 to 1940, learning to control its power before the Doctor tricked Hitler into banishing it by claiming that it was doing <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him when in reality the Timewyrm's power was all that kept Hitler remotely stable {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the Treaty of Georgievsk proved disappointing for the Georgians. King Erekle's {{adherence}} to it prompted Persia's new ruler, Agha Mohammad Khan, who had sent several ultimatums, to invade, as he sought to re-establish Persia's traditional suzerainty over the region. Russia did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the Georgians during the disastrous Battle of Krtsanisi in 1795, which left Tbilisi sacked and Georgia ravaged (including the west Georgian kingdom of Imereti, ruled by Erekle II's grandson, King Solomon II). Belatedly, Catherine declared war on Persia and sent an army to Transcaucasia. But her death shortly thereafter (November 1796) {{put an end to}} Russia's Persian Expedition of 1796, as her successor, Paul, turned to other strategic objectives. Persia's Shahanshah next contemplated the removal of the Christian population from eastern Georgia and eastern Armenia, launching the campaign from Karabagh. His goal was frustrated not by Russian resistance, but by a Persian assassin in 1797.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. In his veto message, he expressed {{the belief that the}} bill would do <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy. Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it.

500|$|Historian H. M. Walbrook {{wrote in}} 1921 that Pinafore [...] "satirizes {{the type of}} {{nautical}} drama of which Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing little or <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> one's country". G. K. Chesterton agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of [...] "being proud of yourself for being a citizen" [...] of one's country, which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the [...] "temptations to belong to other nations" [...] but is merely an excuse for pride. In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, [...] "they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know damn well they're sending it up, but the music is so military... that you can't help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire." [...] In addition, {{he argued that the}} song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: [...] "H.M.S. Pinafore is basically a satire on... the British love of the class system.... f course [...] can marry [...] daughter, because he's British, and therefore he's great'". Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor's [...] "patriotism guarantees his virtue".|$|E

500|$|In March 2004, he {{appeared}} in Tony Marchant's Passer By, playing Joe Keyes, a man who witnesses a woman being accosted by some men on a train and chooses not to help. Keyes later discovers that the woman was raped but cannot bring himself to admit in court that he did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her. Nesbitt described Keyes as [...] "like a better man than me: a good father and husband. But, once {{he has made a}} wrong decision, he can't control everything in his life, as he thinks he is weak. He loses the respect of his wife, his son and at work, and has to reach the lowest possible point before finding redemption." [...] As a result of these serious roles, he was named the sixth most powerful figure in TV drama in a listing compiled by industry experts for the Radio Times. In September 2004, he starred as Jack Parlabane in the ITV adaptation of Christopher Brookmyre's Quite Ugly One Morning. The producers originally wanted Scottish actor Douglas Henshall to play Glaswegian Parlabane but ITV executives overruled them and cast Nesbitt. He was given coaching to perfect the accent but it was soon discarded on the advice of both the director and his co-star Daniela Nardini. Also in 2004, he filmed the roles of Ronnie Cunningham in Millions (Danny Boyle, 2004), and Detective Banner in Match Point (Woody Allen, 2005). He was considering taking time off from acting and did not really want the role in Match Point. He sent in an audition tape and was accepted for the part. Nesbitt's character appears {{at the end of the}} film and he read only that part of the script, so did not know the full circumstances of the crime Banner investigates. Despite his initial reluctance, Nesbitt enjoyed working with Allen, and complimented him on his directing style.|$|E
