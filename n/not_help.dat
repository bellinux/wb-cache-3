Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch or a more complex continuously variable circuits.|$|E

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does <b>not</b> <b>help</b> with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do <b>not</b> <b>help</b> prevent low back pain.|$|E

5|$|The British {{educational}} policies segregating {{the different}} races — providing minimal public education for Malays, and leaving non-Malays {{to their own}} devices — did <b>not</b> <b>help</b> matters. The Malays, predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non-Malays. The economic impoverishment of the Malays which set them apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|E
5|$|The infrequency of Tchaikovsky's musical successes, {{won with}} {{tremendous}} effort, exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism. Nikolai Rubinstein's private fits of rage critiquing his music, most famously attacking the First Piano Concerto, did <b>not</b> <b>help</b> matters. His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions. Hans von Bülow premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor. Other artists included Adele Aus der Ohe, Max Erdmannsdörfer, Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Taneyev.|$|E

Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E

At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil.

Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did <b>not</b> <b>help</b> the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E

The sister aircraft Najaden arrived later in the afternoon with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and so could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company. The three, along with Reksten and Bredvik, became the investigation commission.|$|E
5|$|Eddy left Boston in September {{and sailed}} to Machias, where he {{recruited}} about 20 men. On October 13, this party sailed from Machias for Passamaquoddy Bay.

The two parties met at sea, where Allan attempted to dissuade Eddy from his plan, informing him that the Mi'kmaq (the largest tribe in Nova Scotia) would <b>not</b> <b>help</b> him. Allan extracted a promise from Eddy to wait at Campobello while he went to Machias to meet with the council there. When the Machias council learned of how little native support there was, they sent a letter to Eddy urging him to give up the effort. Eddy persisted, and left Campobello, having added nine Passamaquoddy recruits to his band.|$|E
