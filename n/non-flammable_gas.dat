40|$|ABSTRACT: Fire {{formation}} and development {{can be defined}} as a specific num-ber of combustion reactions which take place in situ depending on several factors. It is important to notice two different processes: first, material reaction to fire and second, emission of fumes from the material subjected to overheating where optical density and toxicity are factors of concern. An improvement in fire behav-ior can be achieved by means of fire retardants and smoke suppressants. Fire re-tardants can act chemically by interfering with combustion radical chain reactions or physically by several methods, including developing a layer which protects the material from ignition {{on the surface of the}} substrate, giving off <b>non-flammable</b> <b>gases</b> (water vapor, hydrochloric acid, etc.) in order to dilute flamma-ble ones or displace the oxygen from the fire area in the gas phase and enhancing certain reactions (halides, phosphoric acid, etc.) such as endothermic reactions and surface dehydrations. On the other hand, smoke suppressants such as zinc compounds can also act physically and chemically (by formation of metal halides or oxyhalides in red-ox reactions) in the condensed and gas phases.

What is methyl bromide? • Methyl bromide is a broad spectrum fumigant used as an acaricide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, nematicide, and rodenticide (1). Methyl bromide was introduced as an insecticide in 1932 and was first registered in the United States in 1961 (1, 2). • Methyl bromide is used primarily as a soil fumigant with secondary uses for perishable commodities and treatment of closed structures (3). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified methyl bromide as a “Restricted Use Pesticide, ” i. e., a pesticide that may be purchased and used only by certified applicators or persons under their direct supervision (1).

30|$|The {{high-pressure}} gas-foaming technique {{employs a}} gas as a porogen to create interconnected pores. It {{was developed to}} eliminate the use of organic solvents, the residual of which might result in an inflammatory response after implantation. This fabrication process can be conducted at mild conditions. CO 2, a non-toxic and <b>non-flammable</b> <b>gas,</b> has been widely used in supercritical fluid processing. First, a polymer is placed in a chamber and then saturated with high-pressure CO 2. As the pressure is rapidly dropped, the nucleation and formation of pores occur {{as a result of}} the thermodynamic instability in the gas/polymer system (Mooney et al. 1996). The fabrication parameters such as temperature, pressure, degree of saturate and depressurisation time have a great influence on the pore morphology and pore size of the scaffolds. The gas-foaming technique typically produces a sponge-like structure with the average pore size in the range of 30 – 700  μm and a porosity up to 85  % (Chen 2011). The drawbacks of this process include the use of the excessive heat during compression moulding; closed, non-interconnected pore structures, and a non-porous skin layer at the surface of the final product.|$|E
