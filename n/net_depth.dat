40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cumulative}} pan evaporation (CPE) -based irrigation scheduling on growth, yield, crop water use and crop water use efficiency of Irish potatoes (Solannum tuberosum L.) were studied. Irrigation scheduling was at CPE of 20 mm, 30 mm, 40 mm and irrigating at 7 -days rotation (Control). <b>Net</b> <b>depth</b> of 50 mm was used. Pakistan, Nicola, SP and Dual were the four varieties of Irish potatoes {{used for the}} study.

40|$|Using deep {{learning}} {{to improve the}} capabilities of high-resolution satellite images has emerged recently as an important topic in automatic classification. Deep networks track hierarchical high-level features to identify objects; however, enhancing the classification accuracy from low-level features is often disregarded. We therefore proposed a two-stream deep-learning neural network strategy, with a main stream utilizing fine spatial-resolution panchromatic images to retain low-level information under a supervised residual network structure. An auxiliary line employed an unsupervised net to extract high-level abstract and discriminative features from multispectral images to supplement the spectral information in the main stream. Various feature extraction types from the neural network were selected and jointed in the novel net, as the combined high- and low-level features could provide a superior solution to image classification. In traditional convolutional neural networks, increased network depth might not influence the network performance perceptibly; however, we introduced a residual neural network to develop the expressive ability of the deeper net, increasing the role of <b>net</b> <b>depth</b> in feature extraction. To enhance feature robustness, we proposed a novel consolidation part in feature extraction. An adversarial net improved the feature extraction capabilities and aided digging the inherent and discriminative features from data, with increased extraction efficacy. Tests on satellite images indicated the high overall accuracy of our novel net, verifying that <b>net</b> <b>depth</b> or number of convolution kernels affected the classification capability.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fine-grained bed patches were {{monitored}} in {{a representative}} step-pool channel in the Arkansas Ouachita Mountains {{to assess their}} response to near-bankfull streamfl. ow events. These patches are small, relatively well-sorted bed areas predominantly composed of gravel-size and smaller grains. They occupy 5. 2 and 4. 1 % of the active and bankfull channel areas, respectively, over a 100 -m study reach. During each of five simulated flow events with peak discharges {{ranging in size from}} 0. 25 to 1. 34 m”/sec (l. O- to 1. 6 ~yr return periods), 80 % or more of the patches scoured or filled. Patch response frequency shows no difference between patch types, but does vary between hydraulic unit types. Patches show net aggradation in response to all events with fill volumes being two or more times greater than scour volumes. Patch response magnitude appears to vary somewhat between patch types, but not between hydraulic unit types. Both net volume and <b>net</b> <b>depth</b> change vary directly with peak discharge magnitude. The predominance of fill even at flows somewhat above bankfull stage suggests that bankfull events may not be sufficient for maintaining channel form in Ouachita step-plool channels.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Since 2002, a {{total of}} 4, 358 {{derelict}} nets {{were removed from the}} Washington waters of the Salish Sea (WASS), 95 % of which were gillnets. I investigated the causes and rates of gillnet loss from the WASS commercial salmon fishery through interviews with fishers and industry professionals and analysis of historical fishing effort. Major causes of gillnet loss included lack of experience, operator error, equipment malfunction, overcrowding of fishing grounds, mismatch of <b>net</b> <b>depth</b> with ocean depth, and more. The findings suggest that gillnet loss is currently much less frequent than in previous decades characterized by heavy fishing effort (i. e., 1970 s - 1980 s). Analysis of net removal records identified patterns of association between net fishing depths and depths at which derelict nets are found. Spatial analysis and ArcGIS were used to produce a simple model capable of identifying areas of high, moderate and low probability of derelict gillnet occurrence. This model was applied to the British Columbia waters of the Salish Sea (BCSS) where an organized derelict fishing gear removal operation has been identified as a need, but has not yet been implemented. This study refines previous estimates of derelict gillnet quantities in the WASS, identifies the major causes for derelict gillnet loss and produces an exportable model {{that can be used to}} assist the design and implementation of derelict fishing gear surveys and removal efforts in British Columbia and beyond...|$|E

Biopsychology ProgrammeBibliography: leaves 279 - 295 There is {{increased}} concern for harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) susceptibility to incidental mortality in commercial fisheries throughout their range. In {{order to obtain}} information on the incidental capture of harbour porpoise in the western North Atlantic, research was conducted in three fishing regions (St. Bride's, Newfoundland {{during the summer of}} 1993, Jeffreys Ledge in the Gulf of Maine during the fall of 1993 and Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy during the summers of 1994 and 1995) where incidental capture of harbour porpoise in groundfish gillnets was occurring. Data were collected on the procedures used in fishing, the environmental conditions at the time of fishing, characteristics of the porpoise caught and the views of the fishermen regarding the issue of harbour porpoise incidental capture in their nets. [...] A total of 124 harbour porpoises were captured during 465 observer days when 17, 363 nets were hauled. Over three seasons, significant relationships were found between harbour porpoise capture, duration of net soak time and distance of net placement from shore. The depth at which the net was set and the number of nets in a string were related to harbour porpoise bycatch over two seasons. Target species capture varied between seasons, altering the relationship of target species fish and bycatch. For one of the two seasons where mesh size varied, it showed a relationship to harbour porpoise bycatch. Of 85 animals retrieved, 50 were male and 35 female. Lengths and weights of females were greater than males. Estimated age of animals ranged from 0 to 7 + years. Of the total number, 64 % of the porpoises were sexually mature, 23 % were immature, and 13 % were calves. [...] Newfoundland porpoise primarily foraged for capelin, sand lance and herring, while Gulf of Maine/Jeffreys Ledge animals ate pearlsides, silver hake and herring; in the Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy region the diet was primarily Atlantic herring and silver hake. Atlantic herring occurred in 80 % of the stomachs analyzed and was the longest prey fish (44 - 332 mm). [...] Environmental data were collected over the 159 days of the study. Bycatch of the harbour porpoise was correlated with wind speed during both seasons in Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy, with cloud cover during the 1993 summer season in Newfoundland, and with water temperature during the 1994 Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy season. [...] Assessment of elapsed time since death was undertaken to examine the diagnostic usefulness of the vitreous humour and core body temperature in determining postmortem interval. Twenty-four animals from Bay of Fundy bycatches were examined for core temperature and concentrations of various constituents of vitreous humour (glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus) and the data were compared with published data of rectal temperature and serum concentrations of similar elements in live harbour porpoise. Vitreous humour glucose decreased from antemortem serum values, and the level was positively correlated with core temperature. Potassium and magnesium increased from antemortem serum values.

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore how}} {{backboard}} orientation and size impact chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Two backboards of different sizes were tested in longitudinal (head to toe) and latitudinal (side to side) directions {{to assess the impact}} of size and orientation on chest compressions during CPR. The net sternum-to-spine displacement, combined mattress and sternal displacement as well as the axial reaction force were measured during each test. Results: The difference in <b>net</b> compression <b>depth</b> between the larger and smaller backboards ranged between 0. 08 ± 0. 30 cm and 1. 47 ± 0. 13 cm, while the difference in back support stiffness varied between 103. 7 ± 211 N/cm and 688. 1 ± 180. 3. N/cm. The difference in <b>net</b> compression <b>depth</b> between the longitudinal and latitudinal backboard orientations ranged from 0. 07 ± 0. 32 cm to 0. 34 ± 0. 18 cm, while for the back support stiffness the difference was between 13. 4 ± 50. 0. N/cm and 592. 2 ± 211. 0. N/cm. Conclusions: The effect of backboard size on chest compression (CC) performance during CPR was found to be significant with the larger backboard producing deeper chest compressions and higher back support stiffness than the smaller backboard. The impact of backboard orientation was found to depend on the size of the backboard and type of mattress used.

40|$|The fixed nets {{in shallow}} waters are covered all {{over by the}} fine {{attaching}} materials so called "Nuta" which consist of inorganic materials and micro-organisms (Diatoms, Cyanophyta and Protozoa etc), often {{within a short time}} after setting. Usually, fishermen operating the pound net in Omura Bay must clean and take up the net to dry at intervals of 7 or 10 days. If it were not for removing the fouling materials, the catches would be decreased and in the next stage the net become to be occupied by the fouling macro-organisms including algae, sea-squirts, tubeworms, bryozoas, mussels for more than a month. This study was undertaken from the aspect to elucidate the mechanism of fouling and ecological relations between the inorganic and organic materials. We surveyed the seasonal variations of the fine fouling materials in present report. The experiments were carried out at the station in Sakibe Inlet (Sasebo Bay) from January 1958 to July 1959. Samples were collected by the test nets illustrated in Fig. 1. Once a month usually, we hung down the new test nets, taking out the old nets simultaneously which had been laied during a month, two months and three months respectively in the sea. After removing the fine attaching materials and the fouling macro-organisms from each net, then the fine materials were strained through the large mesh sieve (1 mm. mesh) and small one (0. 5 mm. mesh). The fine muds passed through the small meshed were settled in the calibrated tubes and their volumes were recorded in cc. after 24 hours. Informations obtained from the experiments are as follows. The volumes of the fine muds in a month were small than them of 2 and 3 months. Generally, the fine muds of 5 - 7 m. <b>depth</b> <b>nets</b> increased slightly with the period which had been laied in the water, but muds of 0 - 4 m. <b>depth</b> <b>nets</b> were not so always. Also the mud volumes of surface nets were larger than the bottoms in spite of the duration of laying. In nets of the same period of laying, the seasonal variations of the fine muds in 0 - 3 m. <b>depth</b> <b>nets</b> were remarkable, in 4 - 7 m. <b>depth</b> <b>nets</b> were smooth. The seasonal variations of the fine muds in a month may be independent of rainfall and wind velocity of each month. 1 漁網(クレモナ網) に付着する泥について,' 58 年 1 月より' 59 年 6 月までに実験した結果について,二,三の知見を述べた。 2 泥の量は,網の浸漬期間が長期間になると共に,徐々に増加する。その際,表層の量は経月的な変動が大きいが,中層(4 － 5 m層) 以深ではほぼ直線的に増加している。 3 各月のとりあげた,同一期間浸漬網について,表層の網の泥の量は,季節的な変動が大きいが,中層(4 － 5 m層) 以深では変動が小さくなる。また短期間(1 カ月間) の浸漬網では,水深別の泥の量の季節によるカーブは,表層から下層まで平行して動いているが, 2 カ月以上の浸漬網になると平行しなくな る。 4 一般に,浸漬期間の長短にかかわらず,表層ほど泥の量が大きく,深くなるにつれて減少している。 52 カ月網, 3 カ月網の各水深別の泥の量は,網を海に入れた月におけるよりも,とりあげた月の付着の状態により影響をうけている。 6 泥の付着量におよぼす,降水や風の影響はあきらかでない...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between proof nets for mutiplicative linear logic (with unbounded fan-in logical connectives) and Boolean circuits. We give simulations {{of each other in}} the style of the proofs-as-programs correspondence; proof nets correspond to Boolean circuits and cutelimination corresponds to evaluation. The depth of a proof net is defined to be the maximum logical depth of cut formulas in it, and it is shown that every unbounded fan-in Boolean circuit of depth n, possibly with stCONN 2 gates, is polynomially simulated by a proof <b>net</b> of <b>depth</b> O(n) and vice versa. Here, stCONN 2 stands for st-connectivity gates for undirected graphs of degree 2. Let APN i be the class of languages for which there is a polynomial size, log i-depth family of proof nets. We then have APN i = AC i (st CONN 2). 1...|$|R

Dr. Wallich writes in 1862--"By sinking very fine gauze <b>nets</b> to considerable <b>depths,</b> I have repeatedly satisfied myself that Globigerina does not occur in the superficial strata of the ocean."[7] Moreover, having obtained certain living star- fish from a depth of 1,260 fathoms, and found their stomachs full of [...] "fresh-looking Globigerinoe" [...] and their débris--he adduces this fact {{in support of his}} belief that the Globigerinoe live at the bottom.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the conditions necessary to achieve optimum chest compression (CC) performance during constant peak displacement cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This was accomplished by first performing a sensitivity analysis on a theoretical constant peak displacement CPR CC model to identify the parameters with the highest sensitivity. Next, the most sensitive parameters were then optimized for <b>net</b> sternum-to-spine compression <b>depth,</b> using a two-variable non-linear least squares method. The theoretical CC model was found to be most sensitive to: thoracic stiffness, maximum sternal displacement, CC rate, and back support stiffness. Based on a two-variable, non-linear least squares analysis to optimize the model for the <b>net</b> sternum-to-spine compression <b>depth</b> during constant peak displacement CPR, it was found that the optimum ranges for the CC rate and back support stiffness are between 40 - 120  cpm and 241. 0 - 1198. 5  Ncm- 1, respectively. Clinically, this suggests that current ERC guidelines for the CC rate during peak displacement CPR are appropriate; however, practitioners should be aware that the stiffness of the back support surfaces found in many hospitals may be sub-optimal and should consider using a backboard or a concrete floor to enhance CPR effectiveness. © 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

40|$|Mesopelagic {{fish were}} {{collected}} using a 1 m** 2 Double-MOCNESS (Multiple Opening and Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System) and 4. 5 m** 2 IKMT (Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl). The main {{portion of the}} IKMT was 20 mm knotted nylon, and the tail bag was 3 mm knotless nylon. Oblique IKMT tows were made to a maximum depth of 500 m at a tow speed of 3. 5 knots. The original cruise plan intended for nighttime IKMT tows, but tow times varied due to operational constraints. The MOCNESS was equipped with 20 nets of 333 µm mesh size; 10 nets per side. The towing speed was 2 knots. Samples were collected to a maximum depth of 1250 m. The first oblique nets sampled from the surface to the max depth, and the other <b>nets</b> sampled <b>depth</b> stratified bins of the water column. MOCNESS hauls were performed during day and night to investigate diel vertical migrations. Mesoplelagic fish were processed on board. All fish were picked from all IKMT nets, most oblique MOCNESS nets, and the left side <b>nets</b> of the <b>depth</b> stratified MOCNESS samples. The <b>Depth</b> stratified <b>nets</b> from {{the right side of}} the MOCNESS frame were preserved in 5 % formalin for future quantitative analyses of the nekton. Fish were identified to the lowest possible taxa using Whitehead et al. (1984) and Fahay (2007). Standard length of each fish was measured to the nearest 0. 1 mm using a digital caliper. Measured and identified fish were frozen in an - 80 °C freezer, and shipped to the University of Hamburg at the end of the cruise...|$|R
