40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{principles}} of the European Union functioning is even and balanced regional development. However, considerable socioeconomic disparities can be still observed across the regions in Latvia, with its monocentric, i. e., capital city-oriented, distribution of people and economic activities instead of a polycentric one. This factor negatively affects the development of the country’s regions. According to the <b>NUTS</b> <b>classification</b> of the European Union, Latvia represents a NUTS 3 region, yet there are five planning regions and six statistical regions in country, and the overall situation along with internal processes in these regions are radically different. Within the framework of the Latvian National Programme EKOSOC-LV, the present paper focuses on smart growth as a tool for regional convergence to be applied in the context of regional development. A new Smart Development Index was created and the Analytic Hierarchy Process was employed to analyse one of the regions in Latvia – Latgale and its 19 municipalities focusing on the expansion of local entrepreneurial activity and the important role of innovative high-tech enterprises in it...|$|E

However, NUTS concept, as all definitions, is rather arbitrary. Not only the administrative units have been structured through “accidental ” historical conditions but the reliability of the measurement of the population in an area is disputable as long as the mobility is strengthened and the “usual residence ” becomes more and more vague. Concerning the auxiliary criteria, they are also heterogeneous and they are rather perceptions imposed by decision-makers than physical entities.

40|$|It {{is known}} that as of 1998 Romania has started a Top-Down process of regionalization. The main purpose of this process was to {{subdivide}} the national territory according to the criteria of the <b>NUTS</b> <b>classification</b> used in the European Union both for statistical purposes and as a dimension to ac-cess EU fundings. Within this framework the paper aims to assess {{the development of the}} competitive-ness of the “new” Romanian regions with a particular focus on innovation seen as a determining fac-tor. For this purpose are mainly used the data shown in the last report on the Regional Competitive Index, by making comparisons with the different European countries and their regions. It emerges that even in a context of progress towards a higher competitiveness, regions in Romania show a substantial deficit in terms of innovation. This condition seems to be indicative of a structural weakness of the innovation process related to both the regional economic structure and to the system of R & D. To keep upwith the other European regional economies is crucial that significant efforts are made in the directionof promoting innovation and thus competitiveness also to improve integration in the dynamics of the European economy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of {{the second phase of the}} project whose main objective is to provide an analytical basis for evaluating the level of development of the Croatian territorial units, i. e. municipalities in this particular case. In the second phase, a structural equation model with latent variables is estimated with the purpose to test the validity of the first (simple) model and its results. The structural model takes into account complex casual relations between simple and joint indicators (factors) used in the model, but its output is a single development level scale which allows interval ranking of the territorial units. On the other hand, the first model makes distinctions between municipalities according to each collective indicator (economic, structural and demogeographic), but it assumes that collective indicators are independent. As the intention from the beginning of the project was to try to categorise territorial units according to the methodology used by Structural Funds and based on <b>NUTS</b> <b>classification,</b> the first model was used for the final evaluation and categorisation of the territorial units, but it was somewhat changed according to the results of the structural equation model. ...|$|E

The basic question addressed by {{this paper is}} how to ‘detect’ objective socio-economic spatial structures instead of ‘defining’ them arbitrarily. The <b>NUTS</b> <b>classification</b> model is rather arbitrary. Not only have the administrative units been structured through ‘accidental’ historical conditions but {{the reliability of the}} measurement of the population in an area is disputable as long as the mobility is strengthened and the ‘usual residence’ becomes more and more vague. Concerning the auxiliary criteria, they are also heterogeneous and are rather perceptions imposed by decision makers than physical entities. The quantitative network analysis (QNA) approach is suggested as a tool to detect macro-structures regarded as socio-economic and natural infrastructure of a ‘macro-region’. This is based on algebraic analysis of a number of variables such as flows of people migration, financial means, information, commodities, bio-diversity elements and parameters of the new relationship between urban and rural areas. In this paper, by using algorithms of QNA, such as Density of flows or Betweenness centrality of places, ‘denserâ€ or more â€œcentral’ places can be differentiated from others, and thus can be used for a more substantial demarcation of ‘macro-regions’.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the relationship between Europeanization and regionalization processes in Turkey in the post-Helsinki Era of 1999. By considering European regional policy and its related pre-accession financial incentives as the most useful and appropriate empirical lenses, it offers an analysis of the causes and mechanisms encouraging regionalization process in Turkey during the EU accession process. Through the analysis of official documents and of in-depth interviews with relevant actors in the EU and Turkey, findings suggest that while some of the changes are considered as direct effects of Europeanization, such as the creation of territorial system according to <b>NUTS</b> <b>classification,</b> other developments are invoked by indirect mechanisms of Europeanization, such as the creation of regional development agencies (RDAs) and their role in regional planning and allocation of national funds. More importantly, the findings illustrate that although the EU’s credibility has declined after 2005 and its regional policy, {{in the sense of the}} implementation of regional policies and management of structural funds, have shifted towards the more centralized model in the post-Lisbon era (for the 2007 - 2013 structural fund programme), developments in these areas in Turkey have gone to opposite directions, more accurately, through the more regionalized model. These changes not only reflect the pre-Lisbon practices of EU regional policy and structural funds underlining a spill-over effect resulting from the dissemination of EU practices and policies, but also contain the spices of Turkish administrative tradition...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{differences}} between rural and urban areas as regards the role of social capital and its effect on self-rated health and subjective well-being among older people in Poland. The sample was selected on the basis of multi-stage clustered design from the non-institutionalized adult population. Analysis was based on 1, 299 elderly people aged 65 and over from the general Polish population who participated in the COURAGE in Europe project. Six regions of Poland were distinguished according to first level of Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (<b>NUTS)</b> <b>classification.</b> As an indicator of social capital, the COURAGE Social Network Index, the OSLO- 3 Social Support Scale, and the three item UCLA Loneliness scale were used, as well as social participation and trust was assessed. Self-rated health (SRH) was measured by WHO-Europe recommended version (ranging from ‘very good’ to ‘very bad’). Well-being was assessed by the Day Reconstruction Method. The results showed that in urban areas, social network and social participation supported positive self-rated health; in rural, older residents the number of years of education and social support played the same role, while self-rated health decreased with an increasing level of loneliness. Self-rated health decreased in both groups of older people with a growing number of diseases. The multivariate linear regression model of predictors of well-being in older age also confirmed differences between urban and rural elderly residents. In rural residents, subjective well-being significantly increased with the positive effect of the social network. In both urban and rural areas, poor assessment of subjective well-being in older age increased with a higher level of loneliness and growing number of chronic diseases...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present {{regional}} business framework which affects small and medium-sized enterprises’ development. The paper presents results of own empirical research, which were conducted in late- 2004 year within two groups: entrepreneurs and local authorities. The research was restricted to two provinces in southern Poland (Lesser Poland Voivodeship - Małopolska and Silesian Voivodeship - Śląsk), which make up one region within the EU <b>NUTS</b> <b>classification</b> (region II). The first research group consisted of 109 micro, small and medium-sized firms random sample and the second one of 150 commune authorities. The empirical study {{was based on the}} numerous questions, which thematically can be divided into three groups: local business environment, the entrepreneurial attitude of the owner and the characteristics of the firm as well as the development of a firm. In entrepreneurs’ perceptions nationalwide factors (96, 2 %) and entrepreneurial attitude of entrepreneurs (94, 3 %) matter most on development of small and medium-sized enterprises, but regional factors in entrepreneur’s opinions also play a very important role (76, 5 %). The factors based in regional business environment can be divided into two groups: stimuli and barriers. On the basis of empirical research it is possible to determine upon sixteen barriers and stimuli of small and medium-sized enterprises development, in addition to which it is worth underlining, that they are common for the whole studied community, as only in two incidents statistical essential differences were proved. As far as legal form is concerned differences of financial support evaluation were affirmed (χ 2 = 8, 43 at p = 0, 07, χ 2 YATESA = 9, 05 at p = 0, 06). One-man private enterprises considerably more often than remaining enterprises defined this factor as a barrier. Industrial enterprises in predominant majority (considerably more often than remaining enterprises) defined public financial support as a barrier of small and medium-sized enterprises development (χ 2 = 26, 2 near p = 0, 03), but in addition to which the level of significance in first case is rather weak. Taking additionally the percentages of confirmed dependences into account, which carried out 3 % (16 factors x 4 variables characterizing each enterprise) it can be commonly accepted, that the prepared on the basis of empirical research composition of barriers and stimuli is typical for the all studied enterprises, which allow for generalizations in this range. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Sweden has {{experienced}} a unique epidemic of celiac disease (CD) in children younger than 2 years of age. The epidemic was partly explained by changes over time in infant feeding and indicated a multifactorial aetiology. In CD, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is crucial for health but noncompliance is often reported among adolescents. Knowledge is limited regarding their own perspectives and experiences of managing the disease and adhering to GFD. Objectives To analyse the incidence of CD in epidemic and post epidemic birth cohorts, and explore and understand how adolescents with CD perceive and manage their everyday lives {{in relation to the}} GFD. Methods A population-based incidence register of CD in children covering the entire nation from 1998 to 2003, and part of the country back to 1973. ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria for CD and <b>NUTS</b> <b>classification</b> of regions were used. Incidence rates for each year of diagnosis, age group, gender and region, and cumulative incidence by age for each birth cohort were calculated. Ten focus groups were conducted with 47 CD adolescents aged 15 - 18 years. Transcribed interviews were analysed to illustrate and explain adolescents’ own perspectives concerning life with a GFD, and to search for recurrent stigma-related themes across the groups. Results A considerable gap in the cumulative incidence of CD at comparable ages was demonstrated between birth cohorts of the epidemic and post-epidemic periods. The gap persisted during pre-school years, although it decreased somewhat with age. During the final years of follow-up there was again a gradual increase in incidence rate among children younger than 2 years of age. The childhood populations in ‘West Sweden’ and ‘Småland and the islands’ had a significantly higher incidence rate compared to ‘North Middle Sweden’ and ‘Stockholm’. CD adolescents described an awareness of being different from others produced by meal appearance and the poor availability of gluten-free (GF) food. Eating in public had the effect of making an invisible condition visible and thereby creating a context for felt or enacted stigma. Maintaining invisibility avoided the negative consequences of stigma. The probability of compliance with the GFD was compromised by insufficient knowledge of significant others, problems with the availability and sensory acceptance of GF food, insufficient social support and their perceived dietary deviance. Three different approaches to the GFD emerged: compliers, occasional non-compliers, and non-compliers. Conclusions The difference in CD risk between birth cohorts at comparable ages may suggest an opportunity for primary prevention. Based on post-epidemic incidence trends, the Swedish epidemic might not have been as unique as previously thought, even though its magnitude was striking. The regional variation in CD risk supports multifactorial aetiology. Continued efforts are warranted to define factors besides gluten exposure that modulate CD risk. CD adolescents experience various dilemmas related to the GFD. It can produce stigma experiences in adolescence, and dietary compliance (or lack of) can be understood in terms of dealing with GFD concealment and disclosure. The increase in CD prevalence over time and unmet needs in young celiacs require resources to attain adequate levels of dietetic provision, regulated subsidies for covering additional costs for GF food, evidence-based practice, and increased general CD awareness for optimum clinical outcomes...|$|E
