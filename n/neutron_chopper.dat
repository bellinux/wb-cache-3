40|$|The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) 800 MeV proton linear {{accelerator}} (linac) operates at a maximum repetition rate of twice the AC power line frequency, i. e. 120 Hz. The start of each machine cycle occurs a fixed delay after each zero-crossing of the AC line voltage. Fluctuations in the AC line frequency and phase are therefore present on all linac timing signals. Proper beam acceleration along the linac {{requires that the}} timing signals remain well synchronized to the AC line. For <b>neutron</b> <b>chopper</b> spectrometers, e. g., PHAROS at the Manuel Lujan Jr. Neutron Scattering Center, accurate neutron energy selection requires that precise synchronization be maintained between the beam-on-target arrival time and the <b>neutron</b> <b>chopper</b> rotor position. This is most easily accomplished when the chopper is synchronized to a stable, fixed frequency signal. A new zero-crossing circuit which employs a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) has been developed to increase the phase and frequency stability of the linac timing signals and thereby improve <b>neutron</b> <b>chopper</b> performance while simultaneously maintaining proper linac operation. Results of timing signal data analysis and modeling and {{a description of the}} PLL circuit are presented...|$|E

40|$|Neutron Source {{operates}} at 30 Hz. Its beam spill must be locked to <b>neutron</b> <b>choppers</b> with a precision of 5 0. 5 US. A chopper and an accelerator have large and diff-erent inertias. This makes synchronization by phase lock to the 60 Hz power line extremely difficult. We solved the phasing problem by running both the Ring Magnet Power Supply (RMPS) of the synchrotron and the chopper motors {{from a common}} oscillator that is stable to 1 ppm and by controlling five quantities of the RMPS. The quantities controlled by feedback loops are dc current, injection current, ejection current, reso-nant frequency, and the phase shift between the syn-chrotron peak field and the chopper window...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} the {{production}} of neutrons at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) is tightly coupled to the instantaneous phase of the local commercial power grid. <b>Neutron</b> <b>choppers</b> require active control in order to follow the phase of the grid. A digital signal processor (DSP) based control system has been developed for active phase control of low speed choppers with large moments of inertia. Two of these systems are presently in use and a third system, now being tested, is able to maintain rotor phase control within 2. 6 us (sigma) of the coupled power grid. The amount of time of flight data that must be discarded due to chopper phase errors is typically less than 1 percent. The current system {{is in the process}} of being redesigned as VME module running under the EPICS controls software. The design and performance of the phase controller are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Neutron</b> <b>choppers</b> at spallation-neutron {{facilities}} are rotating devices that are precisely phased to chop a neutron beam. Depending on the mass, moment-ofinertia, and velocity of rotation, a chopper {{can have a}} large amount of stored kinetic energy. For example, the PHAROS T-zero chopper at the LANSCE facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory has a rotating kinetic energy of over 1 MJ. When energy levels are this high and for other logistical reasons, it is often much more practical to develop and test chopper speed and phase controllers using a hardware simulator than an actual chopper. This paper describes the design and performance of a programmable DSP-based chopper simulator developed and used at LANSCE. Chopper models are first developed using Simulink and then coded for uploading to the DSP. Several chopper models have been developed all of which include moment-of-inertia, losses, motor parameters, and rotating speed. The simulator receives, as input, an analog control voltage and outputs a digital topdead-center (TDC) pulse train. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Operation of <b>neutron</b> {{bandwidth}} limiting <b>chopper</b> requires high controlling precision. Phase {{difference between}} the chopper rotor and the synchronous pulse signal should be maintained to be fixed. Rotating frequency of the rotor needs to be very stable. To achieve the above technical requirements, control scheme, dynamic balance, and other means are made. Thus influences to control accuracy are effectively reduced, which are from rotor asymmetry and neutron absorbing materials. In the case described in this paper, phase tracking error was controlled under ± 0. 10752 °with 90 % confidence for the designed chopper...|$|R

40|$|Collaborative efforts {{between the}} Neutronics and Target Design Group at the Instituto de Fusión Nuclear and the Molecular Spectroscopy Group at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source {{date back to}} 2012 {{in the context of}} the ESS-Bilbao project. The {{rationale}} for these joint activities was twofold, namely: to assess the realm of applicability of the low-energy neutron source proposed by ESS-Bilbao - for details; and to explore instrument capabilities for pulsed-neutron techniques in the range 0. 05 - 3 ms, a time range where ESS-Bilbao and ISIS could offer a significant degree of synergy and complementarity. As part of this collaboration, J. P. de Vicente has spent a three-month period within the ISIS Molecular Spectroscopy Group, to gain hands-on experience on the practical aspects of neutron-instrument design and the requisite neutron-transport simulations. To date, these activities have resulted in a joint MEng thesis as well as a number of publications and contributions to national and international conferences. Building upon these previous works, the primary aim of this report is to provide a self-contained discussion of general criteria for instrument selection at ESS-Bilbao, the first accelerator-driven, low-energy neutron source designed in Spain. To this end, Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of the current design parameters of the accelerator and target station. Neutron moderation is covered in Chapter 2, where we take a closer look at two possible target-moderator-reflector configurations and pay special attention to the spectral and temporal characteristics of the resulting neutron pulses. This discussion provides a necessary starting point to assess the operation of ESSB in short- and long-pulse modes. These considerations are further explored in Chapter 3, dealing with the primary characteristics of ESS-Bilbao as a short- or long-pulse facility in terms of accessible dynamic range and spectral resolution. Other practical aspects including background suppression and the use of fast choppers are also discussed. The guiding principles introduced in the first three chapters are put to use in Chapter 4 where we analyse in some detail the capabilities of a small-angle scattering instrument, as well as how specific scientific requirements can be mapped onto the optimal use of ESS-Bilbao for condensed-matter research. Part 2 of the report contains additional supporting documentation, including a description of the ESSB McStas component, a detailed characterisation of moderator response and neutron pulses, and estimates ofparameters associated with the design and operation of <b>neutron</b> <b>choppers.</b> In closing this brief foreword, we wish to thank both ESS-Bilbao and ISIS for their continuing encouragement and support along the way...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of the new Cold <b>Neutron</b> <b>Chopper</b> Spectrometer (CNCS) at the Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge are described. CNCS is a direct geometry inelastic time-of-flight spectrometer, designed to cover essentially the same energy and momentum transfer ranges as IN 5 at ILL, LET at ISIS, DCS at NIST, TOFTOF at FRM 2, AMATERAS at J-PARC, PHAROS at LANSCE and NEAT at HZB, at similar energy resolution. Measured values of key figures such as neutron flux at sample position and energy resolution are compared between measurements and ray tracing Monte Carlo simulations, and good agreement (better than 20 % of absolute numbers) has been achieved. The instrument performs {{very well in the}} cold and thermal neutron energy ranges, and promises to become a workhorse for the neutron scattering community for quasielastic and inelastic scattering experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{first eight}} years of {{operation}} of the Cold <b>Neutron</b> <b>Chopper</b> Spectrometer (CNCS) at the Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge is being reviewed.

CNCS is an extremely powerful and versatile instrument and offers leading edge performance in terms of beam intensity, energy resolution, and flexibility to trade one for another. Experiments are being routinely performed with the sample at extreme conditions: T~ 0. 05 K, p>= 2 GPa and B= 8 T can be achieved individually or in combination. In particular, CNCS is in a position to advance the state of the art with inelastic neutron scattering under pressure, and some of the recent accomplishments in this area will be presented in more detail...|$|E
40|$|A modern physics {{facility}} must synchronize {{the operation}} of equipment over a wide area. The {{primary purpose of the}} site wide SNS synchronization and timing system is to synchronize {{the operation of}} the LINAC, accumulator ring and neutron choppers and to distribute appropriate timing signals to accelerator systems, including the Injector, LINAC, Accumulator Ring and Experimental Facilities. Signals to be distributed include the ring RF clock, real-time timing triggers, machine mode and other informational events. Timing triggers and clocks from the SNS synchronization and timing system are used to synchronize hardware operations including the MEBT beam chopper, RF turn on, synchronous equipment state changes, as well as data acquisition for power supplies and beam diagnostics equipment. This paper will describe the timing equipment being designed for the SNS facility and discuss the tradeoffs between conflicting demands of the accelerator and <b>neutron</b> <b>chopper</b> performance due to AC power grid frequency fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method is presented with allows {{to estimate the}} energy resolution of time-of-flight neutron spectrometers, {{as well as its}} partial contributions, over a dynamical range that extends from the elastic line to the accessible inelastic regions. Such a method, already successfully applied in the past to the TOSCA and HET neutron inelastic scattering spectrometers installed at the ISIS neutron spallation source [A M Gaspar, PhD Thesis, Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa, 2004], is here applied to the high resolution time-of-flight spectrometer TOFTOF, mainly dedicated to quasi-elastic neutron scattering studies and installed at the new neutron reactor FRM II. To make such calculations easily understandable, the principle of work of the TOFTOF instrument and of each of its components is explained in detail. A simply method {{that can be used to}} estimate the instrument intensity, i. e. of the number of neutrons arriving at the sample position per unit time, is also briefly outlined. To the benefit of the TOFTOF users, graphs displaying the dependencies of the instrument resolution at the elastic line and of the instrument intensity on the relevant instrument parameters, i. e the wavelength of the incident <b>neutrons,</b> the <b>choppers</b> speed of rotation and the frame overlap ratio, are presented, in the form of iso-resolution or iso-intensity lines. The method of estimation of the frame overlap ratio that is commonly used at time-of-flight instruments such as TOFTOF is also explained and alternative options concerning this parameter, depending on the dynamical range of interest, are briefly addressed.

40|$|The {{time-of-flight}} small-angle diffractometer SAND {{has been}} serving the scientific user community since 1996. One notable feature of SAND is its capability {{to measure the}} scattered intensity in a wide Q (4 {pi}sin{theta}/{lambda}, where 2 {theta} is the scattering angle and {lambda} is the wavelength of the neutrons) range of 0. 0035 to 0. 5 {angstrom}{sup {minus} 1 } in a single measurement. The optical alignment system {{makes it easy to}} set up the instrument and the sample. The cryogenically cooled MgO filter reduces the fast neutrons over two orders of magnitude, while still transmitting over 70 % of the cold <b>neutrons.</b> A drum <b>chopper</b> running at 15 Hz suppresses the delayed neutron background. SAND has a variety of ancillary equipment to control the sample environment. In this paper we describe the features of the SAND instrument, compare its data on a few standard samples with those measured at well established centers in the world, and display two scientific examples which take advantage of measuring data in a wide Q-range in a single measurement.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} backscattering time-of-flight spectrometer MIRACLES approved for construction at the long-pulse European Spallation Source (ESS). MIRACLES's unparalleled combination of variable resolution, high flux, extended energy, and momentum transfer (0. 2 - 6 Å- 1) ranges will open new avenues for neutron backscattering spectroscopy. Its remarkable flexibility {{can be attributed to}} 3 key elements: the long-pulse time structure and low repetition rate of the ESS <b>neutron</b> source, the <b>chopper</b> cascade that tailors the moderator pulse in the primary part of the spectrometer, and the bent Si(111) analyzer crystals arranged in a near-backscattering geometry in the secondary part of the spectrometer. Analytical calculations combined with instrument Monte-Carlo simulations show that the instrument will provide a variable elastic energy resolution, δ(Latin small letter h with stroke ω), between 2 and 32 μeV, when using a wavelength of λ ≈ 6. 267 Å (Si(111) -reflection), with an energy transfer range, Latin small letter h with stroke ω, centered at the elastic line from - 600 to + 600 μeV. In addition, when selecting λ ≈ 2. 08 Å (i. e., the Si(333) -reflection), δ(Latin small letter h with stroke ω) can be relaxed to 300 μeV and Latin small letter h with stroke ω from about 10 meV in energy gain to ca - 40 meV in energy loss. Finally, the dynamic wavelength range of MIRACLES, approximately 1. 8 Å, can be shifted within the interval of 2 - 20 Å to allow the measurement of low-energy inelastic excitations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{bandwidth}} limiting <b>neutron</b> <b>chopper</b> {{prototype for}} spallation-neutron facilities is introduced. The content includes {{the structure of}} the chopper, design specifications, neutron absorber construction and motor phase control. The investigation shows that the strength of Boron Carbide + Resin composite covered on an Aluminum alloy disk is high enough when the chopper rotor runs at a speed of 3000 rpm. A general purpose PM servo motor was equipped for the chopper. High accuracy phase tracking performance was achieved for the chopper based on a dual-loop motor control structure including a velocity loop and a phase loop. Torque disturbance was well restrained by the velocity control loop at a high sampling rate with help of a high resolution encoder in the motor. With the stable inner loop, the phase loop could work at a low sampling frequency equal to the rotation speed. Thus the rotor was synchronous with an inner reference pulse within less than 10 s.
