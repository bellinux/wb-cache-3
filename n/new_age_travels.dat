500|$|In {{discussing}} the <b>New</b> <b>Age,</b> academics have varyingly referred to [...] "New Age spirituality" [...] and [...] "New Age religion". Those {{involved in the}} <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> rarely consider it to be [...] "religion"—negatively associating that term solely with organized religion—and instead describe their practices as [...] "spirituality". Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> milieu as a [...] "religion". York described the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> as a <b>new</b> religious movement (NRM). Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation; Heelas believed that while elements of the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> represented NRMs, this {{did not apply to}} every <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> group.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> spiritual movement in {{its relationship with}} Indigenous cultures. Indigenous spiritual traditions have been appropriated to support relevant <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> theories. It critiques <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> perceptions of Indigenous cultures as misinformed and argues this misinformation is proliferated through certain <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> practices. It argues that the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> can achieve a sustaining, earth-based spiritual practice without resorting to the appropriation of Indigenous traditions. Neo-paganism holds many of the qualities that New Agers seek in Indigenous traditions and is a potential alternative avenue of spiritual solace to the appropriation of Indigenous culture. The embodiment of <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> goals can be understood {{within the context of}} environmental ethics philosophies. Alternative festivals that operate with a spiritual ethic are explored as evidence that the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> can and in some areas, does operate in a positive, life-affirming manner. Importantly, the thesis argues that re-interpretation of Indigenous culture by the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> is neither welcome nor necessary...|$|R
