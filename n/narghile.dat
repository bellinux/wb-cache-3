25|$|Additional {{contributing}} factors {{to the spread}} of <b>narghile</b> use include free time and boredom of Syrian youth, social pressures, euphoric feeling after inhalation, aesthetic appeal of the <b>narghile</b> itself, smoking as a replacement for alcohol, widespread availability of the <b>narghile</b> in cafes and restaurants, and glamorization and commercialization of the practice in the media.|$|E
25|$|Both smokers and non-smokers in Syria {{acknowledge}} that {{smell and taste}} are noteworthy appealing factors of the <b>narghile.</b> This mention of the narghile’s sensory appeal signifies {{the importance of the}} introduction of Maasel, a specially prepared fruit-flavored tobacco, in replacement of Ajami, a raw unflavored tobacco, in regard to the growing popularity of the <b>narghile.</b> The spread of Maasel in the 1990s produced a surge in popularity for <b>narghile</b> smoking. In addition to providing the pleasing aroma and taste, Maasel also simplifies the process of <b>narghile</b> preparation in comparison to the more complex process of preparing the traditional Ajami.|$|E
25|$|Although {{habitual}} <b>Narghile</b> smokers {{are less}} likely than cigarette smokers to perceive their habit as an addiction, many report steadily increasing frequency and intensity of <b>narghile</b> use, difficulty quitting, and withdrawal symptoms when attempting to quit.|$|E
60|$|Leaving {{the two men}} to {{look after}} the horses, Edgar and Sidi entered the city. The scene was {{intensely}} interesting, Cairo being vastly more oriental in its appearance than Alexandria. The narrow streets were crowded; strict orders had been issued against plundering, Napoleon being anxious to win the good-will of the population, and merchandise of all sorts was displayed in the shops. Each trade had its special bazaar, the gold and silversmiths, the dealers in silks, in carpets, richly embroidered garments, tobacco, long pipes with jewelled mouthpieces, <b>narghiles</b> with their long twisted stems; workers in iron, vendors of the yellow shoes used by the women in walking, the dainty gold-embroidered velvet slippers for indoors, or the pointed upturned shoes of the men, had each its own bazaars scattered throughout the streets.|$|R
60|$|The chamber {{in which}} the bewildered Robert now found himself was more luxurious, if less rich, than any which he had yet seen. Low settees of claret-coloured plush were {{scattered}} in orderly disorder over a mossy Eastern carpet. Deep lounges, reclining sofas, American rocking-chairs, all were to be had for the choosing. One {{end of the room}} was walled by glass, and appeared to open upon a luxuriant hot-house. At the further end a double line of gilt rails supported a profusion of the most recent magazines and periodicals. A rack at each side of the inlaid fireplace sustained a long line of the pipes of all places and nations--English cherrywoods, French briars, German china-bowls, carved meerschaums, scented cedar and myall-wood, with Eastern <b>narghiles,</b> Turkish chibooques, and two great golden-topped hookahs. To right and left were a series of small lockers, extending in a treble row for the whole length of the room, with the names of the various brands of tobacco scrolled in ivory work across them. Above were other larger tiers of polished oak, which held cigars and cigarettes.|$|R
60|$|As piety forbids the Turks to eat {{during the}} weary {{daylight}} {{hours of the}} Ramazan, they spend their time profitably in sleeping until the welcome sunset, when the town wakens: all the lanterns are lighted up; all the pipes begin to puff, and the <b>narghiles</b> to bubble; all the sour-milk-and-sherbet-men begin to yell out the excellence of their wares; all the frying-pans in the little dirty cookshops begin to friz, and the pots to send forth a steam: and through this dingy, ragged, bustling, beggarly, cheerful scene, we began now to march towards the Bow Street of Jaffa. We bustled through a crowded narrow archway {{which led to the}} cadi's police- office, entered the little room, atrociously perfumed with musk, and passing by the rail-board, where the common sort stood, mounted the stage upon which his worship and friends sat, and squatted down on the divans in stern and silent dignity. His honour ordered us coffee, his countenance evidently showing considerable alarm. A black slave, whose duty seemed to be to prepare this beverage in a side-room with a furnace, prepared for each of us about a teaspoonful of the liquor: his worship's clerk, I presume, a tall Turk of a noble aspect, presented it to us; and having lapped up the little modicum of drink, the British lion began to speak.|$|R
25|$|<b>Narghile</b> {{addiction}} {{tends to}} be more context dependent, as many who smoke it only crave it around friends or in the typical <b>Narghile</b> café setting. Cigarette smoking is a more personal pursuit, and desire to smoke is therefore constant regardless of the context.|$|E
25|$|<b>Narghile</b> smoking, however, is {{generally}} socially acceptable. Tensions can sometimes arise between non-smoking parents and smoking {{children as well}} as between smokers and non smokers within groups of friends. <b>Narghile</b> smoking can sometimes cause smokers to only spend recreation time with other smokers.|$|E
25|$|Anthropologists {{hypothesize that}} the Syrian public {{considers}} <b>narghile</b> smoke {{to be less}} dangerous than cigarette smoke due to the perceived “filtration” process that occurs as the tobacco passes through water before it gets inhaled. This hypothesis has become less popular following increasing prevalence of surveying and research, which show that Syrian <b>narghile</b> smokers are aware that water is not a reliable means of filtration. The social atmosphere and positive connotation of smoking the <b>narghile</b> is likely to overshadow the health concerns and make it ultimately seem less harmful than smoking cigarettes.|$|E
50|$|Count Konstantin Konstantinovich Pahlen, {{during his}} travels {{through the area}} in 1908 and 1909, {{described}} such dances, and commissioned photographs of the dancers:Cushions and rugs were fetched, on which we gratefully reclined, great carpets were spread over the court, the natives puffed at their <b>narghiles,</b> politely offering them to us, and the famous Khivan bachehs made their entrance. Backstage, an orchestra mainly composed of twin flutes, kettle drums, {{and half a dozen}} man-sized silver trumpets took up its stand. Opposite us a door left slightly ajar led to the harem quarters. We caught a glimpse of flashing eyes as the inmates thronged to the door to have a good look at us and watch the performance.The orchestra started up with a curious, plaintive melody, the rhythm being taken up and stressed by the kettle drums, and four bachehs took up their positions on the carpet. The bachehs are young men specially trained to perform a particular set of dances. Barefoot, and dressed like women in long, brightly coloured silk smocks reaching below their knees and narrow trousers fastened tightly round their ankles, their arms and hands sparkle with rings and bracelets. They wear their hair long, reaching below the shoulders, though the front part of the head is clean shaven. The nails of the hands and feet are painted red, the eyebrows are jet black and meet over the bridge of the nose. The dances consist of sensuous contortions of the body and a rhythmical pacing to and fro, with the hands and arms raised in a trembling movement. As the ballet proceeded the number of dancers increased, the circle grew in size, the music waxed shriller and shriller and the eyes of the native onlookers shone with admiration, while the bachehs intoned a piercing melody in time with the ever-growing tempo of the music. The Heir explained that they were chanting of love and the beauty of women. Swifter and swifter moved the dancers till they finally sank to the floor, seemingly exhausted and enchanted by love. They were followed by others, but the general theme was usually the same.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{got into}} the bazaar among this race, somehow I {{felt as if they}} were all friends. There sat the merchants in their little shops, quiet and solemn, but with {{friendly}} looks. There was no smoking, it was the Ramazan; no eating, the fish and meat fizzing in the enormous pots of the cook-shops are only for the Christians. The children abounded; the law is not so stringent upon them, and many wandering merchants were there selling figs (in the name of the Prophet, doubtless) for their benefit, and elbowing onwards with baskets of grapes and cucumbers. Countrymen passed bristling over with arms, each with a huge bellyful of pistols and daggers in his girdle; fierce, but not the least dangerous. Wild swarthy Arabs, who had come in with the caravans, walked solemnly about, very different in look and demeanour from the sleek inhabitants of the town. Greeks and Jews squatted and smoked, their shops tended by sallow-faced boys, with large eyes, who smiled and welcomed you in; negroes bustled about in gaudy colours; and women, with black nose-bags and shuffling yellow slippers, chattered and bargained at the doors of the little shops. There was the rope quarter and the sweetmeat quarter, and the pipe bazaar and the arm bazaar, and the little turned-up shoe quarter, and the shops where ready-made jackets and pelisses were swinging, and the region where, under the ragged awning, regiments of tailors were at work. The sun peeps through these awnings of mat or canvas, which are hung over the narrow lanes of the bazaar, and ornaments them with a thousand freaks of light and shadow. Cogia Hassan Alhabbal's shop is in a blaze of light; while his neighbour, the barber and coffee-house keeper, has his premises, his low seats and <b>narghiles,</b> his queer pots and basins, in the shade. The cobblers are always good- natured; there was one who, I am sure, has been revealed to me in my dreams, in a dirty old green turban, with a pleasant wrinkled face like an apple, twinkling his little grey eyes as he held them up to talk to the gossips, and smiling under a delightful old grey beard, which did the heart good to see. You divine the conversation between him and the cucumber-man, as the Sultan used to understand the language of birds. Are any of those cucumbers stuffed with pearls, and is that Armenian with the black square turban Haroun Alraschid in disguise, standing yonder by the fountain where the children are drinking--the gleaming marble fountain, chequered all over with light and shadow, and engraved with delicate arabesques and sentences from the Koran? ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{first of}} my senses which {{returned}} {{to me was}} that of smell, and I seemed almost drowned in the spicy perfumes of Araby. Then my eyes became aware of a green soft fluttering, as of the leaves of a great forest, but quickly I perceived that the fluttering {{was caused by the}} green scarfs of a countless multitude of women. They were [...] "fine women" [...] in the popular sense of the term, and were of the school of beauty admired by the Faithful of Islam, and known to Mr. Bailey, in [...] "Martin Chuzzlewit," [...] as [...] "crumby." [...] These fond attendant nymphs carried me into gardens twain, in each two gushing springs, in each fruit, and palms, and pomegranates. There were the blessed reclining, precisely as the Prophet has declared, [...] "on beds the linings whereof are brocade, and the fruit of the two gardens within reach to cull." [...] There also were the [...] "maids of modest glances," [...] previously indifferent to the wooing [...] "of man or ginn." [...] "Bright and large-eyed maids kept in their tents, reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets. About the golden couches went eternal youths with goblets and ewers, and a cup of flowing wine. No headache shall they feel therefrom," [...] says the compassionate Prophet, [...] "nor shall their wits be dimmed." [...] And all that land is misty and fragrant with the perfume of the softest Latakia, and the gardens are musical with the bubbling of countless narghiles; and I must say that to the Christian soul which enters that paradise the whole place has, certainly, a rather curious air, as of a highly transcendental Cremorne. There could be no doubt, however, that the Faithful were enjoying themselves amazingly--"right lucky fellows," [...] as we read in the new translation of the Koran. Yet even here all was not peace and pleasantness, for I heard my name called by a small voice, in a tone of patient subdued querulousness. Looking hastily round, I with some difficulty recognized, in a green turban and silk gown to match, my old college tutor and professor of Arabic. Poor old Jones had been the best and the most shy of university men. As there was never any undergraduate in his time (it is different now) who wished to learn Arabic, his place had been a sinecure, and he had chiefly devoted his leisure to [...] "drawing" [...] pupils who were too late for college chapel. The sight of a lady of his acquaintance in the streets had at all times been alarming enough to drive him into a shop or up a lane, and he had not survived the creation of the first batch of married fellows. How he had got into this thoroughly wrong paradise was a mystery which he made no attempt to explain. [...] "A nice place this, eh?" [...] he said to me. [...] "Nice gardens; remind me of Magdalene a good deal. It seems, however, to be decidedly rather gay just now; don't you think so? Commemoration week, perhaps. A great many young ladies up, certainly; a good deal of cup drunk in the gardens too. I always did prefer to go down in Commemoration week, myself; never was a dancing man. There {{is a great deal of}} dancing here, but the young ladies dance alone, rather like what is called the ballet, I believe, at the opera. I must say the young persons are a little forward; a little embarrassing it is to be alone here, especially as I have forgotten a good deal of my Arabic. Don't you think, my dear fellow, you and I could manage to give them the slip? Run away from them, eh?" [...] He uttered a timid little chuckle, and at that moment an innumerable host of houris began a ballet d'action illustrative of a series of events in the career of the Prophet. It was obvious that my poor uncomplaining old friend was really very miserable. The [...] "thornless loto trees" [...] were all thorny to him, and the [...] "tal'h trees with piles of fruit, the outspread shade, and water outpoured" [...] could not comfort him in his really very natural shyness. A happy thought occurred to me. In early and credulous youth I had studied the works of Cornelius Agrippa and Petrus de Abano. Their lessons, which had not hitherto been of much practical service, recurred to my mind. Stooping down, I drew a circle round myself and my old friend in the fragrant white blossoms which were strewn so thick that they quite hid the grass. This circle I fortified by the usual signs employed, as Benvenuto Cellini tells us, in the conjuration of evil spirits. I then proceeded to utter one of the common forms of exorcism. Instantly the myriad houris assumed the forms of irritated demons; the smoke from the uncounted <b>narghiles</b> burned thick and black; the cries of the frustrated ginns, who were no better than they should be, rang wildly in our ears; the palm-trees shook beneath a mighty wind; the distant summits of the minarets rocked and wavered, and, with a tremendous crash, the paradise of the Faithful disappeared.|$|R
25|$|<b>Narghile</b> smokers are {{generally}} less {{cognizant of the}} narghile’s health effects on themselves and the people around them.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} tobacco {{smoke in the}} form of the <b>Narghile</b> can be attributed to a variety of factors. French anthropologist Kamel Chaoucachi has isolated the three main elements of the narghile’s appeal, which include “passing of the smoking hose, conversation of the actors, and the nature of time within the created situation.” These factors highlight the social benefits of smoking the <b>Narghile</b> and the general increase in trendiness of the experience.|$|E
25|$|<b>Narghile</b> smokers {{generally}} start {{smoking in}} their early 20’s as they find that the activity produces a sense of togetherness among friends and facilitates an enjoyable social situation.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{successful}} cut-down on public smoking, the ban has also caused {{an increase in}} <b>narghile</b> delivery and at-home smoking, since this type of smoking is not prohibited by the ban.|$|E
25|$|In Syria, Grand Mufti Ahmad Badruddin Hassoun {{issued a}} fatwa prohibiting {{every type of}} smoking, {{including}} cigarettes and <b>narghile,</b> {{as well as the}} selling and buying of tobacco and any affiliation with tobacco distribution (see also Smoking in Syria).|$|E
25|$|Relapses {{tend to be}} {{attributed}} to stressful situations and having friend groups that smoke. Relapses are also caused by cigarette smokers’ use of the <b>narghile</b> {{as a means of}} easing off of cigarettes, which ends up proliferating their dependence.|$|E
25|$|Although {{specifics}} of the health hazards of tobacco use are not widely known, Syrian students tend to generally associate smoking the <b>narghile</b> with an increased risk in respiratory disease while mainly associating smoking cigarettes with {{an increased risk of}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|Media {{campaigns are}} a viable means of {{spreading}} {{knowledge to the}} public of {{the health effects of}} smoking. This is especially important in relation to <b>narghile</b> smoking, as its positive cultural perception is a large factor in its increasing popularity.|$|E
25|$|The Fatwa Higher Council of Syria {{recently}} {{reiterated the}} importance of the 2007 fatwa (Islamic legal pronouncement), issued by Syria’s Grand Mufti Ahmad Badruddin Hassoun prohibiting every type of smoking, including cigarettes and <b>narghile,</b> as well as the selling and buying of tobacco and any affiliation with tobacco distribution.|$|E
25|$|Women in Syria {{and across}} the entire Middle East are {{becoming}} increasingly vulnerable to the tobacco epidemic. In the past, Middle Eastern social customs deterred women from smoking tobacco in any form. <b>Narghile</b> smoking, however, is now a more acceptable activity for Syrian women and {{is seen as an}} indicator of increased socio-economic liberalization.|$|E
25|$|The factual {{history of}} smoking in Syria is uncertain. Cannabis was {{common in the}} Middle East {{before the arrival of}} tobacco, and is known to have existed in at least 2000 BC. Tobacco use in the middle east dates back to the 16th century. <b>Narghile</b> use is likely to have been a longstanding middle eastern {{tradition}} but may not have been considered a Syrian staple until the narghile’s popularity boom in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Non-Arabs, {{women from}} urban populations, women from smaller households, and women married to non-relatives {{are more likely}} to be smokers of <b>narghile</b> and {{cigarettes}} than their counterparts. Christians {{are more likely to}} be smokers than Muslims, and women working for pay are more likely to smoke than those that are unemployed. Sign of the tobacco epidemic spreading to women in poorer levels of society are particularly alarming, as this is the most unlikely sector of the population to be affected.|$|E
25|$|A common belief among users is {{that the}} smoke of a hookah (waterpipe, <b>narghile)</b> is {{significantly}} less dangerous than that from cigarettes. The water moisture induced by the hookah makes the smoke less irritating and may give {{a false sense of}} security and reduce concerns about true health effects. Doctors at institutions including the Mayo Clinic have stated that use of hookah can be as detrimental to a person's health as smoking cigarettes, and a study by the World Health Organization also confirmed these findings.|$|E
2500|$|About a {{third of}} <b>narghile</b> smokers express {{motivation}} to quit. [...] Some <b>narghile</b> smokers who are uninterested in quitting express enthusiasm about continuing their smoking habits in the future.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the positive view of smoking the <b>Narghile,</b> Syrian smokers tend to view cigarette smoking as a “mundane, oppressive, personal addiction.” ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Narghile</b> {{smoking is}} {{currently}} {{perceived as an}} important cultural feature of Syria, most notably {{in the city of}} Aleppo, while cigarette smoking is perceived as a mundane activity with little importance to cultural life. [...] Despite the perception of <b>Narghile</b> being a staple of Syrian culture, Bisher Daaboul of the Syrian Society for Smoking Cessation notes that Narghiles have only been popular since the 1990s and “are not a tradition here in Syria that we have to live with and we have to protect.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Another primary issue {{involves}} the Syrian medical industry and its health care providers. According to {{a sampling of}} Aleppo health care professionals in 2010, 22.4% of physicians and 26% of nurses smoke cigarettes and 9.5% of physicians and 9.4% of nurses smoke the <b>narghile.</b> [...] Health care providers who smoke {{are less likely to}} believe that smoking is harmful and acknowledge the specific health impacts of smoking than those who do not smoke.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking in Syria is {{currently}} banned inside cafes (hookah bars), restaurants {{and other public}} spaces by a presidential decree issued on 12 October 2009 which went into effect on 21 April 2010. Syria was the first Arab country to introduce such a ban. The decree also outlaws smoking in educational institutions, health centres, sports halls, cinemas and theatres and on public transport. The restrictions include the <b>narghile.</b> According to the official [...] Syrian Arab News Agency, fines for violating the ban range from 500 to 100,000 Syrian pounds (US$11 to $2,169).|$|E
2500|$|Businesses say the ban {{is already}} hurting trade, and has, “led {{to a total}} halt in business” Although {{citizens}} {{know that this is}} the government’s attempt to tries improve the nation’s health, changing the tobacco loving culture in this region as well as the dependence on tobacco consumption for business may take some time. [...] As of 2010, 20% of women and 60% of men are said to smoke and 98% of the overall population is affected by passive smoking., [...] <b>Narghile</b> (also known as the hookah or water pipe) and cigarettes are the two main forms of tobacco consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking in Syria is {{steadily}} increasing in popularity amongst the Syrian population, {{mainly in the}} forms of cigarettes or Narghiles. In Syria, the General Organization of Tobacco manages the growth and exportation of tobacco products. Syrians collectively spend about $600 million per year on tobacco consumption. [...] As of 2010, 20% of women and 60% of men smoke and 98% of the overall population is affected by passive smoking. Narghiles (also known as the hookah or water pipe) and cigarettes are the two main forms of tobacco consumption. Despite the assumption that smoking, specifically the <b>narghile,</b> is embedded in Syrian culture, this phenomenon has only recently become widespread. Health officials are currently working on smoking cessation programs and policies, to remove this idea that smoking in Syria {{is an essential part}} of the culture, to educate regarding health effects, and to prevent citizens from smoking in public places.|$|E
6000|$|... "Labour troubles!" [...] exclaimed {{the little}} Sultan rolling up his eyes. [...] "I should say so.

60|$|Ibrahim {{had advised}} Arthur to stay quietly where he was, and not {{venture into the}} city, and he spent his time as he best might by {{the help of a}} <b>narghile,</b> which was hospitably {{presented}} to him, though the strictness of Marabout life forbade the use alike of tobacco and coffee.|$|E
60|$|He led off {{the first}} charade. A Turkish officer with an immense plume of {{feathers}} (the Janizaries {{were supposed to be}} still in existence, and the tarboosh had not as yet displaced the ancient and majestic head-dress of the true believers) was seen couched on a divan, and making believe to puff at a <b>narghile,</b> in which, however, {{for the sake of the}} ladies, only a fragrant pastille was allowed to smoke. The Turkish dignitary yawns and expresses signs of weariness and idleness. He claps his hands and Mesrour the Nubian appears, with bare arms, bangles, yataghans, and every Eastern ornament--gaunt, tall, and hideous. He makes a salaam before my lord the Aga.|$|E
60|$|When {{the whole}} {{operation}} is concluded, you are led--with what heartfelt joy I need not say--softly back to the cooling-room, having been robed in shawls and turbans as before.
