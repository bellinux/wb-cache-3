50|$|Platonia insignis, {{the sole}} {{species of the}} genus Platonia, is a tree of the family Clusiaceae native to South America in the humid forests of Brazil, Paraguay, parts of Colombia and {{northeast}} to Guyana; specially in Amazon Rainforest. Common names include bacuri (and numerous variant spellings thereof; bacur√≠, bacury, bakuri, pacuri, pakuri, pakouri, packoeri, pakoeri), maniballi, <b>naranjillo</b> and bacurizeiro.|$|E
50|$|Trichanthera is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plants in the}} acanthus family containing the single species Trichanthera gigantea, which is known by many common names, including madre de agua, suiban, cenicero, tuno, <b>naranjillo,</b> and palo de agua. It is native to Central America and northern South America. It has also been introduced to other tropical regions such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines.|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{investigation}} of the EtOAc fraction (EF) obtained from the ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum <b>naranjillo</b> (Rutaceae) leaves (EE) by preparative HPLC resulted in the isolation of protocatechuic acid (1), gallic acid (2), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (3), and 5 -O-caffeoylshikimic acid (4). This {{is the first time}} that the presence of compounds 1 - 4 in Z. <b>naranjillo</b> has been reported. Compounds 1 - 4, the EE, and EF were tested in vitro against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. The results showed that the S. mansoni daily egg production decreased by 29. 8 %, 13. 5 % 28. 4 %, 17. 7 %, 16. 3 %, and 6. 4 %, respectively. Compounds 1 and 3 were also able to separate adult worm pairs into male and female. This activity may be correlated with the reduction in egg production, since 1 and 3 showed better inhibitory properties compared with 2 and 4.
