40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of the fluoride (F) content in drinking water sources and the extent of human exposure to different levels of fluoride contamination in the four blocks of Palamu district. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water for the area residents. The permissibility and concentration of fluoride in groundwater samples from different sites in Chainpur, Daltonganj, Bishrampur and Pandu blocks of the Palamu district, Jharkhand, was determined by field kit and laboratory test, respectively. Samples with <b>non</b> <b>permissible</b> concentration of fluoride on an average indicate higher proportion in Daltonganj, Pandu and Chainpur blocks as compared to Bishrampur block. A significantly higher concentration 4. 2 mg L - 1 was found in Daltonganj block i. e. in the depth range of 0 - 50 feet. Looking into the total samples (2864) the percentage distributions of <b>non</b> <b>permissible</b> samples indicate that the depth range of 100 - 150 feet is highly vulnerable to fluoride occurrence. Maximum fluoride concentration and average concentration were highest in samples from hand pumps which are generally pumping from shallow aquifers...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the peroxide value, acid value and rancidity of edible oil which are used in sweet pancake, samosa, confectionery and sandwich shop. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was carried out on all sandwich shops and sweet pancake at north region of Isfahan city. The peroxide value, acid value and rancidity were determined based on national standard procedure number 4179, on thirty samples. Results: The average of peroxide and acid value was 5. 2 and 0. 5, respectively. Around 7. 4 percent of tested oil has a <b>non</b> <b>permissible</b> rancidity value. Also, 87 percent of samples were healthy. In general, 98. 1 percent of oil samples were unusable. Conclusion: The acid and peroxide numbers was in acceptable range, however, the rancidity or oil chemicals corruption caused by inappropriate conservation conditions. This type of fast food, have adverse effects on consumersâ€² health...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is theinvestigation of the occurrence of standard threshold shift (STS) among workers of Isfehan metalindustry using audiometric data and noise measurement level. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional and descriptive study that performed among 2016 of workers in Isfehan Metal Industry. All of subjects were men and the rate of using personalprotective equipment among workers were sometime= 189, often= 865 and always= 962. At the first wedetermined the parts of plant that exposed to <b>non</b> <b>permissible</b> noise level and then measured exposureto 8 hour equivalent noise level. Finally in regard to basic audiometric and current audiometric, theoccurrences of STS were examined. Results: This study showed that 29. 9 % of workers have a STS in these workplaces. There aresignificance relationship between age, exposure time, noise level, wearing time and number ofworkers with STS. But there is no relation between precedence of work and STS statistically. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicated that occurrences of STS among workers exposed tonoise are high. Thus, it is concluded that hearing conservation programs in these industries wasunsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|The {{presentation}} {{deals with}} {{the solution of the}} design problem as an inverse problem to nonlinear structural analysis. Starting point is the given point-to-point mapping between discrete points in the space of the design parameters (input parameters) and in the space of the constrained parameters (result parameters). These spaces are formed by input and result parameters, respectively, which are modeled as fuzzy sets. The point-to-point mapping results from the fuzzy probabilistic struc-tural analysis or the fuzzy structural analysis [2]. By comparing requirements regarding structural responses with the fuzzy results, points in the space of fuzzy design parameters are separated in a permissible and a <b>non</b> <b>permissible</b> set. Permissible points in the space of the fuzzy design parame-ters are determined. Permissible points in the space of design parameters are lumped together in clusters by applying crisp cluster methods or fuzzy cluster methods [1]. The detected permissible clusters represent alternative structural design variants. The crisp values of structural responses are computed by applying defuzzification methods. In the presented study the centroid method and the defuzzification algorithms after Chen and Jain [3] are proposed. The distance between the defuzzified result and the design constraints serve as an assessment criterion. Further, a second criterion is introduced as a robustness measure. Th...|$|E
