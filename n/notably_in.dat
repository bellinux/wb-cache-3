Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E

Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, {{and a number of}} large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large churches were constructed with brick walls, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> Bergen, Christiania, Røros and Kongsberg.|$|E

Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator Tom Daschle was the Senate minority leader (and briefly its majority leader during Democratic control of the Senate in 2001–02).|$|E

5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5|$|He {{seemingly}} rejected {{some aspects}} of van Eyckian realism, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, even if this inhibited realism. He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques of representing perspective, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.|$|E
