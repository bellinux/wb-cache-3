However, they may be set for predicting {{the value of the}} final effective modulus of elasticity, which is very important for the analysis and design of foundations on saturated and unsaturated soils. It is interesting to highlight that the soil natural porosity is very close to the percolation threshold.

In the experiments, the display of a non-intrusive stereo imaging measurement of the three-dimensional <b>net</b> <b>geometry</b> was established by tracing the positions of the LED markers on the cage net. A 1 / 30 -scale model of a net cage was used composing of top and bottom hoops (or rings), nets, four buoys and four anchor blocks moored to the tank bottom. Trinocular stereo imaging, which used three synchronized video cameras to follow the three-dimensional displacements of 37 Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) attached to the net, was em-ployed to monitor the deformation and motion of the fish net. The motion of the collar and bottom hoop under different current velocities was also observed and is discussed in this paper. This measurement method offers more convenience and detail about deformation and motion investigation of a flexible net structure...|$|E
40|$|The common {{treatment}} of {{open channel flow}} involves the hydrostatic pressure approach. However, many flows are curvilinear and a higher-order approach is needed {{to deal with the}} non-hydrostatic pressure distribution. The current models are based on linear relationships for the variation of streamline curvature and inclination along the equipotential curves of the flow net, yet this approach is not verified with 2 D results. In the present study typical 2 D free surface flow nets are analysed to investigate the variations of streamline curvature and inclination. From the detailed 2 D information, approximate relationships describing the curvature and inclination are proposed. It was found that streamline curvature and inclination do not vary linearly in general. The higher-order energy and momentum curvilinear equations are improved with this approach, thereby approximating the real flow <b>net</b> <b>geometry.</b> The implications of these findings on curvilinear flow modelling are discussed using several test cases. © 2010 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.

40|$|Abstract. We give an {{elaborated}} {{treatment of}} discrete isothermic surfaces and their analogs in different geometries (projective, Möbius, Laguerre, Lie). We find {{the core of}} the theory to be a novel projective characterization of discrete isothermic nets as Moutard nets. The latter belong to projective <b>geometry</b> and are <b>nets</b> with planar faces defined through a five-point property: a vertex and its four diagonal neighbors span a three dimensional space. Analytically this property is equivalent to the existence of representatives in the space of homogeneous coordinates satisfying the discrete Moutard equation. Restricting the projective theory to quadrics, we obtain Moutard <b>nets</b> in sphere <b>geometries.</b> In particular, Moutard <b>nets</b> in Möbius <b>geometry</b> are shown to coincide with discrete isothermic nets. The five-point property in this particular case says that a vertex and its four diagonal neighbors lie on a common sphere, which is a novel characterization of discrete isothermic surfaces. Discrete Laguerre isothermic surfaces are defined through the corresponding five-plane property which requires that a plane and its four diagonal neighbors share a common touching sphere. Equivalently, Laguerre isothermic surfaces are characterized by having an isothermic Gauss map. We conclude with Moutard <b>nets</b> in Lie <b>geometry...</b>|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} work presents the chemical milling {{effect on the}} low cycle fatigue properties of cast Ti– 6 Al– 2 Sn– 4 Zr– 2 Mo alloy. Chemical milling treatment {{is one of the}} final steps in manufacturing titanium alloy components that removes the brittle alpha-case layer formed during various thermal processes. The treatment includes immersion of the components in solutions containing hydrofluoric (HF) and nitric (HNO 3) acids in relevant molar ratios. Although this treatment demonstrates advantages in handling components with complex <b>net</b> <b>geometries,</b> it may have detrimental effects on the surface, by introducing pitting and/or intergranular corrosion and thereby adversely affecting in particular the fatigue strength. The first series of specimens were tested in as-machined condition. Two more series were, prior to fatigue testing, subjected to 5 and 60 min chemical milling treatment. It was found that the fatigue lives were substantially decreased for the chemically treated specimens. The fractographic investigation of all mechanically tested samples revealed multiple fatigue crack initiation sites in the chemically milled samples. These cracks were located either at the prior beta grain boundary or the prior beta grain boundary triple joints. The prior beta grain boundaries were found to have deep ditch-like appearance which depth increased with increasing milling time. These ditch-like grain boundaries acts as stress raisers and thereby promote early fatigue crack initiation and thus lower fatigue life. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|The International Bottom Trawl Working Group (IBTSWG) met in Lorient, France, from 27 – 30 March 2012. There were 21 {{participants}} from 12 countries, {{all of whom}} are involved in designing and conducting bottom trawl surveys, and one participant representing the ICES Secretariat. All terms of reference have been met, details are given in relevant sections (see table of contents). Major developments, achievements and recommendations from the 2012 meeting are given below: Section 3 is dedicated to reviewing the recommendations of the previous year, split into two sections: follow up of recommendations from IBTSWG in 2011; and secondly to answer recommendations for IBTSWG from other EGs. Individual surveys coordinated by IBTSWG are presented using the standard reporting format that summarizes the surveys design and coverage as well as aggregated results and samples collected for the target species, including summary tables that report samples collected under the DCF (Data Collection Framework). Section 4 and the summary tables provide a centralized and accessible overview of specific survey datasets for those using the data. Also this year IBTS first has provided the first combined index within the Western and southern areas, using Irish groundfish survey and French EVHOE survey data to produce a combined index for cod and haddock on the Celtic Sea area (ICES Division VIIjgh). These indices have been evaluated and accepted by the ICES benchmark process. Maps showing the distribution of the main target species over the entire IBTS coordinated area are presented as combined results for all surveys (see Section 4. 4 and Annex 6). Section 5 deals with the effect of sweep length on <b>net</b> <b>geometry</b> and provides a comparison of <b>net</b> <b>geometry</b> results for GOV gears from different vessels highlighting that differences with the manual expected geometry are produced independently of sweep length. This stresses the recommendation in the manual: ‘gear <b>net</b> <b>geometry,</b> consistent between countries and year’ should be the first aim and the warp/depth ratio should adjusted consequently during the survey’. Results of paired hauls carried out by Marine Scotland Science will be published {{in the latter half of}} 2012 and will be made available for discussion to North Sea Survey participants and coordinators before NSIBTS Q 1 2013 surveys. Section 6 about sensitivity of abundance indices looks at two approaches to essentially the same issue – variability of survey indices due to planned or un-planned changes in survey sampling or design. A forced change of vessel for the Swedish survey is used to illustrate the measurable change in sampling unit that can occur with an evolving survey, as well as predict possible scale of impact on the indices going forward. Conversely, a recommendation from WGWIDE to evaluate the potential for an IBTS Horse Mackerel Index for the North Sea is used as an example of taking a historically noisy index and seeing if it can be improved in retrospect using available survey information. Section 7 deals with quality of the data stored in DATRAS, pointing out some problems detected in relation to DATRAS download products and with the data uploaded in the last year. Problems found resulted in a recommendation to close the download option of some products in DATRAS, and highlights once again the necessity of checking products and algorithms used both when uploading data and when calculating the products. A course of action is proposed to solve these problems. Section 8 deals with the updates of IBTS manuals (North Sea and Eastern areas) together with the MIK manual, new editions of the current versions will be issued online in the ICES website, with an ISSN assignment and consecutive numbering under this new system. A short summary of the updates to be issued is also presented. Section 9 addresses the use of IBTS data in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive including again coverage and issues with sampling marine litter within IBTSurveys, an update from WGISUR last meeting and possibilities to build Ecosystem surveys from IBTSurveys. Finally Section 10 presents the views of the group on the proposal for multi-annual ToRs and the implications of how it can be implemented in the case of the IBTSWG...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{models of}} fishing nets {{are used in}} fishing {{technology}} research at scales of 1 : 40 or smaller. As with all modelling involving fluid flow, {{a set of rules}} is required to determine the geometry of the model and its velocity relative to the water. Appropriate rules ensure that the model is subject to similar forces and behaves in a similar way to the full-scale net. It is not possible however, to choose a completely compatible set of modelling rules and a compromise is necessary. The common practice is to assume that similarity is achieved when a constant Froude Number is maintained. This is often found to be inadequate in that drag is increasingly overestimated as the scale is reduced. A new empirical relation between net drag coefficient and Reynolds Number at constant <b>net</b> <b>geometry</b> for one design of large mesh pelagic trawl is derived which applies over a wide range of Reynolds Numbers (based on mean twine thickness) from 63 to 1. 67 x 104. Six sizes of the same net design from full-scale to 1 : 40 were investigated. From this relation a new velocity scale relation has been proposed which relates velocity scale to linear scale for this particular trawl design. It is argued that not only the net mouth but also all the individual netting panels will maintain the correct geometry over this range of model sizes. The traditional Froude similarity law states that the velocity scale is equal to the linear scale to the power of 0. 5. The new relation suggests a power of approximately 0. 6. Lower velocities may be necessary to compensate for the increase in drag coefficient as Reynolds Number decreases at constant Froude Number. Until more experiments are done on radically different net designs it will not be possible to assess how widely this new relation may apply...|$|E

To simulate flow in natural convection mode, Boussinesq model and pressure inlet and outlet boundary conditions are used. Results show that the most effective geometry is the one with baffles that drive flow in radial channels in addition to axial channels. Streamlines near the holes in papers show that that height of holes is too small to affect heat transfer and, so, the comparison between geometries with and without paper shows the types without paper have higher heat transfer coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Rekenaarwetenskap)) [...] PU for CHE, 1998 The problem-centred {{approach}} in the instruction of Mathematics has gained much ground {{in the last few}} years. Different points of view exist on how this approach ought to be implemented in schools. Many researchers place great emphasis on the understanding of the problem by the child, but the role of accompaniment in solving the problem is often left in abeyance. It is important that the problem is correctly represented in the solving of geometry problems. The expert problem-solver does this by memory. This is, however, very abstract and often difficult for pupils to do. Expert systems is a field of study within Artificial Intelligence which is aimed at developing computer programmes that can simulate the problem-solving abilities of human experts. The two main components of problem-solving that must be simulated are the expert's knowledge and his reasoning ability. The expert system simulates man's reasoning process by making use of inference techniques. Inference can be described as the process used by the expert system to acquire new information from existing information. Semantic nets are a method of representation used in Artificial Intelligence to represent knowledge and solve problems. It is a graphic representation that consists of nodes and links, where a node represents an object, a concept or a fact, and a link represents the relationship or association between the objects. Any type of knowledge can be represented by a semantic <b>net.</b> A <b>geometry</b> problem can also be represented and solved according to a semantic net and certain inference techniques. The links of the semantic <b>net</b> are the <b>geometry</b> theorems and the nodes are the new facts. If a semantic net is used for the solving of geometry problems it is unnecessary for the child to represent the solution of the problem in his mind. A semantic net provides the   pupil with a clear image of where he finds himself in the solution process. Conclusions flow logically and this provides the students with a structure to direct their thoughts. The use of semantic nets in the solution of geometry problems combined with inference and search techniques can be of great value. It ought to be emphasized in teacher training. Master...|$|R

To investigate some aspects of their behavior, we used a high resolution ultrasonic telemetry system that makes it possible to continuously and accurately monitor the position of multiple fish, in 3 D, for days at a time. The data presented in this manuscript were obtained from a total of 32 cod (29. 3 ± 4. 9 cm, range: 22. 5 – 43. 0 cm), tracked under a variety of conditions, inside a net pen located 13 km off the coast of New Hampshire, USA. Typically, cod exhibited clear diurnal rhythms, with the highest swimming activity during daytime hours (mean swimming speed = 17. 8 ± 5. 5 cm/s; 0. 6 ± 0. 2 body lengths per sec (BL/s)) compared with nighttime hours (6. 6 ± 0. 5 cm/s; 0. 2 ± 0. 03 BL/s). Analysis of net pen utilization revealed that: a) the entire volume of the net pen was not utilized (volumes used by individuals overlapped); and b) there was a spatial preference for the lower half of the net pen. Adding lights and increasing stocking densities elicited dramatic changes in behavior. When lights were turned on at dawn and dusk, to extend the day photoperiod, cod increased their swimming activity by 66. 4 % and 202. 6 %, compared to day and night levels, respectively. When the density of cod reached high levels (~ 48. 5 kg/m 3) as they grew, their typical diurnal pattern of independent swimming changed to schooling behavior, with no significant difference in day and night activity.

The attractiveness of these man-made materials is mainly due to their lower costs and lower weight to strength ratios when compared to conventional materials. Another attractive feature that certain manufacturing techniques can generate near <b>net</b> shape, complex <b>geometry</b> composites [1 - 3]. However, composite materials suffer {{from a number of}} drawbacks that limit their usage in load-bearing components. Some of these drawbacks are manufacturing-related such as voids and dry areas as well as poor fiber-matrix adhesion that severely affect thermomechanical properties of composite parts [5 - 9]. Other drawbacks are inherent to composites such as moisture absorption or even nanofillers dispersion [10 - 12]. As the demand for fuel efficiency becomes a must in today's reality, composite materials are more than ever coveted to play a greater part in the transportation field. Consequently, there is a pronounced need for developing enhanced composite materials with better mechanical properties, lower costs and longer lifespan. Since mechanical properties and lifespan of composite parts have been shown to depend heavily on processing parameters [1 - 14], optimizing the latter can {{play a key role in}} this endeavor.

40|$|Pore {{pressure}} {{and its relationship}} with fracture net pressure has been reported qualitatively from both field and experimental observations. From a modeling perspective, the ubiquitously used pseudo 3 D (P 3 D) models {{that are based on}} linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) do not include the effect of reservoir depletion (or overpressure). Models that utilize effective stress as propagation criteria with a cohesive zone description, introduce the pore pressure directly into the simulation and hence can potentially capture the effect of pore pressure on fracture propagation. This work investigates the effect of pore pressure on hydraulic fracturing <b>net</b> {{pressure and}} <b>geometry</b> using empirical and numerical simulation approaches. We carried out an analysis of more than 400 datafrac injections spanning a wide range of geological ages and depositional environments in order to investigate the relationship between observed net pressure and reservoir pore pressure. The net fracture propagation pressure from the fracture treatment analysis was seen to be correlated with the effective stress in the reservoir. Fracture propagation simulations were performed using a coupled finite element – finite difference fracture simulator. The code uses a cohesive zone model (CZM) to describe fracture propagation. Four different effective stress scenarios were used to study the effect of effective stress on net pressure. The simulation results closely match the empirical relation between net pressure and effective stress as obtained from the analysis of actual frac treatment data. It is observed from the simulations that the magnitude of the effective stress also has an effect on the fracture geometry with a high effective stress leading to wider, shorter and more radial fractures. The derived empirical correlation is hence useful as a fracture design parameter. The datafrac net pressure diagnostics workflow in the pseudo 3 D models can incorporate local tip pore pressure as a new pressure matching parameter. The pore pressure effect can thus explain high net pressures routinely observed in frac operations and also as a containment mechanism. </p...|$|R
