40|$|We study {{differences}} in contributory and non-contributory welfare benefit receipt between immigrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> for 16 EU countries. In contrast to previous studies we analyse {{differences in}} benefit levels allowing for potentially different takeup rates between immigrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> use Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions to discuss residual welfare dependence. Results point to substantial heterogeneity in welfare dependence between countries when not controlling for observed characteristics of immigrants <b>and</b> <b>natives.</b> This is {{primarily due to}} different selection into benefits between immigrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> differences in their characteristics (mainly income, personal, and household characteristics). Once this is controlled for, immigrants participate at most equally often in both types of benefits as <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> usually also receive lower or comparable benefit levels...|$|R

30|$|A {{second source}} of {{productivity}} differences between <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> immigrants can be subsumed under {{the concept of}} segregation, i.e. the non-random sorting into categories with different productivity. The most common categories associated with segregation include job types, tasks, occupational nomenclatures, firms with different technologies or capital endowments and sectors of activity. Whereas intrinsic productivity effects refer to differences between <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> immigrants within the same category (e.g. unequal productivity within the same occupation), segregation points to differences {{in the distribution of}} <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> immigrants across categories that each capture a certain level of productivity (e.g. overrepresentation of immigrants in occupations with lower productivity).|$|R

The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is mass spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement {{of the mass of}} the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the <b>native</b> <b>and</b> modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer. The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor will be the one that contains the site of modification.|$|E

The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh.

In Malaysia, access which is the first level of exposure to Information Communication Technology (ICT) has been largely achieved. Recent research has attempted to expand the conception of the divide to move beyond access to consider issues of proficiency and gratification. This study uses a survey research to obtain data. Some 600 respondents, who are divided into <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> migrants were sampled for the study. The literacy/knowledge and skills for internet applications for both the <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> migrants respondents is above average.
