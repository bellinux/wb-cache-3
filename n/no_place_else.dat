2500|$|Allmusic {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{websites}} to comment on The Oracle, with their reviewer Jason Ankeny describing the album' as [...] "the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut", awarding it three stars out of five, and praising it for being a return to the band original sound, stating, [...] "The Oracle is, if nothing else, a return to the band’s signature sound of yore. It seems as if Godsmack heard the cry of their dedicated hoard and went back to making the kind of record that defined them.", then he added, [...] "Those fans seeking a return to Godsmack’s roots will not be disappointed; for others, the sound may be a retrenchment because there was <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> for them to go. The only undebatable thing is that The Oracle is the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut." ...|$|E

60|$|The omnibus {{worked its}} way at a slow walk among the promenaders going and coming between the rows of pollard locusts {{on one side and}} the bright walls of the houses on the other. Under the trees were tables, served by pretty bareheaded girls who ran to and from the {{restaurants}} across the way. On both sides flashed and glittered the little shops full of silver, glass, jewelry, terracotta figurines, wood-carvings, and all the idle frippery of watering-place traffic: they suggested Paris, and they suggested Saratoga, and then they were of Carlsbad and of <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> in the world, as the crowd which might have been that of other cities at certain moments could only have been of Carlsbad in its habitual effect.|$|E
5|$|Young {{now had to}} {{lead the}} Saints into the far west, without knowing exactly where to go or where they would end up. He insisted the Mormons should settle in a <b>place</b> <b>no</b> one <b>else</b> wanted and felt the {{isolated}} Great Basin would provide the Saints with many advantages.|$|R
5000|$|ShaoShu: ShaoShu, or Little Mouse, first {{appears in}} [...] "Eagle".

50|$|Traditional {{products}} used locks which {{stated that}} a particular transaction was going to modify a record. Once the lock was <b>placed,</b> <b>no</b> one <b>else</b> could read or modify the data until the lock was released. The lock may block changes to a single record, a page (a group of records stored together on disk) of records, or every record examined by a particular transaction, depending on the lock resolution. Lock resolution is a tradeoff between performance and accuracy—by blocking updates at the page level, for example, some updates will be blocked which do not in fact conflict with updates made by other transactions, but performance will be improved in comparison with record level locks.|$|R

5000|$|In January 2015, Bell {{wrote the}} article [...] "Why you don't need God" [...] for CNN, where he {{reflected}} on his year without God, {{and talked about}} finding meaning in life after losing faith in God. Without dependency on a cosmic savior who is coming to rescue us, we are free to recognize {{that we are the}} ones we're waiting for. If we don't make the world a fair and habitable <b>place,</b> <b>no</b> one <b>else</b> is {{going to do it for}} us. Life does not need a divine source in order to be meaningful. Anyone who has seen a breathtaking sunset or fallen in love with another human being knows that we make meaning from the experiences of our lives; we construct it the way we construct any social narrative. During the year that Bell spent [...] "without God", filmmakers Ryan Moore and Tim Banks filmed his experience. The documentary Year Without God will be released in late 2015.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2004, Fort Wright Administrator Larry Klein {{said this}} of the grant, [...] "This {{will be a}} great start to a great park.

Byron introduces his wan and raggedy troupe, including Simon, a traumatized boy who communicates by transmitting visions. Lochley wants Simon in Medlab and she'll think about the rest.|$|E

With <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> to go, she asks Ned to take her to his hotel suite. Bob follows and tries to pick a fight, but is too drunk to do anything serious.

6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} we would oust the little people from the world," [...] he said, [...] "in order that we, who are no more than one step upwards from their littleness, may hold their world for ever. It is the step we fight for and not ourselves.... We are here, Brothers, to what end? To serve the spirit and the purpose that has been breathed into our lives. We fight not for ourselves--for we are but the {{momentary}} hands and eyes of the Life of the World. So you, Father Redwood, taught us. Through us and through the little folk the Spirit looks and learns. From us by word and birth and act it must pass--to still greater lives. This earth is no resting place; this earth is <b>no</b> playing <b>place,</b> <b>else</b> indeed we might put our throats to the little people's knife, having no greater right to live than they. And they in their turn might yield to the ants and vermin. We fight not for ourselves but for growth--growth that goes on for ever. To-morrow, whether we live or die, growth will conquer through us. That is the law of the spirit for ever more. To grow according to the will of God! To grow out of these cracks and crannies, out of these shadows and darknesses, into greatness and the light! Greater," [...] he said, speaking with slow deliberation, [...] "greater, my Brothers! And then--still greater. To grow, and again--to grow. To grow at last into the fellowship and understanding of God. Growing.... Till the earth {{is no more than a}} footstool.... Till the spirit shall have driven fear into nothingness, and spread...." [...] He swung his arm heavenward:--"There!" [...] His voice ceased. The white glare of one of tho searchlights wheeled about, and for a moment fell upon him, standing out gigantic with hand upraised against the sky.|$|R

5000|$|In November 1973 writer Richard Cromelin reported, [...] "Once inside, everybody's a star. The social {{rules are}} simple but rigid: All {{you want to}} hear is how fabulous you look, so you tell them how fabulous they look. You talk about how bored you are, coming here night after night, but that there’s <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> to go. If you're not jaded there's {{something}} wrong. It's good to come in very messed up on some kind of pills every once in a while, and weekend nights usually see at least one elaborate, tearful fight or breakdown.

5000|$|With {{the cattle}} trade forced west, Texas longhorns began moving {{north along the}} Chisholm Trail. In 1867, the main cow town was Abilene, Kansas. Profits were high, and other towns quickly joined in the cattle boom: Newton in 1871; Ellsworth in 1872; and Wichita in 1872. However, in 1876 the Kansas State Legislature responded to {{pressure}} from farmers settling in central Kansas and once again shifted the quarantine line westward, which essentially eliminated Abilene and the other cow towns from the cattle trade. With <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> to go, Dodge City suddenly became the [...] "queen of the cow towns." ...|$|E

50|$|On March 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln {{signed an}} Act of Congress to {{incorporate}} St. Ann's Infant Asylum, {{as it was}} then called. St. Ann’s was chartered “for the purpose of establishing and maintaining in the city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, an institution for the maintenance and support of foundlings and infant orphan and half orphan children, and also to provide for deserving, indigent, and unprotected females during their confinement and childbirth.” The asylum was charged with caring for the city’s growing number of abandoned children and unwed mothers of all races and religions, many of whom had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> to turn. For 83 years St. Ann's occupied the old British Embassy at 24th Street and K Street, Northwest.|$|E
5000|$|African American {{migrants}} {{were largely}} restricted to Black Bottom. With <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> to go, Black Bottom remained {{the home of}} the poor working class, and landlords had no need to make improvements to living quarters. The poor living conditions led to the constant threat of infection and spread of disease, and many died of smallpox, pneumonia, and syphilis. [...] "Black Bottom" [...] became the name of a popular dance in the Florida/New Orleans areas between 1926-27. It was performed at the Apollo Theater and was modeled after young black children’s imitations of cows stuck in the mud. In the 1960s, Black Bottom was demolished during the city's urban renewal program and replaced by what is currently known as Lafayette Park.|$|E
50|$|Denmark became officially Lutheran in 1536 and {{the process}} of {{eliminating}} Catholic institutions and practice were carried out over the next decades. Sorø Abbey was turned into a home for monks who had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> to go. It became crown property in 1580. In 1584 the monastery buildings came into the possession of Peter Reetz, a member of the State Council and Soro was set up for two sons of Frederik II, Christian, later Christian IV and Prince Ulrich. Two years later an academy had been established for the sons of wealthy noble families. Between 1596 and 1600 Christian IV built one of Denmark's first tennis courts at the academy. It was later transformed in the library at the Academy. Sorø Academy continued on and off again until the present day.|$|E

5000|$|Religions, such {{as those}} of the Egyptian and Greeks, {{imagined}} stories of the sun as the god Amon Ra and Apollo.

Metallica turn heavy metal's melodrama into algebra. This isn't thrash, but : mechanized mayhem.
