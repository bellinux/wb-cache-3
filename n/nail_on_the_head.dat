"When Mr 'Herbert' {{came in to}} bat ... many of {{the spectators}} in the free seats did not {{recognise}} him, but after he had sampled an over or two, an old gentleman, who had shown some knowledge of the game, hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> when he remarked: I don't remember to have seen this Mr 'Erbert' before but he's 'class'." [...] He continued to play cricket for the Harrow Wanderers, MCC and I Zingari until 1901. At {{the time of the}} 1901 Census, Hewett was living in Westminster. He was listed as head of the household, the only other resident being a servant.|$|E
2500|$|The English stage {{designer}} Jocelyn Herbert was a {{close friend}} and influence on Beckett until his death. She worked with him on such plays as Happy Days (their third project) and Krapp's Last Tape at the Royal Court Theatre. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: [...] "She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Generally speaking, there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate, and this has never been the case with Jocelyn." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wendell Potter {{admitted}} {{that while he}} was working as Head of Corporate Communications at CIGNA, the health insurance industry umbrella agency America's Health Insurance Plans had developed a campaign to discredit Michael Moore and the movie. When asked what he thought about the film Potter said that [...] "I thought that he hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with his movie. But the industry, from the moment that the industry learned that Michael Moore was taking on the health care industry, it was really concerned.... They were afraid that people would believe Michael Moore." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He loves money, that's why, Dora. He {{would rather}} have that two hundred dollars than our services," [...] and with this remark Dick hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> {{squarely}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You shut up!" [...] roared Dan Baxter, for Harris had hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> exactly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "We'll {{settle this}} with the Rovers and the police, not with you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Robertson is {{credited}} as writer or co-writer {{of the majority}} of The Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, , Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that The Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: [...] "I think Levon's book hits the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band.... I'm truly friends with everybody but, hey—it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble." [...] Robertson denied that Helm had written any of the songs attributed to Robertson, and his daughter Alexandra later remarked {{in a letter to the}} Los Angeles Times that Helm's solo work consists almost entirely of songs written by others.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, now, you know, Master, I reckon it's {{likely he}} does, seeing that that's {{exactly what he}} is. You've hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> square <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Italyun, yes, sir! Rather too much so, I'm thinking, for decent folks' taste." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{lot of talk}} {{here from}} Secretary of State Andy Burnham onwards about the public and yet the citizen is strangely absent. The Oxford Media Convention is the media {{community}} drawing up its annual wishlist and airing its collective angsts. Burnham warned against a ‘fevered and inward looking debate’ but that is kind of what we got. His speech was expansive and hit various <b>nails</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> but despite admitting that we are ‘only weeks away from hard decisions’ he refused to reveal what callls {{he is going to}} make regarding Ofcom and the public service broadcasting review. Burnham came out with some platitudes, of course, apparantly ‘quality and standards matter’, which is a relief. His defence of pluralism was welcome but hardly controversial...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a sharp girl, Isa; you've hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> for I {{heard him}} in his drunken swagger boast of his {{intention}} to do that very thing. Now, will you take in hand, lass, to give the letter back to Mrs Martin, and explain how you came by it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay! ay! At last we {{have hit}} the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head!</b> Secret anxieties. Yes! yes! Plain enough now. A {{disappointment}} in love--eh, Mrs. Crayford?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> Mr. Cameron!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "Glad to see you!" [...] And {{he walked}} forward {{and held out}} his hand.|$|E
60|$|Varley did try again, and so successfully, too, {{that the}} ball hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> leaving {{a portion of the}} lead {{sticking}} to its edge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Mrs. Wilkins, [...] "you 'ave 'it <b>the</b> right <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>'ead,</b> there, sir. They go {{into the}} 'otels and work like niggers, knowing that if a single thing goes wrong they will be bully-ragged and sworn at till they don't know whether they are {{standing}} on their 'ead or their 'eels. But they 'ave their hours; the gal knows when 'er work is done, and when the clock strikes she is a 'uman being once again. She 'as got that moment {{to look forward to}} all day, and it keeps 'er going. In private service there's no moment in the day to 'ope for. If the lady is reasonable she ain't overworked; but no 'ow can she ever feel she is her own mistress, free to come and go, to wear 'er bit of finery, to 'ave 'er bit of fun. She works from six in the morning till eleven or twelve at night, and then she only goes to bed provided she ain't wanted. She don't belong to 'erself at all; it's that that irritates them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed! The Spaniards are--are brutes!" [...] exclaimed the youth. [...] "I {{only hope}} we send them from Cuba a-flying. I think {{they and the}} Cubans must have been {{fighting}} {{for the past three}} years like a lot of cats and dogs. It's high time Uncle Sam took a hand." [...] This reply brought forth a hearty laugh from those gathered around. Walter, young as he was, had hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> right <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> as later events proved.|$|R
6000|$|... "It heartens {{a fellow}} to have things happen this way," [...] my partner {{said in a}} tone of satisfaction. [...] "There's no {{question}} but that we're in a bad box, take it all around, for after the British get settled down in the city they will most likely look about for such as us, therefore our work must be done quickly, an' by your hittin' <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> square <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> it looks as if we might pull through all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have hit}} the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> It {{was the man who}} was out last night, at the same time I was out myself, and his name is Joel Strides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{struck the}} <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> lad. And why not, seeing as {{how we are}} out here in {{fighting}} waters, and with no ship of our own to go aboard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. Still, we can't {{deny that}} {{you hit the}} <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing. How was the window?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{a better}} detective {{than any of}} us," [...] she remarked. [...] "What I've been groping for {{is the object of}} the abduction, and you've hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> {{squarely}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Now we're getting down to brass tacks, so to speak. The whole thing is explained by the one word--'blackmail.' Girl disappears; papa is threatened with the lose of thousands. Very well, Papa! pay up. Relinquish a part of the income and you may keep the rest. Refuse, and you lose it all. Ergo, papa pays." ...|$|R

It sits very well beside Tear of Thought There are plenty of different textures and great big fat rock songs, as well as some quiet moments.

6000|$|So {{many times}} Lorna's trenchant remarks silenced Lane. She hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Practical, logical, {{inevitable}} {{were some of}} her speeches. She knew what men wanted. That was the pith of her meaning. What else mattered? ...|$|E
60|$|If Captain Trench {{had been}} a {{professional}} prophet he could hardly have hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> more fairly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> for he indicated exactly what bad government has actually done for Newfoundland--only he might have said centuries instead of years--for its internal resources, even at the present time, remain to a very great extent undeveloped. However, not being a professional prophet, but merely an ancient mariner, the captain wound up his remark with a recommendation to hoist all sail and lay their course, as there was no saying how long the mild weather would last.|$|R
60|$|Shank Leather, {{in saying}} this, had hit <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fairly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> {{although}} he had not intelligently probed the truth to the bottom. In fact {{a great deal of}} the friendship which drew these young men together was the result of their great dissimilarity of character. They acted on each other somewhat after the fashion of a well-adjusted piece of mechanism, the ratchets of selfishness and cog-wheels of vanity in Shank fitting easily into the pinions of good-will and modesty which characterised his friend, so that there was no jarring in their intercourse. This alone would not, perhaps, have induced the strong friendship that existed if it had not been coupled with their intimacy from childhood, and if Brooke had not been particularly fond of Shank's invalid mother, and recognised a few of her good characteristics faintly reproduced in her son, while Shank fully appreciated in Charlie that amiable temperament which inclines its happy possessor to sympathise much with others, to talk little of self, to believe all things and to hope all things, to the verge almost of infantine credulity.|$|R
500|$|As the character's storyline progressed, {{he became}} [...] "one {{of the most}} devious {{characters}} on daytime" [...] {{as part of a}} Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge <b>on</b> his father. <b>The</b> story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was not sure how to portray the blindness. He said, [...] "I didn't want to <b>nail</b> it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> completely with <b>the</b> blindness, because I wasn't sure if the blindness was real. Signy [...] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, and I {{thought it would be a}} dishonor to that if I came too close to the mark." [...] Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers [...] "know what they're doing, and right now it would seem like Adam is instigating more...drama." [...] The actor worried whether the character's actions might lead to him becoming [...] "irredeemable", but also said he took it as a challenge to make what Adam does [...] "interesting and human".|$|R
60|$|It was not {{difficult}} for so acute an observer as Madeline Neroni {{to see that}} she had hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and driven the bolt home. Mr. Arabin winced visibly before her attack, and she knew at once that he was jealous of Mr. Slope.|$|E

40|$|This {{refreshing}} {{discussion paper}} from Dr. Jillian Rodd hits <b>the</b> retention <b>nail</b> right <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Leadership {{is an essential}} ingredient for quality early childhood provision; no longer can it be allowed to remain an optional extra. The continued focus in recent years on quality provision for young children has at best skimmed over and at worst neglected the need for quality leadership, from professionally mature leaders who value and respect the work of early years and childcare practitioners. Early years and childcare practitioners feel undervalued (Cameron et al. 2001) resulting in constant migration of the workforce as individuals seek better pay and prospects. Undervalued participants {{in a study of}} early years and childcare practitioners in private day nurseries felt undervalued and know how to remedy the situation (Simms 2006). They want to be managed by people who make time for the children, are prepared to get their hands dirty; have plenty of experience, are approachable and really listen to the staff, making sure that the team works well together. Participants in the study felt that practitioners evolved into management without necessarily having the maturing for the role or appropriate training. This kind of scenario was said to cause ‘negativ...|$|R
40|$|On {{a walking}} hike in {{southern}} Germany you may encounter {{a small house}} with the striking inscription: ‘Gott schütze uns für Gewitter, Ungerechtigkeit und Planer’. (God protect us from thunder, injustice, and planners). It marks – whether justifiably or not – the broad distrust in society of the noble profession of planning. In a similar event, a recent planning masterpiece of the Flemish Government – the Lange Wapper Bridge, planned to complete the ring road around Antwerp – was voted down in a referendum. In Amsterdam, however, planning disasters that have turned the city upside-down for more than 15 years are completely ignored by the residents. They no longer bother with what has been decided beyond and over their heads; they just {{get on with their}} own lives. Against this background and in these times of crisis, not only in planning, but economically and politically as well, {{there is every reason to}} critically refocus the fundamentals of planning. This is, in fact, what David Webb, in his commentary on my outside-inward deployment of an actor-relational-approach (ARA) is doing. Moreover, Webb also recognizes that ARA ‘has the potential to generate relationally embedded projects, which have a greater, or at least different, change of success to mainstream, plan-led approaches’ (Webb, 2010). Nevertheless, he rightly distrusts the general applicability of that deployment and hits <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> right <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> in his comments...|$|R
