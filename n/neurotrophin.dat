25|$|Testosterone {{has been}} found to act as an {{antagonist}} of the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors for the <b>neurotrophin</b> nerve growth factor (NGF), with high affinity (around 5nM).

25|$|Different {{mechanisms}} regulate PCD in {{the peripheral}} nervous system (PNS) versus {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). In the PNS, innervation of the target is proportional to the amount of the target-released neurotrophic factors NGF and NT3. Expression of <b>neurotrophin</b> receptors, TrkA and TrkC, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in the absence of their ligands. Therefore, it is speculated that PCD in the PNS is dependent on the release of neurotrophic factors and thus follows the concept of the neurotrophic theory.|$|E
50|$|In the {{peripheral}} and central neurons, <b>neurotrophins</b> are important regulators for survival, differentiation, {{and maintenance of}} nerve cells. They are small proteins that secrete into the nervous system to help keep nerve cells alive. There are two distinct classes of glycosylated receptors that can bind to <b>neurotrophins.</b> These two proteins are p75 (NTR), which binds to all <b>neurotrophins,</b> and subtypes of Trk, which are each specific for different <b>neurotrophins.</b> The reported structure above is a 2.6 Å-resolution crystal structure of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) complexed to the ectodomain of glycosylated p75 (NRT), forming a symmetrical crystal structure.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Walking is of high {{priority}} {{for people with}} multiple sclerosis (PwMS). It remains unclear whether aerobic exercise can improve walking ability and upregulate <b>neurotrophins.</b> This review aims to consolidate evidence to develop optimal aerobic training parameters to enhance walking outcomes and neuroplasticity in PwMS. Methods. Clinical studies examining aerobic exercise for ≥ 3 weeks, having outcomes on walking with or without neurotrophic markers, were included. Studies utilizing animal models of MS were included if they employed aerobic exercise with outcomes on neurological recovery and <b>neurotrophins.</b> From a total of 1783 articles, 12 clinical and 5 animal studies were included. Results. Eleven clinical studies reported improvements in walking ability. Only two clinical studies evaluated both walking and <b>neurotrophins,</b> and neither found an increase in <b>neurotrophins</b> despite improvements in walking. Patients with significant walking impairments were underrepresented. Long-term follow-up revealed mixed results. Two animal studies reported a positive change in both neurological recovery and <b>neurotrophins.</b> Conclusion. Aerobic exercise improves walking ability in PwMS. Gains are not consistently maintained at 2 - to 9 -month follow-up. Studies examining levels of <b>neurotrophins</b> are inconclusive, necessitating further research. Aerobic exercise enhances both neurological recovery and <b>neurotrophins</b> in animal studies when started 2 weeks before induction of MS...|$|R
25|$|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), {{also known}} as androstenolone, is an {{endogenous}} steroid hormone. It {{is one of the}} most abundant circulating steroids in humans, in whom it is produced in the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the brain, where it functions as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids. However, DHEA also has a variety of potential biological effects in its own right, binding to an array of nuclear and cell surface receptors, and acting as a neurosteroid and <b>neurotrophin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the {{surprising}} discovery {{was made that}} DHEA, as well as DHEA-S, directly bind to and activate the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors of neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with high affinity. DHEA was subsequently also found to bind to the TrkB and TrkC with high affinity, though it notably activated the TrkC but not the TrkB. DHEA and DHEA-S bound to these receptors with affinities {{that were in the}} low nanomolar range (around 5nM), although the affinities were nonetheless approximately two orders of magnitude lower relative to highly potent polypeptide neurotrophins like NGF (0.01–0.1nM). In any case, DHEA and DHEA-S both circulate at requisite concentrations to activate these receptors and were thus identified as important endogenous neurotrophic factors. They have since been labeled [...] "steroidal microneurotrophins", due to their small-molecule and steroidal nature relative to their polypeptide <b>neurotrophin</b> counterparts. Subsequent research has suggested that DHEA and/or DHEA-S may in fact be phylogenetically ancient [...] "ancestral" [...] ligands of the <b>neurotrophin</b> receptors from early on {{in the evolution of the}} nervous system. The findings that DHEA binds to and potently activates <b>neurotrophin</b> receptors may explain the positive association between decreased circulating DHEA levels with age and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{amitriptyline}} {{has been}} demonstrated {{to act as an}} agonist of the TrkA and TrkB receptors. It promotes the heterodimerization of these proteins in the absence of NGF and has potent neurotrophic activity both in-vivo and in-vitro in mouse models. These are the same receptors [...] activates, an endogenous <b>neurotrophin</b> with powerful antidepressant effects, and as such this property may contribute significantly to its therapeutic efficacy against depression. Amitriptyline also acts as a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMAG is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of axonal regeneration. Here, inhibition by MAG, and myelin in general, is blocked if neurons are exposed to <b>neurotrophins</b> before encountering the inhibitor; priming cerebellar neurons with BDNF or GDNF, but not NGF, or priming DRG neurons {{with any of these}} <b>neurotrophins</b> blocks inhibition by MAG/myelin. Dibutyryl cAMP also overcomes inhibition by MAG/myelin, and cAMP is elevated by <b>neurotrophins.</b> A PKA inhibitor present during priming abrogates the block of inhibition. Finally, if neurons are exposed to MAG/myelin and <b>neurotrophins</b> simultaneously, but with the Gi protein inhibitor, inhibition is blocked. We suggest that priming neurons with particular <b>neurotrophins</b> elevates cAMP and activates PKA, which blocks subsequent inhibition of regeneration and that priming is required because MAG/myelin activates a Gi protein, which blocks increases in cAMP. This is important for encouraging axons to regrow in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The <b>neurotrophins</b> are {{a family}} of {{polypeptide}} growth factors that are essential for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system. In recent years, data have emerged indicating that <b>neurotrophins</b> could have a broader role than their name might suggest.

2500|$|As {{shown in}} a 2008 study, one factor common to all {{bilateral}} organisms (including humans) is a family of secreted signaling molecules called neurotrophins which regulate the growth and survival of neurons.

DNT1 shares structural similarity with all known neurotrophins and is {{a key factor in}} the fate of neurons in Drosophila. Because neurotrophins have now been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrates, this evidence suggests that neurotrophins were present in an ancestor common to bilateral organisms and may represent a common mechanism for nervous system formation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{synergistic}} effect of delivering two <b>neurotrophins</b> simultaneously to encourage neuron survival and neurite elongation was explored. Neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) and {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) were incorporated into polypyrrole (PPy) during electrosynthesis and the amounts incorporated and released were determined using iodine- 125 (125 I) radio-labelled <b>neurotrophins.</b> Neurite outgrowth from cochlear neural explants grown on the conducting polymer was equivalent to that on tissue culture plastic but significantly improved with the incorporation of NT- 3 and BDNF. Neurite outgrowth from explants grown on polymers containing both NT- 3 and BDNF showed significant improvement over PPy doped only with NT- 3, due to the synergistic effect of both <b>neurotrophins.</b> Neurite outgrowth was significantly improved when the polymer containing both <b>neurotrophins</b> was electrically stimulated. It is envisaged that when applied to the cochlear implant, these conducting and novel polymer films will provide a biocompatible substrate for storage and release of <b>neurotrophins</b> to help protect auditory neurons from degradation after sensorineural hearing loss and encourage neurite outgrowth towards the electrodes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Neurotrophins</b> are {{important}} regulators of visual cortical plasticity. It is still unclear, however, whether they play similar or different roles {{and which are}} their effects on the electrical activity of cortical neurons in vivo.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>neurotrophins</b> and their specific receptors in adult and developing Japanese quail ovaries Nechita E-L, Arcamone N, Maruccio L, Solcan C, Cotea C Nerve growth factor (NGF), {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) are members of <b>neurotrophins</b> family, which are involved in growth, maintaining, differentiation and survival of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. The activity of these <b>neurotrophins</b> is elicited in systems other than nervous, such as reproductive and endocrine systems. In mammals, <b>neurotrophins</b> and their receptors TrkA, TrkB, TrkC {{play a critical role}} in oogenesis and folliculogenesis, promoting the follicular development and oo-cyte maturation, also during early embryonic development. In this study we report the {{presence of}} NGF, BDNF, NT- 3 and their specific receptors in adult and embryonic quail gonads. The investigations were con-ducted on embryonic stages from 4 th to 17 th day of incubation and on adult laying quail ovaries. Immunohisto-chemical Envision technique was used.

40|$|The <b>neurotrophins</b> {{influence}} {{survival and}} maintenance of vertebrate neurons in the embryonic, early post-natal and post-developmental stages of the nervous system. Binding of <b>neurotrophins</b> to receptors encoded by the gene family trk initiates signal transduction into the cell. trkA interacts preferably with nerve growth factor (NGF), trkB with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 4 / 5 (NT- 4 / 5) and trkC with neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3). By constructing 17 different chimeras and domain deletions of the human trk receptors and analyzing their binding affinities to the <b>neurotrophins</b> we have shown that an immunoglobulin-like domain located adjacent to the transmembrane domain is the structural element that determines the interaction of <b>neurotrophins</b> with their receptors. Chimeras of trkC where this domain was exchanged for the homologous sequences from trkB or trkA gained high affinity binding to BDNF or NGF respectively, while deletion of this domain in trkC or trkA abolished binding to NT- 3 or NGF respectively.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS) with unknown etiology. It was recently suggested that autoimmunity, which had long been considered to be destructive in MS, might also play a protective role in the CNS of MS patients. <b>Neurotrophins</b> are polypeptides belonging to the neurotrophic factor family. While <b>neurotrophins</b> mediate cell survival and proliferation in the nervous system, they are also expressed within peripheral blood mononuclear cells fraction (PBMCs) of immunological system. In MS additional neurotrophic support from PBMCs might compensate relative <b>neurotrophins</b> deficiency in the damaged CNS tissue that needs to be repaired. Failure to produce the adequate <b>neurotrophins</b> concentrations might result in decreased protection of the CNS, consequently leading to increased atrophy, which is the main determinant of MS patients’ end-point disability.
