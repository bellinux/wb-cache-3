The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception of Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Later scores have included those for Antony and Cleopatra (1972), Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), The Fly (1986), Dead Ringers (1988), In the <b>Name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> (1993), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the three films derived from The Hobbit (2012–14).|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh {{was the son}} of Gille-Brighde, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil. Donnchadh's ancestry {{cannot be}} traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from {{contemporary}} sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate their ancestors in documents, they never go earlier than he does. The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of Somhairle, petty king of Argyll {{in the third quarter of}} the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.|$|E
5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in the}} AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Thompson won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for {{the period}} drama Howards End.

Thompson scripted and starred in Sense and Sensibility (1995), which earned her (among other awards) an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress. Other notable film and television credits include: the Harry Potter film series, Wit (2001), Love Actually (2003), Angels in America (2003), Nanny McPhee (2005), Stranger than Fiction (2006), Last Chance Harvey (2008), Men in Black 3 (2012), Brave (2012) and Beauty and the Beast (2017).

25|$|The surname 'Irani' {{was adopted}} by the Zoroastrian {{immigrants}} in the 18th century and later, and only by them, for legal and communal reasons. Sheriar was then not born with 'Irani' as a last name, and would originally have had his father's first name as a surname; thus his birth name was probably Sheriar Moondegar. Inversely, in Indian Zoroastrian tradition, which goes back to the days before family names were introduced by the British colonial government, the middle name is always the father's first name, so if one knows a person's middle name, one knows the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father.</b> For instance, Meher Baba's full legal name was Merwan Sheriar Irani.|$|E

25|$|Human {{personal}} {{names are}} presented, used and categorised {{in many ways}} depending on the language and culture. In most cultures (Indonesia is one exception) it is customary for individuals to be given at least two names. In Western culture, the first name is given at birth or shortly thereafter and {{is referred to as}} the given name, the forename, the baptismal name (if given then), or simply the first name. In England prior to the Norman invasion of 1066, small communities of Celts, Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians generally used single names: each person was identified by a single name as either a personal name or nickname. As the population increased, it gradually became necessary to identify people further – giving rise to names like John the butcher, Henry from Sutton, and Roger son of Richard … which naturally evolved into John Butcher, Henry Sutton, and Roger Richardson. We now know this additional name variously as the second name, last name, family name, surname or occasionally the byname, and this natural tendency was accelerated by the Norman tradition of using surnames that were fixed and hereditary within individual families. In combination these two names are now known as the personal name or, simply, the name. There are many exceptions to this general rule: Westerners often insert a third or more names between the given and surnames; Chinese and Hungarian names have the family name preceding the given name; females now often retain their maiden names (their family surname) or combine, using a hyphen, their maiden name and the surname of their husband; some East Slavic nations insert the patronym (a name derived from the given <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father)</b> between the given and the family name; in Iceland the given name is used with the patronym, or matronym (a name derived from the given name of the mother), and surnames are rarely used. Nicknames (sometimes called hypocoristic names) are informal names used mostly between friends.|$|E
