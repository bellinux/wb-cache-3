5|$|After {{it first}} came to light in October, {{it was found that}} it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} election, Carroll faced Republican Robert E. Gable, a coal company owner. The main {{issue of the}} {{campaign}} was the imposition of desegregation busing on the city of Louisville. Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not [...] "doing something about it". In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using {{what he called a}} [...] "truth bell". Gable rang the bell every time that he perceived that Carroll was <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Eventually, the moderator of the debate, newspaper publisher Al Smith, ordered Gable to put the bell away, and Gable's credibility suffered in the eyes of voters. Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 to 277,998, representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor's race. He carried every congressional district including Jefferson County, where a Democrat had not won a race in 20 years. His separately selected running mate, Thelma Stovall, became the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.|$|E

60|$|Last year I {{started to}} build a barn. A man who was a liar {{undertook}} to do the stonework and concrete work for me. He could <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> to my face; he could <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in his work. I was building for posterity. The concrete foundations were four feet wide and sunk three and one-half feet into the earth. The stone walls were two feet thick and nine feet high. Upon them were to rest the great beams that were to carry all the weight of hay and the forty tons of the roof. The man who was a liar made beautiful stone walls. I used to stand alongside of them and love them. I caressed their massive strength with my hands. I thought about them in bed, before I went to sheep. And they were lies.|$|R
500|$|The {{affidavit}} {{filed by}} authorities supporting the arrest warrant for Ward showed that investigators had concluded {{the men were}} <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about what happened. The report states [...] "The evidence demonstrates that Robert Wone was restrained, incapacitated, sexually assaulted, and murdered inside 1509 Swann Street," [...] and there exists [...] "overwhelming evidence, far in excess of probable cause" [...] that Price, Zaborsky, and Ward [...] "obstructed justice by altering and orchestrating the crime scene, planting evidence, delaying the reporting of the murder to the authorities, and lying to the police about the true circumstances of the murder." [...] Lawyers for the three accused men have called the affidavit [...] "speculation, innuendo, assumptions, and irrelevant inflammatory comments" [...] and maintain their clients' innocence. Price and Zaborsky were domestic partners, and the affidavit alleges that Price had previously had {{a sexual relationship with}} Ward. Washington attorney Dale Sanders opined that the release of the extensively detailed affidavit was intended to turn one of the housemates, presumably Ward, against the others, and hypothesized that it indicated prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to charge any of the housemates with additional crimes without the cooperation of a witness.|$|E
