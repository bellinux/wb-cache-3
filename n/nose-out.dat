The straighter the cheek-shank line is, the less signal is provided to the horse before the bit engages. Those that curve backward provide more of {{a signal to the}} horse. Therefore, the type of shank needs to be considered according {{to the use of the}} horse. Horses that maintain a more vertical head position, such as dressage horses, generally use a curb bit with straight shanks. Those that have a <b>nose-out</b> head position when working, such as cutting and roping horses, more commonly use a curved shank.|$|E
5000|$|The cheek-to-shank angle also varies, {{with some}} {{straight}} up and down, others with the shanks curving backward. Some shanks have a dramatic S-curve. Cheek angle influences the angle at which the bit engages and thus way the horse carries its head. Therefore, the type of shank needs to be considered according {{to the use of}} the horse. Horses that maintain a more vertical head position, such as dressage horses and western horses trained in the [...] "straight up" [...] or Vaquero tradition generally use a curb bit with straighter shanks. Those that have a <b>nose-out</b> head position when working, such as cutting and roping horses, more commonly use a more curved shank. Shanks on certain western bits that curve back are sometimes called a [...] "grazing bit." [...] Though a horse should never be allowed to graze in a bridle, the term came from the mistaken notion that the turned-back shank was to allow the horse to eat with a bridle. In reality, the design simply allowed the horse to comfortably travel with its nose well ahead of the vertical. An S curve in a shank does not have a major effect on the angle at which the rein engages, but may alter the balance of the bit at the point the lever arm joins the mouthpiece.|$|E
2500|$|Spinner {{dolphins}} {{are known}} for their acrobatics and aerial behaviors. A spinner dolphin comes out of the water front first and twists its body as it rises into the air. When it reaches its maximum height, the dolphin descends back into the water, landing on its side. A dolphin can make two to 5.5 spins in one leap; the swimming and rotational speed of the dolphin as it spins underwater affects the number of spins it can do while airborne. These spins may serve several functions. [...] Dolphins may also make <b>nose-outs,</b> tail slaps, flips, head slaps, [...] "salmon leaps", and side and back slaps.|$|R
