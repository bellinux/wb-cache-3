5|$|The Australian {{shipping}} {{interests of}} Cunard, Blue Star Line and Ellerman Lines were subsequently formed {{into a separate}} operating company (Associated Container Transportation (Australia)) and following work by Smallpeice, the Australian government allowed the state owned Australian <b>National</b> <b>Line</b> to form a partnership with Associated Container Transportation (Australia). The group {{would go on to}} form the Pacific America Container Express which operated services between Australia and the east coast of North America via the Panama Canal. Smallpeice would serve as chairman of the Associated Container Transportation (Australia)/Australian <b>National</b> <b>Line</b> partnership from its creation in 1969 and as chairman of Associated Container Transportation (Australia) from 1971, retiring from both positions in February 1979.|$|E

It crosses some other major strips such as Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route62 or US62), a major {{contributor}} to traffic on Sheridan due to the proximity of the Boulevard Mall, and Millersport Highway (NY263), which feeds the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. In Amherst it meets the Youngmann Expressway (I-290) where NY240 (Harlem Road), reaches its northern end. Past the Youngmann development abates, green returns to the roadside and the median ends, although the road remains four-lane and high-volume. There is another pocket of development around the Wegmans supermarket north of Williamsville, which has seen some rapid growth in the last few years.|$|E

25|$|The former Illinois Central Railroad line — {{now part}} of the Canadian National system — runs north to south through the city. A spur line from the Canadian <b>National</b> <b>line</b> {{provides}} service to several large industries, including two large food processing plants, on the west edge of Champaign and two grain elevators in outlying communities to the west. The Norfolk Southern operates an east to west line through Champaign. The NS line connects industries in eastern Urbana to the Norfolk Southern main line at Mansfield, Illinois, west of Champaign. The line now operated by Norfolk Southern is the former Peoria & Eastern Railway, later operated as part of the Big Four (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway), New York Central, Penn Central, and Conrail systems, being sold by Conrail to Norfolk Southern in 1996. Construction of the line was begun by the Danville, Urbana, Bloomington and Pekin Railroad. This short-lived entity became part of the Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway before the railroad was completed.|$|E

2500|$|Rockford {{is served}} by several {{different}} freight railroad lines, the Union Pacific, the Canadian National, the Iowa, Chicago & Eastern (Canadian Pacific), and the Illinois Railway. The Union Pacific line from West Chicago terminates in Rockford, at a small yard. Canadian <b>National</b> <b>line</b> from Elgin enters from the South-East, and leaves in the North-West. They have a small yard, where they interchange with the Illinois Railway. The Illinois Railway Rockford Line comes from the South, joins the Canadian <b>National</b> <b>line,</b> where they continue on trackage rights to the Canadian National yard. Canadian Pacific (Iowa, Chicago, and Eastern) runs on Illinois Railway trackage rights from Davis Junction, and leaves on their own trackage to the North. All of the railroads interchange at a yard off of Main Street. The Union Pacific Railroad's Global III Intermodal Facility is located approximately [...] south of Rockford in Rochelle, Illinois, a community of 10,000. [...] The complex {{is one of the}} largest intermodal facilities in the world. Construction on the state-of-the-art facility was completed in 2003 in Rochelle due to the close proximity to four interstate highways (I-39, I-88, I-80, and I-90) and rail routes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{it was decided}} that the Australian Army needed to be {{provided}} with a long-term sealift capability, preferably through the acquisition of a dedicated cargo ship. The chartering of civilian ships to provide this capability when required—as had been done with the merchant vessels [...] and [...] during the Vietnam War—was considered and rejected, because Australian <b>National</b> <b>Line</b> was unable to provide the necessary level of support. It was decided that a purpose-built ship would be constructed for the role, and would be operated by the RAN. While the Army did not require that the ship be capable of beaching, the RAN set this as a requirement, to maximise the ship's flexibility. In 1975, the Navy successfully convinced Australian Military's Force Structure Committee to endorse this requirement over the Army's opposition, and the committee authorised the purchase of a Landing Ship Heavy (LSH) on 19 March 1975.|$|E
60|$|With his {{official}} career Alaric was, {{as we have}} said, well contented; in his stock-jobbing line of business he also had had moments of great exaltation, and some moments of considerable depression. The West Corks had vacillated. Both he and Undy had sold and bought and sold again; and on the whole their stake in that stupendous <b>national</b> <b>line</b> of accommodation was not so all-absorbing as it had once been. But if money had been withdrawn from this, it had been invested elsewhere, and the great sum borrowed from Madame Jaquêtanàpe's fortune had been in no part replaced--one full moiety of it had been taken--may one not say stolen?--to enable Alaric and Undy to continue their speculations.|$|E
60|$|The Confederate assaults {{were made}} with such a {{disregard}} of losses on their own side that our line of tents soon fell into their hands. The ground on which the battle was fought was undulating, heavily timbered with scattered clearings, the woods giving some protection to the troops on both sides. There was also considerable underbrush. A number of attempts {{were made by the}} enemy to turn our right flank, where Sherman was posted, but every effort was repulsed with heavy loss. But the front attack was kept up so vigorously that, to prevent the success of these attempts to get on our flanks, the National troops were compelled, several times, to take positions to the rear nearer Pittsburg landing. When the firing ceased at night the <b>National</b> <b>line</b> was all of a mile in rear of the position it had occupied in the morning.|$|E

60|$|When I {{left the}} <b>National</b> <b>line</b> to visit Flag-officer Foote I {{had no idea}} that there would be any {{engagement}} on land unless I brought it on myself. The conditions for battle were much more favorable to us than they had been for the first two days of the investment. From the 12th to the 14th we had but 15,000 men of all arms and no gunboats. Now we had been reinforced by a fleet of six naval vessels, a large division of troops under General L. Wallace and 2,500 men brought over from Fort Henry belonging to the division of C. F. Smith. The enemy, however, had taken the initiative. Just as I landed I met Captain Hillyer of my staff, white with fear, not for his personal safety, but {{for the safety of the}} National troops. He said the enemy had come out of his lines in full force and attacked and scattered McClernand's division, which was in full retreat. The roads, as I have said, were unfit for making fast time, but I got to my command as soon as possible. The attack had been made on the National right. I was some four or five miles north of our left. The line was about three miles long. In reaching the point where the disaster had occurred I had to pass the divisions of Smith and Wallace. I saw no sign of excitement on the portion of the line held by Smith; Wallace was nearer the scene of conflict and had taken part in it. He had, at an opportune time, sent Thayer's brigade to the support of McClernand and thereby contributed to hold the enemy within his lines.|$|E
