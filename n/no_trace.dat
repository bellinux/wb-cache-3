5|$|Coprolites (fossilized dung) {{containing}} small bones but <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> {{of plant}} fragments, {{discovered in the}} Ischigualasto Formation, have been assigned to Herrerasaurus based on fossil abundance.

50|$|When Tora Bora was {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} U.S., British and Afghan troops, <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> of the supposed fortress were found despite painstaking searches in the surrounding areas.

While arms and ammunition stores were found, there were <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> of the advanced facilities claimed to exist.|$|R
5|$|Passenger numbers fell {{during the}} 1960s, {{and the line}} became {{economically}} unviable. Following a train crash in 1965, the owners closed {{the line at the}} end of September that year. The tunnel still exists, but <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> remains of the stations.|$|E
5|$|The {{head was}} {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} the south side of the Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its authenticity.

5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> of it has been discovered.|$|E

5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> of an {{enclosure}} wall, which {{is present in}} both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|Many people camp on Helvellyn {{throughout}} the year, often near Red Tarn which gives good views of Striding Edge, Swirral Edge, and {{the summit of}} Helvellyn itself. Although camping in England is illegal without {{the permission of the}} landowner, there is a tradition of wild camping in the Lake District. This has often been tolerated so long as people have camped unobtrusively, for no more than one night, and have left <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> of their campsite behind.|$|E
5|$|Nerva was succeeded without {{incident}} by his adopted son Trajan, who {{was greeted by}} the Roman populace with much enthusiasm. According to Pliny the Younger, Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of Nerva, yet <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> of {{it has ever been}} found; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued until ten years after his death. According to Cassius Dio, however, the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, Casperius Aelianus, was 'dismissed' upon Trajan's accession.|$|E

In G 7820B <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> of a coffin were found either, but there was a canopic pit in the {{southeast}} corner of the burial chamber.|$|R
60|$|Witness had {{testified that}} <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> {{had been found}} of these two men; but the witness had not testified that <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> had been found of St. Vincent, Pierre La Flitche, or John the Swede. And {{there was no need}} for them so to testify. Everybody knew that no foot-marks were left when St. Vincent ran up the trail, and when he came back with La Flitche and the other man. Everybody knew the {{condition}} of the trail, that it was a hard-packed groove in the ground, on which a soft moccasin could leave no impression; and that had the ice not gone down the river, <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> would have been left by the murderers in passing from and to the mainland.|$|R
