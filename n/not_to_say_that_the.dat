5|$|Despite these numbers, not all {{the clergy}} were {{regularly}} present at the services in Elgin Cathedral. Absence was an enduring {{fact of life in}} all cathedrals in a period when careerist clerics would accept positions in other cathedrals. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> time spent away from the chanonry was without permission, as some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part-time basis. The dean of Elgin was permanently in attendance; the precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, were available for half the year. The non-permanent canons had to attend continuously for three months. The chapter decided in 1240 to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one seventh of their income. In the Diocese of Aberdeen and it is assumed in other bishoprics also, when important decisions of the chapter had to be taken, an absentee canon had to appoint a procurator to act on his behalf—this was usually one of the dignitaries who had a higher likelihood of being present. At Elgin in 1488, many canons were not abiding by the terms of their leave of absence, resulting in each of them receiving a formal warning and a summons; despite this, ten canons refused to attend and had a seventh of their prebendary income deducted. The bulk of the workload fell to the vicars and a smaller number of permanent canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions. Seven services were held daily, most of which were solely for the clergy and took place behind the rood screen which separated the high altar and choir from lay worshipers. Only cathedrals, collegiate churches and large burgh churches were resourced to perform the more elaborate services; the services in the parish churches were more basic.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> phase of art denoted by {{post-modernism}} is accepted, merely {{that the need for}} a term to describe movements in art after the peak of abstract expressionism is well established. However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Ben Collier {{has said}} that the Culture is a utopia {{carrying}} significantly greater moral legitimacy than the West's, by comparison, proto-democracies. While Culture interventions can seem similar at first to Western interventions, especially when considered with their democratising rhetoric, the argument is that the Culture operates completely without material need, and therefore without the possibility of baser motives. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Culture's motives are purely altruistic; a peaceful, enlightened universe full of good neighbours lacking ethnic, religious, and sexual chauvinisms is in the Culture's interest as well. Furthermore, the Culture's ideals (in many ways {{similar to those of the}} liberal perspective today) are to a much larger extent realised internally in comparison to the West.|$|E

25|$|However, this is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bohr-Sommerfeld {{model was}} without its successes. Calculations {{based on the}} Bohr–Sommerfeld model were able to {{accurately}} explain a number of more complex atomic spectral effects. For example, up to first-order perturbations, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics make the same predictions for the spectral line splitting in the Stark effect. At higher-order perturbations, however, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics differ, and measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths helped confirm the correctness of quantum mechanics over the Bohr model. The prevailing theory behind this difference lies in {{the shapes of the}} orbitals of the electrons, which vary according to the energy state of the electron.|$|E
25|$|A fifth work, {{which in}} the past has been {{attributed}} to Fulgentius is the Super Thebaiden (On the Thebaid). The manuscript ascribes the work to “S. Fulgencius Episcopus”, whom Rudolf Helm (the first modern publisher of Fulgentius’ work) considered to be the mythographer. This work {{was not included in the}} Carolingian manuscripts (possibly because it did not exist at this time), but was included in Helm’s 1897 edition of the works of Fulgentius with strong reservations. While there is no consensus on the authenticity of the treatise, there is strong evidence to support the fact that the work was written in the twelfth century by a writer imitating the allegorical style of Fulgentius. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work was a forgery, but more likely that it was mistakenly attributed to Fulgentius as a result of scribal error.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{is often}} said to use the civil law system, {{but it has a}} unique system that {{combines}} elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis with an element of its own common law long predating the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 (see Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, Scottish common law differed in that the use of precedent was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a precedent, and principles of natural justice and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a stare decisis akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.|$|E

25|$|The Boca Raton Airport, {{also known}} as Boca Raton Army Airfield, was {{selected}} to house a military airfield {{for a number of}} geographic and practical reasons. Southern Florida's climate and physical geography are generally considered mild compared to most northern locations. Florida experiences a winter climate characteristic of the subtropics. Lacking snow or low temperatures enabled military operations to continue year round. Florida also has consistently flat terrain, an ideal feature when training new and inexperienced pilots. Its location adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico also provided ideal locations for flight training. Boca Raton was also chosen for practical purposes. In the early-1940s, Boca Raton's population numbered only 723. This enabled the United States government to take thousands of acres of land for its use without having to relocate a large number of people. However, this is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the military airfield was without controversy. A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony, the land having been seized through the process of eminent domain, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse {{in the early days of}} World War II. All of these conditions enabled construction of the military airfield to commence in June 1942.|$|E
500|$|Not all critics {{agree that}} the work is too complex for children, and some, like Marcus Walsh and Karina Williamson, view that the works would have fit the {{appropriate}} level for children in the 18th century, especially with the short length of each hymn and a small illustration of the scene proceeding each one.

And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but there are some people out there who like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} that the plot of Love in Several Masques is connected to Fielding's own attempt to marry Sarah Andrew in November 1725. Fielding met Andrew when he travelled to Lyme Regis. She was his cousin by marriage, 15 years old, and an heiress of the fortune of her father, Solomon Andrew. Her guardian Andrew Tucker, her uncle, prohibited Fielding from romantically pursuing her; it {{is possible}} that Tucker wished Andrew to marry his own son. On 14 November 1725, Andrew Tucker alleged the mayor that Fielding and Fielding's servant, Joseph Lewis, threatened to harm Tucker. According to Andrews's descendants, Fielding attempted to violently take Andrew on 14 November. Regardless, Fielding fled the town after leaving a notice in public view that accused Andrew Tucker and his son of being [...] "Clowns, and Cowards". Thomas Lockwood qualified the connection of this incident and the plot of Love in Several Masques by saying, [...] "I suspect so too, or at any rate suspect that this experience gave a crucial infusion of real feeling to that part of the play: which is however <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> writing itself, or the idea, goes back that far." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{describes}} {{a series of}} conflicts between reality and the Romantic ideal of uniting with nature. In the words of Richard Fogle, [...] "The principal stress of the poem is a struggle between ideal and actual: inclusive terms which, however, contain more particular antitheses of pleasure and pain, of imagination and common sense reason, of fullness and privation, of permanence and change, {{of nature and the}} human, of art and life, freedom and bondage, waking and dream." [...] Of course, the nightingale's song is the dominant image and dominant [...] "voice" [...] within the ode. The nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem. However, the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song, but about human experience in general. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song is a simple metaphor, but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning. On this theme, David Perkins summarizes the way [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] perform this when he says, [...] "we are dealing with a talent, indeed an entire approach to poetry, in which symbol, however necessary, may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry, any more than it could with Shakespeare, but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions". However, {{there is a difference between}} an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity. Furthermore, in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can have with the nightingale.|$|E
