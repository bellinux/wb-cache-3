25|$|While {{there are}} a variety of {{hypotheses}} that have been proposed for the cause of Alzheimer's disease, the knowledge of this disease is far from complete to explain, making it difficult to develop methods for treatment. In the brain of Alzheimer's patients, both neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors and NMDA receptors are known to be down-regulated. Thus, four anticholinesterases have been developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment in the U.S.A. However, these are not ideal drugs, considering their side-effects and limited effectiveness.

5000|$|Studies of {{long term}} {{consumption}} of <b>nefiracetam</b> in humans and primates have shown {{it to have}} no toxicity. However, animals which metabolize <b>nefiracetam</b> differently from humans and primates {{are at risk for}} renal and testicular [...] toxicity.

50|$|There is no universally {{accepted}} {{mechanism of action}} for racetams. Racetams generally show negligible affinity for common central nervous system receptors, but modulation of central neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine and glutamate, has been reported. Although aniracetam and nebracetam show affinity for muscarinic receptors, only <b>nefiracetam</b> demonstrates nanomolar interactions. Modification of membrane-located mechanisms of central signal transduction is another hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|Nootropic drug <b>nefiracetam</b> {{and related}} {{compounds}} {{are used in}} diseases with learning and memory deficits. Recent studies have implicated relationships between learning, memory, and chronic pain. Thus, in the present report, we have studied the effects of nootropic drug <b>nefiracetam</b> on the thermal and me-chanical hyperalgesia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation or streptozotocin treatment in mice. In the thermal paw with-drawal test, p. o., s. c., i. t., and i. c. v. administration of nefirac-etam dose dependently reversed the thermal hyperalgesia ob-served in nerve-injured mice. <b>Nefiracetam</b> (p. o. and i. t.) also significantly reversed the thermal hyperalgesia observed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.

40|$|<b>Nefiracetam,</b> a {{pyrrolidone}} derivative {{developed as}} an anti-dementia drug, persistently potentiated currents through neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the potentiation {{was blocked by}} either the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, GF 109203 X and staurosporine, or co-expressed active PKC inhibitor peptide. In primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, <b>nefiracetam</b> increased the rate of nicotine-sensitive miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, without affecting the amplitude, and the increase was inhibited by GF 109203 X. In addition, the drug caused a marked increase in the glutamate release from electrically stimulated guinea pig hippocampal slices, and the effect was abolished by the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonists, alpha-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine. <b>Nefiracetam</b> induced a long-lasting facilitation of synaptic transmission in both the CAI area and the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal slices, and the facilitation was inhibited by alpha-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine. Such facilitatory action was still found in the hippocampus with selective cholinergic denervation. The {{results of the present}} study, thus, suggest that <b>nefiracetam</b> enhances activity of nicotinic ACh receptors by interacting with a PKC pathway, thereby increasing glutamate release from presynaptic terminals, and then leading to a sustained facilitation of hippocampal neurotransmission. This may represent a cellular mechanism underlying the cognition-enhancing action of <b>nefiracetam.</b> The results also provide the possibility that <b>nefiracetam</b> could be developed as a promising therapeutic drug for senile dementia or Alzheimer's disease.

We examined the antiepileptic effect of <b>nefiracetam</b> on kainic acid (KA) -induced seizures. KA was infused into the left basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, and focal limbic seizures were induced in 43 male Wistar rats. During status epilepticus, 10, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg of <b>nefiracetam</b> was intravenously injected. <b>Nefiracetam</b> inhibited KA-induced limbic seizures at doses over 100 mg/kg while it had a sedative effect on the animals. In [14 C] deoxyglucose autoradiographic studies, the propagation of seizure-induced hypermetabolic areas was also suppressed dose-dependently. From the results, it was indicated that <b>nefiracetam</b> has an antiepileptic effect and that its application may suppress seizure propagation.

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that continuous i. c. v. infusion of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), the major constituent of senile plaques in {{the brains of}} patients with Alzheimer's disease, results in learning and memory deficits in rats. In the present study, we investigated the effects of <b>nefiracetam</b> [N-(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) - 2 -(2 -oxo- 1 -pyrrolidinyl) acetamide, DM- 9384] on Aβ-(1 - 42) -induced learning and memory deficits in rats. In the Aβ-(1 - 42) -infused rats, spontaneous alternation behaviour in a Y-maze task, spatial reference and working memory in a water maze task, and retention of passive avoidance learning were significantly impaired as compared with Aβ-(40 - 1) -infused control rats. <b>Nefiracetam,</b> at a dose range of 1 – 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, improved learning and memory deficits in the Aβ-(1 - 42) -infused rats when it was administered p. o. 1 [*]h before the behavioural tests. <b>Nefiracetam</b> at a dose of 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 p. o. increased the activity of choline acetyltransferase in the hippocampus of Aβ-(1 - 42) -infused rats. <b>Nefiracetam</b> increased dopamine turnover in the cerebral cortex and striatum of Aβ-(1 - 42) -infused rats, but failed to affect the noradrenaline, serotonin and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid content.

40|$|Accumulated {{evidence}} indicates that the adenylyl cyclase (AC) /cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) /protein kinase A (PKA) /cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) signal transduction system {{may be linked to}} learning and memory function. The effects of <b>nefiracetam,</b> which has been developed as a cognition enhancer, on spatial memory function and the AC/cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction system in rats with sustained cerebral ischaemia were examined. Microsphere embolism (ME) -induced sustained cerebral ischaemia was produced by injection of 700 microspheres (48 μm in diameter) into the right hemisphere of rats. Daily oral administration of <b>nefiracetam</b> (10 mg kg− 1 day− 1) was started from 15 h after the operation. The delayed treatment with <b>nefiracetam</b> attenuated the ME-induced prolongation of the escape latency in the water maze task that was examined on day 7 to 9 after ME, but it did not reduce the infarct size. ME decreased Ca 2 +/calmodulin (CaM) -stimulated AC (AC-I) activity, cAMP content, cytosolic PKA Cβ level, nuclear PKA Cα and Cβ levels, and reduced the phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of CREB in the nucleus in the right parietal cortex and hippocampus on day 3 after ME. The ME-induced changes in these variables did not occur by the delayed treatment with <b>nefiracetam.</b> These results suggest that <b>nefiracetam</b> preserved cognitive function, or prevented cognitive dysfunction, after sustained cerebral ischaemia and that the effect is, in part, attributable to the prevention of the ischaemia-induced impairment of the AC/cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{determining}} whether nefirac-etam might have a persistent cognition-enhancing effect in animals with sustained cerebral ischemia.

40|$|Background/Aims: Prior studies {{demonstrated}} that pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α contribute to regulation of epilepsy-associated pathophysiological {{processes in the}} specific brain regions, namely the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Moreover, GABA transporter type 1 and 3 (GAT- 1 and GAT- 3) modulating extracellular GABA levels are engaged in {{the role played by}} PICs in epileptogenesis. Note that brain ischemic injury also elevates cerebral PICs. Thus, in this report we examined the effects of <b>nefiracetam</b> (NEF), a pyrrolidone derivative, on the levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α, and expression of GAT- 1 and GAT- 3 in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala using a rat model of post-ischemic nonconvulsive seizure (NCS). Methods: NCS was evoked by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ELISA and Western Blot analysis were employed to determine the levels of PICs and GAT- 1 /GAT- 3, respectively. Results: MCAO significantly increased IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala as compared with sham control animals (Pvs. control rats). Also, in these specific brain regions expression of GAT- 1 and GAT- 3 was amplified; and the levels of GABA were decreased in rats following MCAO (Pvs. control rats). Systemic administration of NEF significantly attenuated the elevated PICs, amplified GAT- 1 and GAT- 3 as well as impaired GABA. NEF also attenuated the number of NCS events following MCAO. Conclusion: our data demonstrate that NEF improves post-ischemia evoked-NCS by altering PICs, GABA transporters thereby alleviating GABA in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. This support a role for PICs and GABA in engagement of the adaptive responses associated with epileptic activity, but also suggests that NEF has anti-epileptic effects via PICs-GABA mechanisms, having pharmacological implications to target the specific PICs for neuronal dysfunction and vulnerability related to post-ischemic seizures and cognitive impairment...|$|E
