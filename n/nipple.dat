5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and <b>nipple</b> tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than <b>nipple</b> piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from <b>nipple,</b> eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's <b>nipple.</b> The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the <b>nipple.</b>|$|E
40|$|Pubic <b>nipples</b> (abdominal <b>nipples</b> {{located on}} the ventral body wall near the pubes) are present {{in only a few}} bat taxa. Examination of 1723 indi-viduals {{representing}} 206 species in 83 genera in-dicates that pubic <b>nipples</b> are absent in megachi-ropterans and in the majority ofmicrochiropteran families. Pubic <b>nipples</b> appear to be present in all species belonging to the families Rhinopomatidae, Craseonycteridae, Megadermatidae, and Rhino-lophidae (including Hipposiderinae). Contrary to previous reports, pubic <b>nipples</b> do not occur in Nycteridae, Emballonuridae, Phyllostomidae, or "nyctophiline " vespertilionids. When present, pu-bic <b>nipples</b> are ubiquitous in females but may be absent in some males. Although many previous authors have indicated that pubic <b>nipples</b> do not function at all in lactation, gross morphology of pubic <b>nipples</b> suggests that they may have at least some lacteal function in many species. Lactation aside, it is clear that pubic <b>nipples</b> provide im-portant holdfasts for the young in all taxa. Phylogenetic interpretation of pubic <b>nipples</b> is hampered by uncertainty concerning relationships of bats to other mammalian orders. Based on a variety ofevidence, including the absence ofpubic <b>nipples</b> in Megachiroptera, it seems most likely that absence ofpubic <b>nipples</b> is the primitive con-dition for bats. Because pubic <b>nipples</b> are present in some families but absent in others, the pattem of taxonomic distribution may contribute to our understanding ofhigher-level relationships among microchiropteran bats. Interestingly, the distri-bution of pubic <b>nipples</b> is congruent with immu-nological distance data and the distribution of de-rived traits in other anatomical systems (e. g., hyoid musculature, postcranial osteology). However, more work is necessary before these data can be productively analyzed in a comprehensive phy-logenetic analysis...|$|R

5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{and nose}} piercing {{have been particularly}} widespread and are well represented in historical records and among grave goods. The oldest mummified remains ever discovered were sporting earrings, attesting {{to the existence of}} the practice more than 5,000 years ago. Nose piercing is documented as far back as 1500 BC. Piercings of these types have been documented globally, while lip and tongue piercings were historically found in African and American tribal cultures. <b>Nipple</b> and genital piercing have also been practiced by various cultures, with <b>nipple</b> piercing dating back at least to Ancient Rome while genital piercing is described in Ancient India c. 320 to 550 CE. The history of navel piercing is less clear. The practice of body piercing has waxed and waned in Western culture, but it has experienced an increase of popularity since World War II, with sites other than the ears gaining subcultural popularity in the 1970s and spreading to mainstream in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>nipple</b> {{piercing}}, navel piercing, and genital piercing {{has been particularly}} misrepresented by printed works continuing to repeat myths that were originally promulgated by Malloy in the pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief.

5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to <b>nipple</b> piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one <b>nipple,</b> one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E

50|$|Bacteria {{can enter}} the breast through cracked <b>nipples.</b> This can result in an {{infection}} of the breast - mastitis. Breastmilk has antibacterial action and can protect the baby from infections. The antibacterial properties of milk help to protect the infant. A breast feeding mother can become infected by a Candida infection (thrush) infection in the infant and develop deep-pink, cracked, and sore <b>nipples.</b> It has been found safe for breastfeeding mothers with hepatitis B and cracked <b>nipples</b> to breastfeed. In the event that a nursing woman experiences cracked and bleeding <b>nipples</b> or breast inflammation within one to two weeks immediately following an acute Toxoplasmosis infection (when the organism is still circulating in her bloodstream), it is theoretically possible that she could transmit Toxoplasma gondii to the infant through her breast milk. Immune suppressed women could have circulating Toxoplasma for even longer periods of time. However, the likelihood of human milk transmission is very small. Transmission risk of HIV increases if the mother has cracked and bleeding <b>nipples</b> An uncommon infection in the mother, Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the nursing infant via cracked <b>nipples.</b> Women with hepatitis C are advised to abstain from breastfeeding if their <b>nipples</b> are cracked or bleeding.|$|R
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of <b>nipple</b> and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a <b>nipple</b> piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E

50|$|In humans, milk lines form as thickenings of the {{epidermis}} of the mammary ridge, {{along the}} front surface of both sexes of mammals.

5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the <b>Nipple</b> Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E
5|$|When {{they arise}} in the spring, the females go to nursery colonies which may often be the same place where they were born. These nursery colonies consist mainly of adult females and their young and can {{be located in the}} attics of warm {{buildings}} where there is high humidity. These colonies sometimes reach numbers of bats as great as 1,000 per cave/forest. Gestation lasts 50–60 days. They usually have one baby per female each year, sometimes twins, born sometime from late May to early July. The young are born in an altricial state with their eyes closed and will hang in the nursery while their mothers forage at night. Their eyes open on their second day. They cling to a <b>nipple</b> constantly until they are two weeks old. At three weeks, they learn to fly. By four weeks, they are adult sized. Females may be sexually mature in the fall after their birth, but males may take a year longer. About half of females and most males breed during their first autumn.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one <b>nipple.</b> The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E
