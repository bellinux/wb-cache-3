5|$|For her {{performance}} as Alice Howland, Julianne Moore won an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award. Still Alice marked her first Academy Award win after four previous nominations. Although she was widely considered the Best Actress frontrunner {{in anticipation of}} the Academy Awards ceremony, some critics felt that Still Alice was not one of Moore's strongest performances and did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> win. Moore dedicated her Academy Award win to Glatzer, who died from ALS several weeks later on March 10, 2015.|$|E
5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the sixteenth}} century the Europeans quickly subjugated native peoples, plundering their lands and their wealth.

5|$|After Victory Road, Samoa Joe and Booker T {{continued}} their rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the July17 episode of Impact, Management Director Jim Cornette demanded that Booker T give the championship back to Joe, who {{was recognized as}} the official champion by TNA. Booker T refused this demand, while Joe also declined the offer as he felt he did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> hold the title due to being pinned at the event. Due to these feelings, Cornette instead scheduled a rematch between the two for the championship at TNA's next PPV event Hard Justice on August10. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe challenged Booker T to contest their rematch in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, which Booker T accepted after adding that weapons would be allowed in the match. Joe defeated Booker T at the event to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E

Eventually the Board gave in to the pressure and Younis was promoted back to A category.|$|E

Rakitić later insisted that Croatia did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> go out and the best team were going home. Rakitić appeared in all of Croatia's matches and ended the tournament by scoring one goal.|$|E

25|$|The {{revision}} of her fame and {{status as an}} author {{began in the early}} decades of the 18th century and led to manifest defamations in the 19th and early 20th centuries: she became seen as a scandalous female author who, some critics audaciously asserted, did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be ever read again. Later critics, however, looked back on the conclusions of Richetti and others were short-sighted and perhaps even outright misogynistic and more reflective of their era than of general historic scholarship on the author as an important political satirist.|$|E
25|$|Cardinals owner Chris O'Brien {{was later}} offered- {{but refused to}} accept- the Championship title for his team. At the owners' meeting {{after the end of}} the season, he argued that his team did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> take the title over a team which had beaten them fairly. It appears that his reasons for {{scheduling}} the Milwaukee and Hammond games had been not to take the title, but rather to convince the Chicago Bears to play his team again – the Bears, with Red Grange in their roster, were a very lucrative draw. The NFL said it would revisit the issue later, but never did. It was only after the Bidwill family purchased the team in 1933 that the Cardinals began claiming the championship title.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{the rivalry}} was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later {{kicked out of}} the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a {{lumberjack}} slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2–0 win in Ottawa.|$|E
50|$|Desert claims may be {{generally}} expressed as: Thing X deserves Y in virtue of Z. For example, I (X) deserve a good grade on my test (Y) because I studied hard (Z); Cincinnati (X) <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> be praised (Y) {{because it is}} a pretty city (Z). Some authors have added a further criterion, qualifying Z. That is, Agent X deserves Y in virtue of Z if X is responsible for Z (or, alternatively, if X is also deserving of Z). Considering this stipulation, one does <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> respect simply because one is a human being, because one is not responsible for being a human being (Z). Arguments such as this are understandably contentious as they suggest an untenability of intrinsic desert claims—that is, claims wherein Z means simply to be X. Less controversially, if one (X) uses steroids to win in a footrace, one is said <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> win (Y) because one is not responsible for, and so does <b>not</b> <b>deserve,</b> ones enhanced physical abilities (Z).|$|R

25|$|The {{rules for}} {{unregistered}} land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor {{is entitled to}} apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Shu in 263, Chen Shou's career entered a period of {{stagnation}} until Zhang Hua recommended him {{to serve in the}} government of the Jin dynasty.

Chen Shou was recommended as a xiaolian (civil service candidate), and appointed as a zuo zhuzuo lang (佐著作郎; an assistant scribe) and the acting Prefect (令) of Yangping County (陽平縣). In 274, he collected and compiled the writings of Zhuge Liang, the first chancellor of Shu, and submitted them to the Jin imperial court. He was promoted to zhuzuo lang (著作郎; a scribe) and appointed as the zhongzheng (中正) of Baxi Commandery. The Huayang Guozhi mentioned that he also served as the Chancellor (相) to the Marquis of Pingyang (平陽侯).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Saudis have been {{particularly}} energetic in catering {{to the needs of}} pilgrims. In 1988, a US$l5 billion traffic improvement scheme for the holy sites was launched. The improvement initiative resulted partly from Iranian charges that the Saudi government was incompetent to guard the holy sites after a 1987 clash between demonstrating Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police left 400 people dead. A further disaster occurred in 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims suffocated or were crushed to death in one of the new air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels built to shield pilgrims from the heat. The incident resulted from the panic that erupted in the overcrowded and inadequately ventilated tunnel, and further fueled Iranian claims that the Saudis did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be in sole charge of the holy places. In 1992, however, 114,000 Iranian pilgrims, close to the usual level, participated in the Hajj.|$|E

To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke {{pretends to be}} a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men {{who seem to be}} the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} {{eighteen}} chapters with a two-page preface, which explains {{his experience with}} Metamorphosis and how this book complements it. The thesis of this book is identified by one reviewer as: [...] "the importance of childhood's formative years {{for the development of}} the person. In Suzuki's case, it is the effects of racism, notably time spent in BC's internment camps during the Second World War, that still haunt him." [...] In an interview, Suzuki said, [...] "my drive to do well has been motivated by the desire to demonstrate to my fellow Canadians that my family and I had <b>not</b> <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> be treated as we were". Suzuki identifies a turning point of his life as winning his high school's student presidential election. He initially refused to run believing he was not popular enough.
