5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} {{involved}} is a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. These events may have begun at different times {{in different parts of}} the country. A number of the sites span very long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E
5|$|Göbekli Tepe is {{the site}} of the oldest known {{man-made}} religious structure, a temple dating to circa 10,000 BC, while Çatalhöyük is a very large <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Chalcolithic settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BC to 5700 BC. It is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date and in July 2012 was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The settlement of Troy started in the Neolithic Age and continued into the Iron Age.|$|E

50|$|Neolithic {{architecture}} {{refers to}} structures encompassing housing and shelter from approximately 10,000 to 2,000 BC, the Neolithic period. In southwest Asia, Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the Levant (Pre-Pottery <b>Neolithic</b> A <b>and</b> Pre-Pottery <b>Neolithic</b> B) <b>and</b> from there into the east <b>and</b> west. Early <b>Neolithic</b> structures <b>and</b> buildings {{can be found}} in southeast Anatolia, Syria, and Iraq by 8,000 BC with agriculture societies first appearing in southeast Europe by 7,000 BC, and central Europe by ca. 5,500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the Star&#269;evo-Koros (Cris), Linearbandkeramic, and Vin&#269;a.|$|R
5|$|Karnataka's pre-history {{goes back}} to a paleolithic hand-axe culture {{evidenced}} by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of <b>neolithic</b> <b>and</b> megalithic cultures have also {{been found in the}} state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilisation ca. 3300 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 727 AD but the town probably has an earlier Celtic or Roman origin. Archaeological findings {{provide evidence of}} human settlement during the Mesolithic, the <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> the Bronze Age. A large number of wood piles dating from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were discovered around St. Quirin chapel, suggesting a Roman settlement. At that time Sélestat might have already been a port on the river Ill.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Exmoor's human occupation from Mesolithic times onwards. In the Neolithic period people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> into the Bronze and Iron Ages.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle East, {{cultures}} {{identified as}} Neolithic began {{appearing in the}} 10th millennium BC.

5|$|Herm {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, {{the majority in the}} north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but returned to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War and the scene of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during the sale of the island that the 'identity' of the island was at threat.|$|E
5|$|Kingston Russell Stone Circle, {{also known}} as the Gorwell Circle, is a stone circle located between the villages of Abbotsbury and Littlebredy in the {{south-western}} English county of Dorset. Archaeologists believe that it was likely erected during the Bronze Age. The Kingston Russell ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those who built the circles.|$|E
5|$|Settlement on the Mendip Hills {{appears to}} fall into two types. The first, {{apparent}} in the <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated {{on a small scale}} in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.|$|E

5|$|The Nine Stones {{is part of}} a {{tradition}} of stone circle construction that spread through much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany between 3,300 and 900 BCE, during the Late <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Early Bronze Age. The stone circle tradition was accompanied by the construction of timber circles and earthen henges, reflecting a growing emphasis on circular monuments. The purpose of such rings is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites. At least nine of these stone circles are known to have been constructed near modern Dorset. They are smaller than those found elsewhere in Britain and are typically built from sarsen stone.|$|E
5|$|The area {{displays}} some of {{the earliest}} urban settlements in Europe, with archeological sites showing continuous development from the <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Bronze Age periods. Major archeological finds include Early Helladic fortifications, Mycenaean era workshops and necropolis, a classical era amphitheater, and Paleochristian and Byzantine temples. Some of the earliest and best preserved specimens of Athenian Geometric pottery have been attributed to the Trachones workshop and are featured in museum collections, including two kraters on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{area known}} as Croatia today was {{inhabited}} throughout the prehistoric period. Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina. Remnants of several <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country. The largest proportion of the sites is in the river valleys of northern Croatia, and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered include Starčevo, Vučedol and Baden cultures. The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{hills of}} Euonymeia, {{together}} with the adjacent coastal promontory of Agios Kosmas {{are the two most}} important sites of <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Aegean Bronze Age development in the area of Athens prior to ca. 3000 BCE. Ceramics and obsidian tools found on both sites were identified as originating from the island of Melos, indicating close ties of these settlements with the obsidian-rich islands of the cycladic civilization. The commonality of findings in Agios Kosmas and Euonymeia suggests that the two settlements were functionally linked coastal and inland communities.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation of the area by people from Mesolithic times onward. In the Neolithic period, people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunters and as gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make metal tools, weapons, containers and ornaments started in the late <b>Neolithic,</b> <b>and</b> continued into the bronze and Iron Ages. An earthen ring at Parracombe {{is believed to be}} a Neolithic henge dating from 5000–4000BC, and Cow Castle, which is where White Water meets the River Barle, is an Iron Age fort {{at the top of a}} conical hill.|$|E

5|$|Although little {{evidence}} of settlements {{has been found in}} the Rhondda that date between the <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have been discovered throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. The cairn consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a ring cairn or cairn circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the 'Rhondda Stonehenge' the cairn consists of 10 upright stones no more than 60cm in height encircling a central cist. All the cairns found within the Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is a {{ceremonial}} county in South West England. It is a rural county of rolling hills, {{such as the}} Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. Modern man came {{to what is now}} known as Somerset during the Early Upper Palaeolithic era. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BC, there is evidence of farming when people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> into the Bronze and Iron Ages.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age in Scotland {{lasted from}} {{approximately}} 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland {{has produced a}} relative dearth of remains from this period {{in comparison to the}} <b>Neolithic</b> <b>and</b> later Iron Age. This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC. In Orkney, fewer large stone structures were built during this period, burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate. Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use as bronze metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period. There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland, although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown.|$|E
