The inclusion of a codec integrated circuit (a microchip) amplifies sound signals and converts them from digital to analog.

[...] Like all major DBMS, SQL Server performs a variety of data mining operations by returning or arraying data in different views (also known as drill-down). [...] In addition, SQL Server uses Transact-SQL (T-SQL) [...] to execute four major classes of pre-defined functions in <b>native</b> <b>mode.</b> [...] Functions operating on the DBMS offer several advantages over client layer applications like Excel: they utilize the most up-to-date data available; they can process far larger quantities of data; and, the data is not subject to exporting and transcription errors.|$|E
60|$|The <b>native</b> <b>mode</b> of {{preserving}} {{them is to}} cut off the wings and feet, and then skin the body up to the beak, taking out the skull. A stout stick is then run up through the specimen coming out at the mouth. Round this some leaves are stuffed, and the whole is wrapped up in a palm spathe and dried in the smoky hut. By this plan the head, which is really large, is shrunk up almost to nothing, the body is much reduced and shortened, and the greatest prominence is given to the flowing plumage. Some of these native skins are very clean, and often have wings and feet left on; others are dreadfully stained with smoke, and all hive a most erroneous idea of the proportions of the living bird.|$|E

50|$|Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) is a source-controlled variable-rate {{multimode}} codec {{designed for}} robust encoding/decoding of wideband/narrowband speech.

Depending on the traffic conditions and the desired quality of service (QoS), one of the 4 operational modes is used. All operating modes of the existing VMR-WB standard are fully compliant with cdma2000 rate-set II. VMR-WB modes 0, 1, and 2 are cdma2000 <b>native</b> <b>modes</b> with mode 0 providing the highest quality and mode 2 the lowest ADR. VMR-WB mode 3 is the AMR-WB interoperable mode operating at an ADR slightly higher than mode 0 and providing a quality equal or better than that of AMR-WB at 12.65 kbit/s when in an interoperable interconnection with AMR-WB at 12.65 kbit/s.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{order for}} a Future Internet {{architecture}} to be globally deployed, it must ensure that existing applications will continue to operate efficiently on top of it. As part of the Publish Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP) project, we have explored various options for making endpoint centric applications based on the Sockets Application Programming Interface (API) compatible with the information centric PSIRP prototype implementation. We developed an emulator that mediates between the client/server socket calls and the publish/subscribe PSIRP calls, transforming the exchange of packets to distribution of publications. To assess the overhead of our emulator, we measure the execution time of a simple file transfer application in <b>native</b> socket <b>mode,</b> in emulated socket <b>mode</b> and in <b>native</b> publish/subscribe <b>mode.</b> Index Terms—TCP/IP, Sockets, Publish/Subscribe, PSIRP.

Also, a 65C816 <b>native</b> <b>mode</b> operating system may well use a different stack location than the application software, which means the ISR would have to preserve and subsequently restore the stack pointer (...) [...] Further complicating matters with the 65C816/65C802 is that the sizes of the accumulator and index registers may be either 8 or 16 bits when operating in <b>native</b> <b>mode,</b> requiring that their sizes be preserved for later restoration.|$|E

Under this monthly tax system, the holder of a license (mahaldar) for country spirits could not brew more than ten gallons per day. [...] Licensed distilleries were both private and government-owned. To each distillery was attached an excise establishment consisting of a daroga and a few peons.
