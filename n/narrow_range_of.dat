5|$|The {{subspecies}} Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum (Santa Cruz Long-toed Salamander) is {{of particular}} concern and it was afforded protections in 1967 under the US Endangered Species Act. This subspecies lives in a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> habitat in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County, California. Prior to receiving protections, some few remaining populations were threatened by development. The subspecies is ecologically unique, having unique and irregular skin patterns on its back, a unique moisture tolerance, {{and it is also}} an endemic that is geographically isolated {{from the rest of the}} species range. Other subspecies include A. m. columbianum, A. m. krausei, A. m. macrodactylum and A. m. sigillatum.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, unusual environments may {{preserve}} soft tissues. These lagerstätten allow paleontologists {{to examine}} the internal anatomy of animals that in other sediments are represented only by shells, spines, claws, etc. – if they are preserved at all. However, even lagerstätten present an incomplete picture of life at the time. The majority of organisms living at the time are probably not represented because lagerstätten are restricted to a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> environments, e.g. where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly by events such as mudslides; and the exceptional events that cause quick burial {{make it difficult to}} study the normal environments of the animals. The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms are expected to exist long before and after they are found in the fossil record– this is known as the Signor-Lipps effect.|$|E
5|$|The outer Adams ring, with an orbital {{radius of}} about 63,930km, {{is the best}} studied of Neptune's rings. It is named after John Couch Adams, who {{predicted}} the position of Neptune independently of Le Verrier. This ring is narrow, slightly eccentric and inclined, with total width of about 35km (15–50km), and its normal optical depth is around 0.011±0.003 outside the arcs, which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4km. The fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40%—lower than in other narrow rings. Neptune's small moon Galatea, which orbits just inside of the Adams ring at 61,953km, acts like a shepherd, keeping ring particles inside a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> orbital radii through a 42:43 outer Lindblad resonance. Galatea's gravitational influence creates 42 radial wiggles in the Adams ring with an amplitude of about 30km, which {{have been used to}} infer Galatea's mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune {{are made of}} {{extremely}} dark material, likely organic compounds processed by radiation, similar to that found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> frequencies, a stub {{can be used}} as a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E

25|$|Another {{criticism}} is that IMF programs are only {{designed to address}} poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, and too much state ownership. This assumes that this <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored. A country may also be compelled to accept conditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial crisis in need of assistance.|$|E
25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E

25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> metals because pots and pans need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive so that they do not alter the flavor of the food.

This blows the remaining gases away from the surface of the white dwarf surface and produces an extremely bright outburst of light.|$|E

25|$|For {{scientific}} optical work, dielectric mirrors {{are often}} used. These are glass (or sometimes other material) substrates on which {{one or more}} layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified. The best mirrors of this type can reflect >99.999% of the light (in a <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> wavelengths) which is incident on the mirror. Such mirrors are often used in lasers.|$|E
25|$|In recent work, Jeanette Sakel of the University of Manchester {{studied the}} use of Portuguese by Pirahã speakers. Everett states that the Pirahã use a very {{rudimentary}} Portuguese lexicon with Pirahã grammar when speaking Portuguese and that their Portuguese is so limited to very specific topics that they are rightly called monolingual, without contradicting Gonçalves (since they can communicate on a very <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> topics using a very restricted lexicon). Although Gonçalves quotes whole stories told by the Pirahã, Everett (2009) claims that the Portuguese in these stories is not a literal transcription of what was said, but a free translation from the pidgin Portuguese of the Pirahã.|$|E
25|$|Across most EcM host lineages, {{there appears}} to be low levels of specificity, as EcM plants tend to form symbioses with many distantly related fungi. The {{benefits}} of this system are twofold: 1) seedlings are more likely to form mycorrhizas in a wide array of habitats, thus extending range and setting, and 2) EcM mycobionts can differ in their ability to access nutrients, thus allowing host plants better access to these minerals. Many species of Alnus exhibit a very <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> fungal symbionts, but these fungi are not from related lineages. Thus it is the mycobionts that show phylogenetic specificity, not the alders.|$|E
