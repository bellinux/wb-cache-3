5000|$|The {{ultimate}} {{development is}} the [...] "air-separate" [...] precalciner, in which the hot combustion air for the calciner arrives in a duct directly from the cooler, bypassing the kiln. Typically, 60-75% of the fuel is burned in the precalciner. In these systems, the feed entering the rotary kiln is 100% calcined. The kiln has only to raise the feed to sintering temperature. In theory the maximum efficiency would be achieved if all the fuel were burned in the preheater, but the sintering operation involves partial melting and <b>nodulization</b> to make clinker, and the rolling action of the rotary kiln remains {{the most efficient way}} of doing this. Large modern installations typically have two parallel strings of 4 or 5 cyclones, with one attached to the kiln and the other attached to the precalciner chamber. A rotary kiln of 6 x 100 m makes 8,000-10,000 tonnes per day, using about 0.10-0.11 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. The kiln is dwarfed by the massive preheater tower and cooler in these installations. Such a kiln produces 3 million tonnes of clinker per year, and consumes 300,000 tonnes of coal. A diameter of 6 m appears to be the limit of size of rotary kilns, because the flexibility of the steel shell becomes unmanageable at or above this size, and the firebrick lining tends to fail when the kiln flexes.|$|E
40|$|This paper deals {{about the}} quality {{improvement}} in Raw Mill – 2. In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of production and greater quality of cement, table feeder is replaced with weigh belt feeder. The weight belt feeder helps to weigh the amount of raw material composition and to maintain the constant TPH which is feed to the raw mill. This load cell transfer electrical signals to the electronic unit which is proportional to the load pressure exerted by the raw material. The replacement of existing coin burner with multi channel burner result in increased clinker quality. It is observed that the flame geometry is improved with new burner. Also there is enhanced <b>nodulization</b> and improved strength. Hence a thorough investigation was done on the problems relating to raw mill – 2 and quality improvement is carried out.

40|$|Nodular {{cast irons}} (NCIs) involve the {{inoculation}} and <b>nodulization</b> of 0. 03 to 0. 06 wt% Magnesium, {{as well as}} the addition of Molybdenum, Chromium, Nickel, Copper and Vanadium, although the presence of Niobium is not common. The literature reports that Niobium leads to better mechanical properties of the NCIs, and recent results indicate that 0. 5 wt% Niobium increases the strength and the Charpy notch toughness of NCIs, but decreases its hardness, in relation to a similar NCI without Niobium. The present report studies the addition of 0. 23, 0. 47, 0. 67, and 0. 85 wt% Niobium to a NCI covering the effects on the microstructures, yield and tensile strengths, tensile elongations and Charpy toughness. The NCIs were prepared in a 120 kg medium frequency induction furnace, and samples were obtained following the ASTM A 842 standard; the various test specimens were extracted from these samples according to specific standards for each test. Fracture analysis was performed in fractures specimens after the Charpy tests. It was shown that the volume fraction of pearlite increases as the Niobium content is raised, leading to increments in the yield and tensile strengths and hardness of these materials. Modest increment of tensile ductility and Charpy toughness are observed only for an addition of 0. 23 % Niobium. Fracture analysis revealed typical brittle cleavage surfaces and decohesion between grains and grain - graphite nodules interfaces, and very low porosit...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} soft-sediment deformation structures (clastic dykes, load structures, diapirs, slumps, <b>nodulizations</b> or mudcracks) {{identified in}} three sections (Concud, Ramblillas and Masada Cociero) in the Iberian Range, Spain. These sections were logged from boreholes and outcrops in Upper Pliocene-Lower Pleistocene deposits of the Teruel-Concud Residual Basin, close to de Concud normal fault. Timing of the succession and hence of seismic and non-seismic SSDSs, covering a time span between ~. 3. 6 and ~. 1. 9. Ma, has been constrained from previous biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic information, then substantially refined {{from a new}} magnetostratigraphic study at Masada Cociero profile. Non-seismic SSDSs are relatively well-correlated between sections, while seismic ones are poorly correlated except for several clusters of structures. Between 29 and 35 seismic deformed levels have been computed for the overall stratigraphic succession. Factors controlling the lateral and vertical distribution of SSDSs are their seismic or non-seismic origin, {{the distance to the}} seismogenic source (Concud Fault), the sedimentary facies involved in deformation and the observation conditions (borehole core vs. natural outcrop). In the overall stratigraphic section, seismites show an apparent recurrence period of 56 to 108. ka. Clustering of seismic SSDSs levels within a 91 -ka-long interval records a period of high paleoseismic activity with an apparent recurrence time of 4. 8 to 6. 1. ka, associated with increasing sedimentation rate and fault activity. Such activity pattern of the Concud Fault for the Late Pliocene-Early Pliocene, with alternating periods of faster and slower slip, is similar to that for the most recent Quaternary (last ca. 74. ka BP). Concerning the research methods, time occurrence patterns recognized for peaks of paleoseismic activity from SSDSs in boreholes are similar to those inferred from primary evidence in trenches. Consequently, apparent recurrence periods calculated from SSDS inventories collected in borehole logs close to seismogenic faults are comparable to actual recurrence times of large paleoearthquakes...|$|R
40|$|The lower, {{alluvial}} {{unit in the}} Miocene Bicorb Basin contains several metric-scale limestone intervals which record episodic shallow lacustrine {{environments in}} an alluvial setting developed during the early stage of the basin's evolution. Five main carbonate facies have been differentiated in the lacustrine limestones, although calcite charophyte incrustations predominate and constitute the most striking features of these deposits. The thinnest limestone intervals correspond to deposits from charophyte meadows in ponded shallow depressions in floodplains. The thickest limestone intervals are mainly formed by banded limestones and usually correspond to diverse types of regressive sequences that have been interpreted as resulting from the infill of shallow lakes. The sedimentological features and sequences show noticeable differences in the gradient of the littoral zones {{and the amount of}} palustrine deposits with models proposed for marl lakes. Charophytic carbonates from the best-preserved facies show similar microtextures to those from recent charophyte incrustations. The variations in stable isotopes (δ 13 C, δ 18 O) for these primary carbonates occur in parallel with luminescence variations and correspond to hydrological changes and variations in solute composition and Eh-pH status in the lake waters. The carbonates that display moderate to strong diagenetic modifications show a diverse degree of compaction, aggrading neomorphism, strong cementation and <b>nodulization.</b> The isotopic values for these are arranged in diverse clusters. There is a correlation between the degree of luminescence and the δ 13 C. This suggests that hydrological and hydrochemical variations both in the lacustrine and diagenetic environments are being recorded in parallel. We emphasize the need for further comparative studies between recent and ancient charophytic carbonates. As these carbonates have been used in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, special attention must be paid to the diagenetic changes in ancient charophytic marls. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Repetitive {{sequences}} of carbonate deposits, occurrence {{include in the}} lower part of the Paleogene Carbonate Unit (northeast border of the Madrid Basin), have been studied, defining regressive lacustrine sequences and early diagenetic processes. Binocular microscopic examination, scanning electron microscopic/energy dispersive X-ray observations, and X-ray diffraction analyses joint to isotopic studies (d 18 O and d 13 C) have been used to characterise the facies and environments. The sequences consist of a lower uncemented carbonate mud unit, calcitic or dolomitic in composition, and an upper carbonate unit (arenites, bioclastic limestones, and microbial laminated limestones with cherts). Visual features (vertical prismatic structures, fissures, massive <b>nodulization,</b> rhizoliths, brecciation) and microscopic features (micrite micronodules, vug porosity, circumgranular cementation, gypsum lenticular crystals) outline pedogenic processes. These features, found locally in bioclastic and microbial laminated limestones or in dolomite uncemented muds, define, respectively, palustrine limestones or dolocretes. Facies analysis allows us to define several lacustrine sub-environments (basinal, littoral, eulittoral and supralittoral) and characterises different types of shallowing upward lacustrine sequences, either with or without subaerial exposure. The isotopic values of the bioclastic and microbial laminated limestone (from 5. 77 xto 6. 78 xfor d 13 C, and from 5. 25 xto 5. 53 xfor d 18 O) and those of uncemented calcitic muds (from 5. 80 xto 7. 01 xfor d 13 C, and from 4. 98 xto 5. 58 xfor d 18 O) establish that both types of carbonates precipitated in equilibrium with meteoric waters. In the palustrine carbonate deposits, the d 13 C values suggest a strong organic contribution. The dolomitization that only affected the uncemented carbonate muds is early interpreted because of the structural and compositional characteristics of the dolomite (micro-rhombic dolomicrite, nearly stoichiometric and poorly ordered), and because the calculated average D 18 O dol–cal for calcitic and dolomitic uncemented muds is about 6 x. The d 18 O isotopic values indicate that the dolomite precipitated from water that was slightly more enriched in heavy isotopes than the calcite, because of an increase in evaporation rates. Nodules and nodular levels of cherts occur in the upper units of littoral and eulittoral sequences, probably as a consequence of the existence of microbial mats that could include the silica source. According to their mineralogy (Opal CT and quartz/moganite) and structures (double nodules, lamination and bioturbation), three types of chert are described (TB, MB and WO). These types define three general stages of silicification during the early diagenesis, from the recently buried to the postcompactation of carbonate deposits. The d 18 O values of quartz show that the silicification and ageing of opaline phases occurred from meteoric waters, which were lighter than the calcite or dolomite precipitating waters. The cherts included in palustrine limestones show d 18 O values of quartz that record more evaporated waters than those of the general stages of silicification...|$|E
