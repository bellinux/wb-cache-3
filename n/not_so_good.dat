25|$|On the {{nationalisation}} of British Railways (BR) in 1948 the London Midland Region had {{a number}} of ex-London, Midland and Scottish Railway 2-6-4T and the Western Region a number of GWR Large Prairie 2-6-2T types. These tank engines were particularly suited to commuter and secondary services. However, particularly in Scotland and the Southern Region, the situation was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> with large numbers of pre-grouping types struggling on.|$|E
25|$|The {{human eye}} {{is good at}} seeing small {{differences}} in brightness over a relatively large area, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> at distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency brightness variation. This allows one to greatly {{reduce the amount of}} information in the high frequency components. This is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component, and then rounding to the nearest integer. This rounding operation is the only lossy operation in the whole process (other than chroma subsampling) if the DCT computation is performed with sufficiently high precision. As a result of this, it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero, and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers, which take many fewer bits to represent.|$|E
500|$|Austen's novels {{quickly became}} fashionable among opinion-makers, namely, those aristocrats who often {{dictated}} fashion and taste. Lady Bessborough, sister to the notorious Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, commented on Sense and Sensibility {{in a letter}} to a friend: [...] "it is a clever novel. ...tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it." [...] The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to one of the book's heroines: [...] "I think Marianne & me are very like in disposition, that certainly I am <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> the same imprudence, [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Robert Bridges, {{turn of the}} 19th-century {{literary}} critic, wrote [...] "for {{the sake}} of the last section (l. 50 to end), tho' this is open to the objection that the imagery is work'd up to outface the idea—which is characteristic of Keats' manner. Yet the extreme beauty quenches every dissatisfaction. The beginning of this ode is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> and the middle part is midway in excellence." [...] Later, T. S. Eliot thought very highly of Keats's work and wrote [...] "The Odes—especially perhaps the Ode to Psyche—are enough for his reputation." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert insisted, against Atlantic Records' initial wishes, {{that he and}} Dean {{produce the}} album together. This freed the band from the {{constraints}} of any outside producer's schedule. The recording process could then be intertwined with tour dates, which, Dean said, resulted in improved performances on the record. Dean admitted they had been spoiled by working with producer Brendan O'Brien on previous releases. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> at walking around the control room with a pen and clipboard in my hands, marking down what takes are the best. It's a lot of work. But I like being the very best I can be, and when you're producing, you are taking on everyone's performances and wanting {{it to be the}} best it can be." ...|$|E
500|$|The Return of the King {{was criticized}} for its poor camera placement. [...] "What's {{the use of a}} new {{graphics}} engine and character models when the view is from so far away?" [...] asked Kato. Reed complained about [...] "camera switches which reverse the controls, or worse, completely obscure your viewpoint. On just about every mission the camera switching confuses the hell out of you." [...] The game's save function was also criticized. Ellis commented that [...] "You can only save after completing a level [...] which is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> when you're forced to slog through the same sequences over and over again." [...] Critics also complained about the unskippable cut scenes, occasionally unclear objectives and relatively short length.|$|E

Nancy Basile of About.com listed {{it as one}} of the episodes she felt [...] "shined in season eleven". While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on [...] "Bart to the Future", writing: [...] "This kind of fantasy episode can be hit or miss, and that trend holds true here. However, more of 'Future' succeeds than flops. Though a few gags bomb, most of them prove pretty good. At no point does this become a classic, but it amuses much of the time." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote in 2011 that the episode [...] "was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> although better than many of the real stinkers yet to come at that point. Still, it utterly failed to rise to the challenge of 'Lisa’s Wedding.'" ...|$|E

Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes when we played <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> and we paid for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, {{but this is a}} different story. It's our turn to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite a few times in Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Ghosts of Onyx author Eric Nylund had {{previously}} written {{two of the}} three past Halo novels, [...] and , and went to Halos developer Bungie with an outline of {{what he wanted to do}} next. According to Nylund, Bungie gave him room to write the story as long as he accomplished some [...] "very specific [...] goals", sometimes making changes to the Halo universe to incorporate his ideas. However, he acknowledged the difficulty of fitting his story into the rest of the Halo universe was far greater for Ghosts of Onyx than the other novels as more of the story had been made public and was no longer able to be modified. Nylund mentioned in an interview with IGN that writing a Halo novel had both its positive aspects and drawbacks. [...] "It's better because I have all these great toys and characters to play with," [...] Nylund stated in an interview, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> because I have to work and play well with other parts of the intellectual property so everything meshes." ...|$|E

500|$|Right away, Jackson {{noticed that}} Springsteen {{was a very}} {{particular}} critic of his own concert sound. At every new venue, Springsteen would take [...] "BJ" [...] around to various seats in the concert venue, sitting in every section, even the last row of seats, {{and listen to the}} band play. He asked Jackson why the sound was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> far away as it was up close, and if the audio crew could do anything about it. Jackson said, [...] "we can do a lot about it", and worked with Clair Brothers to design a ring of delay loudspeakers positioned closer to the farthest seats to augment the high frequencies lost over distance by sound waves travelling through air. This made the hi-hat sound more [...] "crisp and clean", with higher quality sound in the back row than previously experienced in such large venues. Throughout Jackson's years with him, Springsteen maintained his interest in delivering high quality sound to every seat, and the solutions grew in size and complexity until by 1984 there were eight rings of delays set up for the largest venues.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{started working}} on the album in mid-July 2000. While {{compiling}} songs for Sweet Kisses, she had expressed inconvenience when a track's lyrics were too suggestive or delivered a message she {{did not agree with}} and thus asked for its modification. However, for Irresistible, she decided to let Tommy Mottola, the CEO of Columbia, take control of the whole project. He enlisted many established composers and producers for the album, hand-picked each song for the track list, and rejected those he felt were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> Although she had previously announced that she would write a few songs for her second album, Simpson does not share songwriting credits on any of the tracks. On being asked why, she said that she was very shy when it came to songwriting and felt that it requires a lot of [...] "bravery" [...] to write songs. She also expressed that she could not find the right words for the songs and hence did not write for the record. According to Simpson, the album did not have a definite concept or theme; Mottola selected songs which they felt were good enough for Simpson and compiled them into an album.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

He was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> in exposition." [...] Asquithian Liberals continued to advocate traditional Gladstonian policies of sound finance, peaceful foreign relations and the better treatment of Ireland.

Musician David Amram - who wrote the foreword to the book - was {{on hand for the}} book signing, along with co-author and Woody Guthrie historian, Guy Logsdon.

2500|$|Harrison was outspoken {{about his}} {{political}} views, {{such as his}} pacifism (he was an active supporter of the international language Esperanto), {{and the fact that}} he was gay. He was also politically active and informed, including knowledge of gay history. He wrote many pieces with political texts or titles, writing, for instance, Homage to Pacifica for the opening of the Berkeley Headquarters of the Pacifica Foundation, and accepting commissions from the Portland Gay Men's Chorus (1988 and 1985) and by the Seattle Men's Chorus to arrange (1987) his Strict Songs, originally for eight baritones, for [...] "a chorus of 120 male singing enthusiasts.

2500|$|All of {{the drum}} tracks had been {{recorded}} at The Pool at Miloco Studios in London, {{over the course}} of three weekends in late 2015. The drums were recorded here due to the band's personal studio consisting solely of a control room, a live room, and storage for their equipment. Duce said their studio was [...] "great for close mic stuff but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> for big room drums." [...] Vocal overdubs and stomps were also recorded. Dan Lancaster produced the sessions here, with assistance from Sam Harper and Jamie McEvoy. Lancaster also engineered the drums, with additional drum engineering by Darren Jones. Jones mentioned that the group originally planned to record a few songs but [...] "liked the sound so much they decided to do the [...] whole album". Following the end of a UK tour in December 2015, the band members went on a six month break to spend time with family. According to Duce, the group spent a period of time [...] "refining our sound as well as trying some new techniques." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the show}} {{continued}} its first season, the response became considerably more positive, {{and by the}} second season critical response was favorable. Entertainment Weekly gave the second season an A-, stating that [...] "all it took was a little sunshine to give this show some heat", and that the [...] "new, trashier take is working" [...] after what they considered a [...] "drippy" [...] first season. LaDale Anderson of Canyon News commented on the change between the first two seasons, saying that [...] "the transformation of the characters and storylines in season two has been fantastic", and [...] "sometimes a show needs a makeover and with the right pieces in place a <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> show can become something sensational." [...] The reviewer opined that [...] "what has worked so well [...] is that the characters are not one-dimensional. With most shows characters seamlessly continue to embody characteristics that solely define them, but not here." [...] Anderson also praised the writing, saying it was [...] "intricate and intertwines itself without forcing the storylines to connect; they mesh naturally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{controversy}} arose {{with the}} publication of Franck's only symphony, that in D minor (1888). [...] The work was badly received: the Conservatoire orchestra opposed, the audience [...] "ice-cold", the critics bewildered (the reactions ranged from [...] "unreserved enthusiasm" [...] to [...] "systematic disparagement"), and many of Franck's fellow composers completely out of countenance towards a work [...] "which by its general style and even certain details" [...] (for example, use of an English horn) [...] "outraged the formalist rules and habits of the stricter professionals and amateurs." [...] Franck himself, on being asked whether the symphony had any basis in a poetic idea, told Louis de Serres, a pupil, that [...] "no, it is just music, nothing but pure music." [...] According to Vallas, much of its style and technique (both good and <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>good)</b> can be attributed directly to the centrality of the organ in Franck's thinking and artistic life, and Franck profited from the experience. [...] "He confided in his pupils that from thence on he would never write like that again." ...|$|E
