5|$|In 1920, the University of Göttingen offered Max Born its {{chair of}} {{theoretical}} physics, which {{had recently been}} vacated by Peter Debye. Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski and Carl Runge, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> physics. This would change. As part of his price for coming to Göttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured professor ordinarius. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought Hertha Sponer with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, a gifted teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures. Franck refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.|$|E

5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E

500|$|Knox was notable <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the {{overthrow}} of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring {{the replacement of the}} established Christian religion with Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism. It was thanks to Knox that the Presbyterian polity was established, though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689. Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and was happy to see his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the Protestant Archbishop of St Andrews John Douglas in 1571. In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide.|$|E

George Marshall {{decided that}} MacArthur would be awarded the Medal of Honor, a decoration {{for which he}} had twice previously been nominated, [...] "to offset any propaganda by the enemy directed at his leaving his command". [...] Eisenhower pointed out that MacArthur had not actually performed any acts of valor as required by law, but Marshall cited the 1927 award of the medal to Charles Lindbergh as a precedent. Special legislation had been passed to authorize Lindbergh's medal, but while similar legislation was introduced authorizing the medal for MacArthur by Congressmen J. Parnell Thomas and James E. Van Zandt, Marshall felt strongly that a serving general should receive the medal from the President and the War Department. MacArthur chose to accept it on the basis that [...] "this award was intended <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command." [...] Arthur and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor.

Collum called Lazzara and Nolan's vocal delivery [...] "rapid-fire" [...] in a [...] "back-and-forth way, {{as if they were}} carrying on a dialogue, [...] allows you to really attach to and {{get a sense of the}} raw emotion behind the songs". In a retrospective review for Alternative Press, Brendan Manley wrote that the album [...] "is as close as it gets to a modern masterpiece, capturing not just a band at their apex, but an entire scene". According to Manley, Tell All Your Friends was [...] "the crossover breaking point, finally bringing what had been percolating for years in East Coast VFW Halls to the attention of the masses". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic wrote that the album features [...] "power chords and clean strums and palm muting and reverb". About whether this was negative, Freeman said, [...] "With songs this good, it shouldn't be ... It's all here, solid and undeniably catchy".

500|$|According {{to modern}} {{historian}} Michael Winship, Hutchinson is famous, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> {{what she did}} or said during the Antinomian Controversy, but for what John Winthrop made of her in his journal and in {{his account of the}} controversy called the Short Story. [...] According to Winship, Hutchinson became the reason in Winthrop's mind for all of the difficulties that the colony had gone through, though inaccurately portrayed and, with her departure, any other lingering issues were swept under the carpet. [...] Winthrop's account has given Hutchinson near legendary status and, as with all legends, what exactly she stood for has shifted over the centuries. Winthrop described her as [...] "a woman of ready wit and bold spirit". In the words of Winship, to Winthrop, Hutchinson was a [...] "hell-spawned agent of destructive anarchy". The close relationship between church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that a challenge to the ministers was quickly interpreted as challenge to established authority of all kinds. [...] To 19th century America, she was a crusader for religious liberty, as the nation celebrated its new achievement of {{the separation of church and}} state. [...] Finally, in the 20th century, she became a feminist leader, credited with terrifying the patriarchs, not because of her religious views but because she was an assertive, highly visible woman. According to feminist Amy Lang, Hutchinson failed to understand that [...] "the force of the female heretic vastly exceeds her heresy". [...] Lang argues that it was difficult for the court to pin a crime on her; her true crime in their eyes, according to Lang's interpretation, was the violation of her role in Puritan society, and she was condemned for undertaking the roles of teacher, minister, magistrate, and husband. [...] (However, the Puritans themselves clearly stated that the threat which they perceived was entirely theological, and no direct mention was ever made to indicate that they were threatened by her gender.) ...|$|E
500|$|Jannon's career {{took place}} during a {{politically}} tense period. Jannon was a Protestant in mostly Catholic France. After apparently working with the Estienne family in Paris he set up an independent career as printer in Sedan {{in what is now}} north-eastern France, becoming printer for the Protestant Academy. By his report he took up punchcutting seriously in his thirties, although according to Williamson he would have cut decorative material and engravings at least before this. Sedan the time enjoyed an unstable independence as a principality {{at a time when the}} French government had conceded through the Edict of Nantes to allowing a complicated system of restricted liberties for Protestants. While acknowledging his talent and commissioning equipment from him, as documented by the surviving purchase order, it is known that authorities in 1644 raided an office in Caen where he had been commissioned to do printing. Warde initially assumed that this was the source of the Jannon materials in the Imprimerie Nationale before the government's purchase order came to light. Jannon's types and their descendants are recognizable by the triangular serifs on the top left of such characters as 'm', 'n' and 'r', which have a very steep slant in Jannon's design compared to Garamond's. The italics are also very different to Garamond's own or Granjon's, being much more ornate and with considerable variation in angle of the capitals. Opinions of Jannon's engraving quality have varied; Warde found them [...] "of slight value as a book face" [...] and Vervliet described them as [...] "famous <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the quality of the design but as for the long-term confusion it created", although many reproductions of his work were successful in printing in the twentieth century. Jannon cut far more types than those surviving in the Imprimerie collection: before the misattribution to Garamond, he was particularly respected for his engraving of an extremely small size of type, known for his workplace as sédanoise, which was popular.|$|E
