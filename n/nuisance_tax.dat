According to our research the administrative costs of taxation in Croatia, as a percentage of GDP, decreased slightly over the past fifteen years but still remain above the EU average. Thus, {{there is a need to}} reduce the administrative costs of taxation, first by identifying and abolishing <b>nuisance</b> <b>taxes</b> that raise very little revenue and have high administrative costs. Second, special attention should be devoted to analysing and reducing the service expenses of tax authorities (especially IT expenses and expenses for telephone, mail and transportation services). The main problem related to research into administrative costs in Croatia over a longer period is the lack of relevant and reliable data, and hence the Croatian tax authorities should collect more data and release them to the public...|$|R

40|$|Mexico's {{tax system}} is a paradox. The tax policy and tax {{administration}} reforms of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s delivered a tax structure that {{is in many ways}} comparable, if not superior, to that in many OECD countries. However, Mexico's tax system continues to perform in some fundamental ways, in particular in its ability to raise adequate revenues, worse than the tax system of many developing countries. The basic objective of this evaluation is to try to explain this paradox. In doing that we will compare the revenue performance of Mexico's tax system to that of other developing and developed countries and examine Mexico's tax system buoyancy and elasticity over time. The evaluation will also take stock of the recent performance of Mexico's tax system vis-a-vis other important objectives of any tax system. In particular, we will examine the vertical and horizontal distribution of tax burdens, the relative distortions or excess burdens introduced by the tax system in the decisions of economic agents, and its relative complexity and impact on tax administration and taxpayer compliance costs. The main objective of the evaluation is to identify the most important avenues for reform in tax policy, tax administration, and the political economy of tax reform in Mexico. The improvements in Mexico's tax structure have been many during the last 10 to 15 years. Examples in the area of income taxation include the practically full indexation of personal and enterprise profit tax for inflation, the full integration of these two taxes to avoid the double taxation of dividends, and the application of a minimum tax on gross assets, to which the enterprise profit tax is creditable, to combat tax evasion. The structures of the VAT and excise taxes are also on the whole quite adequate. While many <b>nuisance</b> <b>taxes</b> were eliminated, the standard tax rates for the main taxes are similar to or slightly below international averages. The effective marginal rates of taxation on new investment, as also reviewed below, {{have been found to be}} below those of most OECD and Latin American countries, thus creating a favorable atmosphere for domestic and foreign investment. And yet, with all these good characteristics, Mexico's tax system has not been able to generate much more that 10 to 11 percent of tax revenues in relation to GDP. The most important issue before proceeding with tax reform, especially if the most important objective is to increase the revenue adequacy of the system, is to explain what factors may account for this enduring low tax effort.

30|$|Research {{reveals that}} small {{enterprises}} bring {{benefits to the}} individuals, communities and economies, especially in the developing countries, including Ghana. Entrepreneurs tend to be happier, healthier {{and less likely to}} be divorced from their ventures than colleagues who worked for large firms (Murphy 2010). This means that entrepreneurship could be learned. Thus, the provision of appropriate entrepreneurial education would enable the budding business people to evaluate the entrepreneurial opportunity identified. Such entrepreneurs assess the resources required to turn the opportunity into benefits, acquire the needed resources to succeed in their ventures and manage the ventures and then enjoy the fruit of their labour. The economic prospects and growth being experienced in Ghana generates a growing demand for new needs, thus opening up opportunities for creating small ventures, and encourages the development of entrepreneurship. Construction work in Ghana is booming, and so is service industries, including the telecommunication sub-sector, media houses and the banking sector. These organisations are in good business, and the workers go to work early and close from work late. They buy food, newspapers and other items {{on the way to work}} making hawking and vending on these two junctions attractive trading posts to the youth. When properly planned, nurtured and supported by government institutions, the informal business people would grow their trades, legally register, licence and subject them to government labour regulations. By so doing, small entrepreneurs would improve not only their quality of life but that of others as well. As observed by Cordeiro (2007), small entrepreneurs are sensitive to the market, and continually innovate and develop new products. That in itself means that small entrepreneurs tend to be efficient in producing and delivering goods and services to the market for profit from short-, medium- to long-term basis. Although becoming an astute entrepreneur demands acquisition of certain critical skills set, yet it is more of a process, a belief and commitment. Displaying hard work, passion and creativity would eventually make entrepreneurs grow their ventures to employ many others, retain wealth locally, generate external wealth and distribute income more equally in the communities. As they work hard to formalise their ventures, they would become registered and start paying tolls, stamp duties and taxes to the government. Succeeding in this direction requires education and training, and that is exactly what the vendors and hawkers on our streets require to grow their trades in the short-, medium- and long-term basis. After all, the policies of government include the reduction of cost of borrowing credit, waiving of some <b>nuisance</b> <b>taxes</b> and the reduction of electricity and water tariffs. These strategies are aimed at empowering, particularly small entrepreneurs, to expand their operations to reduce the growing unemployment in Ghana.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{frequently}} {{argued that the}} formation of inter-firm networks (business cooperation) {{could be used as}} an effective means to promote SMIEs in Indonesia. However, as the majority of previous studies have concentrated largely on investigating SMIEs internal management, there has been only little detailed information available concerning the determinants and the economic role of inter-firm networks in the development of Indonesian SMIEs. This thesis discusses not only issues involving the development of SMIEs from the angle of SMIEs internal management, but also goes further to examine what are the determinants impacting on the efforts of SMIEs to develop and maintain long-term inter-firm networks, and to what extent and how have inter-firm networks contributed to the improvement in their performance. Thus, this thesis is expected to make several distinctive contributions to knowledge since it provides the first examination of the determinants and the economic role of inter-firm networks in the development of SMIEs in the Bandung garment industry, and is the first estimate of technological capabilities, competitiveness, and growth of SMIEs in Indonesia. To provide a better foundation for considering these three issues, this thesis starts by analyzing the development of both the Indonesian SMIEs and the Indonesian garment industry. Subsequently, this thesis constructs a theoretical framework by adopting a pluralistic theoretical approach. The theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of trust and competency as fundamental determinants for cementing the formation and operation of a network. The framework also highlights several advantages that SMIEs can enjoy from their involvement in a particular type of inter-firm networks. Using these initial analyses and the theoretical framework as guidance, a case study is then conducted by surveying 210 SMIEs in the garment industry in several specific locations of Bandung. The analysis outlined in this thesis indicates the important role of SMIEs in the Indonesian economy. SMIEs are able not only to create employment and generate income for both household economies and the national economy, but importantly also to contribute to Indonesias industrial exports. However, despite these important roles, the analysis of the survey (fieldwork) data also indicates that SMIEs suffer from a number of problems. It is found that most SMIEs surveyed face difficulties in securing and expanding their markets. They also have limited resources and access to capital, technology, and raw materials. The majority of SMIEs surveyed eased their problems by engaging in inter-firm networks. However, due to unfair practices, untrustworthy and incompetent partners, a significant number of them terminated and discontinued their engagement. Consistent with theoretical arguments, it is found that by developing inter-firm networks, SMIEs surveyed have an alternative solution to securing and expanding their markets. Furthermore, developing inter-firm networks provides opportunities to SMIEs to have better access to capital, technology, information, and raw materials. This suggests that inter-firm networks can be used as an important means of facilitating the development of SMIEs. Three important conditions may facilitate the preference of the majority of SMIEs surveyed to develop inter-firm networks. Firstly, entrepreneurs in the Bandung garment industry come from a similar socio-cultural background. Furthermore, Bandungs garment products are popular among many Indonesian for their up-to-date design, good quality, and competitive prices. This popularity attracts many enterprises from Bandung and other Indonesian cities to develop networks with Bandungs garment enterprises. In addition, by using a binomial logit model, it is found that several attributes of entrepreneurs, particularly educational background, correlate positively with the decision of SMIEs to develop inter-firm networks. The higher educational level of entrepreneurs, {{the more likely they are}} to develop inter-firm networks. The fact that the majority of entrepreneurs interviewed have a high level of educational background could be another reason why inter-firm networks have been adopted as a common strategy by the majority of SMIEs surveyed. This is because educational background correlates positively with the ability to build contacts and to communicate with others. The better entrepreneurs communicate with others, the more capable they are to develop inter-firm networks. In line with the theoretical argument, the analysis of the fieldwork data also indicates that trustworthiness and competency are fundamental determinants for the success of long-term inter-firm networks. Thus, to develop such networks, SMIEs need not only to build trust and competency, but also to find trustworthy and competent partners. This entailed several initial mechanisms being utilized by the SMIEs surveyed. Interestingly, the initial mechanism that SMIEs choose to develop inter-firm networks determines whether or not their networks can survive over a longer period of time. Indeed, as the estimates of the binomial logit model indicates, if entrepreneurs develop cooperation through mechanisms other than trade and industry associations and government programs, this increases the probability of long-term business cooperation. In contrast, if entrepreneurs develop business cooperation via trade and industry associations and government programs, this decreases the probability that cooperation will continue over a longer period of time. By using an ordered probit model, the analyses of the survey data also shows that inter-firm networks, together with several other variables, positively influence the performances of SMIEs surveyed. If SMIEs are involved in inter-firm networks, this increases their probability of improving their technological capabilities, expanding their markets, and accelerating their growth. However, the estimates of the ordered probit model also indicate that each type of inter-firm network brings a different positive impact. Engaging in more than one type of inter-firm network has a larger impact on improving the performances of SMIEs surveyed than involvement in one type of network. Also, entering a vertical inter-firm network (putting out and subcontracting) has a greater positive impact in enabling SMIEs to increase their business performances than entering into horizontal inter-firm network (clustering). The significant role of inter-firm networks in providing various benefits for SMIEs may in turn encourage the government to become involved in the promotion of inter-firm networks. However, by assuming SMIEs that can maintain their inter-firm networks over a longer period of time are those that succeed in developing their networks, it is found that such networks can only be developed successfully if they are based on economic and profit motivations. This suggests that the government should focus and limit its involvement in the promotion of inter-firm networks by only adopting market-oriented policy based on actual needs as articulated by SMIEs themselves. Indeed, as the SMIEs surveyed mention, instead of intervening directly, the government should pay more attention to the creation of conducive and stable legal and commercial (economic) conditions. Many SMIEs believe that such an environment is an important prerequisite not only to stimulate the development of inter-firm networks, but also to ensure that these work effectively. Without having to intervene directly, there are many ways in which the government can support the development of inter-firm networks. The first important one is to design and introduce a legal framework (laws) that can be used to solve commercial disputes of firms in a network. In addition, the government could eliminate various <b>nuisance</b> <b>taxes</b> and reduce tariffs and taxes on high quality imported inputs to enable SMIEs to develop inter-firm networks. Finally, the government should eliminate discriminatory policy against SMIEs and implement anti-monopoly laws to ensure that SMIEs and LIEs compete fairly...|$|R
