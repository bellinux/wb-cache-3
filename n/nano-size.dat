The complexity comes from the very low concentrations of nanomaterials in the environmental medium, the transformations of the nanomaterials due to the reactivity of the surface, the transfer in the environmental media, particularly in the presence of liquid water (soils, sediments, surface water), which implies an association with natural colloids (organic or minerals) and blockage in some compartments.

However, there are still many characteristics of this technology about which very little is known: e.g., how quickly nZVI will be transformed and to what products, whether this residue will be detectable in the environment, and how surface modifications of nZVI will alter its long-term environmental fate and effectiveness for remediation.|$|E

40|$|We present TEM {{images of}} the {{interior}} of metal whiskers (MW) grown on electroplated Sn films.

In an attempt to address such questions we performed an in-depth study of MW structure at the nanoscale by detaching a MW from its original film, reducing its size to a thin slice by cutting its sides by a focused ion beam, and performing TEM on that structure. Our observations revealed a rich nontrivial morphology suggesting that MW may consist of many side by side grown filaments. This structure appears to extend to the outside whisker surface and be the reason for the striation. In addition, we put forward a theory where nucleation of multiple thin metal needles results into micron-scale and larger MW diameters. This theory is developed in the average field approximation similar to the roughening transitions of metal surfaces. The theory also predicts MW nucleation barriers and other observed features.

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is now {{the most}} {{challenging}} bacterial pathogen affecting patients in hospitals and in care centers, and has brought {{on the need to}} develop new drugs for MRSA. This thesis centers on studies of N-thiolated beta-lactams, a new family of potent antibacterial compounds that selectively inhibit the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Chapter 1 describes MRSA in more detail. Chapter 2 outlines experiments on the effect of a fatty ester group (CO 2 R) on the C 4 -phenyl ring of N-methylthio fO-lactams, expecting that attachment of long chain ester moieties might increase the hydrophobicity, and thus enhance the drugs ability to penetrate through the cell membrane. However, the results indicate that antibacterial activity drops off rapidly when more than seven carbon atoms are in the chain. These results led to the idea about examining a fO-lactam conjugated polymer as a possible pro-drug delivery method, which is the focus of Chapter 3. To synthesize the initial drug-polymer candidate, microemulsion polymerization of an acrylate-substituted lactam was done in aqueous solution to form hydrophilic polymeric nanoparticles containing the highly water-insoluble solid antibiotic, N-methylthio fO-lactam. This method has advantages over the conventional emulsion polymerization methods because a solid co-monomer (fO-lactam drug) can be utilized. SEM studies show that these polymeric nanoparticles have a microspherical morphology with <b>nano-sizes</b> of 40 - 150 nm.

Studied compounds were the two micro-size reference quartzes, SRM 1878 a and DQ 12, a micro- and <b>nano-size</b> rutile titanium dioxide (TiO 2), a <b>nano-size</b> anatase, and an amorphous TiO 2. Particles were administered by a single i. t. instillation in mice at a fixed dose of 5, 50, and 500 μg, respectively. Inflammation was evaluated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) content of inflammatory cells, the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6), as well as from lung histology. Evaluations were at 24 h (acute effects) and 3 months (subchronic effects) after instillations. Both types of quartz induced a dose-dependent acute increase of neutrophils, IL- 6, and total protein in BALF. Limited subchronic inflammation was observed. All types of TiO 2 induced a dose-dependent acute increase of neutrophils in BALF. In the acute phase, micro- and <b>nano-size</b> rutile and <b>nano-size</b> amorphous TiO 2 induced elevated levels of IL- 6 and total protein in BALF at the highest dose. At the <b>nano-size</b> rutile and amorphous TiO 2, subchronic lung inflammation was apparent from a dose-dependent increase in BALF macrophages. Histology showed little inflammation overall.

This thesis addresses {{transmission electron microscope}} characterisation of nanoparticle morphology, concerning specifically the crystal- lographic status of novel intermetallic GaPd 2 nanocatalysts and advancement of electron tomographic methods for high-fidelity three-dimensional analysis. Going beyond preceding analyses, high-resolution annular dark-field imaging is used to verify successful <b>nano-sizing</b> of the intermetallic compound GaPd 2. It also reveals catalytically significant and crystallographically intriguing deviations from the bulk crystal structure. So-called ‘non-crystallographic’ five-fold twinned nanoparticles are observed, adding a new perspective in the long standing debate over how such morphologies may be achieved. The morphological complexity of the GaPd 2 nanocatalysts, and many cognate nanoparticle systems, demands fully three-dimensional analysis. It is illustrated how image processing techniques applied to electron tomography reconstructions can facilitate more facile and objective quantitative analysis (‘nano-metrology’). However, the fidelity of the analysis is limited ultimately by artefacts in the tomographic reconstruction. Compressed sensing, a new sampling theory, asserts that many signals can be recovered from far fewer measurements than traditional theories dictate are necessary. Compressed sensing is applied here to electron tomographic reconstruction, and is shown to yield far higher fidelity reconstructions than conventional algorithms. Reconstruction from extremely limited data, more robust quantitative analysis and novel three-dimensional imaging are demon- strated, including the first three-dimensional imaging of localised surface plasmon resonances. Many aspects of transmission electron microscopy characterisation may be enhanced using a compressed sensing approach...|$|R

Solid catalysts are usually composed of metals that form supports onto the surface and create metal particles with high surface areas. TiO 2 composites containing transition metal ions (silver) and/or bentonite clay were prepared. Photocatalytic efficiencies have been investigated for the degradation of Orange G an azo dye. Various analytical techniques were used to characterize the surface properties of nano-sized titania modified using silver and/or bentonite clay. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR analyses showed that TiO 2 (10 ± 2 nm) and Ag (2 to 3 nm) particles were supported on the surface of the bentonite clay and the size was in the range of 100 ± 2 nm. The modified catalysts P- 25 TiO 2 /Bentonite/Ag and P- 25 TiO 2 /Ag were found to be very active for the photocatalytic decomposition of Orange G.

McGregorThe microstructured {{semiconductor}} neutron detector (MSND) {{was investigated}} and previous designs were improved and optimized. In the present work, fabrication techniques have been refined and improved to produce three-dimensional microstructured semiconductor neutron detectors with reduced leakage current, reduced capacitance, highly anisotropic deep etched trenches, and increased signal-to-noise ratios. As {{a result of}} these improvements, new MSND detection systems function with better gamma-ray discrimination and are easier to fabricate than previous designs. In addition to the microstructured diode fabrication improvement, a superior batch processing backfill-method for 6 LiF neutron reactive material, resulting in a nearly-solid backfill, was developed. This method incorporates a LiF <b>nano-sizing</b> process and a centrifugal batch process for backfilling the nanoparticle LiF material. To better transition the MSND detector to commercialization, the fabrication process was studied and enhanced to better facilitate low cost and batch process MSND production. The research and development of the MSND technology described in this work includes fabrication of variant microstructured diode designs, which have been simulated through MSND physics models to predict performance and neutron detection efficiency, and testing the operational performance of these designs in regards to neutron detection efficiency, gamma-ray rejection, and silicon fabrication methodology. The highest thermal-neutron detection efficiency reported to date for a solid-state semiconductor detector is presented in this work. MSNDs show excellent neutron to gamma-ray (n/γ) rejection ratios, which are on the order of 106, without significant loss in thermal-neutron detection efficiency. Individually, the MSND is intrinsically highly sensitive to thermal neutrons, but not extrinsically sensitive because of their small size. To improve upon this, individual MSNDs were tiled together into a 6 x 6 -element array on a single silicon chip. Individual elements of the array were tested for thermal-neutron detection efficiency and for the n/γ reject ratio. Overall, because of the inadequacies and costs of other neutron detection systems, the MSND is the premier technology for many neutron detection applications...|$|R

With this reasoning the <b>nano-sizing</b> and confinement of light metal hydrides to the pores of a scaffold (carbon being the most favoured due to its relative inertness) can yield significant improvements in their performance for a range of applications. For example, smaller particles display faster kinetics of hydrogen sorption compared to larger particles as they have shorter hydrogen diffusion distances, this also means a higher active surface area for catalysis. It may also be necessary for the hydrogen release and uptake from the metal hydrides to be reversible for the material to behave catalytically and nanoconfinement is a very effective way of achieving this reversibility. This thesis describes the use of nano-confinement as an approach to improve the properties of light metal hydrides in reversible hydrogen storage applications and catalysis. The focus is on the preparation of nanocomposites of sodium and lithium based hydrides, specifically NaAlH 4 and the Li-N-H system confined in carbon nanoscaffolds, and unravelling the effects of nanoconfinement on their ability to reversibly store hydrogen and/or catalyse different hydrogenation reactions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{classes of}} cathode {{materials}} {{have been developed}} for high energy density applications. The Li-rich layered oxide material with the general formula Li 1 +xM 1 -xO 2 (M = Ni, Mn, Co) and the lithium manganese silicate Li 2 MnSiO 4. Both materials have theoretical capacities higher than commercialized ones, which may give rise to higher energy density batteries. Li-rich materials have been prepared by solid state and co-precipitation routes. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) characterization showed an irreversible evolution of the structure through a spinel phase during the first charge. Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) also showed a continuous cation migration during cycling of the material leading to charge/discharge voltage decay. The redox process has been studied by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) in synchrotron facilities (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Ni/Mn ratio has been identified to have a great role on capacity fading of the material. Finally, a Li-rich optimized composition has been prepared and stable reversible capacity of 250 mAh. g- 1 has been obtained. Li 2 MnSiO 4 has a large theoretical specific capacity (333 mAh/g) through exchange of 2 lithium ions per formula unit. The thermal stability due to strong Si-O bonds makes LiMnSiO a very promising material for future energy storage in space applications. Preparation in inert atmosphere showed beneficial improvements of LMSO’s electrochemical properties. <b>Nano-sizing</b> and carbon coating have been effective ways to improve electronic conductivity and therefore electrochemical performance. Up to 1. 66 Li per formula unit can be re-inserted in the 1 st cycle. XRD analysis showed complete amorphization of Li 2 MnSiO 4 after the 1 st charge at 4. 8 V with complete modification of the charge/discharge curves in the next cycles. Increasing the carbon coating ratio limits capacity loss during cycling but did not avoid amorphization. Finally influence of voltage window on structure stability was investigated. Careful choice of upper limit voltage has been showed to stabilize Li 2 MnSiO 4 structure but for now is still limited to low Li+ insertion/extraction from the host material...|$|R
40|$|Chemical looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is {{an emerging}} technology for clean energy-production. In CLC, an oxygen carrier is periodically oxidized with air and then reduced {{in contact with}} a fuel. CLC is thus a flame-less oxy-fuel combustion without an air separation unit, producing sequestration-ready CO 2 -streams without significant energy penalty. However, a major hurdle towards technical implementation of CLC {{is the development of}} robust oxygen carrier materials. In this thesis, we report on a combined study of theoretical and experimental investigations of oxygen carriers for CLC. A detailed thermodynamic screening of oxygen carriers based on several comparison criteria was carried out {{to come up with the}} best candidates for CLC and then effect of sulfur contamination in the fuel stream on the performance of these selected oxygen carriers was studied. In sulfur-free streams the carriers show stable and fast reduction and re-oxidation kinetics. Sulfur contamination results not only in sulfidation of the metal carrier component, but also in partial sulfidation of the support matrix which marginally alters the redox kinetics but does not affect carrier stability. Interestingly, the support sulfidation leads to a significant increase in the oxygen carrying capacity of the carriers. Further investigation of Cu-based carriers showed that efficient desulfurization of the fuel reactor exit stream is achievable with quantitative S-recovery in the air reactor effluent. Beyond combustion, chemical looping can be used to produce hydrogen by replacing air with steam as oxidant in a 'chemical looping steam reforming' process (CLSR). The effluent of the oxidizer is PEMFC-ready hydrogen without further purification steps, resulting in significant process intensification. Challenges in CLSR are slower steam vs air oxidation kinetics, high-temperature carrier stability, and attrition due to large solids transport in a two-bed process. In the final part of the thesis, we report on experimental investigations of Fe-based nanostructured carriers to study their oxidation kinetics and high-temperature stability. Effect of temperature and particle size on hydrogen production and carrier utilization was studied which further demonstrated the importance of <b>nano-sizing</b> of the carrier. Finally, a reactor model was developed demonstrating that a fixed-bed approach is feasible for CLSR...|$|R
