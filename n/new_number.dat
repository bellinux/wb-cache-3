TNA debuted a new match type at Sacrifice named the TerrorDome. At the event {{it was used}} to determine the <b>new</b> <b>number</b> contender to the TNA X Division Championship. However, during the show Management Director Jim Cornette announced the winner would also take Angle's place in the main event. Kaz {{went on to win the}} match, thus becoming number one contender and taking Angle's place.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the <b>new</b> <b>number</b> one {{contender}} Sting on the July 27, 2006 {{episode of}} Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He {{went on to}} say that he had asked Jim Cornette the week before if he could be in Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but had told him he needed Sting's approval. Sting accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his corner, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help Sting win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from a face to a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the title.|$|E

Similarly, newly allocated numbers in Leeds (0113), Leicester (0116) and Bristol (0117) also came from the 3xx xxxx range, but in Nottingham (0115), the <b>new</b> <b>numbers</b> instead came from the 8xx xxxx range. Less than a decade later, further new ranges were opened {{in most of these}} areas, but this time <b>new</b> Leicester <b>numbers</b> are in the 4xx xxxx range, <b>new</b> Bristol <b>numbers</b> are in the 2xx xxxx range, <b>new</b> Nottingham <b>numbers</b> are in the 7xx xxxx range and <b>new</b> Leeds <b>numbers</b> are in the 4xx xxxx and 8xx xxxx ranges.|$|R
5|$|Cage {{fought for}} the NWA Championship once again at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 14, 2007 against Abyss and Sting, this time in a Three Way Elimination match. Cage prevailed this time around by pinning Sting after Abyss was already {{eliminated}} to win the championship. After Final Resolution, Cage prepared for his title defense against the <b>new</b> <b>number</b> one contender Kurt Angle, who had defeated Samoa Joe in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Final Resolution to gain the opportunity. Heading into their encounter at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 11, 2007, Cage announced on the January 17, 2007 episode of Impact! that he had hired a special consultant to assist him in training for his bout with Angle. This consultant was revealed on the February 8, 2007 episode of Impact!, {{who turned out to}} be Scott Steiner after he attacked Angle following a match pitting the team of Angle and Joe against Cage and A.J. Styles. Cage went on to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Angle at Against All Odds with Joe as the unofficial special outside enforcer.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a <b>new</b> <b>number,</b> becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the Euclidean {{algorithm}} led to {{the development}} of <b>new</b> <b>number</b> systems, such as Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers. In 1815, Carl Gauss used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of Gaussian integers, although his work was first published in 1832. Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (published 1801), but only as a method for continued fractions. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory. Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of number theory, such as unique factorization, would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied. Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on number theory were edited and extended by Richard Dedekind, who used Euclid's algorithm to study algebraic integers, a new general type of number. For example, Dedekind was the first to prove Fermat's two-square theorem using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers. Dedekind also defined the concept of a Euclidean domain, a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined (as described below). In the closing decades of the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind's more general theory of ideals.|$|E

The next week on Raw, Morrison challenged R-Truth to a match {{later on in the}} night, with the stipulation that if Morrison won, he would take R-Truth's place in the steel cage match at Extreme Rules. Truth accepted, and lost the match, making Morrison the <b>new</b> <b>number</b> one contender. At Extreme Rules, R-Truth interfered in the match, attacking Morrison and preventing him from winning the match. The next night on Raw, Morrison was attacked by Truth again, prior to a scheduled match between the two which did not happen as a result. Morrison then underwent surgery to correct a legitimately pinched nerve in his neck.|$|E

It is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) {{on behalf of the}} UK music industry, and each week's <b>new</b> <b>number</b> one is first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show. The album chart was first published by Record Mirror in 1956. The record at number one on 25 December that year was the original soundtrack to the 1956 film The King and I, making it the first ever UK Christmas number one album; The King and I soundtrack was also Christmas number one in 1957, the following year. In 1958, the original soundtrack to South Pacific became the second Christmas number one album. Staying {{at the top of the}} album chart for a total of 115 weeks, it was also number one in 1959 and 1960. Soundtracks to the movies The Sound of Music and Grease also became Christmas number ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. Two of the routes assigned at this time were NY6, a north–south route extending from the New York City line to the Canadian border, and NY30, another north–south route connecting NY6 in Mechanicville to the Vermont state line west of Fair Haven. NY6 left Albany on modern NY32 and followed it to Mechanicville, where NY6 veered westward on what is now NY67 and NY30 picked up the current alignment of NY32. NY30 continued north on modern NY32 to Glens Falls, at which point it went east to Hudson Falls via Warren and River streets. It headed northward from there to Vermont on modern US4. From Mechanicville to Schuylerville, NY30 utilized the alignment of legislative Route44. By 1926, NY30 was rerouted north of Whitehall to continue north toward the Canadian border. The old alignment of NY30 between Whitehall and Vermont was not assigned a <b>new</b> <b>number.</b> Meanwhile, an alternate route of NY6 {{on the east side}} of the Hudson River between NY5 (now US20) in East Greenbush and NY6 in Waterford was designated as NY6B by 1926.|$|E
