40|$|OBJECTIVEâ€”The Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) {{equations}} previously {{have been}} recommended to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We compared both estimates with true GFR, {{measured by the}} isotopic 51 Cr-EDTA method, in newly diagnosed, treatment-naÃ¯ve subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSâ€”A total of 292 mainly normoalbuminuric (241 of 292) subjects were recruited. Subjects were classified as having mild renal impairment (group 1, GFR < 90 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2) or normal renal function (group 2, GFR â‰¥ 90 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2). Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated by the CG and MDRD equations. Blood samples drawn at 44, 120, 180, and 240 min after administration of 1 MBq of 51 Cr-EDTA were used to measure isotopic GFR (iGFR). RESULTSâ€”For subjects in group 1, mean (Â±SD) iGFR was 83. 8 Â± 4. 3 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. eGFR was 78. 0 Â± 16. 5 or 73. 7 Â± 12. 0 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 using CG and MDRD equations, respectively. <b>Ninety-five</b> <b>percent</b> CIs for method bias were â€“ 11. 1 to â€“ 0. 6 using CG and â€“ 14. 4 to â€“ 7. 0 using MDRD. <b>Ninety-five</b> <b>percent</b> limits <b>of</b> agreement (mean bias Â± 2 SD) were â€“ 37. 2 to 25. 6 and â€“ 33. 1 to 11. 7, respectively. In group 2, iGFR was 119. 4 Â± 20. 3 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. eGFR was 104. 4 Â± 26. 3 or 92. 3 Â± 18. 7 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 using CG and MDRD equations, respectively. <b>Ninety-five</b> <b>percent</b> CIs for method bias were â€“ 17. 4 to â€“ 12. 5 using CG and â€“ 29. 1 to â€“ 25. 1 using MDRD. <b>Ninety-five</b> <b>percent</b> limits <b>of</b> agreement were â€“ 54. 4 to 24. 4 and â€“ 59. 5 to 5. 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONSâ€”In newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, particularly those with a GFR â‰¥ 90 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, both CG and MDRD equations significantly underestimate iGFR.

Methods Thirty-five DMARD-naïve patients with early RA provided blood samples for whole blood flow cytometric determination of phosphorylation of JAKs in CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, CD 19 + B cells, and CD 14 + monocytes. Treatment response was determined after 1  year of treatment with synthetic DMARDs, with remission defined as absence of tender and swollen joints and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

We sought to determine the benefit of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in providing pain relief for patients with refractory pain secondary to metastases involving bone. Patients and Methods Thirty-one US and 12 European patients with painful osteolytic metastases involving bone were treated with image-guided RFA using a multitip needle. Treated patients had 4 / 10 pain and had either failed or were poor candidates for standard treatments such as radiation or opioid analgesics. Using the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form, worst pain intensity was the primary end point, with a 2 -unit drop considered clinically significant. Results Forty-three patients were treated (median follow-up, 16 weeks). Before RFA, {{the mean score for}} worst pain was 7. 9 (range, 4 / 10 to 10 / 10).
