2500|$|Under the {{concepts}} of [...] Torts [...] under Anglo-American Common Law, these points might {{best be described as}} a defense of contributory <b>negligence.</b> <b>In</b> other <b>words,</b> Ms Calad and Mr. Davila might have prevented the damage to their person for which they are allowed no monetary damages in court if they had properly enforced their ERISA or THCLA rights against CIGNA and Aetna to prevent the injury from happening. The fact that ERISA had failed to prevent the harm, however, {{and the fact that it}} was ruled by the Supreme Court that neither CIGNA nor Aetna could owe monetary damages for their contribution to the harm done, shows that there is a need for change, either in ERISA itself by Congress or by Supreme Court common law.|$|R
50|$|In S v Van der Mescht, {{the accused}} and “G” had melted gold amalgam on a stove for the {{purposes}} of extracting the gold. As a result of the heating, the amalgam emitted mercurial gas which resulted in the death of G and four of the children who were in the house at the time.The trial court convicted the accused of culpable homicide. The conviction was, however, set aside by the Appellate Division, the majority holding that the prosecution had failed to prove that the deaths were attributable to the accused’s <b>negligence.</b> <b>In</b> other <b>words,</b> it had not been proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have foreseen that the heating of gold amalgam might lead to the death of someone.|$|R
40|$|In nature, it is inspiring {{to observe}} such an {{extensive}} variety of defensive skills distributed among species. The speed of an antelope, and {{the sting of}} a scorpion, wasp or a bee are some examples of such defensive tools or mechanisms important to survive against predators. However sophisticated the skills or tools are, the correct accurate use and on-time triggering of those tools {{is a matter of}} life and death for animals. With those defensive measures, animals come with a complementary ability called "vigilance". Vigilance is costly and the human tries to minimize vigilant behaviour in every aspect of life. The absence of vigilance, or <b>negligence</b> <b>in</b> other <b>words,</b> allows humans to spend more time and cognition on matters that he or she wants rather than on problems that need time. The human has an inherent and intricate mechanism that determine the vigilance level required for a particular problem. The consequences of the lack of vigilance in a work environment, more especially in the Information Technologies Security field are catastrophic and even lethal as humanity becomes an increasingly associated habitant of cyberspace ecosystem. Intrusion Execution Systems (IES) which is one of my conceptual propositions in this research, is my approach to reduce negligent behaviour in IT Security personnel. Impetus is the name of the first prototype for IES concept with limitations, which is included in this research. Impetus can successfully achieve desired behaviour in test environment, however the conceptual propositions in this research among with Impetus, should further be experimented in real-world in order to be convinced of its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though it}} offers a {{compelling}} account of the responsibility-component <b>in</b> the <b>negligence</b> standard—arguably the Holy Grail of negligence theory—it {{is a mistake to}} conceive of the duty of care <b>in</b> <b>negligence</b> as a duty to try to avert harm. My goal here is to explain why and to point to an alternative account of the responsibility-component <b>in</b> <b>negligence.</b> The flaws <b>in</b> conceiving of the duty of care as a duty to try are: failing to comport with the legal doctrine of negligence and failing as a revisionary account for the law; overly burdening autonomy and restricting the liberty of thought; adversely affecting the prevention of negligent harm—the essence of the negligence standard—; and, raising severe probative difficulties. Moreover, the duty of care also does not give rise to what I call a de facto duty to try. The duty of care is better construed to require only certain conduct and not trying. Returning to the primary appeal and motivation for exploring the validity of equating the duty of care with a duty to try—searching for the responsibility-component <b>in</b> the <b>negligence</b> standard—I argue that the responsibility-component <b>in</b> <b>negligence</b> does not take the form of an obligation to try but rather has a conditional form, manifested in the conditions of applicability of the <b>negligence</b> standard. <b>In</b> other <b>words,</b> the <b>negligence</b> standard comprises a conduct-based as opposed to a combined action-/intent-based duty (such as a duty to try) as its duty of care, a duty that only applies to actors who possess the capacity to intentionally or knowingly comply with it, or, put differently, possess the capacity to try...|$|R
