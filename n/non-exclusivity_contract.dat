He {{appeared}} on the GMA-7 show Click and primetime series Habang Kapiling Ka with Angelika dela Cruz. He starred in the TV fantasy series Mulawin which aired from August 2, 2004 until March 18, 2005, where he played the lead character Aguiluz. The series led to a feature-length film of the same name (Mulawin: The Movie). Since then he has played lead roles in other GMA-7 shows including Sugo, Kamandag, Codename: Asero, Zorro, Lupin, Full House and Captain Barbell. Gutierrez signed a <b>non-exclusivity</b> <b>contract</b> with Viva Artists Agency in 2008, wherein he worked in a movie Patient X and where his ex-girlfriend Anne Curtis is a talent; in 2015, he, his twin brother Raymond and sister Ruffa signed an exclusivity contract with Viva Artists Agency.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies equilibria for economies {{characterized}} by moral hazard (hidden action), {{in which the}} set of contracts marketed in equilibrium {{is determined by the}} interaction of financial intermediaries. The crucial aspect of the environment that we study is that intermediaries are restricted to trade non-exclusive contracts: the agents' contractual relationships with competing intermediaries cannot be monitored (or are not contractible upon). We fully characterize equilibrium allocations and contracts. In this set-up equilibrium allocations are clearly incentive constrained inefficient. A robust property of equilibria with non-exclusivity is that the contracts issued in equilibrium do not implement the optimal action. Moreover we prove that, whenever equilibrium contracts do implement the optimal action, intermediaries make positive profits and equilibrium allocations are third best inefficient (where the definition of third best efficiency accounts for constraints which capture the <b>non-exclusivity</b> of <b>contracts)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{string of}} {{theoretical}} papers {{shows that the}} <b>non-exclusivity</b> of credit <b>contracts</b> generates important negative contractual externalities. Employing a unique dataset, we identify how these externalities affect the supply of credit. Using internal information on a creditor’s willingness to lend, we find that a creditor reduces its credit supply when a borrower obtains a loan at another creditor (an “outside loan”). Consistent with the theoretical literature, the effect is more pronounced the larger the outside loans and it is muted if the initial creditor’s existing and future loans retain seniority over the outside loans and are secured with valuable collateral. non-exclusivity; contractual externalities; credit supply; debt seniority;...|$|R
40|$|Credit {{contracts}} are non-exclusive. A string of theoretical papers shows that nonexclusivity generates important negative contractual externalities. Employing a unique dataset, we identify how the contractual externality {{stemming from the}} <b>non-exclusivity</b> of credit <b>contracts</b> affects credit supply. In particular, using internal information on a creditor’s willingness to lend, we find that a creditor reduces its loan supply when a borrower initiates a loan at another creditor. Consistent with the theoretical literature on contractual externalities, the effect is more pronounced the larger the loans from the other creditor. We also find that the initial creditor’s willingness to lend does not change if its existing and future loans retain seniority over the other creditors’ loans and are secured with assets whose value is high and stable over time. ...|$|R
