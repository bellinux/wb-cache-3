Six of seven cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from these animals had neutralizing antibody for Akabane virus (AKV).

Corresponding to the encephalitic lesion, AKV antigen was demonstrated in neuroglial cells in the brain stem and neuronal cells in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.

40|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is of {{particular}} importance for the adaptation of mammals to their environment. Hypothyroidism {{is the most common}} type of thyroid disorders in cattle. Thyrotropin (TSH) is used in several mammalian species for the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Currently in cattle, thyroid hormone assays are used to diagnose such disease. The aim of the study was to compare different tools for diagnosing hypothyroidism in <b>newborn</b> <b>calves.</b> Twelve goitrous <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> from two beef herds were studied as well as 45 healthy <b>newborn</b> <b>calves.</b> Bovine TSH, thyroxine (T 4), tri-iodothyronine (T 3), reverse-T 3 (rT 3), plasmatic inorganic iodine (PII) and glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes (GPXe) were assayed in these calves during the first day of life. T 4 /T 3 and T 4 /TSH ratio were calculated. Furthermore, TSH, T 4, PII and GPXe were also assayed in their dams at calving. Results were analysed using Wilcoxon rank sum test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. A significant higher value (P 0. 1) and PII (P > 0. 05). Significantly higher values were seen for healthy calves compared to goitrous calves concerning T 4, T 4 /T 3 ratio, T 4 /TSH ratio, rT 3 (P 0. 1). Furthermore, it appeared that T 4 and rT 3 values in goitrous-alive calves were not different compared to healthy calves (P > 0. 1). Regarding TSH (rho= 0. 44), T 4 (rho=- 0. 44), PII (rho= 0. 70) and GPXe (rho= 0. 87), there was a correlation between healthy calves and their dams, with significantly higher values being found in the calves (P 0. 1). However, for these animals there was a strong relationship in the values of PH (rho= 0. 82) and GPXe (rho= 0. 94) (P 0. 1). This study revealed that TSH alone is a good marker for hypothyroidism in <b>newborn</b> <b>calves.</b> In the absence of TSH assay, the T 4 /T 3 ratio may be used to diagnose hypothyroidism in <b>newborn</b> <b>calves.</b> In our study, although T 4 /T 3 ratio was helpful in identifying goitrous calves, it did not allow to discriminate goitrous-dead from goitrous-alive calves, contrary to TSH.

The aim of this study was to compare serumic levels of albumin, total protein, and total globulin in the blood of <b>newborn</b> <b>calves,</b> before and after feeding of heated colostrum at 63 ˚C for 30 minutes.

40|$|In human medicine, {{pulse oximetry}} {{is widely used}} to measure non-invasively and {{accurately}} the percentage of oxygen saturation of arterial haemoglobin (SpO(2)). Recently, pulse oximetry {{has been used in}} calves, but its accuracy has not been evaluated in <b>newborn</b> <b>calves.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of a pulse oximeter in <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> by comparing SpO(2) with arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SaO(2)) obtained by use of a blood gas analyser. Fifty-five <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> were investigated from birth to 20 days old. Pulse oximetry readings and arterial blood samples were performed 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 min, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24 h and 1 and 3 weeks after birth. The transmission-type sensors of the pulse oximeter were fixed at the recommended site in the bovine species (at the base of the calf tail, where the skin had been shaved and was not pigmented) and arterial blood samples were withdrawn from the subclavian artery and analysed for SaO(2). Five-hundred paired data of SaO(2) and mean SpO(2) (mSpO(2)) were collected. Linear regression of the pooled data indicated a highly significant correlation of mSpO(2) with SaO(2) (r = 0. 87;P< 0. 001; mSpO(2) = 15. 8 + 0. 84 SaO(2)). The overall data bias value was positive (+ 2. 1 %), which indicated that the pulse oximeter tended to overestimate the SaO(2). The bias value for each SaO(2) category tended to become higher for lower ranges of SaO(2). Precision was also lower when SaO(2) values were low. The lower the SaO(2) value, the higher the positive bias (overestimation) and the lower the precision. These results suggest that pulse oximetry provides a relatively accurate non-invasive, immediate and portable method to monitor SaO(2) and to evaluate objectively the pulmonary function effectiveness in <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> during their adaptation to extra-uterine life.

To <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> (n = 4) 4 liters colostrum was administered by an esophageal drencher, within 2 hours after birth. Abomasal volume was determined using ultrasonography. Mean determined abomasal volume was 2. 74 liters (CI 1. 87 – 3. 61). No correlation (- 0. 134) was found between determined abomasal volume and administered volume. Determined abomasal volume was significantly different from administered volume (p = 0. 025). In another newborn calf 2. 1 liters of a solution of colostrum and barium-sulfate was provided by an esophageal drencher. X-rays and fluoroscopy was performed to determine localization of provided colostrum. Fluoroscopy showed a first entry of colostrum into reticulum and ruminal atrium, after which overflow to all ruminal compartments, omasum and abomasum occurs. No flow into duodenum was detected. This study clearly shows that the abomasum is unable to contain 4 liters colostrum. Also, this study shows colostrum is localized in all parts of the forestomachs and abomasum.

Between day 70 – 80 pp 3 out of 11 samples (27 %) had PAG concentrations > 4 ng/ml plasma.

40|$|The {{immunological}} {{importance of}} passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins {{to the young}} has been well recognised in cattle and other farm animals including pigs, horses, goats and sheep (Brambell, 1958; Gay, 1965; Butler, 1969; and Simpson - Morgan and Smeaton, 1972). All these animals lack prepartum maternofoetal transfer of immunoglobulins {{probably due to the}} epitheliochorial (pigs and horses) or syndesmochorial placentation (cows, goats and sheep) (Sterz] and Silverstein, 1967), which are impermeable to macromolecules such as immunoglobulins, antitoxin (Mason_et al, 1930) and even to smaller molecules such as growth hormone (Alexander _et al, 1973). In the calves, this lack of prenatal transfer, coupled with the apparent inability of the <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> to actively produce antibodies in sufficient quantities during the immediate prenatal and postnatal period, means that the newborn are ill-equipped to resist pathogens. Their early ability to obtain and absorb adequate maternal colostral antibodies is therefore of paramount importance to ensure survival against most neonatal diseases.

40|$|AbstractThe {{immune system}} of <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> is {{immature}} and must mature gradually. Understanding how this immunity is established may define different profiles. Twelve healthy calves were monitored during 8 time periods {{to assess the}} innate immune system during the first 90 d. Blood samples were collected, and the blood phagocytes, identified by the expression of CD 14 and CH 138 surface molecules, were evaluated for phagocytic functionality (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli stained with propidium iodide) and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (2, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate oxidation). Functional changes in the CD 14 + and CH 138 + cells occurred at 40 d of age, with sporadic increases in phagocytosis intensity and reactive oxygen species production, and decreased phagocytosis occurred at 60 d of age. Therefore, fewer phagocytes were active from 40 d of age, although those that were active performed their roles with greater efficacy. That change presumably occurred because the calf phagocytes began to support the immune response without the influence of passive immunity. The animals failed to reach the stability needed to complete the maturation of the innate immune response by 90 d of age. These data are applicable for healthy <b>calves</b> <b>only...</b>|$|R
