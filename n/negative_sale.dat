40|$|Previous tax {{systems in}} Slovakia and their {{imperfections}} Economic policy in Slovakia {{has undergone a}} few principal qualitative turns {{in the course of}} a 15 -year transition from a centrally-planned economy to a market economy. The need to adjust the tax system arose as an accompanying necessary features of such shifts. Besides dozens of parametrical changes, the tax system was subject to two cases of fundamental re-construction. Both were linked to substantial changes in direction of economic policy. Firstly, the fall of the socialist economy required the creation of a tax sys-tem that could be comparable with that in standard market economies. Secondly, the overcoming of non-standard and somehow hybrid economic policy after 1998 and consequent upshifting of the reform process after 2002 called for further fundamental re-form. An overview of the reform stages is provided in Box 1. The tax system at the threshold of the transforma-tion process corresponded to the needs of an admin-istratively managed economy. It served as a tool for direct selection, subsidies and social policy. These functions were incorporated in the sales tax with nu-merous rates, which enabled an individual approach in accordance with the goals of the centrally planned economy. The sales tax system was marked by indi-vidual tax rates for each item and was, thus, in fun-damental contradiction with the principles of mod-ern market economy. The system also included several items with <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> tax (which in fact represented a subsidy) in or-der to maintain low prices and ensure affordability to all citizens. Understandably, the first fundamental change in the tax system included abolition of the <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> tax in 1990. This step resulted in a first inflation shock (increase in prices of food which had benefited from the <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> tax). This increase was compensated by a special social allowance. The abolition of the <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> tax was followed by price liberalisation which came into force on...|$|R

Being privatised has a positive impact on employment but this is concentrated within a range of 3 – 6 years after privatisation. There are no systematic differences in employment response to <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> growth across the ownership categories. Employment in state firms is less responsive to positive sales growth. From these results we infer that the behaviour of state firms is affected by both insider rent sharing and binding budget constraints...|$|R

The data set entails all remaining sales cases of the year 2009. For the development of forecasting models we limited the data set to weeks 14 – 51 because the case company used a different demand forecasting method and other replenishment cycles before week 14. We also excluded data from week 19 and 28 because here unsold products from earlier sales periods were sold without conducting another pilot sale beforehand. The remaining weeks were randomly split into two data sets. One was used for developing new forecasting methods {{and the other one}} was used for testing.|$|R
40|$|Employment {{protection}} affects aggregate productivity via several {{channels in}} potentially contradicting ways, {{which makes it}} difficult to establish the relationship between the two. This study focuses on the misallocation of production factors across plants, which has been shown in past studies to substantially reduce aggregate productivity. The study provides new evidence on the effect of employment protection on resource misallocation using a large dataset of manufacturing plants covering more than 90 countries. For measuring misallocation, I use the within‐industry dispersion of the marginal product of labor and total factor productivity. The results show that higher cost of dismissing redundant workers is positively associated with misallocation. The effect of dismissal cost is especially larger in industries that have greater demand for adjusting labor. More specifically, the effect is larger in industries that intrinsically have higher layoff rate, and in industries that have large positive or <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> growth rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Generating {{databases}} {{for testing}} database applications (e. g., OLAP or business objects) is {{a daunting task}} in practice. There {{are a number of}} commercial tools to automatically generate test databases. These tools take a database schema (table layouts plus integrity constraints) and table sizes as input in order to generate new tuples. However, the databases generated by these tools are not adequate for testing a database application. If an application query is executed against such a synthetic database, then the result of that application query is likely to be empty or contain weird results, such as a report on the performance of a sales person that contains <b>negative</b> <b>sales.</b> To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new technique called Reverse Query Processing (RQP). RQP gets a query and a result as input and returns a possible database instance that could have produced that result for that query. RQP also has other applications; most notably, testing the performance of DBMS and debugging SQL queries. 1...|$|R

40|$|Using panel data {{on large}} Polish firms this paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} corporate control structures, sales growth and the determinants of employment change during the period 1996 - 2002. We find that privatised and de novo firms are the main drivers of employment growth and that, {{in the case of}} de novo firms, it is foreign ownership which underpins the result. Interestingly, we find that being privatised has a positive impact on employment growth but that this impact is concentrated within a range of three to six years after privatisation. In contrast with the findings of earlier literature, we find evidence that there are no systematic differences in employment response to <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> growth across the ownership categories. On the other hand, employment in state firms is less responsive to positive sales growth. From these combined results we infer that the behaviour of state firms is constrained by both insider rent sharing and binding budget constraints. Consistent with this, we find that privatised companies, three to six years post-privatisation, are the firms for whom employment is most responsive to positive sales growth and as such, offer the best hope for rapid labour market expansion...|$|R

30|$|From {{the next}} {{row in the}} table, {{it can be seen}} that, for the MENA sample, the {{interaction}} term between Mean Log (Inspections Tax) and the Total Tax Rate does have the significant negative effect on Training that one might expect. That effect is negative and significant, however, in column (8) for the non-MENA sample. Note that the effects of positive shocks in the form of recent sales increases of 50 % or more are positive and significant in each column, though larger in the MENA sample than in the Non-MENA sample. Among the presumably negative external shocks, only the effect of Water Out is negative in both regions, more significantly so in the Non-MENA sample. Counterintuitively, the <b>negative</b> <b>sales</b> growth shock has a positive and sometimes significant effect in the MENA sample. Notably, Power Out has a positive and significant effect in the Non-MENA region. As expected, the apparent lack of access to external finance for working capital (measured by Finance Working Capital Internal) has a highly significant negative effect on the probability of training in both samples, but is somewhat larger in absolute terms in the MENA sample. As expected, because of economies of scale and scope in training, in both samples, firms which are larger or have more than one plant are more likely to train than others.|$|R
