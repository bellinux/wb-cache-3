25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that they were poor.|$|E
25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act {{as if he wanted to}} send them a message.|$|E
500|$|Christy's role as {{a villain}} has been widely praised by {{television}} commentators, though Patterson's performance {{was the subject of}} negative criticism. Spanos placed Christy as number three on its list of 161 of the series' antagonist as rated by scariness. Demain praised Christy as an interesting character following the reveal that she was secretly working for the Triad. Gavin Hetherington, on the other hand, wrote he was indifferent about Christy, and found Billie to be the stronger character of the two. The story arc was criticized by Digital Spys Hugh Armitage, who felt it was weakened by Patterson's [...] "habit of pulling 'evil' faces when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her like a pantomime villain". Jon Langmead of PopMatters summarized Patterson's acting as [...] "huff and puff through her on-camera time".|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 14, 1868, the Lincoln statue was moved from Flannery's studio to City Hall. [...] The covered statue was guarded by police so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it before the {{dedication}} ceremony the following day. [...] On April 15, all of the city's offices were closed at noon and all flags were flown at half-staff. [...] An estimated 20,000 people, around 20% of Washington's population, attended the dedication. [...] Dignitaries at the dedication included President Andrew Johnson, General Ulysses S. Grant, General William Tecumseh Sherman, and General Winfield Scott Hancock. [...] Supreme Court Justices and members of Congress were not in attendance because Johnson's impeachment trial was taking place. [...] A Masonic ceremony, along with music and prayers, {{took place at the}} dedication before the main speech by Major General Benjamin Brown French. [...] Following the speech, Washington mayor Richard Wallach introduced Johnson, who uncovered the statue. [...] The crowd cheered, followed by more music and finally a benediction.|$|E
2500|$|The base at Zapadnaya Litsa, called [...] "Basis Nord", had {{advantages}} {{with regard}} to secrecy. It was surrounded by Russian territory and closed to all foreign and Soviet domestic shipping, so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> operations taking place. Its entrance also prevented observation from the open sea.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 former England rugby union captain Will Carling rated David Campese {{the third}} best rugby player of all time. He stated that, [...] "He was {{well ahead of}} his time. His {{anticipation}} and vision was way ahead of what everyone else was attempting, and 99 per cent of it came off. He took running lines {{no one else could}} fathom and made passes <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were on. He was an extraordinary talent – the best winger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter {{edited the}} film using the {{pseudonym}} John T. Chance, {{the name of}} John Wayne's character in Rio Bravo. Debra Hill acted as an uncredited assistant editor. According to Carpenter, the editing process was very bare bones. One mistake Carpenter was not proud of was one shot [...] "cut out of frame," [...] which means the cut is made within the frame so a viewer can see it. Assault was shot on Panavision, which takes up the entire negative, and edited on Moviola, which cannot show the whole image, so if a cut was made improperly (i.e., frame line not lined up properly) then one would cut a half of a sprocket into the film and [...] "cut out of frame," [...] as happened to Carpenter. In the end, {{it did not matter}} because he said [...] "It was so dark <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it, thank God!" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} famous images of the event was the live {{broadcast}} of Hoy Mismo, a news program in the Televisa television network, when the earthquake struck. In the video, movement can be seen, especially in the lights above the newscasters. The three newscasters were María Victoria Llamas (substituting for Guillermo Ochoa), Lourdes Guerrero and Juan Dosal. As the movement began Llamas reports grabbing {{the underside of the}} desk, and whispering quickly to her colleagues that she hoped <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how scared she was. The last image broadcast from the studio was that of Lourdes Guerrero stating [...] "...it's still shaking a little (sigue temblando un poquitito), but we must take it calmly. We will wait just a second so we can keep talking." [...] Then the image disappeared. The transmission ended because a nearby 10-ton antenna had bent over and crushed parts of Televisa's buildings that were located on Niños Héroes and Dr. Río de la Loza Streets in Colonia Doctores.|$|E
2500|$|Darwin was {{questioning}} {{from the}} outset, {{and in his}} first zoology notes he wondered why deep-ocean plankton had been created with so much beauty for little purpose as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them. He saw landforms as supporting Lyell's Uniformitarianism which explained features as {{the outcome of a}} gradual process over huge periods of time, and quickly showed a gift for theorising about the geology he was examining. He concluded that the land had indeed risen, and referred to loose rock deposits as [...] "part of the long disputed Diluvium". Around 1825 both Lyell and Sedgwick had supported William Buckland's Catastrophism which postulated diluvialism to reconcile findings with the Biblical account of Noah's ark, but by 1830 evidence had shown them that the [...] "diluvium" [...] had come from a series of local processes. They still distinguished between diluvial and alluvial deposits, but Sedgwick no longer thought these deposits were connected with Noah's flood by the time he taught Darwin, though the debate continued. Darwin's notes show him increasingly discounting [...] "debacles" [...] to account for such formations. It was only later that glaciation was accepted as the source of these deposits.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his time}} with the team, while sitting in a bar {{seemingly}} alone, Hector met another lady whom he soon realized <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>could</b> <b>see</b> and hear. The lady pleaded with him to help find her body. Hector did so, feeding off the spirit's emotions to gain strength. He left the body, and the killer, for the police.|$|R
60|$|His {{conjecture}} was speedily verified, for, looking {{along the}} crest which the British had held during the fight, {{he saw a}} large body of French troops just reaching the top of the rise. He stood up now and looked round. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> moving in the orchards and vineyards round. He peered over the wall; his horse lay there in a huddled-up heap.|$|R
2500|$|The {{match at}} WrestleMania {{was part of}} a storyline in which Guerrero turned on Mysterio and beat him up after abandoning him during a match against MNM for the Tag Team Championship. Then after a no {{disqualification}} match against Chavo, Eddie came out and slammed Mysterio on the steel steps, displaying Eddie's increasing frustration with being unable to defeat Mysterio. Guerrero and Mysterio continued to feud, with Guerrero threatening to reveal a secret he and Mysterio shared involving Mysterio's real life son Dominick, unless Mysterio deferred to Guerrero's authority. Guerrero later revealed that, in the storyline, he was Dominick's biological father. The storyline went that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick as a baby with Mysterio and his wife Angie to raise. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match for the custody of Dominick. Their feud ended when Guerrero gained a victory over Mysterio in a steel cage match. On November 13, 2005, Eddie Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in Minneapolis, Minnesota. That same day at a WWE [...] "Super Show" [...] where SmackDown! and Raw were both taped, Mysterio gave an emotional speech about Guerrero, and in a show of respect removed his mask (though he put his head down, so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his face). Mysterio went on to defeat Shawn Michaels in an interpromotional match later that night. After the match, Michaels and Mysterio hugged in the ring and Mysterio pointed up to the sky, crying, in memory of Guerrero.|$|E

60|$|That we had {{repeated}} the words correctly was {{shown by the}} opening of the door, and although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> be <b>seen,</b> we four stepped inside hurriedly, after which the door was closed and barred, when the screen was thrown from a lantern which set on a rude table. Then we saw before us the man whom we had been told would be able, above all others, to aid us in our dangerous venture.|$|R
60|$|At last {{daylight}} came, {{and then}} we began to look about in good earnest. We saw a top-sail off on the horizon, {{but it was too}} far for our raft to be seen from it, and it might be coming our way or it might not. When we were down in the trough of the waves we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> us. It was of no use to put up a signal, the captain said, until we saw a vessel near enough to see it.|$|R
60|$|That was {{the comfort}} Miss Woolmer gave. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> else <b>could</b> <b>see</b> any at all, except {{a few old}} women in the parish, who spoke tenderly of poor Mr. Ambrose and Mr. Eustace; but then they had sons or {{brothers}} who had been out with the rioters, and after these twenty-six years <b>no</b> <b>one</b> remembered the outrages and terrors of the time with anything but horror; and {{the coming of the}} wild lad from the Bush was looked on as the end of all comfort.|$|R

5000|$|Despite its {{link with}} one of Northeast Pennsylvania's most prestigious {{broadcasters}} (the AM station had been founded in 1925), WGBI-TV operated on a tight budget. For example, the Megargees found AT&T's rates for a dedicated network feed line too high for their liking. This forced station engineers to switch {{to and from the}} signal of WCBS-TV in New York City whenever CBS programming was on-the-air. As a result, picture quality for network programming left much to be desired. The switchover was a delicate process requiring tight coordination between engineers stationed around the clock at the transmitter site and directors at the studios since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> there <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the WCBS feed.|$|R
60|$|My friends, {{how else}} could it be? How can you see life, but by seeing some one live it? You cannot see a man's life, unless you see him live such and such a life, or hear of his living such and such a life, and so knowing what his life, manners, {{character}}, are. And so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> God's life, or known what life God lived, and what character God's was, {{had it not been}} for the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who was made flesh, and dwelt among us, that by seeing him, the Son, we might see the Father, whose likeness he was, and is, and ever will be.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Chang, of that ilk (Chang Chang Tien-ts), {{was a man}} of fifty- seven, and a {{graduate}} in letters. The ladies of his family having accommodated a demon with a shrine in his house, Mr. Chang said he [...] "would have none of that nonsense". The spirit then entered into Mrs. Chang, and the usual fire-raising began all over the place. The furniture and crockery danced in the familiar way, and objects took to disappearing mysteriously, even when secured under lock and key. Mr. Chang was as unlucky as Mr. Chin. At his house [...] "doors would open of their own accord, footfalls were heard, as of persons walking in the house, although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> be <b>seen.</b> Plates, bowls and the teapot would suddenly rise from the table into the air."

Ethel asked him if he were tired, or had a headache.|$|R
