5|$|According to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), Forrest Ackerman, Dolores Fuller and Richard Sheffield, the film's {{portrayal}} of Lugosi is inaccurate: In real life, he <b>never</b> <b>used</b> profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. And contrary to this film, Bela did not struggle performing on The Red Skelton Show.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{bacteriology}} in the 20th century increased {{the sophistication of}} possible bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with indifferent results. In World War II, Britain weaponised tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, but <b>never</b> <b>used</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the flame}} fougasse was <b>never</b> <b>used</b> in Britain, {{the idea was}} {{exported}} to Greece {{by a couple of}} PWD officers when, in 1941, German invasion threatened. They were reported to have a powerful effect on enemy units.|$|E

5|$|He began {{smoking and}} {{drinking}} at age nine, and casual marijuana use at age 13, but he <b>never</b> <b>used</b> hard drugs. His two closest friends died from drug abuse at the ages of 19 and 30. Growing up in The Bronx, he got into occasional fights and was considered something of a troublemaker at school.|$|E
5|$|In {{the dying}} {{stages of the}} conflict, FRELIMO was {{provided}} with a few SA-7 MANPAD shoulder-launched missile launchers from China; these were <b>never</b> <b>used</b> to shoot down a Portuguese plane. Only one Portuguese aircraft was lost in combat during the conflict, when Lt. Emilio Lourenço's G.91R-4 was destroyed by premature detonation of his own ordnance.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} {{due to the}} vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was <b>never</b> <b>used</b> as an academic work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It {{is worth noting that}} the work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, <b>never</b> <b>used</b> such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although <b>never</b> <b>used</b> in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found that Black male signers used {{constructed}} action, {{with or without}} constructed dialogue, more often than White signers, but <b>never</b> <b>used</b> constructed dialogue by itself. These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found that Black signers not only used constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white signers.|$|E
5|$|After Marcoux {{had lost}} his vision, his brother Billy Joe (B.J.) Marcoux decided to put his college {{education}} on hold in order to assist him with skiing. Alpine Canada introduced them to {{a new kind of}} skiing called Para-Alpine. They were inspired by the McKeever brothers to do visually impaired para-alpine. Other than the Paralympics, his brother B.J. has been his sighted guide using radio communication ever since then; something they had <b>never</b> <b>used</b> before.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she <b>never</b> <b>used</b> heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E

5|$|Although the bunkers were <b>never</b> <b>used</b> {{in a real}} {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in {{conflicts that}} {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} the marshall of Jülich {{approached}} Mercator {{and asked him to}} prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the crown prince Johannes. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator <b>never</b> <b>used</b> such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.|$|E
5|$|Blythe further {{testified that}} he was not under the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had <b>never</b> <b>used</b> any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E

5|$|By late 1940 Naujocks {{had been}} removed from his {{position}} after he fell out of favour with Heydrich. The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer before he left in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the unit had produced around £3 million in forged notes; the historian Anthony Pirie puts the figure at £500,000. Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was <b>never</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|Clint Grant {{was born}} in Nashville, Tennessee. During his time at Vanderbilt University, {{economic}} troubles {{brought on by the}} Great Depression forced Grant's family to move from Nashville; they settled in Dallas, Texas, where his father was asked to lead the Art Department at the Morning News. Grant got a job with the Photo Department, but he was drafted into the United States Army before he could report to work. Grant served during World War II in Europe, where he <b>never</b> <b>used</b> a camera.|$|E
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was <b>never</b> <b>used</b> on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
