They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> should be... But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours that the battle was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{was well}} {{received}} by the Scotsman, but The Times Literary Supplement was not entirely enthusiastic:Among the little books that have become as much a manifestation of autumn as falling leaves, one looks first for whatever Miss Beatrix Potter gives... In her new book... {{although there is no}} diminution in the charm and drollery of the drawings, Miss Potter's fancy is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. The story is inconclusive. Next year we think she must call in a literary assistant. We have no hesitation in calling her pencil perfect.|$|E

5|$|Finn {{wakes up}} to {{discover}} that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) is now his wife {{and he is now}} the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to hint that reality is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> seems. Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E

25|$|Scalia also {{attacked}} {{the majority opinion}} as being fundamentally antidemocratic. His dissent cited a passage from The Federalist Papers in arguing {{that the role of}} the judiciary in the constitutional scheme is to interpret the law as formulated in democratically selected legislatures. He argued that the Court exists to rule on what the law says, <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> should say, and that it is for the legislature, acting in the manner prescribed in Article V of the Constitution to offer amendments to the Constitution in light of the evolving standard of decency, not for the Court to arbitrarily make de facto amendments. He challenged the right of unelected lawyers to discern moral values and to impose them on the people in the name of flexible readings of the constitutional text.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of Maya {{is used to}} explain the empirical reality in Advaita. Jiva, when conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, states Vedanta school, which leads it to misunderstand Maya and interpret it as the sole and final reality. Advaitins assert that the perceived world, including people and other existence, is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> appears to be". It is Māyā, they assert, which manifests and perpetuates a sense of false duality or divisional plurality. The empirical manifestation is real but changing, but it obfuscates {{the true nature of}} metaphysical Reality which is never changing. Advaita school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of the unchanging Reality and truths – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his {{servants}} prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor {{says that he is}} unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.|$|E
25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

And I say" [...] his version is [...] "But he don't {{know what it means}}, Don't {{know what it means to}} love someone". He has stated the lyric change was a mistake during the recording process, caused by him not reading the lyrics before recording the song.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} tour, a [...] movie trailer video was premiered in May 2014 {{entitled}} [...] "Run" [...] (stylized as [...] "RUN"). The video, which features eight celebrity cameo appearances, showcases {{the couple in}} a variety of Bonnie and Clyde style, action and gun packed situations. The tour itself was noted to follow this same theme throughout, with similar video interludes incorporated into the production of the show. Critics generally lauded the tour, praising the extravagant set list, dynamic and detailed theme and story of the show and both artists' performance abilities, however some felt the on stage chemistry between the couple was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> could have been.|$|E
500|$|Hendrick Vroom explains, [...] "the term Maya [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} as 'illusion,' {{but then it}} does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' {{does not mean that}} the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned." [...] According to Wendy Doniger, [...] "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{another meeting}} with Epstein on 9 May at the Abbey Road studios, Martin was {{impressed}} by Epstein's enthusiasm and agreed to sign the unknown Beatles to a recording contract, without having met them or seen them play live. The contract was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> seemed, however, as Martin would not sign it himself until he had heard an audition, and later said that EMI had [...] "nothing to lose," [...] as it offered one penny for each record sold, which was split among the four members. Martin suggested to EMI (after the release of [...] "From Me to You") that the royalty rate should be doubled without asking for anything in return, which led to Martin being {{thought of as a}} [...] "traitor in EMI".|$|E

500|$|On June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, {{delivered}} {{a speech to}} the Senate she called a [...] "Declaration of Conscience". In a clear attack upon McCarthyism, she {{called for an end to}} [...] "character assassinations" [...] and named [...] "some of the basic principles of Americanism: The right to criticize; The right to hold unpopular beliefs; The right to protest; The right of independent thought". She said [...] "freedom of speech is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> used to be in America", and decried [...] "cancerous tentacles of 'know nothing, suspect everything' attitudes".

500|$|Like many Nirvana songs, [...] "In Bloom" [...] shifts {{back and}} forth between quiet verses and loud choruses. Cobain uses a Mesa Boogie guitar {{amplifier}} for the verses, and during the chorus he switches to a Fender Bassman amp (suggested by Vig) for a heavier, double-tracked fuzztone sound. The rhythm section of Novoselic and Grohl kept its parts simple; Grohl stated it was [...] "an unspoken rule" [...] to avoid unnecessary drum fills, while Novoselic said he felt his role was about [...] "serving the song". During the choruses, vocalist Cobain and drummer Grohl harmonize while singing [...] "He's the one/Who likes all our pretty songs/And he likes to sing along/And he likes to shoot his gun/But he knows <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means". The song's intro reappears {{at the end of each}} chorus.|$|E
500|$|The {{best known}} of Bath's {{terraces}} is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. But all is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> seems; while Wood designed the great curved façade of {{what appears to be}} about 30 houses with Ionic columns on a rusticated ground floor, that was the extent of his input. Each purchaser bought a certain length of the façade, and then employed their own architect to build a house to their own specifications behind it; hence what appears to be two houses is sometimes one. This system of town planning is betrayed {{at the rear of the}} crescent: while the front is completely uniform and symmetrical, the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights, juxtapositions and fenestration. This [...] "Queen Anne fronts and Mary-Anne backs" [...] architecture occurs repeatedly in Bath.|$|E
