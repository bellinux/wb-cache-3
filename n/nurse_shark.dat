5|$|Compared to the <b>nurse</b> <b>shark,</b> the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{has a more}} placid {{disposition}} {{and will}} often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E
5|$|The tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> has few natural predators; {{attacks on}} this {{species have been}} {{reported}} from bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran), while the related <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{has been known to}} fall prey to tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Known parasites of this species include five species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium, which infest the shark's spiral intestine.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> as Vulnerable worldwide, as it faces heavy fishing pressure and its low reproductive and dispersal rates limit {{the ability of}} over-exploited populations to recover. Furthermore, this shark's inshore habitat renders it susceptible to habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices (e.g. poisons and explosives, especially prevalent off Indonesia and the Philippines), and human harassment. Localized declines or extirpations of the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> have been documented off India and Thailand. Off Australia, this species has been assessed as of Least Concern, as there it is not targeted by fisheries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are thought}} to take {{advantage}} of dormant fish which would otherwise be too fast for the sharks to catch; although their small mouths limit the size of prey items, the sharks' large throat cavities are used as a sort of bellows valve. In this way, <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are able to suck in their prey. <b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are also known to graze algae and coral.|$|R
50|$|The Ginglymostomatidae are a {{cosmopolitan}} family of carpet sharks, containing two monotypic genera of <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> Common in shallow, tropical and subtropical waters, these sharks are sluggish and docile bottom-dwellers. <b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> typically attack humans only if directly threatened.|$|R
25|$|Tourism and {{recreational}} {{use of the}} Cape Byron Marine Park has impacted on the populations of Grey <b>Nurse</b> <b>Sharks</b> (Carcharias taurus). Grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> maintain the same nursery breeding grounds which are often disturbed by tourism activities such as divers and often the use of shark repellent. Shark netting protected swimmers on beaches has also been linked to mortality of grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> Increased boat traffic, pollution and fishing equipment are also {{a threat to the}} humpback whale on their migratory journey.|$|R
5|$|The tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific region. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa northward to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and India, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Chagos Archipelago, the Seychelles, and the Maldives. In the western Pacific, it occurs from southern Japan and the coast of China to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to {{as far south as}} the northern coast of Australia. In the central Pacific, it has been reported from off New Caledonia, Samoa, Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Tahiti. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in the Pirabas Formation of northern Brazil, dating back to the Lower Miocene (2316 Ma). The presence of these fossils indicates that the range of the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> once extended to the tropical Atlantic Ocean, prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.|$|E
5|$|Mating in the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is known}} to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|The tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is taken}} by {{commercial}} fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, {{where it is}} only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the offal processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver {{is a source of}} oil and vitamins, and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors, making grunting noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Recreational fishing {{which is}} {{permitted}} in the Cape Byron Marine Park {{has also been}} linked to mortality rates of grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> It {{has been reported that}} the injuries sustained by grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> in the form of jaw injuries and internal fishing hook, which can cause disease or internal injuries which has increased the long term mortality rates. Considering that over 30% of grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> reported have fishing related injuries, this is a significant impact on an endangered species.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{exceptionally}} sedentary {{unlike most}} other <b>shark</b> species. <b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> show strong site fidelity (typical of reef sharks), {{and it is}} one of the few shark species known to exhibit mating site fidelity, as they will return to the same breeding grounds time and time again.|$|R

5|$|The tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{may be one}} of the few fishes {{specializing in}} preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting tawny nurse sharks swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{tends to}} spend the day resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E
5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} nurse sharks, the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is believed to}} be a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at all hours off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark,</b> but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking <b>nurse</b> <b>shark.</b> The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} Marine Parks Act 1997, the Cape Byron Marine Park is also {{affected}} by the Environment protection and Biodiversity Act 1999, NSW Threatened species conservation Act 1995, National Parks and wildlife Act 1974. These Acts impact on the area as they cover several species that are protected under these acts such as the grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ongoing {{threats to the}} Cape Byron Marine Park and its biodiversity. These {{environmental}} threats and issues include tourism and recreational use, fishing, pollution, development, invasive species, disease and climate change.

50|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are nocturnal animals, {{spending}} {{the day in}} large inactive groups of up to 40 individuals. Hidden under submerged ledges or in crevices within the reef, the <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> seem to prefer specific haunts and will return to them every day. By night, the sharks are largely solitary; they {{spend most of their}} time searching through the bottom sediments in search of food. Their diet consists primarily of crustaceans, molluscs, tunicates, and other fish, particularly stingrays.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are ovoviviparous, {{producing}} young {{by means}} of eggs that are hatched within {{the body of the}} pregnant female. The mating cycle is biennial, taking 18 months for the female's ovaries to produce another batch of eggs. The mating season runs from late June to the end of July, with a gestation period of six months and a typical litter of 21-29 pups. The young <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are born fully developed at about 30 cm long.|$|R
