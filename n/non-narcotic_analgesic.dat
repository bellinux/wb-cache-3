Nearly two decades earlier there had been a sharp increase in the prevalence of chronic gastric ulcer in young women living in the same two states [6 – 9], but the etiological role of analgesic abuse in that disease was not recognized until the 1960 's [10 – 15].

40|$|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Metamizole was {{withdrawn}} from {{the market in the}} United States and several European countries following reports of fatal agranulocytosis among users, but is still available in many countries in Europe, South America and Asia. Over the past several decades, a number of epidemiologic studies have been conducted to quantify the risk of agranulocytosis and other adverse effects associated with metamizole and other <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesics.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} perform a systematic review of the safety of metamizole. METHODS: Epidemiologic studies published between 1 January 1980 and 15 December 2014 were identified through systematic searches of PubMed and Google Scholar; the reference sections of selected articles were also reviewed to identify potentially relevant studies. Studies included in this review focused on the safety of metamizole, that is on outcomes such as haematologic abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleeding, anaphylaxis and hepatotoxicity. Two study investigators independently reviewed the abstracts and articles to determine relevant studies according to prespecified criteria. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 22 articles met the criteria for evaluation. The majority of studies that evaluated agranulocytosis indicated an increased risk associated with metamizole, with relative risk (RR) estimates ranging from 1. 5 (95 % CI, 0. 8 - 2. 7) to 40. 2 (95 % CI, 14. 7 - 113. 3). Findings of three case-control studies do not suggest an association between metamizole and aplastic anaemia. Of the five case-control studies that evaluated the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, four found a statistically significant increased risk associated with metamizole (RR estimates ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 7). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether metamizole increases the risk of other outcomes (e. g. hepatic effects, anaphylaxis, congenital anomalies). Few studies evaluated the effects of dose, route of administration or duration of therapy. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Published studies reported differences in the magnitude of risk of adverse outcomes associated with metamizole use and often had small sample sizes and a number of other limitations that may have biased the results. Further research is needed to better quantify the potential risks associated with metamizole compared to other <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesics...</b>|$|R

The availability of published data on clearance and volume of distribution of Tramadol in veterinary/laboratory animal species rendered the applicability of allometry. The results of the interspecies scaling for both clearance (2. 036353 W 0. 894801;R 2 = 0. 781829) and volume of distribution (2. 526827 W 1. 009582;R 2 = 0. 943264) suggested that simple allometry could help in formulating an effective dosing strategy of Tramadol in a new veterinary species. For instance, the predicted clearance for Tramadol was within 2 -fold of the observed value in camels (predicted: 1. 08 L/h; observed: 1. 94 L/h); while, the predicted steady state volume of distribution value was in close proximity to the observed value in camels (predicted: 2. 67 L; observed: 2. 58 L). Also, simple allometry performed by the use of laboratory animal (rat, rabbit, dog) and human data predicted clearance and volume parameters in cat, goat, horse and camel within 4 -fold and 2 -fold, respectively. In summary, interspecies allometry scaling inclusive human data can be potentially used as a tool for dosing strategy when a new veterinary species is chosen.

Currently, ureterorenoscopic (URS) stone {{fragmentation}} and removal is {{the treatment of}} choice for managing ureteral stones, especially mid and distal ones and is advocated as initial management of ureteric stones. The aim of this work was to evaluate the symptoms, necessity, potential benefits and adverse effects of ureteral stent placement after uncomplicated ureteroscopic lithotripsy. Methods. This retrospective-prospective study evaluated a total of 125 patients who had underwent ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL). The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: stented (59 patients) and unstented (controls, 66 patients). The outcomes measured and compared between the two groups included: stone free rate, postoperative patient pain validated by scale, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), the need for unplanned hospital care, stent related complications, and functional recovery in the form return to normal physical activities. Results. A successful outcome, defined as being stonefree after 12 weeks, was achieved in all 125 (100 %) patients. The stone-free rate showed {{no significant differences between the}} two groups. LUTS was frequent complaint in the stented group, with statistically significant difference in the domain of frequency/urgency (p = 0. 0314). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in the mean operative time and mean hospitalization time, mean pain visual analog scale (VAS) score and in the use of nonnarcotic analgesic. On the day of the surgery and until postoperative day 3 (POD 3) and postoperative day 5 (POD 5), the pain score was much higher among stented patients than among the controls (p = 0. 0001) and <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesic</b> use (p = 0. 001) was frequently required in the stented group.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Background: Utilization of {{hospital}} emergency departments (EDs) for dental complaints is increasing. Approximately 79 % of dental-related ED visits are for non-emergency conditions. Most visits are avoidable, and directing them to alternative settings {{could result in}} substantial savings to the United States health care system. Methods: This retrospective cohort study assessed patient and dental condition characteristics associated with presentation to a pediatric hospital ED versus urgent care (UC) for after-hours non-emergency complaints from 2014 to 2016. Data were collected from the electronic medical records at Seattle Children’s Hospital from patients presenting from 5 : 00 pm to 10 : 30 pm Monday through Friday and 11 : 00 am to 8 : 00 pm on weekends and holidays. Logistic regression was performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) to assess the association of characteristics such as age, sex, dental home, and triage acuity with presentation to the ED versus UC. Differences in types of medical and dental services in the ED versus UC were compared using Chi-squared testing. Results: A total of 266 visits were assessed, 189 (71. 0 %) visits occurred in the ED, and 77 (29. 0 %) occurred in the UC. Children with a community clinic dental home had a 4. 05 -fold increased odds of presenting to the ED compared to those with private practice dental homes (95 % CI 1. 06 - 15. 52). For every unit decrease in triage acuity there was a 91 % lower odds of presenting to the ED (95 % CI 0. 04 – 0. 19). More children in the ED received at least one medication (60 % versus 26 %, p< 0. 001), <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesics</b> (36 % and 20 %, p= 0. 01), at least one prescription for medication (31 % versus 15 %, p= 0. 004), prescription for <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesics</b> (10 % and 2 %, p= 0. 03), primary tooth extraction (37 % versus 24 %, p= 0. 04), and interim tooth restoration (12 % versus 2 %, p= 0. 01).   Fewer children seen in the ED received definitive tooth restoration (0 % versus 9 %, p< 0. 001).

Either 15 or 30 mg of nefopam or 50 or 100 mg of pethidine were given by i. m. injection in a random order. All assessments {{were made by the}} same observer on the first day after operation, at least 4 h after the previous analgesic injection. Nefopam 15 mg was equipotent with pethidine 50 mg, peak analgesia being achieved 1 h after the i. m. injection. Pethidine 100 mg provided significantly better pain relief than nefopam 30 mg, the latter being not more effective than nefopam 15 mg apart from the duration of analgesia which was longer. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar after both drugs. Sweating and tachycardia were observed more frequently after nefopam, whereas sedative side-effects were more common after pethidine. Nefopam HC 1 is a new <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesic</b> with a unique heterocyclic structure (Klohs et al, 1972). The analgesic action of nefopam has been confirmed by several studies (Tobin and Gold, 1972; Cohen, 1974; Workmon and Winter, 1974). It seems to have no depressant action on the central nervous system, unlike most other potent analgesic agents. On the contrary, Gassel (1973) has demonstrated enhanced reflex activity after nefopam. Gasser and Belville (1975) found no respiratory depression after giving nefopam in therapeutic dosages. Klotz (1974) was unable to demonstrate any habituation or depen-dency after long-term administration of nefopam in human volunteers.

Ibuprofen is a <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesic</b> and acetaminophen is considered {{as one of the most}} consumption anti-inflammatory drugs and is administrated to relieve moderate to severe pains. Our purpose is comparing the effects of acetaminophen, ibuprofen and combination of them to relieve the teeth pain due to extraction under local anesthesia. Materials & Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, we divided 105 children (6 - 11 years old) referred to pediatrics ward of dental faculty of Hamadan University into 3 groups of 35 after getting their parent's consents, taking, their history and weighing them. Group 1 : received acetaminophen syrup with dose of 15 mg/kg, group 2 : received ibuprofen syrup with dose of 5 mg/kg, and group 3 received acetaminophen syrup with dose of 7. 5 mg/kg and ibuprofen syrup with dose of 2. 5 mg/kg.. One hour before and 15 min after tooth extraction, severity of their pain was evaluated according to table(CHEOPS). Drug effects in every group was studied by c 2, t-test and Mann Whitney U test. Results: Age average of the children under survey in the group of acetaminophen syrup was 8. 62 ± 1. 81 years old and in the group of ibuprofen syrup was 8. 45 ± 1. 68 years old, and in the group of acetaminophen with ibuprofen was equal with 8. 71 ± 1. 27 years old. Sex combination of the under survey children in the group of acetaminophen syrup was 51. 4 % / 48. 6 % (female/male), in the group of ibuprofen syrup was 51. 4 %/ 48. 6 %, and in the group of acetaminophen syrup with ibuprofen syrup was 65. 7 %/ 34. 3 %. Grade average of toothache immediately after extraction in the group treated with acetaminophen syrup was 33. 19 and, in group treated with ibuprofen syrup equaled 37. 81, and in the group treated with acetaminophen syrup with ibuprofen syrup was 47. 86. Grade average of toothache 15 min after extraction in the group 1 was 35. 1, in the second group was 35. 9, and in the third group was 40. 83. Conclusion: The group received ibuprofen syrup and in the group received acetaminophen syrup in comparison with the group received acetaminophen with ibuprofen on the instant and 15 min after extraction showed much more relieved effect (P< 0. 05). No meaningful statistic differences were observed between the group received acetaminophen I 5 mg/kg and the group received ibuprofen 5 mg/kg. (Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2012; 18 (4) : 5 - 9...|$|E
40|$|Acetaminophen and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) are {{compounds}} {{which are}} extremely toxic to the liver. Acetaminophen {{is a drug}} which {{is well known for}} its analgesic and antipyretic properties. However, the abuse potential of this agent as a <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesic</b> in alcoholics is well known. It is also the leading cause of overdose in England. DMF toxicity results mainly from occupational exposure. At present there are no known reports of an antidote for DMF poisoning, while N-acetylcysteine, the antidote for acetaminophen poisoning, is known to produce adverse effects. The present study evaluates the potential of melatonin as an antidote for acetaminophen and DMF poisoning. This study also investigates the mechanism underlying acetaminophen addiction and abuse. Initial studies involved in vitro techniques in an attempt to remove the complexities of organ interactions. The photodegradation studies, using ultraviolet (UV) light, revealed that melatonin accelerates the rate of acetaminophen degradation in the presence of air, and reduces the rate of degradation in the presence of nitrogen. This study also revealed that melatonin is rapidly degraded in the presence of air, following UV irradiation. The effect of DMF on hydroxyl radical generation was also determined. DMF was shown to act as a free radical scavenger, rather that a generator of free radicals. The in vitro studies were followed by lipid peroxidation determination. DMF (0. 4 ml/kg and 0. 8 ml/kg) did not produce any significant increases in lipid peroxidation in the liver. Three different doses of acetaminophen (30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg) were administered to rats for seven days. Acetaminophen (500 mg/kg) was shown to significantly increase (p< 0. 05) lipid peroxidation in the liver. Melatonin (2. 5 mg/kg) was not able to significantly reduce the damage. The lower doses of acetaminophen (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) did not increase lipid peroxidation. Electron microscopy studies showed that DMF adversely affects the liver, and in particular, the endoplasmic reticulum. Co administration of melatonin (2. 5 mg/kg) was able to reduce the damage. Further experiments need to be performed before an accurate assessment can be made on the ability of melatonin as an antidote for DMF and acetaminophen poisoning. Several experiments were done in an attempt to uncover the biochemical mechanism underlying acetaminophen addiction and abuse. The first experiment targeted the liver enzyme tryptophan- 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO). This enzyme is the major determinant of tryptophan levels in vivo. Acetaminophen administration (100 mg/kg for three hours) was shown to significantly inhibit (p< 0. 05) the activity of TDO, indicating increased peripheral levels of tryptophan. This experiment was followed up with determination of brain serotonin and pineal melatonin. Brain serotonin was determined using the ELISA technique. Melatonin was estimated using this technique as well as with pineal organ culture. Acetaminophen administration (100 mg/kg for three hours) significantly increased (p< 0. 05) brain serotonin levels. Using organ culture where exogenous (3 H) tryptophan is metabolised to (3 H) melatonin, acetaminophen (100 mg/kg for three hours) was shown to significantly increase (p< 0. 05) pineal melatonin concentrations. However, the ELISA technique did not reveal any changes in endogenous pineal melatonin levels. The final experiment was the determination of urinary 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid (5 - HIAA), the major metabolite of serotonin, following acetaminophen administration (100 mg/kg for three hours). Acetaminophen was shown to significantly reduce 5 -HIAA levels (p< 0. 05) suggesting reduced catabolism of serotonin. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} acetaminophen mimics the actions of an antidepressant. This compelling finding has important clinical implications, and needs to be examined further...|$|E
40|$|Use {{of drugs}} during {{pregnancy}} was recorded prospectively in 2765 women attending the antenatal clinics {{of a general}} hospital from October 1982 to March 1984. Of these women, 2588 (93. 6 %) avoided exposure to drugs during the first trimester, 1802 (65. 2 %) took no drugs at any stage, 963 (34. 8 %) took a total of 154 different drugs from 35 groups of drugs, and 243 (8. 8 %) took a self administered drug. The most commonly used drugs were <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesics,</b> usually self administered, and antibacterials. The last survey of use of drugs in pregnancy in the United Kingdom 20 years ago showed fewer women avoiding drugs throughout pregnancy (195 of 911 (21. 4 %), p less than 0. 001) and in taking a self administered drug (586 (64. 4 %), p less than 0. 001) than at present. Most women nowadays abstain totally from alcohol (1786 (64. 6 %) v 109 (12. 0 %) previously, p less than 0. 001), but while more women are non-smokers compared with previously (1811 (65. 5 %) v 392 (43 %), p less than 0. 001) the trend has been far less dramatic than that for use of alcohol...|$|R

40|$|Bone {{metastasis}} is {{a common}} sequelae of solid malignant tumors such as prostate, breast, lung, and renal cancers, {{which can lead to}} various complications, including fractures, hypercalcemia, and bone pain, as well as reduced performance status and quality of life. It occurs {{as a result of a}} complex pathophysiologic process between host and tumor cells leading to cellular invasion, migration adhesion, and stimulation of osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Several sequelae occur as a result of osseous metastases and resulting bone pain can lead to significant debilitation. A multidisciplinary approach is usually required not only to address the etiology of the pain and its complicating factors but also to treat the patient appropriately. Pharmaceutical therapy of bone pain, includes non-steroidal analgesics, opiates, steroids, hormones, bisphosphonates, and chemotherapy. While external beam radiation therapy remains the mainstay of pain palliation of a solitary lesions, bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals have entered the therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of multiple painful osseous lesions. 32 P, 89 SrCl, 153 Sm-EDTMP, 188 Re/ 186 Re-HEDP, and 177 Lu-EDTMP can be used to treat painful osseous metastases. These various radiopharmaceuticals have shown good efficacy in relieving bone pain secondary to bone metastasis. This systemic form of metabolic radiotherapy is simple to administer and complements other treatment options. This has been associated with improved mobility in many patients, reduced dependence on narcotic and <b>non-narcotic</b> <b>analgesics,</b> improved performance status and quality of life, and, in some studies...|$|R
