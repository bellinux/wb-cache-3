40|$|The 1 st study {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>nonfluency</b> and information value in the oral reading of normal 5 s, controlling for the known relationship between <b>nonfluency</b> and sentence position of the words. As expected from studies of stuttering, a positive nonfluency-information relationship was found. The 2 nd {{study investigated}} the same relationship in the spontaneous speech of normal 5 s, again controlling for sentence position. Contrary to expectation, <b>nonfluency</b> tended to occur more often on lower information words. Further analysis showed that <b>nonfluency</b> was strongly related to sentence position of words as anticipated. The 3 rd study failed to demonstrate a relationship between <b>nonfluency</b> and information value in the spontaneous speech of stutterers. Theories of stuttering {{can be divided into}} two kinds: those that consider <b>nonfluency</b> in stuttered speech to be a pathological exaggeration of normal <b>nonfluency,</b> and those that consider it to be qualitatively different from <b>nonfluency</b> in normal speech. Johnson (19 SS; Johnson et al., 1959) has been the chief exponent of the "exaggeration " position, which is also consistent with operant conditioning approaches (e. g., Goldiamond, 196 S; Shames & Sherrick, 1963). In the "qualitative difference" position, stuttering is connected with various physiological or deep-seated psychological factors. An excellent summary of the different points of view is provided by Bloodstein (19 S 9). Evidence bearing on the utilities of these alternate theoretical positions could be derived from a comparison of the characteristics of <b>nonfluency</b> in stuttered and normal speech. Taylor (1966 b), reviewing studies of <b>nonfluency</b> in the oral reading of stutterers, concluded that hesitations in normal speech and stuttering are analogous, and that the common underlying mechanism involves the information value of the words. However, the present author considers that Taylor's conclusion was not fully justified, since there were no studies of stutterers ' spontaneou...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: <b>Nonfluency</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} commen {{childhood}} disorders. <b>Nonfluency</b> is a disorder of fluency, articulation rate, rhythm, or mixture of these factors. This has unknown etiology and is very complicated. The Aim of this article is studying the prevalence of <b>nonfluency</b> disorder in 8 year children (second grade in school). Subjects and Methods: This article is a cross-sectional study. The number of participants is 200 children. They were examined by reading, spontaneous speech and descriptive speech tasks. Then, the data were analyzed descriptively and by doing independence t-test. Results: Of 200 samples, 100 children were male and 100 were female. The prevalence rate of <b>nonfluency</b> was 4. 5 percent (4 percent for female and 5 percent for male). Prevalence of stuttering was the same. There was no subject of cluttering. Conclusion: The findings of this study are inconsistent with the result of the study performed in Amene institute in Tehran, and Menson’s study in Denmark 2000.

40|$|Purpose: Behavioral genetic {{studies of}} speech fluency {{have focused on}} {{participants}} who present with clinical stuttering. Knowledge about genetic influences on the development and regulation of normal speech fluency is limited. The primary aims {{of this study were}} to identify the heritability of stuttering and high <b>nonfluency</b> and to assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the correlation between these 2 fluency phenotypes. Method: Information on 6 specific speech fluency behaviors was obtained by maternal report for over 10, 500 5 -year-old Dutch twin pairs. Results: Genetic analyses revealed that both fluency phenotypes were moderately heritable, with heritability estimates of 42 % and 45 % for probable stuttering and high <b>nonfluency,</b> respectively. Shared environmental factors were also significant, explaining 44 % of the individual differences in probable stuttering and 32 % in <b>nonfluency.</b> For both phenotypes, the magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences did not differ between boys and girls. The overlap between the 2 traits was substantial (tetrachoric correlation was. 72). A bivariate genetic analysis showed tha...|$|E
40|$|Three {{theoretical}} explanations {{have been}} proposed to account for reactivity in self-monitoring, including Kanfer 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive-mediational model, Rachlin 2 ̆ 7 s operant recording response model, and Nelson and Hayes 2 ̆ 7 s multiple cueing models. The present study compared these models under uniform conditions. Sixty undergraduates were assigned to either self-monitoring (SM); SM plus goal setting (GS); SM, GS, plus self-reinforcement (SR); GS plus SR; or a training only control group. The dependent variable consisted of verbal <b>nonfluencies.</b> Results suggested that although all conditions produced significant reductions in verbal <b>nonfluencies,</b> reactive effects were largest under the two conditions that employed self-reinforcement conditions (i. e., SM + GS + SR, and GS + SR). The role of external contingencies in the reactivity of self-monitoring are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Three {{theoretical}} models explaining reactivity in self-monitoring were examined including one cognitive-behavioral and two operant views. Each theoretical account {{was represented by}} the following self-monitoring conditions: (1) self-monitoring (Rachlin-operant recording response model), (2) self-monitoring and goal setting (Kanfer-cognitive-mediational model), (3) self-monitoring, goal setting and self-reinforcement (Nelson and Hayes-multiple cueing stimuli model), (4) goal setting and self-reinforcement (Kanfer-cognitive-mediational model), and (5) training only. The comparative effects of the five self-monitoring conditions on the dependent measure, verbal <b>nonfluencies,</b> were evaluated using a repeated measures analysis of covariance design with the pretest as covariate. Results of the study indicated that self-monitoring conditions containing a self-reinforcement component (i. e., conditions 3 and 4) produced the greatest reactivity. Moreover, the presence of reinforcement appeared to positively influence whether subjects reached their individually set goals for reducing <b>nonfluencies.</b> The vast majority of self-reported cognitions associated with the occurrence of the target behavior were independently judged to be neutral rather than self-reinforcing or self-punishing. The implications of this study {{for the role of}} external versus covert forms of reinforcement were discussed as well as the use of this technique in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Using {{a sample}} of 20, 445 Dutch twins, this study {{examined}} the relationship between speech fluency and attentional regulation in children. A secondary objective was to identify etiological overlap between <b>nonfluency</b> and poor attention using fluency-discordant twin pairs. Method: Three fluency groups were created at age 5 using a parent questionnaire: (a) probable stuttering (PS; N = 826; 4. 0 %), highly nonfluent (HNF; N = 547; 2. 7 %), and typically fluent (TF; N = 19, 072; 93 %). Multiple scales assessing attention, primarily self-regulation/inhibition, were obtained from both parents when children were ages 5 and 7 and from teachers when children were age 7. Results: When compared with the TF controls, both the PS and HNF children received higher (i. e., more problematic) scores on parental attention ratings at both ages (p <. 002). Effect sizes were moderate for both groups. Teacher and parent ratings were generally comparable. The discordant co-twin analyses suggested that <b>nonfluency</b> and attention were influenced by potentially overlapping genetic and shared environmental factors. Conclusions: The liability to express both high <b>nonfluency</b> and problems with self-regulation/inhibition may arise from a common set of pathogenic mechanisms. This supports emerging models of stuttering, which propose that poor fluency may be part of a broader network of impaired self-regulatory processes. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: School-aged {{children}} with borderline intelligence quotient (IQ) have different comprehension and narrative skills compared with normal children. This research compared dysfluencies and story comprehension {{of these students}} with normal students. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 30 students with borderline intelligence quotient and 25 normal students were compared. Stratified random sampling was used for selection of students. Picture-elicited narrative and comprehension tests were used to study students. The Mann-Whitney U test and the analysis of covariance Spearman correlation test were used for data analysis. Results: Students with borderline intelligence quotient produced word dysfluencies and phrasal <b>nonfluencies</b> more than normal students (p= 0. 005, p= 0. 01, respectively). They also performed more poorly in story comprehension (p= 0. 002). There was a significant association between phrasal disfluency and story comprehension (r=- 0. 21). Conclusion: Students with borderline intelligence quotient show more dysfluencies in narration and are weaker in story comprehension. There are negative associations between phrasal disfluency and story comprehension...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{stories told}} by 150 kindergarten and first grade subjects for qualitative {{differences in their}} ability to use language. It was proposed that children who were poor readers {{would not be able to}} use language at a displaced symbolic level, and thus would have difficulty interpreting, organizing and specifying the elements of a story. It was therefore hypothesized that poor readers would exhibit qualitatively poorer stories, as reflected in criteria designed to evaluate the interpretation, organization and specification of the story. ^ Subjects viewed a sequence of pictures, generated a corresponding story, and recounted the story to a listener (i. e., a puppet) who had not seen the pictures. Fourteen pragmatic criteria, including failure to provide significant orienting information, failure to use temporal, spatial or causal terms to establish relationships between situations or events, message inaccuracies, and false starts or linguistic <b>nonfluencies,</b> were used to analyze the narratives. ^ For each pragmatic variable, an error ratio consisting of the number of errors per proposition used in the generation of the story was derived. A discriminant function analysis indicated that the pragmatic variables were successful at discriminating between the high and low reading groups. Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed significant relationships between the pragmatic errors and reading achievement for individual subjects. No age/grade differences were found: first grade poor readers were more similar to kindergarten poor readers in the ability to use language than they were to either kindergarten or first grade good readers. ^ The results of this study are consistent with the notion that qualitative language differences exist between good and poor readers relative to their ability to use language to interpret, organize and specify the elements of a story. These results suggest the need for follow-up studies that evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies that provide instruction congruent with a child 2 ̆ 7 s language level and enhance a transition to more organized and displaced use of language. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective – As {{part of a}} multi‐staged project, {{this study}} seeks to {{identify}} the unanswered questions about users as found in three fields: library and information science (LIS), human computer interaction, and communication and media studies, {{as well as the}} convergences and divergences across these fields. Design – A multi‐phased, qualitative study involving individual face‐to‐face and telephone interviews, as well as self interviewing and focus groups. Setting – The fields of LIS, human computer interaction, and communication and media studies as examined in interview situations. Subjects – 83 international experts across the three fields, as well as 31 local experts from central Ohio, USA. Methods – The majority of the 83 international experts in the fields of LIS, human computer interaction, and communication and media studies were interviewed by telephone (some in person). Thirty‐one local experts (7 public and 24 academic library directors) were individually interviewed and also took part in focus groups. The Sense‐Making Methodology was used as an interview approach with its emphasis on bridging gaps. Neutral interview questions were used to tease out the gaps in certain situations— in the case of this project, the gaps involve communication and the unanswered questions about users. Brenda Dervin developed this approach, which has been transformed and adapted by Dervin {{and a host of other}} LIS researchers over the past 25 years. It is a metatheoretical approach that has “evolved into a generalized communication‐based methodology seen as useful for the study of human sense‐making (and sense‐unmaking) in any context”(Dervin 729). The Sense‐Making metatheory is implemented three ways in the method: “in the framing of research questions; in the designing of interviewing; and in the analyzing and concluding processes of research” (Dervin 737). In the research under review for this summary the answers to the gap‐identifying questions allow different disciplines to begin to communicate and understand each other. Using Sense‐Making in focus groups involves self interviewing (diaries, journals) and group discussions. Interviews were transcribed using the “smooth verbatim approach” in which <b>nonfluencies</b> such as repetition, hesitancies, and partial words are eliminated. Care was taken to ensure anonymity, as this is necessary in the first step of the Sense‐Making approach. The transcripts were analyzed for themes to capture a broad picture of what the participants struggle with across disciplinary and research practicedivides. Analysis was carried out by using comparative coding developed in early grounded theory combined with the Sense‐Making methodology’s emphasis on gaps and bridging gaps. The “quotablequote” was the unit of analysis, and thematically representative quotes were selected from the transcriptions. Main Results – In an attempt to analyze communication across and within disciplines, the researchers did a thematic analysis on the interviews conducted with their international and local experts. The thematic analysis found 12 major themes, which included a total of 75 sub themes. The 12 major themes include the following:Participants wanted to make a difference with their work; participants agreed that current user research is not doing the job;there are fundamental disagreements about users and user studies; there are fundamental disagreements about the purposes of using user studies; there are external forces that make carrying out andapplying user studies difficult; there was a lengthy list of differing suggestions for improving user studies; interdisciplinary communication across the three fields that do user studies is not effective; it was agreed that interdisciplinary contact is difficult;communication across the research/practice divide is not going well; some participants saw academic researchers as the problem, while some participants viewed practitioners as the problem; and most participants agreed that contact across fields and the research/practice divide would be beneficial. The researchers contend that this analysis is one of many that could be done on the information retrieved from the interviews. Their goal was not to find the definitive answers, but to describe the difficulties that participants are having across disciplines and across the research/practice divide in terms of communication and relating to user studies. The researchers wanted to tease out implications for communication and to illustrate the multiplicity that they found. Conclusion – It is difficult for this study to draw conclusions except in the most general sense, as it is part of a larger, multi‐staged research project. However, this study did find that although participants across fields wanted a synthesis, they also expressed their inability to understand syntheses fromfields other than their own. There were some who wanted more theories, while some claimed there were too many theories already. There was much criticism about communication across disciplines, but few solutions offered. The researchers can offer up no “magic wands” as solutions for these results, but they do suggest that the modes of communication traditionally used in user studies research are not working...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{research}} evidence suggests that labelling the nonfluent child as a stutterer {{may not always be}} warranted. Premature labelling may even lead to deleterious effects on the development of a child‘s self-concept and progressive socialization. The responsibility rests with adults as significant others in the child’s conceptual world to both appreciate and anticipate the reactions that any overt or covert action of labelling might precipitate. Labelling automatically implies a discrimination process. Discrimination involves the recognition of similarities and differences. It is convenient as parents, educators and observers to classify people within our social discourse. Yet are we fully aware of the import of this dictatorial action? A child who is classified as a stutterer becomes automatically differentiated from his non-stuttering peers. Supposedly we do this {{on the grounds of the}} <b>nonfluency</b> pattern observed in his speech. But all too often, our classification process involves more than a simple observance of nonfluencies. It carries overtones of an evaluative judgment of the personality, motivation and intellectua...|$|E

40|$|Depressive {{alterations}} {{were investigated}} in 21 acute and 21 chronic aphasic patients with single left sided strokes. The assessment of depression {{was based on}} a psychometrically evaluated German version of the Cornell Scale for Depression (CDS) and the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). No significant difference was found concerning depression sum-scores between the two aphasic groups. The acute group, however, exhibited significantly higher ratings in items related to physical signs of depression and disturbances of cyclic functions. Patients corresponding to the RDC-syndrome of major depression were only found in the acute group. Neither age, sex nor degree of hemiparesis discriminated the patients on the severity of depressive symptoms. In the acute patient group, <b>nonfluency</b> of aphasia was the only parameter that could be identified which had an effect on the mood symptom scores. A CT scan analysis in the acute patient group showed an association between the severity of depression and anterior lesions. A significant correlation was found between CDS sum-scores and the proximity of the anterior border of the lesion to the frontal pole of the hemisphere whereas the volume of lesions seemed to have no effect on depressive alterations in acute aphasic patients. Superimposition of the lesions of the aphasic patients with major depressive disorders showed a common subcortical lesion area involving putaminal and external pallidal structures...|$|E
40|$|A simple new contact lens {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to permit the presentation of continuously lateralized visual information to one visual half field at a time. Free unilateral scanning of the information and monitoring of performance in the subjects' lap {{makes it possible to}} administer a variety of standard perceptual and cognitive tasks to either hemisphere in order to assess hemispheric specialization under natural conditions. Two representative commissurotomy patients have been fitted with the new device and have undergone an extensive series of language and related studies focusing on the right hemisphere. All tests were administered unilaterally to each hemisphere and subsequently in free vision. The results were correlated with data from a group of three hemispherectomy patients in two of whom the right (non dominant) and in one of whom the left (dominant) cerebral hemisphere has been surgically removed for the treatment of post infantile tumor. The case of dominant hemispherectomy is particularly rare and permits the study of language competence and performance in a girl whose language lateralization for speech and hearing was well under way (perhaps completed) when the tumor set in. Results of extensive clinical aphasia tests reveal a distinct hierarchy of language functions from a relatively good auditory comprehension through a more severe speech deficit, to almost complete alexia, agraphia and acalculia. Theoretical aphasiological analysis of the pattern of impairment in language functions here shows that in spite of characteristic <b>nonfluency</b> and anomia in speech, the syndrome is unique and does not correspond to either a Broca's or anomic aphasia. The agraphia and especially the alexia in this patient are more severe than in the separated right hemisphere of the two commissurotomy patients which can read a wide range of individual words and even short sentences. This is in contrast to her superior expressive speech relative to the right hemisphere of the same two commissurotomy patients. In a series of studies comparing the psycholinguistic abilities of the two hemispheres in the two commissurotomy and three hemispherectomy patients it was shown that the right cerebral hemisphere had extensive ability to elicit meaning from pictures and to recognize semantic associations and form concepts. In particular it was able to ignore perceptual for semantic similarity. Lateralized tests of visual closure reveal the conditions under which right hemisphere visual feature extraction mechanisms fail. Previous results on superior right hemisphere competence in completing patterns from fragmented information must now be qualified by the provision that when the gestalt of the visual ground is strong and in competition with the figure, the right hemisphere is unable to complete partial patterns. Neither can it recognize complete embedded figures in the face of distracting gestalt in the ground. Right hemisphere competence in various aspects of auditory language comprehension has been investigated with the aid of an experimental paradigm involving matching an auditory message to one of unilaterally presented alternative line drawings. Lower limit age estimates for right hemisphere comprehension of vocabulary were obtained and it was shown that the right hemisphere can comprehend not only abstract words but also a variety of syntactic structures including verbs, and sentential transformations and to a lesser degree long nonredundant and semantically abstract references. Right hemisphere pattern of syntactic competence has weak correlation with order of acquisition in children and somewhat stronger with aphasics. In contrast, aural vocabulary in the right hemisphere, although consistently inferior to the left, follows the same function of frequency as the left just as do children and aphasics. ...|$|E
