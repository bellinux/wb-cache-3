The forces and moments {{on either side of the}} section must be equal in order to counteract each other and maintain a state of equilibrium so the same bending moment will result from summing the moments, regardless of which side of the section is selected. If clockwise bending moments are taken as negative, then a <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> within an element will cause [...] "sagging", and a positive moment will cause [...] "hogging". It is therefore clear that a point of zero bending moment within a beam is a point of contraflexure - that is the point of transition from hogging to sagging or vice versa.|$|E

Internal force of main girder {{is influenced by the}} dead load and stiffness of main girder, the length and stiffness of launching nose. Parametric analysis on the effect of internal force of an 8 × 60 m-span concrete continuous box girder bridge was carried out. The results show that bending moment increases following the increase of weight and stiffness of corresponding segment of main girder. The phenomenon is even more obvious in the <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> region of main girder segment nearby the launching nose. The bending moment of main girder reduces significantly when the stiffness ratio among launching nose and main girder is less than 0. 15. While, the <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> of main girder reduces significantly when the length ratio among launching nose and main span is more than 0. 58...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} and compare <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>moments</b> across mandibular fractures, for different positions of the bite point and different sites of the fracture. Three identical resin mandibles, each with a single fracture, were used. The fracture sites were in the angle, body and symphyseal regions. A polyethylene bone plate was used for fixation. Simulated bite forces were applied at 13 bite points. For each bite point, the displacements of the fragments were registered and converted into <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>moments</b> across the fracture. Positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were defined as those moments that caused compression at the lower border and tension at the alveolar side of the mandible; <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> did the opposite, Angle fractures had relatively high positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments.</b> Body fractures had positive as well as <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and the highest torsion moments. Symphyseal fractures had <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> only and relatively high torsion moments.

These load patterns should play a decisive role in the treatment of mandibular fractures with regard to number and positioning of plates...|$|R
40|$|The loads {{across the}} {{fracture}} depend on {{variables such as}} position of the fracture and the bite point. Up to now, no study has described systematically the influence of these two variables on these loads. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe and compare value and direction of the loads across the fracture for different positions of fractures in the mandible. In a three-dimensional model, <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>moments</b> and shear forces were compared for five mandibular fractures. The fractures were located in, respectively, the angle, posterior body, anterior body, canine and symphysis region. Positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were defined to give compression at the border, <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> to give compression at the alveolar side of the mandible. The angle and posterior body fracture have high positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments,</b> small torsion moments and high sheer forces. The anterior body, canine and symphysis fracture have high <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and high torsion moments with similar maximum values. The number of bite points with <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were different for all fractures. These bite points were always located on the fractured side. It is concluded that mandibular fractures can be divided roughly into two groups with similar load patterns across the fracture.

Then, the bending moment is redistributed when the I-girder has enough flexural ductility (or rotational capacity). However, for I-girder with high strength steel, {{it is known}} that the flexural ductility is considerably decreased by increasing the yield strength of material. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a study for guaranteeing proper flexural ductility of I-girder with high-strength steel. In this study, the evaluation of flexural ductility of negative moment region of I-girder with high strength steel where yield stress of steel is 680 MPa is presented {{based on the results of}} finite element analysis and experiment. From the results, it is found that the flexural ductility of the I-girder is significantly reduced due to the increase of elastic deformation and the decrease of plastic deformation ability of the material when the yield strength increases. In this study, the method to improve the flexural ductility of I-girder with high strength steel is proposed by an unequal installation of cross beam and an optimal position of cross beam is also suggested. Finally, the effects of the unequal installation of cross beam on the flexural ductility are discussed based on the experimental results...|$|E

30|$|The shear {{strength}} of reinforced concrete beams extracted from existing buildings often reveals insufficient transversal steel reinforcement, mainly due to design or construction defects or increased design load requirements. FRP wrapping {{is one of}} the best solutions to improve beam {{shear strength}} as the retrofitting intervention is fast and the cost is modest. Design codes provide clear indication about the retrofitting design of simply supported beams, while the case of a beam with negative moments at the end is not considered, although this is in the case of a beam in a framed structure. One of the main uncertainties lies in the effectiveness of the FRP U sheet anchorage behavior in the area of <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> with cracked concrete. This may limit the shear strength of the retrofitted beam. In this study, two beams extracted from an existing building constructed in the 1930 s in Rome and retrofitted by carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (C-FRP) U strips placed at beam ends, where also <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were present, and have been evaluated with experimental tests at the laboratory of the Department of Architecture of Roma Tre University.

The current design approach of the prestressed concrete sleeper relies on the permissible stresses over crosssectional area. Loading condition acting on railway sleepers is considered from axle burden and dynamic amplification factor. On the basis of Australian design of railway prestressed concrete sleepers, only service limit states are considered; however, the design challenge is to provide adequate resistance of certain cross sections to both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments.</b> In this paper, the service limit states functions are formulated {{taking into account the}} permissible compressive and tensile stresses at both initial and final stages, and applied positive and <b>negative</b> <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> at railseat and middle sections. Random variables in the reliability analysis include railway track design parameters, axle load, material and geometrical properties, prestressing force and its losses, and model uncertainties regarded to the structural resistance and load effects. Statistical properties of related parameters are adopted from previous studies. Two analysis methods are used: first-order moment reliability method (FORM) and second-order moment reliability method (SORM). Sensitivity analyses of the reliability indices for flexural capacity according to the requirements of the limit states functions are also investigated, in order to evaluate the major influences of dynamic load factors, strengths of materials, track parameters, and model uncertainties...|$|R
