5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} and <b>naval</b> <b>vessel</b> urban legend {{describes an}} encounter between a large naval ship and what at first {{appears to be}} another vessel, with which the ship is on a collision course. The <b>naval</b> <b>vessel,</b> usually identified as of the United States Navy and generally described as a battleship or aircraft carrier, requests that the other ship change course. The other party (generally identified as Canadian or often Irish and occasionally Spanish) responds that the <b>naval</b> <b>vessel</b> should change course, whereupon {{the captain of the}} <b>naval</b> <b>vessel</b> reiterates the demand, identifying himself and the ship he commands and sometimes making threats. This elicits a response worded as [...] "I'm a lighthouse. Your call" [...] (or similarly), a punchline which has become shorthand for the entire anecdote.|$|R

5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> while on the move. This process, called underway replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to underway replenishment, <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> had to enter a port or anchor to take on fuel. In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived on}} 22 July 1718, surprising and trapping a ship commanded by pirate Charles Vane. After negotiations failed, Vane used a captured French vessel as a fireship {{in an attempt}} to ram the <b>naval</b> <b>vessels.</b> The attempt failed, but the <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> were forced out of the west end of Nassau harbour, giving Vane's crew an opportunity to raid the town and secure the best local pilot. Vane and his men then escaped in a small sloop via the harbour's narrow east entrance. The pirates had evaded the trap, but Nassau and New Providence Island were in Rogers' hands.|$|E

5|$|When World War I (1914–18) began, the {{government}} {{took control of}} all the railways and docks.

5|$|From May 1864, George {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the Peloponnese, through Corinth, Argos, Tripolitsa, Sparta, and Kalamata, where he embarked on the frigate Hellas.

5|$|In August 1964, as {{a result}} of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, in which U.S. <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> claimed to have been {{attacked}} by North Vietnamese patrol boats, President Johnson ordered retaliatory air strikes (Operation Pierce Arrow) launched against the north.

5|$|The attacking force {{included}} JNA soldiers conscripted {{from across}} Yugoslavia, {{members of the}} TO, Chetniks (Serbian nationalist paramilitaries), local Serb militiamen and units of the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force. At their peak, the Yugoslav and Serb forces {{in the vicinity of}} Vukovar numbered about 36,000. They were equipped with heavy artillery, rockets and tanks and supported by aircraft and <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> on the Danube.|$|E
5|$|The two {{attacks were}} the most {{effective}} operations conducted by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. They disrupted supplies of phosphate to Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which reduced agricultural production in these countries. In response, Allied <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> were deployed to protect Nauru and nearby Ocean Island and escort shipping in the South Pacific. Small garrisons were also established to protect the two islands.|$|E
5|$|While AIB patrols {{continued}} {{to report that}} no Japanese troops were located in the Jacquinot Bay area, the Australian command decided that the landing there would be made by a combat-ready force protected by <b>naval</b> <b>vessels.</b> This was intended both as a precaution against a sudden Japanese offensive and to provide useful experience for the units involved. The landing was designated Operation Battleaxe.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Massachusetts sailed for Puget Sound and {{overhaul}} 1 September. She {{left there}} 28 January 1946 for operations off the California coast, until leaving San Francisco, California, for Hampton Roads, arriving 22 April. She was decommissioned on 27 March 1947 {{to enter the}} Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk, Virginia, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1962. After being stricken, approximately 5,000 tons of equipment were stripped from Massachusetts for use on other <b>naval</b> <b>vessels,</b> including both of the explosively driven catapults used to launch float planes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine <b>naval</b> <b>vessels</b> moored in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E

5|$|In 1539 {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} from France and Spain grew and Henry issued orders for his coastal defences to be improved, creating a sequence of fortifications called the Device Forts across England.
