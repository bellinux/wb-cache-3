30|$|Coils and {{vascular}} Amplatzer plugs (self-expandable nitinol occlusion device) {{are frequently}} used for more definitive and targeted embolisation of distal vessels. Metallic coils come in various sizes and are generally coated with <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material</b> (fibrogenic fibers) or are uncovered. They allow rapid mechanical occlusion {{of the vessel}} as they are injected through the microcatheter. Several coils are usually required to conform into an occlusive coil ball, which creates a scaffold for thrombosis (Frandon et al., 2016). However, extensive coil usage precludes distal vessel access in cases of re-bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Hypertension and {{atherosclerosis}} are {{risk factors}} for both atherosclerotic plaques and thromboembolism. In atherosclerotic formations, a plaque develops under a fibrous cap. When the fibrous cap is degraded by metalloproteinases released from macrophages or by intravascular shear force from blood flow, subendothelial <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material</b> (extracellular matrix) is exposed to circulating platelets and thrombus formation occurs on the vessel wall occluding blood flow. Occasionally, the plaque may rupture and form an embolus which travels with the blood-flow downstream to where the vessel narrows and eventually clogs the vessel lumen.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of vascular and heart valve surgeries {{have contributed to}} improve outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, there are drawbacks, such as risk of infection and lack of growth potential. Tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) and tissue engineered heart valve (TEHV) hold great promise to address these drawbacks as the ideal TEVG and TEHV is easily implanted, biocompatible, <b>non</b> <b>thrombogenic,</b> durable, degradable, and ultimately remodels into nativelike tissue. In general, the TEVG and/or TEHV concept consists of scaffold, cells for scaffold seeding, and a subsequent remodeling process driven by cell accumulation and proliferation, and/or biochemical and mechanical signaling. Despite rapid progress in the field over the past decade, small-diameter arterial TEVG and TEHV have not been translated into clinical applications successfully. To successfully utilize TEVGs and TEHVs clinically, further elucidation of the mechanisms for TEVG and TEHV remodeling and further translational research outcome evaluations will be required...|$|R
25|$|Calcification at {{the outer}} base of older or more {{advanced}} lesions. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable). The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated, but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, {{which tend to}} be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells, and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material,</b> such as collagen, to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism.|$|R

30|$|The {{main cause}} of {{cardiovascular}} disease is the formation of atherosclerotic plaques within the blood vessel wall. They may occur at multiple sites in the arterial tree and be {{at different stages of}} progression [1]. While plaques progressively narrow the arteries in which they form, their clinical significance is dependent more on their composition than the size they attain [2],[3]. Morphologically, advanced plaques are composed of a necrotic core and overlying fibrous cap and those with a relatively large core and thin cap are considered unstable as they are vulnerable to rupture [2]-[4]. Rupture of the cap leads to exposure of the blood to <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material.</b> While the subsequent thrombus that forms primarily leads to subclinical plaque progression, through fibrosis tissue formation and constrictive remodelling [1],[5], it may also lead to vessel occlusion and occurrence of a clinical event, such as a heart attack or stroke [6],[7].|$|R

Apart from thromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in ischemia.|$|R

Etiology includes minor trauma, connective tissue disorders, or anatomic variations of the carotid artery. Most patients present with headache and/or neck pain, while ischemic symptoms are seen in at least 50 % of patients. In the pregnant population, imaging with MRI or MRA {{of the head and neck}} aids in diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is made, patients are treated with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. The optimal treatment in both pregnant and nonpregnant patients has not been well-studied. Conclusion. CAD is an important diagnosis to consider in a pregnant patient with persistent headache, especially if neurological symptoms are present. Imaging should be quickly obtained so treatment can be initiated...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Outcome from sinus vein {{thrombosis}} is very variable, with symptoms from headache to coma. Experimental {{findings suggest that}} an involvement of cortical veins is necessary to affect the cerebral microcirculation. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to investigate the regional and temporal changes in local cortical blood flow after experimental occlusion and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and tributary cortical veins in rats. Methods: Thrombosis was induced by slow injection of kaolin-cephalin suspension after frontal and caudal ligation of the sagittal sinus in rats. Local cerebral blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and correlated with parenchymal damage found 24 hours after induction of thrombosis. Results: Local cerebral blood flow 1 hour after sinus occlusion and induction of thrombosis had decreased to 60. 92 ± 29. 05 % (/?< 0. 01); however, {{there was a large}} variability among individual animals. Only five of 12 rats showed histological damage and intracerebral hemorrhages 24 hours after induction of thrombosis. A subgroup analysis revealed that parenchymal damage occurred in concurrence with reduced blood flow values after sinus ligation and injection of the <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material.</b> Sinus thrombosis alone, without alteration of blood flow, did not cause tissue necrosis.

40|$|Venous and {{arterial}} thromboses {{are major}} causes of morbidity and mortality. Venous thrombosis {{is the result}} of pathological occlusive clot formation in the veins. It occurs mainly in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis), from which parts of the clot frequently embolize to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). Less than 5 % of all venous thromboses occur at other sites (e. g. arm or cerebral veins). Rarely occurring, but often life-threathening venous thrombosis is splanchnic vein thrombosis, including hepatic vein thrombosis, Budd Chiari syndrome (BCS) and portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Venous thrombosis often occurs spontaneously, but it also frequently accompanies medical and surgical conditions, both in the community and the hospital. Many risk factors for venous thrombosis are known, most of them related either to immobilization or to hypercoagulability [1]. The symptoms of venous thrombosis are non-specific, and therefore the clinical diagnosis is difficult and requires objective testing by imaging. Major complications of thrombosis include a disabling post-thrombotic syndrome and death due to fatal pulmonary embolism. Treatment with anticoagulants should be prompt and adequate. Arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an artery. Most arterial thrombi are superimposed on disrupted atherosclerotic plaque because plaque rupture exposes <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material</b> in the plaque core to the blood, and is therefore referred to as atherothrombosis...|$|R
40|$|Thromboembolic disease {{secondary}} to atherosclerosis is the commonest cause of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. The atherosclerotic plaque develops into a complex structure {{consisting of a}} lipid rich core and a connective tissue matrix. If the plaque undergoes acute change such as rupture or ulceration, exposure of highly <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material</b> in the plaque core leads to thrombus formation with subsequent embolisation or vessel occlusion. There is considerable {{evidence to support the}} theory that such acute changes immediately precede the onset of clinical symptoms.;Targeting pharmacotherapy towards preventing acute plaque change could in theory reduce the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with atherosclerosis. The potential for therapeutic intervention to prevent disease progression is therefore a very attractive option, but the precise cause of acute plaque disruption and thus the target for pharmacotherapy, has been elusive.;There is increasing evidence that a group of proteolytic enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are intimately involved in the atherosclerotic disease process. The plaque is a dynamic structure, undergoing continuous remodelling of the extracellular matrix upon which its structural integrity depends. MMPs represent the main physiological regulators of the extracellular matrix, and any imbalance between the level of MMPs and their inhibitors could cause increased matrix degradation.;The hypothesis in this study of was that a localised imbalance in the level of MMPs and their inhibitors may be associated with plaque instability and the onset of clinical events. The aim {{of the study was to}} quantify the major MMP/TIMP subtype levels within carotid plaques and to correlate them with clinical and histological features of plaque instability...|$|R
40|$|There is {{consensus}} that intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF) with direct (non-sinus-type) or indirect (sinus-type) retrograde filling of a leptomeningeal vein {{should be treated}} due to the high risk of neurological deficits and hemorrhage. No consensus exists on treatment modality (surgery and/or embolization) and, if surgery is performed, on the best surgical strategy. This series aims to evaluate the role of surgery {{in the management of}} aggressive dAVFs. Forty-two patients underwent surgery. Opening and packing the sinus with <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material</b> was performed in 9 of the 12 sinus-type dAVFs. In two sinus-type fistulae of the cavernous sinus and 1 of the torcular, microsurgery was used as prerequisite for subsequent embolization by providing access to the sinus. In the 30 non-sinus-type dAVFs, surgery consisted of interruption of the draining vein at the intradural entry point. In 41 patients undergoing 43 operations, elimination of the dAVF was achieved (97. 6 %). In one case, a minimal venous drainage persisted after surgery. The transient surgical morbidity was 11. 9 % (n[*]=[*] 5) and the permanent surgical morbidity 7. 1 % (n[*]=[*] 3). Our surgical strategy was to focus on the arterialized leptomeningeal vein in the non-sinus-type and on the arterialized sinus segment in the sinus-type dAVFs allowing us to obliterate all but one dAVF with a low morbidity rate. We therefore propose that microsurgery should be considered early in the treatment of both types of aggressive dAVFs. In selected cases of cavernous sinus dAVFs, the role of microsurgery is reduced to that of an adjunct to endovascular therapy...|$|R
30|$|Currently, various {{in vitro}} static and dynamic test systems {{are applied to}} {{evaluate}} the hemocompatibility of biomaterials. Tests under static conditions were earlier developed by Breddin to determine platelet spreading as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for platelet disorders, e.g. thrombocytopenia [88]. More recently, this method was adapted for hemocompatibility screening studies [89] and further modified and automated for <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>materials</b> [90 – 92]. Static test systems simulate low flow or even no flow areas in the vasculature and provide a rapid and sensitive setup to determine the thrombogenicity of a biomaterial, in particular platelet adhesion. Dynamic systems are more appropriate to simulate the conditions in flowing whole blood in vivo or of extracorporeal devices and allow an adaptation of the test conditions to the (patho-) physiological situation of specific medical devices [93, 94]. Different setups are currently used including: agitators, centrifugation systems, flow chambers, chandler systems and closed loop circulation models. However, information about the test conditions and reproducibility are required but lacking {{for many of these}} systems. An appropriate dynamic model should simulate the arterial or venous conditions of blood/material interactions during the clinical application. Size and geometry of the device, duration of contact (up to 240  minutes), temperature as well as rheological (flow) and shear conditions should be considered {{in the design of the}} setup [29, 52, 70]. If a miniaturization of the device is required, blood flow should be proportionally adjusted to the reduced material surface area in order to adapt the degree of mechanically induced shear forces [70]. In studies focusing on platelet-material interactions, elevated shear forces (> 50  N • m- 2), as well as recalcification of citrated blood samples or air in the test system may artificially induce platelet activation/aggregation and should be avoided to ensure an accurate determination of thrombogenic effects induced explicitly by the material surfaces and not by the experimental conditions [95 – 97]. Especially in the dynamic test systems, kinetic measurements should preferentially be performed instead of endpoint determinations to characterize the time-dependence of blood/material interactions.|$|R
40|$|Blood {{flow through}} a narrow {{arterial}} tube has been a classical mathematical problem {{dating back to the}} 1840 &# 039;s, after the pioneer experimental work conducted by Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille, Observations of blood flow, published in Ann. Sci. Naturelles in 1836. However, numerical simulations on atherosclerosis only started to thrive in the 1990 &# 039;s, due to rapid advancement in computer technology. The transportation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) enables lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides to be carried within the water-based bloodstream. Numerous research papers have shown that LDL particles would adhere on the artery wall at the locations where the local wall shear stress (WSS) is too low to move them further, resulting in localised regions with high LDL concentrations. Atherosclerosis tends to develop at regions where LDL accumulation is high and consistent. It is well known in the medical community that high level of LDL is closely related to myocardial infarction and/or stroke due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Some rupture would release highly concentrated lipids and <b>thrombogenic</b> <b>material</b> into the bloodstream, leading to lethal blood clots that result in sudden cardiovascular casualties. In order to explore the dominant phenomenological mechanism, the thesis hypothesizes that LDL accumulation has the sole influence on plaque growth. By applying the hypothesis as the rule of growth, the thesis investigates how LDL accumulation affects the plaque morphology during its growth, aiming to provide a better understanding of atherosclerosis development. In this research the advanced two-way fluid-structural interaction (FSI) method is applied to model the growth of three-dimensional atherosclerotic plaques. The mild 45 % axis-asymmetric stenosis model with the bi-elliptical cross-sectional plaque morphology is used as the base model, and then the plaque morphology is updated to the non-elliptical arbitrarily shaped profile across the centre of the plaque {{in the direction of the}} flow and elliptical profiles at various cross-sections of the plaque that are perpendicular to the flow direction. The updated plaque morphology is determined according to the simulation results of WSS distribution in the vicinity of the previous plaque and the relationship between the WSS and LDL accumulation derived from the literature. The growth-updated model is then used as the new geometry for the next round of simulation. This process repeats until the stenosis severity is increased to or beyond 79 %, which is 1 % greater than the critical stenosis as reported in literature. The numerical results of these growth-updated models presented and discussed in the thesis are extensive, providing valuable insight into the plaque development...|$|R
2500|$|Non-thrombogenic – As natural {{heart valves}} {{are lined with}} an {{endothelium}} continuous with the endothelium lining the heart chambers they are not normally thrombogenic. This is important as should thrombi form on the heart valve leaflets and become seeded with bacteria, so called [...] "bacterial vegetations" [...] will form. Such vegetations are difficult for the body to deal with as the normal physiological defense mechanisms are not present within the valve leaflets because they are avascular and largely composed of connective tissue (Fixme: Create article discussing the pathgonesis of leaflet bacterial vegetations.). Should bacterial vegetations form on the valve leafets they may continually seed bacteria into the arterial tree which may lead to bacteremia or septicaemia. Portions of the vegetation may also break off forming septic emboli. Septic emboli can lodge anywhere in the arterial tree (e.g. brain, bowel, lungs) causing local infectious foci. Even dislodged fragments from uninfected thrombi can be hazardous as they can lodge in, and block, downstream arteries (e.g. coronary arteries leading to myocardial infarction, cerebral arteries leading to stroke, see embolism).

40|$|Collagens are {{integral}} structural proteins in animal tissues and play key functional roles in cellular modulation. We sought to discover collagen model peptides (CMPs) that would form triple helices and self-assemble into supramolecular fibrils exhibiting collagen-like biological activity without preorganizing the peptide chains by covalent linkages. This challenging objective {{was accomplished by}} placing aromatic groups {{on the ends of}} a representative 30 -mer CMP, (GPO) 10, as with l-phenylalanine and l-pentafluorophenylalanine in 32 -mer 1 a. Computational studies on homologous 29 -mers 1 a′–d′ (one less GPO), as pairs of triple helices interacting head-to-tail, yielded stabilization energies in the order 1 a′ > 1 b′ > 1 c′ > 1 d′, supporting the hypothesis that hydrophobic aromatic groups can drive CMP self-assembly. Peptides 1 a–d were studied comparatively relative to structural properties and ability to stimulate human platelets. Although each 32 -mer formed stable triple helices (CD) spectroscopy, only 1 a and 1 b self-assembled into micrometer-scale fibrils. Light microscopy images for 1 a depicted long collagen-like fibrils, whereas images for 1 d did not. Atomic force microscopy topographical images indicated that 1 a and 1 b self-organize into microfibrillar species, whereas 1 c and 1 d do not. Peptides 1 a and 1 b induced the aggregation of human blood platelets with a potency similar to type I collagen, whereas 1 c was much less effective, and 1 d was inactive (EC 50 potency: 1 a/ 1 b ≫ 1 c > 1 d). Thus, 1 a and 1 b spontaneously self-assemble into <b>thrombogenic</b> collagen-mimetic <b>materials</b> because of hydrophobic aromatic interactions provided by the special end-groups.
