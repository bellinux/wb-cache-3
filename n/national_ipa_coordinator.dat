40|$|Many {{countries}} spend significant {{resources on}} investment promotion agencies (IPAs) {{in the hope}} of attracting inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). Despite the importance of this question for public policy choices, {{little is known about the}} effectiveness of investment promotion efforts. This study uses newly collected data on <b>national</b> <b>IPAs</b> in 109 countries to examine the effects of investment promotion on FDI inflows. The empirical analysis follows two approaches. First, we test whether sectors explicitly targeted by IPAs receive more FDI in the post-targeting period relative to the pre-targeting period and non-targeted sectors. Second, we examine whether the existence of an IPA is correlated with higher FDI inflows. Results from both approaches point to the same conclusion. Investment promotion efforts appear to increase FDI inflows to developing countries. Moreover, agency characteristics, such as its legal status and reporting structure, affect the effectiveness of investment promotion. There is also evidence of FDI diversion due to investment incentives offered by other countries in the same geographic region. foreign direct investment; investment incentives; investment promotion...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} macroeconomic evidence predominantly demonstrates {{positive effects}} of foreign direct investment (FDI) on growth and competitiveness. Countries thus tend to have systematic policies in place for FDI promotion, devised and implemented especially through investment promotion agencies (IPAs). This paper adds to the literature on FDI incentives by examining the beliefs or attitudes of people working in the FDI promotion industry {{and the extent to}} which they coincide with the known FDI pull factors. To that end, we utilize a data set of attitudes of people largely working in regional and <b>national</b> <b>IPAs</b> in Europe and the Western Balkans. Cluster analysis reveals that in fact we can talk about three sets of beliefs or attitudes toward FDI: "pessimistic," "Keynesian," and "neoclassical. " Keynesians largely favor fiscal measures for attracting FDI, whereas neoclassicals dislike fiscal measures and government interventions and prefer good economic fundamentals and infrastructure and qualified personnel. Interestingly enough, most of the eastern European Union as well as southeastern European respondents can be classified as Keynesians; on the other hand, almost all neoclassicals are from western Europe. ...|$|R
40|$|Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) {{acquired}} {{an important role}} in the development process of the global economy. FDI inward stock was equivalent to an average of 32 % of GDP for OECD countries in 2013. However, FDI affects a country’s Balance of Payments (BoP) in two ways: FDI flows are recorded in the BoP financial account while returns on FDI affect the BoP current account. Therefore, part of the positive contribution of inward FDI to a country on its financial account could be potentially offset by a negative contribution of FDI returns on the current account. The intent of this work is to complement the research on FDI determinants by introducing FDI returns as a variable in a gravity model where bilateral FDI outflows are the dependent variable. Moreover, using outward FDI flows as the dependent variable, the work allows looking at the behavior of Multinational Corporations (MNC) investing abroad. The results show that MNCs repatriate returns generating from the investments they make abroad. This is particularly true when high-income countries are involved: MNCs from high-income countries repatriate returns to their home countries from FDI made anywhere, while MNCs from middle-income countries repatriate returns from FDI in high-income countries. Repatriated returns are a relevant variable determining the value of FDI that a country makes in another country. The information on FDI returns is starting to become available to the public. This allows MNCs to sharpen their investment location decision models and <b>national</b> <b>IPAs</b> to better assess the two-fold BoP effects of promoting FDI...|$|R

The competition named Deuchars <b>IPA</b> <b>National</b> League {{suffered from a}} plethora of clubs leaving, which was {{partly due to the}} RFL withdrawing all their funding to the Scottish Rugby League. Two-time former champions Fife Lions were the biggest name to go; after appearing in the previous 17 campaigns they decided to call it a day after a couple of seasons of struggle {{both on and off the}} pitch. Victoria Knights lasted just one season for the second time, deciding to fully concentrate on their youth clubs. Also leaving were three clubs from the north: Ross Sutherland RL, Moray Eels and Moray Titans. The season itself saw Aberdeen Warriors lay down a marker for their continued dominance as they went through the season undefeated, leading them to their second title after beating Edinburgh Eagles 30-20 in the final played in Aberdeen at the Hazlehead Academy. In the Challenge Cup champions Aberdeen Warriors made their debut but were heavily beaten at Pilkington Recs 4-46.|$|R
40|$|An Indigenous Protected Areas (IPA) {{is an area}} of land and/or {{water that}} an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group has decided to voluntarily declare and manage through a mixture of legal and other {{effective}} mean in line with the International Union for the Conservation of Natureâs (IUCN) protected area (PA) guidelines. The Australian Governmentâs IPA program supports the declaration and management of IPAs. Currently, there are 72 IPAs covering over 65 million hectares, making up more than 44 per cent of the <b>national</b> PA network. <b>IPAs</b> represent the first time a PA has been established with the informed consent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The IPA concept and program have been in effect for 20 years; however, despite national and international recognition as an approach that surpasses the constraints of collaborative forms of conservation, the Government have not made a commitment to continue funding IPAs post- 2018. To date, there is limited critical analysis of the IPA concept and program. This thesis aims to fill this gap in the literature by utilising an original analytical framework â addressing the role of Indigenous recognition, the role of language, bureaucracy, territoriality, accounting and accountability, and asymmetrical relations of power â to investigate the form and function of the IPA concept and program, against principles of the established 'fortress' (Brockington et al., 2008 a) and emerging rights-based paradigms for conservation. The analysis highlights that the concept and program reinforce a number of the principles of both paradigms. Nonetheless, the concept and program have in some respect evolved beyond the principles by further grounding the IPA concept and program in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders peoplesâ conception of their relationship to country. The future of IPAs is not only in the guarantee of long-term funding but also in how they continue to evolve and adapt. </p...|$|R
