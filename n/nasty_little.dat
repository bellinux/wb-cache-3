500|$|To help {{increase}} their positive publicity, Island Records hired the <b>Nasty</b> <b>Little</b> Man publicity team. The team {{set up a}} photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was {{to appear on the}} cover of Alternative Press magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song [...] "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated [...] "Fuck the Beastie Boys and the Dalai Lama" [...] needed to be changed. Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again – referring to Disney's previous requirement of censure. <b>Nasty</b> <b>Little</b> Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric. In response, Bruce fired <b>Nasty</b> <b>Little</b> Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.|$|E
500|$|Gardner's mother married Bill Lucas, who {{had been}} incarcerated in Wyoming in 1968. The Gardner-Lucas family {{eventually}} had nine children. Gardner admired Lucas, who used his stepsons as lookouts while burglarizing homes. By his early teens, Gardner had been held in detention at a series of institutions, including an involuntary commitment at Utah State Hospital in Provo. Gardner was small as a boy, and described {{that he had to}} fight to defend himself and earn respect. As Gardner admitted, [...] "I was a <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> bugger." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Nutcracker Suite, {{animator}} Art Babbitt {{is said to}} have credited The Three Stooges as a {{guide for}} animating the dancing mushrooms in the Chinese Dance routine. He drew with a music score pinned to his desk to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint, [...] "those <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> notes underneath... so something has to be related to that". The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for Dance of the Flutes. An Arabian dancer was also brought in to study the movements for the goldfish in Arab Dance.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Such a hole!' {{continued}} Bertha. 'It is {{the worst}} of all the curates' sitting-rooms, looking out into the <b>nastiest</b> <b>little</b> alley. It was a shame {{he did not have the}} first choice, when it is all his own.' ...|$|R

500|$|TVSquad {{reviewer}} Jonathon Toomey {{gave the}} first episode 9 out of 10 and said of it that [...] "This show is legit, well-worth watching. The only reason I'm holding back that last star is because the screener DVD I received only had the pilot episode and I suppose it's possible that the show could go downhill after that. But I wouldn't bet on it. [...] " [...] Toomey also later added another review of the premiere, stating that [...] "I'm worried though. Dexter is good. In fact, it's really good. That's why I'm worried. Why? Because Showtime has a <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> habit of canceling great shows. There was The Chris Isaak Show. Then Dead Like Me. The most recent casualty? Huff. All three of those shows were spectacular. And you know what? Dexter is better than all of them. So, yeah... I'm worried." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Keaton {{returned}} after {{a significant increase}} in his salary to $10 million. Annette Bening was cast as Catwoman after Burton saw her performance in The Grifters, but she dropped out due to her pregnancy. Raquel Welch, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Madonna, Ellen Barkin, Cher, Bridget Fonda, Lorraine Bracco, Jennifer Beals and Susan Sarandon were then in competition for the role. Sean Young, who was originally chosen for Vicki Vale in the previous film, believed the role should have gone to her. Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume, demanding an audition. Burton was unfamiliar with Michelle Pfeiffer's work, but was convinced to cast her after one meeting. Pfeiffer received a $3 million salary, $2 million more than Bening, and a percentage of the box office. The actress undertook kickboxing lessons for the role. Kathy Long served as Pfeiffer's body double. On Danny DeVito's casting, Waters explained, [...] "I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin. We didn't really officially cast it, but for a short <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> guy, it's a short list. I ended up writing the character for Danny DeVito." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} his vast accomplishments, Petipa's final years with the Imperial Ballet were difficult. By 1901 Pierina Legnani had retired from the stage to her native Italy, having given up in her rivalry with Mathilde Kschessinskaya. Petipa {{thoroughly}} despised Kschessinskaya, referring to her as [...] " ... that <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> swine" [...] in his diaries and commenting that local critics should beat her, rather than give her any compliments.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was a <b>nasty,</b> low-looking <b>little</b> chap, was Dodgy, very fly-looking {{and very}} conceited. I didn’t like {{the look of}} ’im at all, and {{unbearable}} as Joe was, it didn’t seem to be quite the sort o’ thing to get a chap aboard to ’ammer a shipmate you couldn’t ’ammer yourself.|$|R

A pulling up your pesticoats before the quality--a!" [...] Each exclamation being {{followed}} with that groaning grunt, with which the West-country folk, after having screamed their lungs empty through their noses, recover their breath for a fresh burst.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, dear, oh, dear! Quite a deep little cut. <b>Nasty</b> <b>little</b> cut. <b>Nasty</b> <b>little</b> cut. But, never mind. Never mind, little lady. We'll {{soon have}} it better. Soon have it better, little lady. What's your name?' ...|$|E

5000|$|John Lydon {{would later}} {{indicate}} that he felt with this song, the groups shock tactics crossed the line into gratuitous bad taste. In an interview conducted for Q magazine in 1996 he stated [...] "song was a very <b>nasty,</b> silly <b>little</b> thing... that shouldve {{ended up on the}} cutting room floor". He also took the opportunity to claim responsibility for the lyrics.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic wrote, [...] "While it {{will most}} likely be {{overlooked}} considering Immortal's brightest and deadliest moments came before and after it (respectively)", [...] "Damned in Black strikes one as being and Sons of Northern Darkness <b>nasty,</b> spiteful <b>little</b> brother, sounding slightly rushed, unkempt and panicky, with whirlwind blastbeats more prominent in the arrangements. But the album benefits from this approach; it's an angrier, more fiery record".|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{watched me}} so, and {{whenever}} I was making friends with any nice American girl, they always rattled me off somewhere else. I never did understand before what people meant when {{they talked about}} God being their only Friend, but I knew it then, for I had none at all, none else. And I did not think He would help me, for now I knew I had been hard, and horrid and nasty, and cruel to you and Allen, {{the only people who}} ever cared for me for myself, and not for my horrid, horrid money, though I was the <b>nastiest</b> <b>little</b> wretch. Oh! Mother Carey, I did know it then, and I got quite sick with longing for one honest kiss—-or even one honest scolding of yours. I used to cry all Church-time, and they used to try not to let me go—-and I felt just like the children of Israel in Egypt, as if I had got into heavy bondage, and the land of captivity. O do speak, and let me hear your voice once more! Your arm is so comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> beast; that's a biter," [...] {{replied the}} captain, shaking his head. [...] "But {{so long as}} you and me hang in, it don't matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, Miss Mercer," [...] said Josephine Cameron, with a <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> laugh. [...] "Make her tell. We're all interested. It's news {{to us that}} Charlotte {{ever had}} a beau." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, only I don't {{believe he}} did it! It was that <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> Bill Nosey. I am sure that he got hold of the lady's parcel, and stuffed it into Silky's cap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The word in {{your throat}} {{and in your}} father's!" [...] I cried. [...] "I have dared him this day already in your interest. I will dare him again, the <b>nasty</b> pole-cat; <b>little</b> I care which of us should fall!

5000|$|The Philadelphia Weekly review {{called the}} film [...] "an odious little potboiler". [...] Long Beach Press-Telegram called the film a {{predictable}} thriller. A review in The San Diego Union-Tribune concluded, [...] "What {{began as a}} fairly interesting girls-gone-wild picture becomes just another gorefest with lingering close-ups of wounds and knives being extracted." [...] Though the San Francisco Chronicle called Donkey Punch an [...] "interesting but flawed indie thriller", it determined the final act was [...] "annoyingly routine". Contra Costa Times gave the film a grade of [...] "C" [...] and described it as unoriginal suspense. The Seattle Times called Donkey Punch a [...] "lurid thriller", and was critical of its plot progression towards {{the middle of the}} film. The Kitsap Sun described the film as [...] "a <b>nasty,</b> dirty <b>little</b> movie". Though lamenting the predictability of the films plot, the review offered an instruction for potential viewers, [...] "Prediction isn’t the point, because you know the final score’s going to be 1. The point is to just sit back, if you’re so disposed and not easily offended, and gleefully watch all the <b>nasty,</b> dirty <b>little</b> business go down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{make one}} confession, though," [...] Babbie continued, almost reluctantly. [...] "When you were so <b>nasty</b> a <b>little</b> while ago, I didn't go back to Nanny's. I stood {{watching}} you from behind a tree, and then, for an excuse to come back, I--I poured out the water. Yes, and I told you another lie. I really came back {{to admit that it}} was all my fault, if I could not get you {{to say that it was}} yours. I am so glad you gave in first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{but because}} it is malice. I mean, that is, if there is dislike, or a grudge in our hearts at them--talking for ever of <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> miserable irritations makes it worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's unnatural," [...] I said. [...] "There's {{something}} about him--don't think me fanciful, {{but it gives}} me a <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> sensation, a tightening of my muscles, when he comes near me. It's a touch--of the diabolical, in fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> bald-'eaded little butcher, that is," [...] he said. [...] "'E don't please me. 'E's got a colley dog wot do, though. I'm goin' up to Murree in a week. That dawg'll bring fifteen rupees anywheres." ...|$|E
5000|$|A remixed {{version of}} [...] "Fame" [...] was {{released}} by EMI in 1990 {{to coincide with the}} Sound+Vision Tour, the release of the Changesbowie compilation, and the Pretty Woman soundtrack. Bowie wanted to remix a successful American single for the tour and album release; of the two options ("Let's Dance" [...] and [...] "Fame"), [...] "Let's Dance" [...] was simply too recent. Bowie liked the choice: [...] "It covers a lot of ground, Fame; it stands up really well in time. It still sounds potent. It's quite a <b>nasty,</b> angry <b>little</b> song. I quite like that." [...] The [...] "Gass Mix" [...] was subsequently included on the Pretty Woman soundtrack.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, honestly, I don't think I was," [...] {{answered}} Staniford. [...] "But I {{seemed to}} leave that impression on the company. I felt a <b>little</b> <b>nasty,</b> that was all; and I tried to hurt Mr. Dunham's feelings. But I shall make it right with him before I sleep; he knows that. He's used to having me repent at leisure. Do you ever walk Sunday night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! he'd {{be like a}} <b>nasty</b> oily {{efficient}} <b>little</b> {{machine for}} some merely subordinate necessity among all my delicate stuff. He'd do all we wanted no doubt {{in the way of}} money and powers--and he'd do it wrong and mess the place for ever. Hands all black, you know. He's just a means. Just a very aggressive and unmanageable means. This isn't a plumber's job...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's {{all very}} well to call me your dear,' said Bella, with a pettish whimper, 'and I am glad to be called so, though I have slight enough claim to be. But I AM such a <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> thing!' ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{aunt was}} old, and she again {{borrowed}} the parlour, {{though she was}} not now well inclined to ask favours from Mrs Buggins. Mrs Buggins had taken to heart the slight put upon her husband, and sometimes made <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> speeches.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm seriously distressed {{about my}} girls. They live in <b>nasty</b> <b>little</b> cottages, and eat filthy things; they pass {{their whole lives}} under the most disgusting conditions, and yet they're happy. I can't get them {{to see that they}} ought to be utterly miserable." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a letter}} {{for him on the}} ten o'clock morning mail. He didn't receive many letters--one a month from Joe Tubbs {{relating}} diverting scandal about perfectly respectable neighbors, or an occasional note from Cousin George Henry of Stamford. Lulu was acutely curious regarding it; she almost smelled it, with that quivering sharp-pointed nose of hers that could tell for hours afterward whether Father had been smoking [...] "those <b>nasty,</b> undignified <b>little</b> cigarettes--why don't you smoke the handsome brier pipe that Harris gave you?" [...] She brightly commented that the letter was from Boston. But Father didn't follow her lead. He defensively tucked the letter in his inside coat pocket and trotted up-stairs to read it to Mother.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{those outside}} of the Movement, Gidra {{garnered}} more criticism. In the final edition of Gidra, Murase described letters Gidra received from the greater Los Angeles community, including one from a “Chinese woman in Los Angeles who called Gidra ‘atrocious,’ and intimated {{that the quality of}} the newspaper can only improve when ‘some of you staff members (who are) SDS members and gangsters depart.’” Another letter read, “I don’t know what is wrong with you poor minority groups. As a while mother Im awfully proud of it. … it must be awful to be what you are, that you have to go so low that you have ot use nasty words to express your selfs your naughty <b>nasty</b> thilthy <b>little</b> people and I pity your kind. sic” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, danger!" [...] Eddie Denton laughed lightly. [...] "One {{drops into}} the habit of taking a few risks out there, you know. Talking of danger, the time when things really did look a <b>little</b> <b>nasty</b> was when the wounded gongo cornered me in a narrow tongo and I only had a pocket-knife with {{everything}} in it broken except the corkscrew and the thing for taking stones out of horses' hoofs. It was like this----" ...|$|R
