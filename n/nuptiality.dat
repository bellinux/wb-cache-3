40|$|Comparison {{of marital}} {{behaviour}} in the Czech and Slovak Republic since 1993 Abstract: This thesis deals with <b>nuptiality</b> in the Czech and Slovak Republic after the year 1993.

Based on the results, divergence of marital behaviour has occurred in both countries after 1993. This study concerns Second Demographic Transition, population climate changes and family policy.

Surveyed countries were chosen from all continents. The main criterion was availability of suitable data. The choice cannot be generalized for whole continents. But the differentiation of <b>nuptiality</b> {{and the most important}} trends were described. The analyse contains the portion of single according to age, singulate mean age at first marriage and in some cases distribution of fiancés according to age. This thesis shows that there was a shift of timing of marriage to older age of bridegrooms in most of chosen {{countries in the}} 70 s of the 20 th century. However in South America situation was a little bit different because of the high portion of people who lived in cohabitations. Values of mean age at marriage are influenced by level of literacy.

40|$|This {{research}} studies the <b>nuptiality</b> patterns in Egypt and the Maghreb countries of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Despite {{the importance of}} <b>nuptiality</b> as a demographic component, it is considerably under studied when compared to fertility, or mortality, particularly in the Arab region. <b>Nuptiality</b> studies in the Arab region are very sparse and marital status is usually analysed in terms of education and age without looking at other potential explanatory variables and interactions. In general, education and employment experiences can enhance autonomy and self-recognition, which in turn change people's expectations and prospective gains from marriage. However, the effect of both education and employment on marriage decisions is rather complex and does not usually follow the expected pattern in all {{the countries in the}} region. For example, the persistence of the kinship system, in many countries in the region, which benefits arranged marriage can well limit the role of education and employment on marriage. Such observations invited the elaboration of an analytical framework that takes into account the relationships between different factors that can interact and affect <b>nuptiality.</b> Both the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Pan Arab Project surveys (PAPCHILD) provide national information on some of marriage aspects in the four countries. The data used come from the Egypt DHS 1995, Morocco DHS 1992, Tunisia DHS 1988, and Algeria PAPCHILD 1993.

40|$|The {{constancy}} {{of fertility}} levels in Ghana, Senegal and southwest Nigeria since 1970 is separated into its <b>nuptiality</b> and marital fertility elements. The age-specific {{changes in the}} two components are examined and these show that the apparent stability in observed total fertility rates is essentially {{the outcome of the}} offsetting impact of increased marital fertility below age 25 and above age 40, over the effect of the increasing proportion of women remaining single up to 25 yr of age. Continuity in traditional fertility behaviour and stable <b>nuptiality</b> has remained operative over the broad middle segment of the reproductive lifespan of women in the three areas. The paper thus concludes that West Africa is likely to continue to display stably high fertility for many years into the next century.

40|$|BACKGROUND Research {{into the}} causes of the mid-twentieth-century baby boom has {{concluded}} that the main proximate cause of the fertility increase during the 1940 s was earlier and more universal marriage in the cohorts born after 1910, and that this association between <b>nuptiality</b> trends and fertility was particularly strong in Sweden. OBJECTIVE However, we do not know whether this was a general trend or if certain socio-economic groups spearheaded the change towards earlier marriage. METHODS The present study uses event history analysis to investigate the marital histories of approximately 100, 000 men and women in Sweden, born 1880 - 1934, to determine how socio-economic differentials in <b>nuptiality</b> developed during the period 1900 - 1960. CONCLUSIONS The analysis shows that the sharp increase in <b>nuptiality</b> was not driven uniformly across different social strata, but rather took the form of earlier and more universal marriage among men in the mid and upper social strata and among economically active women, while male unskilled workers and women outside the labor market did not participate in the <b>nuptiality</b> boom during the peak baby boom years and even showed some signs of decreased marriage probabilities compared to earlier cohorts. CONTRIBUTION The results indicate that sector-specific economic growth after the depression and the breakthrough of the Swedish welfare state benefitted couples who could aspire to a middle-class identity, and that pronatalist policies made female economic activity more compatible with marriage. The results show that the shift towards a positive female socio-economic gradient of marriage and family formation that can be observed in contemporary Sweden, had its beginnings already with the cohorts that participated in the mid-twentieth-century baby boom...|$|E

40|$|Marriage {{is central}} to {{understanding}} his-torical populations and the family. Not only is marriage the event in the human life cycle which precipitates family forma-tion, but also marriage patterns are the primary surface on which fertility levels are inscribed. Age at marriage and pro-portion married determine females ’ expo-sure to risk of pregnancy. Since Hajnal demonstrated the primacy of <b>nuptiality</b> patterns to demographic behavior in the West (1953), marriage has been central to definitions of the Western family (Hajnal, 1965; Laslett, 1977). Moreover, <b>nuptiality</b> patterns respond to economic and social change. In the past few years, this has been demonstrated by Braun’s (1978) and Levine’s (1977) studies of proletarianiza-tion and by studies linking such factors as occupation, sex ratios (Haines, 1979) and economic crises (Wrigley, 1971 : 158 - 161) to <b>nuptiality.</b> Changes in marriage age and proportion married also have been accepted as part of Europe’s demographic transition along with changes in fertility and mortality (Tilly and Scott, 1978 : 91 - 96). Marriage may also be central to un-derstanding the relatively low fertility and high mortality of the European city in history.
