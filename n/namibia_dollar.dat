50|$|The Namibian {{economy is}} {{closely linked to}} South Africa with the Namibian dollar pegged to the South African rand. Privatisation of several {{enterprises}} in coming years may stimulate long-run foreign investment, although with the trade union movement opposed, so far most politicians {{have been reluctant to}} advance the issue. In September 1993, Namibia introduced its own currency, the <b>Namibia</b> <b>Dollar</b> (N$), which is linked to the South African Rand at a fixed exchange rate of 1:1. There has been widespread acceptance of the <b>Namibia</b> <b>Dollar</b> throughout the country and, while Namibia remains a part of the Common Monetary Area, it now enjoys slightly more flexibility in monetary policy although interest rates have so far always moved very closely in line with the South African rates.|$|E
40|$|To assess Namibia's {{external}} competitiveness, {{this study}} estimates the country's equilibrium real exchange rate using the autoregressive distributed lag modelling approach that has superior small-sample properties. The nominal depreciation of the <b>Namibia</b> <b>dollar</b> in 2002 created historically {{one of the}} largest deviations in the real exchange rate from its equilibrium level, but deviations are small at present. The half-life of deviations from equilibrium is found to be about 1 year. Copyright (c) 2009 The Author. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Economic Society of South Africa. ...|$|E

50|$|The cross border money {{transfer}} {{facilities are}} limited to major bank in towns. The money transfer to countries outside of common monetary area is particularly very expensive because of high banks commission {{and one of the}} poorest currency buying & selling rates. The bank's commission is applicable to both inward and outward remittance. Cross border foreign currency bank cheque and bank draft have been abolished. SWIFT is the preferred method for cross border remittance by banks. Further, in an effort to curb money laundering and to protect the countryâ€™s foreign exchange reserves, exchange control regulation is applied to all outward remittances. An expatriate employee in Namibia is only allowed send a certain percentage of their net earning back to their home country. In terms of Exchange Control Regulations, every person who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of these Regulations shall be guilty of an offence and liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand <b>Namibia</b> <b>Dollars</b> (N$250 000) or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years (5) or both.|$|R
