After <b>necessary</b> <b>adjustments</b> on the <b>measuring</b> {{apparatus}} the dependence of the output data on {{the temperature of used}} sample was measured. The measuring apparatus was connected to computer with direct graphical output to the display. Model samples of alcohol, glucose, wort and glycerol with various concentrations were measured as well as few beer samples. The object of the work is to find out whether QCM method is applicable for determining the alcohol content and original gravity of beer and studying beer stability...|$|R
40|$|Ensuring the {{involvement}} of private sector creditors in the resolution of sovereign debt crises is crucial to ensure an effective management and orderly resolution of those crises. A review of experience gained in past financial crises suggests that crisis management practices have been largely following a case-by-case approach. This has led to some uncertainty about how the official sector addresses different types of crises, which in turn might partially account for the very mixed results achieved so far. From a global welfare perspective, the resolution of international financial crises is too costly and takes too long. Efforts to improve predictability of crisis resolution processes – through guiding debtor, creditor and official sector behaviour – could lower overall costs of such crises and bring about a better distribution of these costs. Past experience with such private sector involvement shows that, in certain cases, existing instruments have successfully contributed to minimising the economic disruptions caused by crises. However, the effective use of these instruments requires predictable and strong commitment of all parties involved. Key variables in that regard are the country’s economic fundamentals and its track record prior to the crisis, underscoring the importance of effective surveillance and crisis prevention. Success also hinges on the country’s resolve to implement <b>necessary</b> domestic <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures.</b> A transparent process providing for early dialogue between a debtor and its creditors also facilitates private sector involvement. Finally, the IMF {{plays a key role}} in crisis situations, as accurate and timely diagnosis by the IMF helps identify at an early stage the need for private sector involvement.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the nexus between {{climate change and}} trade governance from a normative perspective. Only little research {{attention has been paid}} to assessing the interactions between empirical and normative approaches to climate change in the context of potential trade measures. To this end, the paper focuses on currently discussed carbon border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures.</b> This paper assesses these trade measures from a normative perspective: it explores whether they are compatible or in conflict with development ethics on the one hand and with climate ethics on the other. The paper finds that border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> are both a threat to development as well as to a workable climate agreement. It argues that they are therefore both in conflict with development as well as climate ethics concerns. From a development ethics perspective, border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> are objectionable for two reasons. First, they hurt developing countries and above all the ones that are vulnerable in terms of relying only on few export goods. Second, border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> restrict market access for developing countries and thereby undermine the potential of trade to foster development. From a climate ethics perspective, border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> ar...|$|R
