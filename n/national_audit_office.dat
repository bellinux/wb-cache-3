40|$|This better {{practice}} guide {{replaces the}} Australian <b>National</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Office’s</b> earlier guide for public sector governance. This guide’s substantially revised content reinforces the fundamental elements required for good governance and builds {{on them to}} address contemporary governance issues and challenges. Foreword Effective governance can {{make a real difference}} to the performance of public sector entities and to the outcomes sought by government. This is a compelling reason for all public sector entities to periodically review and refine their approaches to governance. Reflecting the public sector environment, governance arrangements need to position entities to achieve the best results for the government and Australian community, consistent with legislative and policy requirements. At the same time, they must focus each public sector entity on its performance to encompass the efficient and effective delivery of its responsibilities in a sustainable manner. Achieving effective governance depends on developing and maintaining appropriate and accepted governance structures and frameworks; it also depends heavily on the application of appropriate governance choices and a commitment to making them work. It is the positive interaction between the ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ elements of governance—the structural and people elements—that leads to improved performance. In this respect, strong leadership is a critical driver for success; it can ensure appropriate governance arrangements are in place and foster ownership of the entity’s goals and strategies by its staff. This guide replaces the Australian <b>National</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Office’s</b> (ANAO’s) 2003 Public Sector Governance Better Practice Guide. Public sector governance has matured since the ANAO’s earlier guide; this guide’s substantially revised content reinforces the fundamental elements required for good governance and builds on them to address contemporary governance issues and challenges. In particular, greater attention is given in this guide to the importance of leadership, engaging in beneficial stakeholder relationships, and working collaboratively across entity, jurisdictional and sector boundaries to enhance policy outcomes. The guide emphasises the importance of a highly performing public sector, particularly in the light of fiscal constraints and public expectations for continuous improvements to public sector services, more transparent processes and increasing levels of engagement with citizens and other stakeholders. The release of the revised guide has been timed to align with the implementation of the substantive provisions of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) in 2014 – 15...|$|R

40|$|Two {{overwhelmingly}} important {{drivers for}} the need for mentoring are mental wellbeing, and unemployment. Regarding the former, {{a number of studies}} now show that adults on the autism spectrum have relatively high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality. This {{is likely to be a}} result of feeling isolated and excluded in society. Regarding the latter, the <b>National</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Office’s</b> 2009 report Supporting People with Autism through Adulthood highlighted that only 12 % of respondents of the NAO survey were in full-time paid employment; and 70 % identified mental health problems. These figures are also supported elsewhere, although they are likely to underestimate the numbers of non-identified people on the autism spectrum in employment. The motivation behind the present mentoring study was to evaluate if mentoring might serve as an effective intervention to promote mental wellbeing and greater levels of employment in adults on the autism spectrum. Given resources, the present study could not be designed as a large scale quantitative randomised control trial.

40|$|In <b>National</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Offices</b> (NAOs), {{impact is}} often used {{as a measure of}} success, serving to build legitimacy. When aiming to {{maximize}} impact, the media tends to play an important role. Based on empirical observations from the Swedish NAO, this paper explores how the role of the media for a NAO can be understood, and how this may affect independence. It is suggested that impact can be understood either as the media coverage of an audit (media impact), or the measures that an audit result in (measure impact). Two interpretations of the media are discussed: (i) Media as an information channel, and (ii) media as a means of bringing pressure to bear among audit objects and members of Parliament. In the Swedish NAO, the Auditor-Generals strived to maximize media impact, in order to gain measure impact, partly because a response to audits was not compulsory. Auditors in the Swedish NAO requested that the media should be understood rather as an information channel, and that impact should not be seen as an important measure, in accordance with the Constitutional school. Implications for independence are discussed. In the Swedish NAO, auditors witnessed about an excessive focus on problems and sensational conclusions, and on producing non-contestable results, following a strong media orientation. It is concluded that the price of media impact is independence, in the Swedish case...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, the European Court of Auditors has placed {{increasing}} importance on the production of “special reports” examining the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of EU spending (the three “E”s). This institutional focus on performance audit, alongside traditional financial and compliance audit, has occurred {{at a time when}} the European Union is increasingly evaluating its own policies and programmes, under political pressure to demonstrate their added value. With performance audit, the EU’s external auditors make value judgements on what was achieved through the EU budget, arguably bringing a greater political dimension to the Court as it works to deliver conclusions and recommendations meant to assist the legislature (European Parliament) in carrying out its scrutiny role and the executive (European Commission) in shaping better future policy. This raises questions about how financial accountability is interpreted, and whether it depends on the quality of audit reports or on the forums to which they are delivered, and subsequently, how they act upon them. This article analyses the factors that explain the increased use of special reports by the Court, questioning if they resemble evaluation studies. It examines their focus and impact, as well as the institutional challenges implicit in performance audit. I. Introduction As the external auditor of the EU, in theory the Court works in cooperation with other multi-level institutions, committees and individual experts, including <b>national</b> <b>audit</b> <b>offices</b> at member state level (“supreme audit institutions”).

With a total cost of £696,000, the difference was covered from the 2009–2010 series budget for EastEnders. When repeats and omnibus editions are shown, the BBC pays additional fees to cast and scriptwriters and incurs additional editing costs, which in the period 2009–2010, amounted to £5.5million.

It also commented that the traffic forecasts during planning were incorrect. The original plans showed an economic benefit of SEK4 billion. However, because A-Train is free to set its ticket prices as it wishes, the high prices resulted in too few passengers taking the Arlanda Line for it to be of economic benefit to the Swedish community, and the line failed to maximise its economic impact through reduced road congestion and emissions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{originates}} {{from the}} <b>National</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Office's</b> 2008 report into widening participation {{policy in the}} United Kingdom. The report found that while {{there appeared to be}} modest improvements in the proportion of students coming from lower socio‐economic groups over the last ten years, reliable analysis was hampered by a high proportion of missing data. In the 2007 / 08 academic year, the proportion of entrants whose socio‐economic status was defined as ‘unknown’ was 26 %, up from just 10 % a decade earlier. This paper uses a random sample of 1000 such students, aged 18 or 19 on entry, to investigate why they have been designated as ‘unknown’ and what other information can be gleaned from their university application form. It was found that 46 % of the sample could in fact be coded to a specific socio‐economic grouping from the parental information provided by the student and it was difficult to see why this had not happened. The social profile of these students was comparable to the national picture. A further 23 % provided information which was too vague to be coded. The focus of the paper, however, was the 32 % of students who either did not provide parental information or who stated that their parents were not working. These students were strongly and disproportionately drawn from areas of high deprivation and low participation in higher education; the precise target of widening participation initiatives, yet they are effectively not acknowledged. This finding causes difficulties for the reliability of official statistics on social class...|$|R

40|$|Audit Committees have an {{important}} role in the governance framework of entities by providing an independent source of assurance and advice to Chief Executives/Boards. A distinguishing feature of an Audit Committee within an entity’s governance framework is its independence and objectivity, as Audit Committees do not undertake management responsibilities and are not a substitute for entity management controls and accountabilities. The aim of the Guide is to provide guidance on the operation of the Audit Committees of public sector entities operating under both the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The Guide updates and replaces the Australian <b>National</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Office’s</b> (ANAO) 2005 Public Sector Audit Committees Better Practice Guide. The Guide is intended as a reference document for Chief Executives, Boards, members of Audit Committees and senior managers with responsibility for Audit Committee activities, and complements the ANAO’s Better Practice Guide Public Sector Internal Audit issued in September 2007.

40|$|In {{the near}} future {{perinatal}} audit will start in the Netherlands, with a systematic critical analysis {{of the quality of}} care of perinatal mortality. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment designed a plan for the implementation of perinatal audit. The slower decline of perinatal mortality in the Netherlands in comparison to surrounding countries gave cause to this plan. There are suggestions that improvement of (preventive) care can lead to perinatal health gains. Perinatal audit is one of the important instruments for the improvement of the quality of care. The proposed strategy is basically a two tier system: cyclic regional (internal) audits and an annual <b>national</b> (external) <b>audit.</b> The regional audit is performed by professionals involved in the provision of the care which is being assessed and who can prompt improvements in regional service delivery. The <b>national</b> <b>audit,</b> performed by a national panel of professionals and experts, will focus on special issues or subgroups of perinatal mortality. The <b>national</b> <b>audit</b> may lead to recommendations on development or adjustment of guidelines or to a recommendation for better implementation of clinical standards, training and education or policy changes. Implementation of audit is facilitated by some key factors. They include a complete data collection of obstetric/neonatal care and outcome; modern information technology to improve the links between routine data collection and the audit; and mechanisms to ensure data protection, confidentiality and blame free reporting.
