As Caxton Foster once said of associative memory, <b>nanocomputers</b> would seem to hold out the promise of sugar tomorrow to people drowing in honey today.

Unable {{to find a job}} outside of manual labor, he accidentally kills two teenagers and wounds two more when they swerve towards him in a car and his combat reflexes kick in, his <b>nanocomputer</b> interpreting his situation in a military context. Following this, the human leader sends the Cobras to colonize a solar system {{on the other side of}} Troft Space, with the Trofts grudgingly allowing the humans passage through a narrow corridor through their territory.

However, most of the cybernetics are permanent, allowing Zahn to examine the position these individuals might fill in a society during peace-time. Their weaponry includes small lasers implanted in the little finger of each hand, an anti-armor laser that runs down the calf muscle of one leg and exits through a lens in the heel of their boot, plus an [...] "arcthrower", a secondary weapon built into the fingertip lasers that delivers a high-voltage pulse, which disrupts nearby electronics. In addition, they are armed with a sonic weapon, which can produce sound at frequencies capable of shattering most objects. All of their weaponry is controlled by a [...] "nanocomputer" [...] that is implanted inside their skull. This computer also helps run the visual and auditory enhancers, targeting computer, automated reflexes, etc. Modifications include ceramic laminae over all of their bones (essentially rendering them unbreakable), as well as servomotors at the major joints, which augment strength and speed.

The area of special-purpose nanoelectronics {{has not been}} given much con-sideration previously, though much effort {{has been devoted to}} the development of general-purpose nanoelectronic systems, i. e., <b>nanocomputers.</b> This paper demonstrates via simulation that the nanodevices and nanofabrication techniques developed re-cently for general-purpose <b>nanocomputers</b> also might be applied with substantial benefit to implement less complex nanocircuits targeted at specific applications. Nanocircuits considered here are a digital controller for the leg motion on an autonomous millimeter-scale robot and an analog nanocircuit for amplification of signals in a tiny optoelectronic sensor or receiver. Simulations of both nanocircuit designs show significant improvement over microelectronic designs in metrics such as footprint area and power consumption. These improvements are obtained from de-signs employing nanodevices and nanofabrication techniques that already have been demonstrated experimentally. Thus, the results presented here suggest that such improvements might be realized in the near term for important, special-purpose applications.

40|$|The sine {{waveguide}} {{slow-wave structure}} is a promising interaction circuit for traveling-wave tubes in the terahertz region because it possesses advantageous properties {{such as high}} transmission, easy fabrication, and elimination of the electron beam tunnel. These waveguides could be fabricated by <b>nanocomputer</b> numerical control (CNC) machining, a fabrication method capable of fabricating microscale components. In our study, we evaluate the practical feasibility of manufacturing 300 -GHz sine waveguides with the ideal design, using nano-CNC machining. It is found that the ideal sine waveguide circuit must be modified, because of the limitations imposed by the actual tool size of the nano-CNC machine. Simulations of cold- and hot-tests of the circuit&# 8212;including the electron beam effect&# 8212;were conducted for both the ideal and the modified sine waveguide circuits.

40|$|In {{recent years}} and after {{molecular}} manufacturing {{in the sense of}} nanoscale building blocks, nanotechnology faced a more complex challenge in building bionanoelectronics and molecular machine. Indeed, one important challenge that has become evident in nanotechnology industrial applications is the automation of atomic-scale manipulation. The starting point of nanotechnology to achieve the main goal of building systems at nanoscale is the development of control automation for molecular machine systems. Nanorobotics encompass the design, fabrication and programming of robots with overall dimensions below a few micrometers, and programmable assembly of nanoscale objects. Thus, nanorobotics is concerned with: 1. 	Design and fabrication of nanorobots with overall dimensions at or below the micrometer range and made of nanoscopic components. 2. 	Programming and coordination of large numbers of such nanorobots (swarms). 3. 	Programmable assembly of nanometer scale components either by manipulation with macro or micro devices, or by self-assembly on programmed templates or scaffolds. Therefore, nanorobots require some type of guidance and control to perform their tasks. Nanorobots could either be remotely controlled by a computer or autonomous. It is noted that autonomous robots would require a <b>nanocomputer.</b> This paper describes some different methods proposed recently how to control nanorobots and how to provide speed and energy for motion and activity...|$|E
40|$|Beyond CMOS, new {{technologies}} are emerging to extend electronic systems with features unavailable to silicon-based devices. Emerging technologies provide new logic and interconnection structures for computation, storage and communication that may require new design paradigms, and therefore trigger {{the development of}} a new generation of design automation tools. In the last decade, several emerging technologies have been proposed and the time has come for studying new ad-hoc techniques and tools for logic synthesis, physical design and testing. The main goal of this project is developing a complete synthesis and optimization methodology for switching nano-crossbar arrays that leads to the design and construction of an emerging <b>nanocomputer.</b> New models for diode, FET, and four-terminal switch based nanoarrays are developed. The proposed methodology implements both arithmetic and memory elements, necessitated by achieving a computer, by considering performance parameters such as area, delay, power dissipation, and reliability. With combination of arithmetic and memory elements a synchronous state machine (SSM), representation of a computer, is realized. The proposed methodology targets variety of emerging technologies including nanowire/nanotube crossbar arrays, magnetic switch-based structures, and crossbar memories. The results of this project will be a foundation of nano-crossbar based circuit design techniques and greatly contribute to the construction of emerging computers beyond CMOS.

40|$|Nanotechnology {{promises}} a natural method {{to accelerate the}} complex task of innovation for many design problems by exploiting self-assembly and quantum processing at extreme scales of miniaturization. With this objective, a range of hybrid computer devices that use biological cells or chemical thin-films have been built {{to take advantage of}} nanoscale information processing. These devices are termed molecular computers and function by manipulating input sets of digital schematics or images stored to Compact Disc optical media. Light transmission through cells or chemical thin-films is a highly nonlinear phenomenon, and causes digital information to replicate with itself. This means that well-defined input sets evolve into entirely new sets through mutation, crossover and natural selection at the atomic level. Each <b>nanocomputer</b> (whether constructed with biological cells or chemical thin-films) is therefore a computationally intensive, yet high-speed, controlled chaotic feedback system, used to deconstruct, then reconstruct form. Methods for generic device construction have been previously reported, so here we focus on the implementation details for approximating several simple design models; before moving on to demonstrate the method against three-dimensional forms such as furniture. Several questions underpinning the formal nature of the design process have been identified in these experiments. For example, what would happen if a designer could access a near-infinite number of different design variations? How does the designer make choices under these conditions? Are pragmatic attributes of concept development such as ergonomic considerations, manufacturing capabilities and material selection marginalized? If so, how does a designer usefully employ this process...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Programmable logic arrays (PLA) {{constitute}} a promising architecture for developing increasingly complex and functional circuits through <b>nanocomputers</b> from nanoscale building blocks. Here we report a novel one-dimensional PLA element that incorporates resistive switch gate structures on a semiconductor nanowire {{and show that}} multiple elements can be integrated to realize functional PLAs. In our PLA element, the gate coupling to the nanowire transistor can be modulated by the memory state of the resistive switch to yield programmable active (transistor) or inactive (resistor) states within a well-defined logic window. Multiple PLA nanowire elements were integrated and programmed to yield a working 2 -to- 4 demultiplexer with long-term retention. The well-defined, controllable logic window and long-term retention of our new one-dimensional PLA element provide a promising route for building increasingly complex circuits with nanoscale building blocks...|$|R
50|$|Nanoparticles {{have the}} ability to {{assemble}} chemically through covalent or noncovalent interactions with their capping ligand. The terminal functional group(s) on the particle are known as capping ligands. As these ligands tend to be complex and sophisticated, self-assembly can provide a simpler pathway for nanoparticle organization by synthesizing efficient functional groups. For instance, DNA oligomers have been a key ligand for nanoparticle building blocks to be self-assembling via sequence-based specific organization.However, to deliver precise and scalable (programmable) assembly for a desired structure, a careful positioning of ligand molecules onto the nanoparticle counterpart should be required at the building block (precursor) level, such as direction, geometry, morphology, affinity, etc.The successful design of ligand-building block units can play an essential role in manufacturing a wide-range of new nano systems, such as nanosensor systems,nanomachines/nanobots, <b>nanocomputers,</b> and many more uncharted systems.|$|R

The compiled program would then run on the generated computer. Inspired by research in design space exploration, this compilation approach exploits the proposed capabilities of <b>nanocomputers,</b> which are in the class of reconfigurable parallel architectures.
