5|$|Having secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made {{preparations}} {{to return}} to New York. They were delayed by Ethel's insistence on acquiring suitable new clothes and by Wodehouse's wish to finish writing his current novel, The Mating Season, in {{the peace of the}} French countryside. In April 1947 they sailed to New York, where Wodehouse was relieved at the friendly reception he received from the large press contingent awaiting his arrival. Ethel secured a comfortable penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side, but Wodehouse was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> ease. The New York that he had known before the war was much changed. The magazines that had paid lavishly for his stories were in decline, and those that remained were not much interested in him. He was sounded out about writing for Broadway, but he was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home in the post-war theatre; he had money problems, with large sums temporarily tied up in Britain, {{and for the first time}} in his career he had no ideas for a new novel. He did not complete one until 1951.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but <b>not</b> <b>at</b> 30°C.|$|E
