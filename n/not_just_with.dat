5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} {{mothers with}} young cubs, are highly vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large carnivores who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to sturdier carnivores such as lions, leopards, spotted and brown hyenas, and wild dogs. Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time. In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>with</b> those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other carnivores, such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|E

The transmissions included both Ford and Borg-Warner, as did rear axles. The XY is now widely regarded as the best Falcon made in Australia, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>with</b> its Bathurst dominance, but also in its performance, build quality, and refinement, which was superior to competitors at the time.

25|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, theatres re-opened. Early {{interpretations of the}} play, from the late 17th to early 18th century, typically showed Prince Hamlet as a heroic figure. Critics responded to Hamlet {{in terms of the}} same dichotomy that shaped all responses to Shakespeare during the period. On the one hand, Shakespeare was seen as primitive and untutored, both in comparison to later English dramatists such as Fletcher and especially when measured against the neoclassical ideals of art brought back from France with the Restoration. On the other, Shakespeare remained popular <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>with</b> mass audiences but even with the very critics made uncomfortable by his ignorance of Aristotle's unities and decorum.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II adds another layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used to pay for all forms of production. In order to produce one unit of product, be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations of a Billion Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>with</b> the maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually go broke. This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E

500|$|In November 1862, President Lincoln gave Banks {{command of}} the Army of the Gulf, {{and asked him to}} {{organize}} a force of 30,000 new recruits, drawn from New York and New England. As a former governor of Massachusetts, he was politically connected to the governors of these states, and the recruitment effort was successful. In December he sailed from New York with a large force of raw recruits to replace Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler at New Orleans, Louisiana, as commander of the Department of the Gulf. [...] Butler disliked Banks, but welcomed him to New Orleans and briefed him on civil and military affairs of importance. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, doubted the wisdom of replacing Butler (also a political general, and later a Massachusetts governor) with Banks, who he thought was a less able leader and administrator. [...] Banks had to contend <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>with</b> Southern opposition to the occupation of New Orleans, but also to politically hostile Radical Republicans both in the city and in Washington, who criticized his moderate approach to administration.|$|E

[...] She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where [...] "fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to" [...] and Agent Carters [...] "status as a period piece—which may have harmed it on broadcast—could be a real draw for Netflix viewers". Ryan also felt Marvel [...] "could copy what CBS is [...] " [...] by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows [...] "as well as premium exclusives like a third season of Agent Carter". Ryan concluded, [...] "A third Agent Carter season could help solidify Marvel's standing <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>with</b> female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling." ...|$|E

[...] After several months, the two returned to Paris, supporting themselves with photojournalism and occasional portraits. [...] Namuth and Reisner were sent to cover the Workers' Olympiad in July 1936 by French magazine Vu, which put them in Barcelona during the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War. [...] Over the next nine months, the two photographed the war, providing photos to European publications. [...] Namuth and Reisner returned to Paris in 1937 and continued their careers as photographers until 1939. [...] While in Paris, Namuth studied with Joseph Breitenbach, who taught him {{the technical aspects of}} photography. [...] After increased tension and hostilities between France and Germany, Namuth and his fellow German expatriates were interned, though Namuth joined the French Foreign Legion to avoid his confinement. [...] After being discharged in 1940, Namuth fled to Marseilles and escaped to the United States with the help of journalist Varian Fry and his Emergency Rescue Committee. [...] He arrived in New York City in 1941 and planned to join the Office of Strategic Services in 1943 out of a desire [...] "to do something about everything". [...] However, he {{had fallen in love with}} French-born Guatemalan Carmen Herrera and delayed his enlistment until he was drafted for World War II in December 1943. [...] After completing basic training, Namuth joined the intelligence services and worked as an interrogator and interpreter in England, France, and Czechoslovakia.
