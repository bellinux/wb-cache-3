5|$|Some of Van Rensselaer's {{success as}} a jewel {{merchant}} came about due to trade {{made possible by the}} Dutch East India Company. The practical spirit of the Dutch merchant could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> to recognize that the way to riches was through trade with the West Indies and Africa. During the Twelve Years' Truce, Dutch merchants had sailed unmolested to the West Indies but also received no letters of marque to take prizes from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period {{he worked as a}} pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> for being so far behind.|$|E

5|$|Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted {{reassurance}} {{that the character}} would <b>not</b> <b>fail.</b> The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{branches}} of other noble families (from {{all around the}} Swedish realm) settled in Finland, mostly due to an office gained by the newcomer nobleman. These were generally of poorer families or branches, because most noblemen pursued towards positions in Stockholm, and the most resourceful generally did <b>not</b> <b>fail.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{intelligence}} could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> {{to create}} alarm {{in the mind}} of Napoleon, who concluded that the corps in question had been detached against his rear, as a diversion in favour of Blücher, from the Wellington's Anglo-allied, who had probably obtained some signal triumph over Ney. Another officer arrived from Vandamme, reiterating the account previously given.|$|E

While he inveighs against Catiline's depraved character and vicious actions, he does <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> to state that the man had many noble traits, indeed all that a Roman man needed to succeed. In particular, Sallust shows Catiline as deeply courageous in his final battle.|$|E
25|$|Pallis studied music under Arnold Dolmetsch, the {{distinguished}} reviver of early English music, composer, and performer, {{and was considered}} “one of Dolmetsch's most devoted protégés”. Pallis soon discovered a love of early music—in particular chamber music of {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries—and for the viola da gamba. Even while climbing in the region of the Satlej-Ganges watershed, he and his musically-minded friends did <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> to bring their instruments.|$|E

The fastest laptime set by a driver in either session {{was used to determine}} grid placings. There were 26 starting positions available for the race, and the qualifying sessions would normally be used to decide which drivers would miss out, but with the cars from Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo not taking part, the remaining 22 drivers could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> to qualify for the race.|$|E

The souls of the tortured dead cry out for justice, the cry of the living is for freedom. We can create that justice and we can deliver that freedom. The animals have no one but us. We will <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> them.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure {{it is just as}} much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering. Reliability {{engineering is}} always a critical component of safety engineering, as in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and hazard fault tree analysis, and of security engineering.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to passenger transport, wood from Enebakk was carried overland to Ljan and then freighted by rail to the city. Next door was a coaching inn {{which had a}} restaurant. The train station's spelling was changed from Lian to Ljan on April 1894. From 1895 some of the trains were extended to Kullebunden (later renamed Kolbotn Station). Ljan {{was one of the}} first Norwegian stations to receive an interlocking system, on 1 January 1901. This was a limited system which was <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> proof, so the operation had to manually control that they did not place the switches in a conflicting manner.|$|E
25|$|This view of {{software}} quality on a linear continuum {{has to be}} supplemented by the identification of discrete Critical Programming Errors. These vulnerabilities may <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> a test case, {{but they are the}} result of bad practices that under specific circumstances can lead to catastrophic outages, performance degradations, security breaches, corrupted data, and myriad other problems (Nygard, 2007) that make a given system de facto unsuitable for use regardless of its rating based on aggregated measurements. A well-known example of vulnerability is the Common Weakness Enumeration, a repository of vulnerabilities in the source code that make applications exposed to security breaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue was}} {{contrived}} that the Protestant party (Du Plessis Mornay) could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> to lose. By concurring with this decision, Casaubon confirmed the Protestants' suspicions that, like {{his friend and}} patron, Philippe Canaye, he was contemplating abjuration. From then on, he became {{the object of the}} hopes and fears of the two religions; the Catholics lavishing promises and plying him with arguments; the Protestant ministers insinuating that he was preparing to forsake a losing cause, and only haggling about his price. Neither side could understand that Casaubon's reading of the church fathers led him to adopt an intermediate position between Genevan Calvinism and Ultramontanism.|$|E
