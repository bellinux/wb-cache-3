40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} advanced space propulsion concepts and their research activities {{at the beginning of}} the 2 lSt Century.

40|$|The NASA Advanced Propulsion Concepts (APC) {{program at}} the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) {{consists}} of two main areas: The first involves cooperative modeling and research activities between JPL and various universities and industry; the second involves research at universities and industry that is directly supported by JPL. The cooperative research program consists of mission studies, {{research and development of}} ion engine technology using C- 60 (Buckminsterfullerene) propellant, and research and development of lithium-propellant Lorentz-force accelerator (LFA) engine technology. The university/industry- supported research includes research (modeling and proof-of-concept experiments) in advanced, long-life electric propulsion, and in fusion propulsion. These propulsion concepts were selected primarily to cover a range of applications from near-term to far-term missions. For example, the long-lived pulsed-xenon thruster research that JPL is supporting at Princeton University addresses the near-term need for efficient, long-life attitude control and station-keeping propulsion for Earth-orbiting spacecraft. The C- 60 -propellant ion engine has the potential for good efficiency in a relatively low specific impulse (Isp) range (10, 000 - 30, 000 m/s) that is optimum for relatively fast (less than 100 day) cis-lunar (LEO/GEO/Lunar) missions employing near-term, high-specific mass electric propulsion vehicles. Research and modeling on the C- 60 -ion engine are currently being performed by JPL (engine demonstration), Caltech (C- 60 properties), MIT (plume modeling), and USC (diagnostics). The Li-propellant LFA engine also has good efficiency in the modest Isp range (40, 000 - 50, 000 m/s) that is optimum for near-to-mid-term megawatt-class solar- and <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> vehicles used for Mars missions transporting cargo (in support of a piloted mission). Research and modeling on the Li-LFA engine are currently being performed by JPL (cathode development), Moscow Aviation Institute (engine testing), Thermacore (electrode development), as well as at MIT (plume modeling), and USC (diagnostics). Also, the mission performance of a <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> (NEP) Li-LFA Mars cargo vehicle is being modeled by JPL (mission analysis; thruster and power processor modeling) and the Rocketdyne Energy Technology and Engineering Center (ETEC) (power system modeling). Finally, the fusion propulsion research activities that JPL is supporting at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and at Lawrenceville Plasma Physics (LPP) are aimed at far-term fast (less than 100 day round trip) piloted Mars missions and, in the very far term, interstellar missions...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a recent, renewed {{interest}} in high-power electric thrusters for application in <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems. Two {{of the most promising}} thrusters utilize liquid metal propellants: the lithium-fed magnetoplasmadynamic thruster and the bismuth-fed Hall thruster. An important element of part of the maturation of these thrusters will be the development of compact, reliable conductive-propellant feed system components. In the present paper we provide design considerations and experimental calibration data for electromagnetic (EM) pumps. The role of an electromagnetic pump in a liquid metal feed system is to establish a pressure gradient between the propellant reservoir and the thruster - to establish the requisite mass flow rate. While EM pumps have previously been used to a limited extent in nuclear reactor cooling loops, they have never been implemented in electric propulsion (EP) systems. The potential benefit of using EM pumps for EP are reliability (no moving parts) and the ability to precisely meter the propellant flow rate. We have constructed and tested EM pumps that use gallium, lithium, and bismuth propellants. Design details, test results (pressure developed versus current), and material compatibility issues are reported. It is concluded that EM pumps are a viable technology for application in both laboratory and flight EP conductive-propellant feed systems...|$|E
40|$|Continuing {{pressures}} for higher performance and efficiency in propulsion are driving ever more demanding needs for high-temperature materials. Some immediate applications in spaceflight include combustion chambers for advanced chemical rockets and turbomachinery for jet engines and power conversion in <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion.</b> In {{the case of}} rockets, the combination of high stresses and high temperatures make the characterization of creep properties very important. Creep {{is even more important}} in the turbomachinery, where a long service life is an additional constraint. Some very high-temperature materials are being developed, including platinum group metals, carbides, borides, and silicides. But the measurement of creep properties at very high temperatures is itself problematic, because the testing instrument must operate at such high temperatures. Conventional techniques are limited to about 1700 C. A new, containerless technique for measuring creep deformation has been developed. This technique is based on electrostatic levitation (ESL) of a spherical sample, which is heated to the measurement temperature and rotated at a rate such that the centrifugal acceleration causes creep deformation. Creep of samples has been demonstrated at up to 2300 C in the ESL facility at NASA MSFC, while ESL itself has been applied at over 3000 C, and has no theoretical maximum temperature. The preliminary results and future directions of this NASA-funded research collaboration will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The Asteroid Tugboat (AT) is a fully {{controlled}} asteroid deflection concept using {{a robotic}} spacecraft {{powered by a}} high efficiency, electric propulsion system (ion or plasma) which docks with and attaches to the asteroid, conducts preliminary operations, and then thrusts continuously parallel to the asteroid velocity vector until the desired velocity change is achieved. Based on early warning, provided by ground tracking and orbit prediction, it would be deployed {{a decade or more}} prior to a potential impact. On completion of the initial rendezvous with the near-Earth object (NEO) the AT would first reduce the uncertainty in the orbit of the asteroid via Earth tracking of its radio transponder while it is station keeping with the asteroid. If on analysis of tracking data a deflection is required the AT would execute a reconnaissance phase collecting and processing information about the physical characteristics of the asteroid to support subsequent operations. The AT would then dock at the appropriate pole (i. e. on the spin axis), attach to the asteroid surface, and initiate a NEO reorientation maneuver. Following completion of the NEO reorientation the AT would initiate the deflection phase by thrusting continuously parallel to the asteroid velocity vector until the resultant target orbit is achieved. The orbit of the asteroid is continuously monitored throughout the deflection process and the end state is known in real time. If one assumes a <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> (NEP) system similar to that formerly under development in the recently canceled Prometheus Program, the AT would be capable of deflecting threatening NEOs up to 800 meters in diameter or more.

40|$|Advanced {{high-power}} {{electric propulsion}} systems can significantly enhance piloted Mars missions. An {{increase in the}} science payload delivered to Mars and {{the reduction of the}} total Earth-departure mass are the major system-level benefits of electric propulsion. Other potential benefits are the return of the cargo vehicle to Earth orbit and the availability of high power in Mars orbit for high-power science and communications. Parametric analyses for sizing the cargo mission vehicle for Mars exploration missions are presented. The <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> system thruster size, power level, mass, propellant type and payload mass capability are considered in these system-level trade studies. Descriptions of the propulsion system selection issues for both ion and MPD thruster technologies are also discussed. On a manned Mars mission, the total launch mass for an unmanned cargo vehicle in low earth orbit (LEO) can be reduced by up to 50 percent over the baseline oxygen/hydrogen propulsion system. Because the cargo vehicle is sent to Mars prior to the manned mission, the trip time for the vehicle is not a critical factor. By taking advantage of the high specific impulse (I sub sp) of an ion or a Magneto-Plasma-Dynamic (MPD) thruster system, the total LEO mass is reduced from 590, 000 kg for the oxygen/hydrogen propulsion system to 309, 000 kg for the MPD system and 295, 000 kg for the ion system. Many factors must be analyzed in the design of a electric propulsion Mars cargo vehicle. The propellant selection, the number of thrusters, the power level and the specific impulse are among the most important of the parameters. To fully address the electric propulsion system design, trade studies for the differing ion and MPD propulsion system configurations (thruster power levels, number of thrusters, propellants and power systems) must be conducted...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} released policy directive, "A Renewed Spirit of Discovery: The President's Vision for U. S. Space Exploration," seeks {{to advance the}} U. S. scientific, security and economic interest through a program of space exploration which will robotically explore {{the solar system and}} extend human presence to the Moon, Mars and beyond. NASA's implementation of this vision will be guided by compelling questions of scientific and societal importance, including the origin of our Solar System and the search for life beyond Earth. The Exploration Roadmap identifies four key targets: the Moon, Mars, the outer Solar System, and extra-solar planets. First, a lunar investigation will set up exploration test beds, search for resources, and study the geological record of the early Solar System. Human missions to the Moon will serve as precursors for human missions to Mars and other destinations, but will also be driven by their support for furthering science. The second key target is the search for past and present water and life on Mars. Following on from discoveries by Spirit and Opportunity, {{by the end of the}} decade there will have been an additional rover, a lander and two orbiters studying Mars. These will set the stage for a sample return mission in 2013, increasingly complex robotic investigations, and an eventual human landing. The third key target is the study of underground oceans, biological chemistry, and their potential for life in the outer Solar System. Beginning with the arrival of Cassini at Saturn in July 2004 and a landing on Titan in 2006, the next decade will see an extended investigation of the Jupiter icy moons by a mission making use of Project Prometheus, a program to develop space nuclear power and <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion.</b> Finally, the search for Earth-like planets and life includes a series of telescopic missions designed to find and characterize extra-solar planets and search them for evidence of life.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center was {{the major}} {{contributor}} of 2 -kW-class ion thruster technology to the Deep Space 1 mission, which was successfully completed in early 2002. Recently, NASA s Office of Space Science awarded approximately $ 21 million to Glenn to develop higher power xenon ion propulsion systems for large flagship missions such as outer planet explorers and sample return missions. The project, referred to as NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT), is a logical follow-on to the ion propulsion system demonstrated on Deep Space 1. The propulsion system power level for NEXT {{is expected to be}} as high as 25 kW, incorporating multiple ion thrusters, each capable of being throttled over a 1 - to 6 -kW power range. To date, engineering model thrusters have been developed, and performance and plume diagnostics are now being documented. The project team-Glenn, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, General Dynamics, Boeing Electron Dynamic Devices, the Applied Physics Laboratory, the University of Michigan, and Colorado State University-is {{in the process of developing}} hardware for a ground demonstration of the NEXT propulsion system, which comprises a xenon feed system, controllers, multiple thrusters, and power processors. The development program also will include life assessments by tests and analyses, single-string tests of ion thrusters and power systems, and finally, multistring thruster system tests in calendar year 2005. In addition, NASA's Office of Space Science selected Glenn to lead the development of a 25 -kW xenon thruster to enable NASA to conduct future missions to the outer planets of Jupiter and beyond, under the High Power Electric Propulsion (HiPEP) program. The development of a 100 -kW-class ion propulsion system and power conversion systems are critical components to enable future <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems. In fiscal year 2003, a team composed of Glenn, the Boeing Company, General Dynamics, the Applied Physics Laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Michigan, and Colorado State University will perform a 6 -month study that will result in the design of a 25 -kW ion thruster, a propellant feed system, and a power processing architecture. The following 2 years will involve hardware development, wear tests, single-string tests of the thruster-power circuits and the xenon feed system, and subsystem service life analyses. The 2 -kW-class ion propulsion technology developed for the Deep Space 1 mission will be used for NASA's discovery mission Dawn, which involves maneuvering a spacecraft to survey the asteroids Ceres and Vesta. The 6 -kW-class ion thruster subsystem technology under NEXT is scheduled to be flight ready by calendar year 2006. The less mature 25 - kW ion thruster system under HiPEP is expected to be ready for a flight advanced development program in calendar year 2006...|$|E
40|$|Radioisotope heat {{sources and}} power systems, {{traditionally}} fuelled by 238 Pu, {{have been developed}} and used for spacecraft thermal management and to provide electrical power during many deep space and planetary science missions. The use of fission reactors in space, however, has been limited to high power applications in Earth orbit. Previous ground based research programs conducted by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission demonstrated the principal of nuclear thermal rocket propulsion but to date, flight heritage of nuclear propulsion has been limited to <b>nuclear-electric</b> <b>propulsion.</b> The development of space nuclear systems and tributary components {{that are capable of}} meeting the rigors of space flight is of paramount importance. Performance, lifetime and operational safety under all foreseeable conditions are essential considerations that must be made. The selection of appropriate materials and environmental compatibility is vital to the success of any given design. The ability for radioisotope heat sources to survive the extreme temperatures and mechanical loads associated with launch related accidents, is both legally mandated and necessary for the protection of life and the Earth’s environment. Nuclear fuels for fission systems must provide equal protection during accidents while the integral design ensures that a reactor remains in a safe configuration. A historical overview of nuclear systems for space is presented. Traditional and modern system designs and fabrication techniques are discussed. Applicable solid state and mechanical power conversion methods are described and their performances are evaluated. Consideration is made for the effect of radioisotope selection and heat source encapsulation architecture upon radiation safety. The identification of 241 Am as an alternative isotope fuel is made. Other candidate isotopes such as 210 Po, 242 Cm and 244 Cm are assessed. The development of encapsulation methods that are resistant to the extraction and dispersion of the radioactive materials enclosed is increasingly attractive for security reasons. Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) processes are presented as novel, simple and rapid techniques for the encapsulation of radioisotopic materials within tungsten ceramic-metallic or cermet matrices. Computational modelling via Monte-Carlo simulation has shown that the encapsulation of radioisotopes within heterogeneous tungsten cermet matrices may reduce the neutron, X-ray and Gamma-ray radiation dose delivered to the localised environment. The prevention of fabrication related volatilisation of radioisotopic compounds is fundamental {{to the success of the}} encapsulation process. SPS is empirically demonstrated via the use of CeO 2 as an inert simulant for radioisotopic compounds such as PuO 2, AmO 2 and UO 2. The chemical compatibility of americium oxides within a tungsten matrix is also demonstrated through pressureless sintering within a Differential Scanning Calorimetric furnace. The techniques developed for radioisotope encapsulation are also demonstrated in context of cermet fuel fabrication for high temperature space power and propulsion reactor systems. The use of tungsten cermet fuels may eliminate material incompatibilities and failures experienced by historical nuclear thermal propulsion programs. Finally, three novel concept applications of nuclear energy as an enabling technology for planetary exploration are presented. Melt penetration of icy surfaces and long range mobility on planetary surfaces is proposed via the use of pulsed high power heat capacitive radioisotope sources. In-situ resource utilization is considered for propellant production. The use of CO 2 is proposed as a propellant for a radioisotope thermal rocket in the context of a ‘Mars Hopper’. A CO 2 propellant is also considered in the context of a high temperature (3000 °C) nuclear thermal propulsion system for a single stage surface ascent vehicle under a Mars sample return mission.
