40|$|New {{combustion}} {{sources are}} experiencing a seemingly never ending lowering of permit limits for NOx and CO emissions. The new NOx limits are now generally less than 10 ppm. Additionally, many existing sources are {{being required to}} control NOx emissions to comply with future NOx Budget regulations. The new and existing combustion sources require greater measurement precision and accuracy from the NOx and CO analyzers installed to continuously monitor the low NOx and CO emissions. Additionally, and more critically, greater measurent precision and accuracy {{is required for the}} reference NOx and CO analyzers used to perform relative accuracy performance testing for the low NOx and CO CEMS installed on the low NOx and CO emissions sources Historically, the use of chemiluminescence to detect NO/NOx has shown itself to be an excellent gas monitoring method. EPA’s <b>NOx</b> <b>Reference</b> Test Methods 20 and 7 E were based on, and written for, chemiluminescence NOx analyzers. The interference (quenching) of gases such as CO 2 with the chemiluminescent process is inherent in all chemiluminescence analyzers; it cannot be eliminated completely, only minimized. ...|$|E
50|$|Arvin Meritor, a Tier 1 {{supplier}} of automotive technology, at one time, was {{experimenting with a}} plasma reformer technology which would use hydrogen produced from the fuel to enhance engine combustion efficiency and reduce emissions of <b>NOx.</b> This <b>reference</b> states that a 20% to 30% increase in engine thermal efficiency is possible. However, this requires that the engine should be modified {{to operate in the}} ultra-lean region of the plot of compression ratio vs. air/fuel equivalence ratio (lambda), along with other modifications. This technology would not work well as a retrofit to unmodified engine technology. This research was conducted in conjunction with the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at MIT. Eventually, the division conducting this research was sold off to an equity investment firm.|$|R
40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI) and Cleaver-Brooks {{developed}} a new gas-fired steam generation systemÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe Super BoilerÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂfor increased energy efficiency, reduced equipment size, and reduced emissions. The system consists of a firetube boiler with a unique staged furnace design, a two-stage burner system with engineered internal recirculation and inter-stage cooling integral to the boiler, unique convective pass design with extended internal surfaces for enhanced heat transfer, and a novel integrated heat recovery system to extract maximum energy from the flue gas. With these combined innovations, the Super Boiler technical goals were set at 94 % HHV fuel efficiency, operation on natural gas with < 5 ppmv <b>NOx</b> (<b>referenced</b> to 3 %O 2), and 50 % smaller than conventional boilers of similar steam output. To demonstrate these technical goals, the project culminated in the industrial demonstration of this new high-efficiency technology on a 300 HP boiler at Clement Pappas, a juice bottler located in Ontario, California. The Super Boiler combustion system is based on two stage combustion which combines air staging, internal flue gas recirculation, inter-stage cooling, and unique fuel-air mixing technology to achieve low emissions rather than external flue gas recirculation which is most commonly used today. The two-stage combustion provides lower emissions because of the integrated design of the boiler and combustion system which permit precise control of peak flame temperatures in both primary and secondary stages of combustion. To reduce equipment size, the Super Boiler's dual furnace design increases radiant heat transfer to the furnace walls, allowing shorter overall furnace length, and also employs convective tubes with extended surfaces that increase heat transfer by up to 18 -fold compared to conventional bare tubes. In this way, a two-pass boiler can achieve the same efficiency as a traditional three or four-pass firetube boiler design. The Super Boiler is consequently up to 50 % smaller in footprint, has a smaller diameter, and is up to 50 % lower in weight, resulting in very compact design with reduced material cost and labor costs, while requiring less boiler room floor space. For enhanced energy efficiency, the heat recovery system uses a transport membrane condenser (TMC), a humidifying air heater (HAH), and a split-stage economizer to extract maximum energy from the flue gas. The TMC is a new innovation that pulls {{a major portion of}} water vapor produced by the combustion process from the flue gases along with its sensible and latent heat. This results in nearly 100 % transfer of heat to the boiler feed water. The HAH improves the effectiveness of the TMC, particularly in steam systems that do not have a large amount of cold makeup water. In addition, the HAH humidifies the combustion air to reduce NOx formation. The split-stage economizer preheats boiler feed water {{in the same way as}} a conventional economizer, but extracts more heat by working in tandem with the TMC and HAH to reduce flue gas temperature. These components are designed to work synergistically to achieve energy efficiencies of 92 - 94 % which is 10 - 15 % higher than todayÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs typical firetube boilers...|$|R
40|$|Optimizing heat transfer, {{decreasing}} NOx {{production or}} improving flame stability, {{is a major}} objective of new generation combustors. A numerical tool capable of simulating the behaviour of a new system would greatly help in the design process of original, and environmentally friendly combustion systems. Large Eddy Simulations (LES), where larger turbulent scales of the flow field are explicitly resolved when only the effects of smaller ones are modelled constitute a promising tool. In this approach, the interactions between flow and combustion can be finely simulated {{as long as the}} different phenomena involved are correctly taken into account. Many flow configurations from academic to practical situations have been calculated with LES. While combustion modelling has been greatly improved during recent years, different models being now available (Flame Thickening Approach, G-Equation Method, Flame Surface Density Concepts, etc.), the interaction between radiation and combustion, which is a crucial issue, is still neglected. LES now gives the opportunity to achieve a better description of radiative heat transfers as hot burnt gases regions are clearly identified. The focus of the present study is to investigate this interaction. Therefore a powerful numerical tool is developped, based on the CORBA framework [1], which links two dedicated solvers. The first one called AVBP developed at CERFACS [2], is a LES solver, which solves the filtered compressible Navier-Stokes equations together with chemical species equations and energy balance equation on hybrid (structured and unstructured) 3 D meshes. The radiation code, DOMASIUM [3], computes the radiative source term field using temperature and main species (CO 2, H 2 O, CO) coming from the LES solver. The Correlated-K model, based on the cumulative distribution function of the absorption coefficient is combined with a Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM). Numerical simulations of a Lean Premixed Prevaporised burner [4] have been performed showing that radiation has a great impact on the flame dynamics and on the NOx production.
