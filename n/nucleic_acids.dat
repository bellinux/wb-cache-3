5|$|A protein as a {{stand-alone}} infectious agent stands {{in contrast to}} all other known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, all of which contain <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> (DNA, RNA, or both). For this reason, a minority of researchers still consider the prion/TSE hypothesis unproven.|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E

5|$|Research on RNA {{has led to}} many {{important}} biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes. <b>Nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> were discovered in 1868 by Friedrich Miescher, who called the material 'nuclein' since it {{was found in the}} nucleus. It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939. Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Arthur Kornberg) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory. However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in cytosol are quite different from those in extracellular fluid and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. <b>Nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E

Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{biological}} techniques {{become more}} and more popular, as they are applied to many kinds of applications, authentication protocols, biochemistry, and cryptography. One of the most interesting biology techniques is deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> and using it in such domains. Hiding secret data in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> becomes an important and interesting research topic. Some researchers hide the secret data in transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments where it doesn't mention to modify the original sequence, but others hide data in non-transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> non-translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments. Unfortunately, these schemes either alter the functionalities or modify the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequences. As a result, how to embed the secret data into the deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence without altering the functionalities and to have the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence be able to be retrieved is worthy of investigating. This paper applies reversible information hiding scheme on deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence by using the reversible contrast mapping technique. The reversible property makes the secret data hidden in anywhere in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> without altering the functionalities because the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence can be recovered exactly in our scheme...|$|R

5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|E

Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs.

Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> results in excretion of urea and uric acid.

5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are phosphorothioate linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E
