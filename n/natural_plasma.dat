In our analysis, we compare and contrast the azimuthally symmetric modes, on which the previous literature has concentrated, with polaritonic guided modes, which propagate in a different regime close to the plasmonic resonance of the waveguide. Forward and backward modes may be envisioned in this latter regime, traveling with subdiffraction cross section along the cylindrical interface between plasmonic and nonplasmonic materials. In general, two oppositely oriented power flows arise in the positive and negative permittivity regions, consistent with our previous results in the planar geometry.

The operation of the achieved system has been tested for function and stability in a simulated space environment. The PWS system is equipped with two sets of long deployable dipole antennas with a tip-to-tip length of 52 m.

40|$|We {{present a}} set of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) direct numerical simulations of incompressible decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in which we investigate the influence of an external uniform magnetic field B_ 0. A parametric study in terms of B_ 0 intensity is made where, in particular, we distinguish the shear- from the pseudo-Alfven waves dynamics. The initial kinetic and magnetic energies are equal with a negligible cross-correlation. Both the temporal and spectral effects of B_ 0 are discussed. A sub-critical balance is found between the Alfven and nonlinear times with both a global and a spectral definition. The nonlinear dynamics of strongly magnetized flows {{is characterized by a}} different k_perp-spectrum (where B_ 0 defines the parallel direction) if it is plotted at a fixed k_// (2 D spectrum) or if it is integrated (averaged) over all k_// (1 D spectrum).

It is believed that the averaging effect may be a source of difficulty to detect the transition towards wave turbulence in <b>natural</b> <b>plasmas.</b> For the first time, the formation of filaments is reported within current and vorticity sheets in strongly magnetized flows which modifies our classical picture of dissipative sheets in conductive flows.

40|$|Context. Recent {{studies on}} Kappa {{distribution}} functions invoked in space plasma applications have emphasized two alternative approaches which may assume the temperature parameter either dependent or {{independent of the}} power-index κ. Each of them can obtain justification in different scenarios involving Kappa-distributed plasmas, but direct evidences supporting any of these two alternatives with measurements from laboratory or <b>natural</b> <b>plasmas</b> are not available yet. Aims. This paper aims to provide more facts on this intriguing issue from direct fitting measurements of suprathermal electron populations present in the solar wind, {{as well as from}} their destabilizing effects predicted by these two alternating approaches. Methods. Two fitting models are contrasted, namely, the global Kappa and the dual Maxwellian-Kappa models, which are currently invoked in theory and observations. The destabilizing effects of suprathermal electrons are characterized {{on the basis of a}} kinetic approach which accounts for the microscopic details of the velocity distribution. Results. In order to be relevant, the model is chosen to accurately reproduce the observed distributions and this is achieved by a dual Maxwellian-Kappa distribution function. A statistical survey indicates a κ-dependent temperature of the suprathermal (halo) electrons for any heliocentric distance. Only for this approach the instabilities driven by the temperature anisotropy are found to be systematically stimulated by the abundance of suprathermal populations, i. e., lowering the values of κ-index.

The ionosphere can be regarded as a <b>natural</b> <b>plasma</b> laboratory, with far greater scale sizes then anything achievable in a conventional laboratory, thus giving unique access to a range of plasma waves and instabilities. In this thesis results from two campaigns involving the EISCAT (European Incoherent SCATter) ionospheric modification facility (heater) at Tromso, Northern Norway are presented.;The first campaign, in February 1995, was principally concerned with modification of the auroral electrojet region during both disturbed and quiet conditions. During this campaign the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar was utilised to achieve the first experimental demonstration of artificial inospheric cooling by a high power radio wave.;For the second campaign, in April 1996, the most important diagnostic was CUTLASS (Co-operative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System), which can measure power backscattered from field aligned irregularities produced during heating. It has been found that irregularities are excited over a horizontal spatial extent of around 175 km, which far exceeds the normal width of the heater beam. The temporal decay of artificial irregularities remain in the ionosphere for up to four minutes after heater-off.;In addition to these experimental studies, a computer model has been developed to investigate the electron temperature and density changes which are induced in the ionospheric D- and E-regions during periods of electrojet activity.
