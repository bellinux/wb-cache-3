5|$|The {{appearance}} of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> at the Beijing Olympics marked its thirteenth and final appearance. The <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> had consistently appeared at the Summer Olympics since the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, excluding two Olympic games that had been boycotted due to Soviet incursions in other countries.

5|$|The <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> were a {{union of}} five Caribbean islandsCuraçao, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, Saba and Sint Maartenthat, together, {{constituted}} {{a portion of the}} Realm of the Netherlands alongside the Netherlands themselves and Aruba, and held approximately 300,000 residents. The political power of the Dutch colonies was centered at Willemstad, the capital of both Curaçao and of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> The first Dutch Antillean delegation to compete was an eleven-man team that arrived at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Excluding 1956 and 1980, athletes from the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> had participated at twelve summer games between 1952 and 2004. It had additionally competed at the Winter Olympics of 1988 and 1992. The first female Dutch Antillean Olympians competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and had only appeared sporadically between then and 2004 with the exception of in 1984, when female athletes comprised the majority of the Dutch Antillean delegation. The <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> experienced its greatest diversity of athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, when athletes participated in six different sports.|$|E

One athlete from South Sudan also competed as an independent athlete, since the nation had not yet formed a National Olympic Committee after its independence in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are {{constituent}} {{countries of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and thus have King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, {{as well as the}} remaining islands forming the Caribbean Netherlands. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained {{under the control of the}} Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> again split as three areas in 2010. The monarch is represented in each region by the Governor of Aruba, Alfonso Boekhoudt, the Governor of Curaçao, Frits Goedgedrag, and the Governor of Sint Maarten, Eugene Holiday.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing within the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004, sending track athletes Churandy Martina and Geronimo Goeloe and equestrian athlete Eddy Stibbe. The 2004 Games {{were the}} Netherlands Antilles' twelfth {{appearance}} in the Summer Olympics; they first competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Before the 2004 games, the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> had won one medal, a silver in sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics, by Jan Boersma. There were no Dutch Antillean medalists at the Athens Olympics, although Martina advanced to the quarterfinal round in his event. The Dutch Antillean flagbearer at the ceremonies was Churandy Martina.|$|E

5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> Two species are known, which differ {{in size and}} some details of tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type species, is known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are probably 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller species, is known from 35teeth found in a single fossil site, which is probably 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles,</b> but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (including the Athens Olympics).|$|E
5|$|In the quarterfinals, {{which took}} place on August 15, Frater competed in the first heat.

5|$|Eduard Peter Nicolaas Stibbe, known also as Eddy Stibbe, {{competed for}} the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> as its only equestrian athlete. Stibbe competed in {{individual}} eventing. Born in 1948 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Stibbe first competed, aged 23, in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, riding the horse Autumn Flash and representing the Netherlands. He returned {{at the age}} of 43 to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, riding Olympic Bahlua on the Netherlands' behalf. At age 51, Stibbe represented the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> {{for the first time at}} the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia on horse Eton, finishing his event for the first time. He returned again to the Olympics {{at the age of}} 55, riding horse Dusky Moon, for his fourth Olympic appearance and sixth Olympic event. On August 16, Stibbe faced 74 other athletes during the dressage portion of the event. The Dutch Antillean competitor accrued 57.80 penalty points but was awarded 62.40 points by one judge and 61.20 points by another, tying Jaroslav Hatla of the Czech Republic for 38th place. During the August 17 cross-country phase of the event, Stibbe accrued 49.20 penalty points (20 from jumping, 29.20 from time), finishing the race in 10:59. This placed him at 60th place of the 71 athletes who advanced to the cross-country round. Overall, at this point, Eddy Stibbe's combined point values placed him at 58th place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Christian {{participated in the}} quarterfinals and was placed in Heat 3 against athletes that {{included}} Churandy Martina of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> and Kristof Beyens of Belgium.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September7. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned an area of convection three days later, which gradually organized. On September13, the wave moved through the Windward Islands, producing wind gusts of 50mph (85km/h) on Barbados. Later that day, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75mi (120km) west-northwest of Trinidad, based on ship and land reports. Though located in a climatologically unfavorable area, the depression intensified and continued to develop. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September14 indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta {{to the north of the}} <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jasper Schuringa, who was {{en route}} to Miami, Florida for a vacation, stopped Abdulmutallab from causing too much damage and {{received}} burn injuries in the process. In a statement, Schuringa, who was in seat 20J on the flight, said {{he was able to}} locate Abdulmutallab, help to extinguish the fire that the explosive had caused, and helped to restrain Abdulmutallab using plastic cuffs. Schuringa lives in Amsterdam, and was born in 1977 in Curaçao, <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> Schuringa is a graduate of Leiden University, Leiden. He is a film director of low-budget Dutch films for an Amsterdam-based media company, and was the assistant director for National Lampoon's Teed Off Too.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} gradually {{developed over the}} extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea on November 1. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. By November 4, the system stalled to the north of Curaçao, which was followed by a turn to the northeast. Convection slowly organized as a surface circulation formed, and on November 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen. Initially weak with only 20mph (32km/h) winds, the depression steadily organized as it moved northeastward, and a Reconnaissance Aircraft mission confirmed the existence of the cyclone on November 6 as it was located midway between Puerto Rico and the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> Late on the 6th, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Klaus while located a short distance south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, he {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} 200m final {{with a time of}} 19.98seconds, some distance off the winner Usain Bolt who had broken the world record. However, it transpired that both the silver and bronze medalists (Churandy Martina of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> and American Wallace Spearmon) had stepped out of their lanes thus they were disqualified. As a result, Dix received his second Olympic bronze medal. Further disqualifications occurred in the heats of the Olympic 4×100 meter relay race: Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay misjudged a baton pass, causing the American team to be eliminated and spoiling any chance of Dix receiving a relay medal. He finished the Olympics as the only American sprinter to medal in two individual events. Dix closed the season with two sub-10 second runs at the Weltklasse and Athletissima meetings, finishing second to a Jamaican on both occasions (Bolt and Asafa Powell).|$|E
5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E
5|$|El Salvador {{returned}} {{to participate in}} the 1961 CCCF Championship, hosted in Costa Rica, alongside nine other national teams. Due to the larger number of teams the CCCF Championship shifted to a two-round format with two round-robin group stages. In the first round, there were two groups, one with five teams and one with four. The top two teams from both groups advanced to the second stage. El Salvador was placed in the four team group Honduras, the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles,</b> and Nicaragua, which they topped with two wins and one draw. In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica, who won their seventh CCCF Championship. Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the CONCACAF Championship.|$|E
5|$|Geronimo Goeloe also {{represented}} the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> {{in track and}} field at the Athenian Olympics. He competed on the Dutch colony's behalf in the men's 200meters race. Goeloe was born in Willemstad on Curaçao in 1981, making him 22 {{years old at the time}} of his competition at the Athens Olympics. Goeloe had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The qualification round of Goeloe's event took place on August 24. The Dutch Antillean was placed in the second heat, where he faced seven other athletes. Goeloe finished the event in 21.09seconds, placing seventh out of eight athletes; Brazil's Basilio Emidio de Morais ranked behind him (21.14seconds), and South Africa's Leigh Julius ranked directly ahead (20.80seconds). The heat itself was led by the United States' Shawn Crawford (20.55seconds) and Jamaica's Christopher Williams (20.57seconds). Goeloe did not advance to the quarterfinal round.|$|E
5|$|Martina's {{participation}} in the 200m finals round was controversial. Martina came in second place to Usain Bolt, completing the event in 19.82 seconds over Usain Bolt's world-record breaking performance of 19.30 seconds. However, when American would-be bronze medalist Wallace Spearmon was disqualified for running outside of his lane, the American coaches reviewed video records of the race and found that Martina had done the same. The United States filed a protest against the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> The Dutch Antillean Olympic committee argued that the challenge was invalid, having been filed after the 30-minute post-race deadline, but Martina was disqualified from receiving the silver medal anyway. Shawn Crawford of the United States, who originally finished the race in fourth place, was given the silver medal, and Walter Dix was given the bronze medal in place of Spearmon.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this {{has been shown to be}} the result of a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). The highest rate of HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Curaçao, Bonaire, Aruba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin share musical styles, {{as well as}} {{maintain}} their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian road block to calypso, zouk and soca. African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from Lebanon, China and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the Combined Rhythm, like local favorites the Happy Peanuts and Expresando Rimto i Ambiente. Kaseko music from the mainland country Suriname is also popular. Traditional music of Aruba and the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles,</b> however, is primarily African, characterized {{by the use of}} complex, highly developed polyrhythms, dance styles and drums like the tambú. Other African-derived instruments include metal percussion rods, agan, the rasp wiri, aerophones like the cachu trumpet, becu transverse double-reed wind instrument, and the bow benta.|$|E
5|$|Churandy Martina {{represented}} the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> at the Athens Olympics in the men's 100meters race. Born in Willemstad, {{the capital city}} of the island Curaçao, Martina was 20 years old upon his entrance to the 2004 Summer Olympics. He had not previously competed at any Olympic games. On August 21, Martina competed in the eighth heat, which included nine athletes. He finished the race in 10.23seconds, placing in third ahead of Germany's Alexander Kosenkow (10.28seconds) and behind Jamaica's Dwight Thomas (10.21seconds). The heat itself was led by Maurice Greene of the United States. The Dutch Antillean progressed to the next round. During the course of the quarterfinals, which took place on the same day, Martina competed in the first heat against seven other athletes. This time, he finished in seventh place with a time of 10.24seconds. Martina placed ahead of Brazil's André da Silva (10.34seconds) and behind Canada's Pierre Browne in a heat led by national-record-setting Portuguese runner Francis Obikwelu (9.93seconds) and season-best-setting British runner Mark Lewis-Francis (10.12seconds). Churandy Martina did not advance to the semifinal rounds which took place the next day.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{consistently}} {{predicted that}} the storm would intensify and pass through the islands. As Hurricane Dean approached, the island nations began to prepare with a flurry of activity. On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of all member states in the Lesser Antilles. On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to Barbados, Dominica, and St. Kitts {{in advance of the}} hurricane to provide damage assessment should the hurricane affect those islands. At 11p.m.AST August 15 (0300UTC August 16) the respective governments of St. Lucia, Martinique, Saba, St. Eustatius, and Guadeloupe and its dependencies issued Hurricane watches and the government of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> issued a tropical storm watch for the island of St. Maarten, as then-Tropical Storm Dean was expected to intensify to hurricane strength and reach the Windward Islands within 36hours. Authorities in Martinique canceled a memorial to the victims of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 and began to set up shelters.|$|E
