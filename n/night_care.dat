5000|$|The British {{government}} has a clear warning for their military and civilian employees, or British tourists, about using the roads in Yemen: “In {{the event of a}} breakdown of law and order access routes in and out of major cities may be blocked. If you wish to drive outside Sana’a you will need prior permission from the Yemen Tourist Police. Travel permits may take at least 24 hours to be issued and are easiest to obtain through a travel agent. Travel without such permission is likely to result in detention and possible deportation. You should be aware that the consular assistance we can offer outside Sana’a is limited due to restrictions on travel. There have been disturbances in Aden, Lahij and al-Dhali’, which have resulted in closures of the Aden-Sana’a road. These have been short-lived but if you intend to travel by road you should check that the road is open before starting your journey. You can drive in Yemen on an International Driving Permit. Driving standards are poor and mountain roads hazardous. You should avoid all road travel outside the main cities at <b>night.</b> <b>Care</b> should also be taken to avoid minefields left over from Yemen’s civil wars. Travelling off well-used tracks without an experienced guide could be extremely hazardous, particularly in parts of the south and the central highlands.” ...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims at {{understanding}} the processes related to young children's belonging during daily arrivals at day and <b>night</b> <b>care.</b> Two {{aspects of a}} child's belonging are considered: membership and sense of belonging. Data were gathered by ethnographic observation of 8 children aged from 20 to 36 months in two Finnish day care centres offering day and <b>night</b> <b>care.</b> Arrival episodes taking place {{at different times of}} day were analysed qualitatively based on the children's actions and expressions. During these episodes, the children negotiated and constructed their belonging by interacting with adults, peers and material objects. These interactions took place within varying social and material surroundings and according to different daily routines that sometimes challenged the child's belonging. The results underline the importance of sensitive responsiveness by educators to young children's initiatives in supporting children's belonging during daily arrivals at day and <b>night</b> <b>care...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{quality of}} primary {{medical care for}} {{children}} in Poland is unsatisfactory. In the ranking known as ‘the European Health Consumer Index’, Poland (taking the patient {{point of view on}} healthcare quality) is classified on the 27 th position out of the 33 possible. The unsolved problems concern inter alia the quality and availability of <b>night</b> paediatric urgent <b>care.</b> Objective The aim was assessing the quality as well as the level of satisfaction with the <b>night</b> paediatric urgent <b>care</b> in the Lublin Province of eastern Poland. Material and Methods The materials for this study consisted of 540 parents of children aged 6 – 16 years benefiting from night paediatric urgent medical assistance in Lublin Province. The survey was conducted using the Original Survey Questionnaire. Results Inhabitants of the Lublin Province (regardless of place of residence) generally assessed the quality and accessibility of <b>night</b> paediatric urgent <b>care</b> facilities as only satisfactory. Inhabitants living in rural areas have worse access to <b>night</b> paediatric urgent <b>care</b> facilities because of having to travel greater distances, and receive less comprehensive medical assistance than inhabitants living in more urbanized areas, and they are more often referred to hospital emergency departments. During the past five years, both the availability and quality of <b>night</b> paediatric urgent <b>care</b> did not change significantly. Conclusions Inhabitants of the Lublin Province (regardless of place of residence) generally assessed the quality as well as accessibility of <b>night</b> paediatric urgent <b>care</b> facilities as only satisfactory. Rural residents have more reasons for dissatisfaction than urban dwellers. Both the quality and availability of such medical care needs to be improved...|$|R

Adults evaluated children’s moods three times daily over 1 [*]week. A clear weekday–weekend rhythm was found among children in day care, who displayed more negative moods, due to frequent hurried mornings. Children in day and <b>night</b> <b>care</b> had more irregular mood rhythms. Boys were evaluated as displaying more negative moods than girls...|$|E

40|$|Repositioning (turning) {{remains a}} {{standard}} recommendation for pressure ulcer prevention (European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 1998). However, {{the need for}} turning some 'at risk' nursing home patients has been questioned by Schnelle et al. (1993) in a US study. They found that, although two-thirds of residents in nursing homes turned themselves during the <b>night,</b> <b>care</b> staff managed {{them in the same}} way as the third who did not turn themselves. Furthermore, they found that residents who turned themselves were more likely to be turned by staff. Schnelle and colleagues studied their subjects indirectly by monitoring their arm movements, using wrist actigraphy, and hip and shoulder movements, using pressure-sensitive film on the mattress. They did not use direct observation and were therefore unable to determine if any detected movements resulted in a sustained change in position or to discover why staff were more likely to turn self-turners than other residents. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of night-time self-turning by residents in nursing homes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} a Cambridge hospital at home service (CHAH) on patients' quality of care, likelihood of remaining at home in their final 2 weeks of life and general practitioner (GP) visits. The design was a randomized controlled trial, comparing CHAH with standard care. The patient's district nurse, GP and informal carer were surveyed within 6 weeks of patient's death, and 225 district nurses, 194 GPs and 144 informal carers of 229 patients responded. There was no clear evidence that CHAH increased likelihood of remaining at home during the final 2 weeks of life. However, the service was associated with fewer GP out of hours visits. All respondent groups rated CHAH favourably compared to standard care but emphasized different aspects. District nurses rated CHAH as better than standard care in terms of adequacy of <b>night</b> <b>care</b> and support for the carer, GPs in terms of anxiety and depression, and informal carers in terms of control of pain and nausea. Thus whilst CHAH was not found to increase the likelihood of remaining at home, it appeared to be associated with better quality home care...|$|E
