All inorganic and organic nutrients gave better yield of maize on <b>Niger</b> <b>seed</b> precursor crop compared to Mucuna pruriens green manured fields.

Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) was used for mineral analysis and the standard method was adopted to estimate tannin and phytate. Twelve mineral elements; Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, S, Se and Zn were analyzed for each oilseed variety. In <b>niger</b> <b>seed,</b> phosphorous was the most abundant mineral element ranging from 661 to 867 mg/ 100 g and selenium was the least, ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 33 mg/ 100 g.
