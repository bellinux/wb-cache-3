5|$|The {{legend of}} Mussie likely began around 1916, though folk tales claim that Canadian pioneer Samuel de Champlain {{wrote about it}} in the early seventeenth century.

From August 18 to 26, 2003, twenty-three detainees {{participated in a}} mass-suicide attempt. Reporters noted that <b>numerous</b> <b>attempted</b> suicides occurred after a change in command at the camp resulted {{in an increase in}} the severity of interrogation techniques used against the detainees.|$|R
5|$|At {{the western}} end of Highway3, two major traffic {{concerns}} have been the focus of controversy since the mid-1990s and early 2000s: the Essex Bypass and the approach to the Ambassador Bridge. <b>Numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> by local and provincial politicians since then have led the MTO to begin remedying the situation by upgrading the bypass to a divided four lane road and constructing the Windsor–Essex Parkway to a new international crossing.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support would be {{necessary}} for {{the continued existence of}} the United Belgian States, the Statists tried to make contact with foreign powers they believed to be sympathetic. Despite <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts,</b> however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E

5|$|Like the Patriarch in García Márquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, Bolívar was an {{absolute}} dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buendía in One Hundred Years of Solitude: both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in One Hundred Years of Solitude and Santiago Nasar in Chronicle of a Death Foretold.|$|E
5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the castle continued into the reign of Elizabeth I, who was advised {{that it no longer}} had any military utility. Robert Redhead, the tower keeper, became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit. Despite <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> by local city and crown officials to halt this, Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford's Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because of the strength of local feeling.|$|E
5|$|Where {{there was}} an {{existing}} castle on a site, another response across 19th-century Europe was to attempt to improve the buildings, bringing their often chaotic historic features into line with a more integrated architectural aesthetic, in a style often termed Gothic Revivalism. There were <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> to restore or rebuild keeps so as to produce this consistently Gothic style: in England, the architect Anthony Salvin was particularly prominent – as illustrated by reworking and heightening of the keep at Windsor Castle, while in France, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc reworked the keeps at castles in locations like Pierrefonds during the 1860s and 1870s, admittedly in a largely speculative fashion, since the original keep had been mostly destroyed in 1617.|$|E

5|$|Clifford {{had already}} {{achieved}} {{prominence in the}} north where, as an ally of {{the son of the}} earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> {{to break}} through the {{defensive}} line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was {{in the hands of the}} Argives.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Levesque {{was born}} in Nashua, New Hampshire. He watched wrestling {{for the first time}} when he was five, a match {{involving}} Chief Jay Strongbow. Levesque began to take up bodybuilding at the age of 14, because he wanted to look like professional wrestlers. Levesque attended Nashua South High School, where he played baseball and basketball. Following his graduation from high school in 1987, Levesque continued to enter several bodybuilding competitions, and was crowned Mr. Teenage New Hampshire in 1988 at the age of 19. While working as a manager at Gold's Gym in Nashua, New Hampshire, Levesque was introduced to world champion powerlifter, Ted Arcidi, who at the time was employed with the WWE. Eventually, after <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts,</b> Levesque persuaded Arcidi to introduce him to former pro wrestler and trainer, Killer Kowalski, who owned and ran a professional wrestling training school based in Malden, Massachusetts. In early 1992, Levesque enrolled in Kowalski's wrestling school, where he began to train as a professional wrestler.|$|E
5|$|Scott (known then as Norman Josiffe) {{had first}} met Thorpe early in 1961 when the former was a 20-year-old groom working {{for one of}} Thorpe's wealthy friends. The initial meeting was brief, but nearly a year later Scott, by then in London and destitute, called at the House of Commons to ask the MP for help. Thorpe later {{acknowledged}} that a friendship had developed, but denied any physical relationship; Scott, on the other hand, claimed {{that he had been}} seduced by Thorpe on the night following the Commons meeting. Over the following years Thorpe made <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> to help Scott to find accommodation and work, but instead of repaying these favours with gratitude, Scott became increasingly resentful to Thorpe, believing that he was the source of all his ills and threatening him with exposure.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E

5|$|The Rolls-Royce Mermaid {{propulsor}} pods {{fitted to}} QM2 {{have proven to}} be prone to failure. The failures had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009. The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod propulsion systems fitted to Cunard Line's flagship Queen Mary 2 are inherently defective in design. Cunard contends that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud in the course of winning the contract. The Achilles’ heel of the design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings, which have continued to show a tendency to fail even after <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> at redesign. In January 2011 Carnival Corporation was awarded US$24 million (approx. UK£15 million at the time of verdict) by the United States court due to the repeated failure of the propulsors.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> to {{decipher}} the rongorongo script of Easter Island since its discovery {{in the late nineteenth}} century. As with most undeciphered scripts, many of the proposals have been fanciful. Apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to deal with a lunar calendar, none of the texts are understood, and even the calendar cannot actually be read. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment: the small number of remaining texts, comprising only 15,000 legible glyphs; the lack of context in which to interpret the texts, such as illustrations or parallels to texts which can be read; {{and the fact that the}} modern Rapanui language is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets—especially if they record a specialized register such as incantations—while the few remaining examples of the old language are heavily restricted in genre and may not correspond well to the tablets either.|$|E
5|$|Throughout April {{there were}} <b>numerous</b> <b>attempts</b> by UNAMIR to {{establish}} a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured {{the whole of the}} Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the FAR forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far northwest. As well as fighting the war, Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.|$|E
