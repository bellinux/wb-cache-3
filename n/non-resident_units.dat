5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to <b>non-resident</b> <b>units,</b> plus primary income receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|E
40|$|The Czech Republic {{is a small}} open economy, {{which is}} vitally {{dependent}} on its export performance. In the period after EU accession the intensity of international cooperation grew rapidly in all the Central European countries, which is mostly {{the result of the}} huge FDI inflow {{at the beginning of the}} decade. In this context onesignificant problem for the Czech Republic and some other countries of the region appeared: the valuation of the trade flows based on the cross-border measuring overestimates the country’s trade balance in comparison with its value added created. This is the case of trade declared by <b>non-resident</b> <b>units,</b> which is more and more common within the European Union. This phenomenon is even enhanced by strategic geographical location of the Czech Republic, which is an important factor explaining why a lot of this “quasi-transit” trade is beingoperated. The revision of the foreign trade data, which aim is to follow more consistently the ownership approach, significantly changes the picture of the Czech economy, specifically the role of external demand to the economic growth...|$|E
40|$|International Merchandise Trade Statistics (IMTS) is {{a domain}} of {{official}} economic statistics with great tradition. The conventional data source of IMTS has been Customs documents, thus the basic recording principle the cross-border physical movement of goods. As long as national economies covered resident units only and units {{in different countries}} were unrelated to each other, border crossing provided a good estimation for the change of ownership between a resident and non-resident unit – the principle used in Balance of Payments and National Accounts. However, with the evolution of globalization, official ITGS statistics is facing challenges regarding its key conceptual and data collection aspects: Customs formalities are simplified and even abolished {{in the frame of}} a Customs union, <b>non-resident</b> <b>units</b> are acting as traders within the economy and a non negligible part of trade is done between related parties of multinational enterprise groups. Physical movements might become inflated and not reflecting the change of ownership due to internationally fragmented nature of global production processes. The paper is devoted to highlight some aspects of this existing methodological gap through the perspective and practice of an export oriented EU Member State...|$|E
