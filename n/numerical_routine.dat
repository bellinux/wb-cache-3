40|$|A {{crucial part}} of {{building}} reliable models {{for the design of}} under-platform dampers for turbine blades resides in the appropriate description of the contact conditions, both in the normal and in the tangential direction. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine to what extent microslip due to the combined non-linearities along the normal and the tangent of non-conforming contact surfaces influence the damper behaviour. The ultimate goal is to determine whether introducing these features in the contact model would improve the performance of numerical routines used at the blade-damper design stage. In order to explore this problem, a purposely developed contact model is tuned on a single-contact test and then included in the numerical model of a curved-flat damper to simulate its cylindrical interface. The damper <b>numerical</b> <b>routine</b> is then validated against the results from an experimental device purposely developed to test the dynamics of a damper loaded between moving platforms.
