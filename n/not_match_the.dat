He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them. The Byzantines hatched a large-scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojniković to attack the Bulgarians with Magyar support.|$|E
5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> expected Santorini fingerprint.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|Both authors {{wrote that}} the macaws were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe, and {{stressed}} that the parrots of each Caribbean island were distinct, and could be differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations.

5|$|During World War II, American bombers {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were {{protected}} by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> range of the Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, {{the next generation of}} bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development cost for longer-ranged fighters was high, while aerial refueling was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record.

Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from the bones of the child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E

However, {{they noted that}} at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The reviewer considered {{the best part of}} the game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago.

Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago.

5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates {{to be able to}} overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E

5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} {{unusual for the}} time, being long on keel and narrow of beam (width) and {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> European states {{in the size of}} their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E

5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do <b>not</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
