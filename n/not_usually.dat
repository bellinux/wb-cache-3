5|$|A diver {{who only}} {{breathes}} gas at atmospheric pressure when free-diving or snorkelling will <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> need to decompress {{but it is}} possible to get decompression sickness, or taravana, from repetitive deep free-diving with short surface intervals.|$|E

5|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes dental fluorosis, most of which is mild and <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|Native (i.e., elemental) {{selenium}} {{is a rare}} mineral, {{which does}} <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals. Isolation of selenium is often complicated {{by the presence of}} other compounds and elements.|$|E
5|$|Prefixes are <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> used to {{indicate}} multiples {{of a second}} greater than 1; the non-SI units of minute, hour and day are used instead. On the other hand, prefixes are used for multiples of the non-SI unit of volume, the litre (l, L) such as millilitres (ml).|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} large {{herbivore}} is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of the mule deer. Elk and moose are less common. Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, and are <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats {{that live in}} the North Cascades.|$|E
5|$|Their {{longevity}} may {{be explained}} by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.

5|$|Three {{months after}} his return from Korea, Dean was {{assigned}} as the Deputy Commanding General of the Sixth United States Army at the Presidio of San Francisco in California. Dean held this post for two years until he retired from active duty on the 31st of October in 1955. Upon retirement Dean was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge for his front line service in World War II and Korea; general officers are <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> eligible, since they are <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> participants in front line combat, and Dean was only the second general to receive the award.|$|E

5|$|A divers' {{cognition}} may {{be affected}} on dives as shallow as , but the changes are <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> noticeable. There is no reliable method to predict the depth at which narcosis becomes noticeable, or {{the severity of the}} effect on an individual diver, as it may vary from dive to dive even on the same day.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> {{identified}} as a genre writer, William S. Burroughs produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do. In 1959 he published Naked Lunch, {{the first of many}} works such as The Nova Trilogy and The Wild Boys in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold {{more often than}} in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E
5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect {{the leaves and}} shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, but it is <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
5|$|Apples are self-incompatible; {{they must}} cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the {{flowering}} each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees {{are also used}} as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but <b>not</b> <b>usually</b> in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.|$|E
