For example, Washington Post author Abigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended [...] "to further bolster 's ties to former Soviet republics." [...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We know what the goal is and we {{are trying to figure out}} effective ways to slow down or prevent it".|$|E

2500|$|Following promotional {{work for}} the second Kid Creole and the Coconuts album Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places, Darnell gave an {{interview}} to the UK music magazine Melody Maker in December 1981 in which he spoke enthusiastically of the forthcoming solo album he was planning called Wise Guy, and told the magazine about three songs he already had written for the record titled [...] "I'm a Wonderful Thing", [...] "Stool Pigeon" [...] (originally titled [...] "Jive Talking") and [...] "Imitation". When it became apparent a few months later, however, that the record {{would no longer be}} a solo album {{and that it would be}} significantly different in style musically from the previous records, Darnell told interviewers at the time that it was [...] "a chance to do some other things", but in reality he felt he was being forced to do [...] "a cop-out album, an R album" [...] in order to ease ZE's considerable financial difficulties with their parent label in the US, Sire Records. By the time of the album's release in May 1982, Darnell acknowledged that his record company had put pressure on him and that the record had not turned out how he had wanted: [...] "Make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> this album is a compromise. It's much more steeped in R than Kid Creole should be. That's why it originally was supposed to be an August Darnell solo album. But because of the problems we ran into in the [...] company, and the company not believing in Kid Creole enough, this had to be turned into a Kid Creole album." ...|$|E

There could be <b>no</b> possible <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It was that harum-scarum young scapegrace John. If Miss Amanda had had a heart, it would have gone out to that dear old boy; if she had had eyes they would have been filled with tears of affection as she gazed on him.

Vetticad of Firstpost summed up the film as [...] "the best film of 2016 so far". She stated, [...] "Kapoor & Sons is hilarious, heartwarming and heartbreaking rolled in one. It does not wear its social conscience on its sleeve, but make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> this: <b>it</b> has one.

500|$|The league {{title in}} the 1970–71 season was decided in mid-April {{in front of the}} Match of the Day cameras at Elland Road, when Leeds lost their lead at the top with defeat by West Bromwich Albion. The Leeds players blamed the referee for costing them the title as offside was not given for Colin Suggett for Jeff Astle's winner, and despite Bremner saying [...] "But we fight on. Make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> that, <b>it</b> is not over yet" [...] Leeds could not {{overtake}} Arsenal, who {{went on to win the}} Double. Success instead came in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as Leeds knocked out Sarpsborg (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany), Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to reach the final with Juventus (Italy). Bremner recovered from an ankle injury just in time to face Liverpool in the semi-finals, and scored the only goal of the two-legged tie with a header at Anfield. Leeds won the final on the away goals rule after recording a 2–2 draw at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino and then a 1–1 draw at Elland Road.|$|R

60|$|As {{great men}} are urged {{on to the}} abuse of power (when they need urging, which is not often), by their flatterers and dependents, so old John was impelled to these {{exercises}} of authority by the applause and admiration of his Maypole cronies, who, in the intervals of their nightly pipes and pots, would shake their heads and say that Mr Willet was a father of the good old English sort; {{that there were no}} new-fangled notions or modern ways in him; that he put them in mind of what their fathers were when they were boys; that there was <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> him; that <b>it</b> would be well for the country if there were more like him, and more was the pity that there were not; with many other original remarks of that nature. Then they would condescendingly give Joe to understand that it was all for his good, and he would be thankful for it one day; and in particular, Mr Cobb would acquaint him, that when he was his age, his father thought no more of giving him a parental kick, or a box on the ears, or a cuff on the head, or some little admonition of that sort, than he did of any other ordinary duty of life; and he would further remark, with looks of great significance, that but for this judicious bringing up, he might have never been the man he was at that present speaking; which was probable enough, as he was, beyond all question, the dullest dog of the party. In short, between old John and old John's friends, there never was an unfortunate young fellow so bullied, badgered, worried, fretted, and brow-beaten; so constantly beset, or made so tired of his life, as poor Joe Willet.|$|R
