25|$|The {{painting}} Louis XIII Comes of Age {{represents the}} historical {{scene of the}} transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means. Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang {{on the side of}} the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a trumpet. Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
500|$|As Cash escapes {{the asylum}} and enters an {{abandoned}} apartment complex, he is caught by Ramirez and the Wardogs, who decide {{to play a}} little game of cat and mouse; Cash manages to kill the gang and Ramirez before backup arrives. Upon fleeing the area, the journalist reporting on Cash suddenly arrives in her car and rescues him. She explains that the Director is actually Lionel Starkweather, a former film producer from Los Santos, who was popular in the 90s, but was forced to leave the industry due to a [...] "scandal". The reporter has been putting together evidence about Starkweather's snuff movies for months, and <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> enough to expose him. First, however, she needs to retrieve some of this evidence from her apartment. Meanwhile, Starkweather orders the chief of the Carcer City Police Department, Gary Schaffer, to bring both Cash and the journalist to him, blackmailing him that he will expose his corruption to the Liberty City Supreme Court if he does not comply.|$|E
500|$|Channel Seven {{described}} Martha {{as being}} [...] "Friendly, {{straight down the}} line, and with a great enthusiasm for life", and Jetstar magazine called Martha [...] "a feisty addition to the Stewart family". Gordon described Martha's persona stating: [...] "Martha's pretty feisty {{all of the time}} but in the sense of always fighting for what's right and keeping up a strong perspective on where I want to go, things like that." [...] Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she never knows what she wants. Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side. Gordon later said that [...] "There will always {{be a little bit of}} trouble attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous". On the character's appearance, RTÉ said [...] "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> grown into a stylish woman with great taste in clothes which range from shorts and strappy tops to gorgeous summer dresses." ...|$|E

500|$|Loud Tour Live at the O2 {{begins with}} Rihanna {{and her team}} {{arriving}} with a ferryboat on a dock. Rihanna continues to walk through and explains how it's a very sad day because the Loud Tour just finished and she is so emotional about that right now. The singer starts crying and further explains {{that she and her}} team have done very good things this year and she believes those things wouldn't happen without the support of her fans. However, <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to go back to Los Angeles where she doesn't have any friends, her [...] "very best" [...] friends travel with her around the world. Before getting into a van, Rihanna says that the tour was one of her best experiences of her life and talks how she will miss her fans the next upcoming year. Scenes are intercut with the start of the show at The O2 Arena. After the interlude Rihanna starts the show with the opening song [...] "Only Girl (In the World)". Emerging from a purple ball, the singer performs the song while wearing a blue electric dress and is surrounded by four backup dancers.

The set finishes with a rendition of [...] "Man Down".|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave it}} {{four out of five}} stars, wrote [...] "what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off" [...] and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: [...] "a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [...] Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly gave it a [...] "4" [...] rating, remarking that [...] "Breakaway is not a Thriller to her Off The Wall by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Bad or Thriller, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. Breakaway may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna's early material perhaps." [...] Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as [...] "Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of Pat Benatar." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Breakaway a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that [...] "though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent Thankful, Clarkson had always cited Mariah Carey as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist." [...] Furthering describing it as [...] "what Mariah might sound like if she ever decided to rock out." [...] Charles Merwin wrote for Stylus Magazine that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality [...] "high enough to quell worries about the [...] "I love the singles, but that's all I really need to hear" [...] arguments." [...] He described Clarkson as ranking some where {{at the top of her}} class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she [...] "has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an American Idol, but for <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops." [...] In a quick review, Billboard described Breakaway as a [...] "rare exhibition of substance over style".|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right <b>now,</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> her own identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|King and Abernathy {{continued}} to protest segregation. In 1957, they founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The first major event {{sponsored by the}} SCLC was the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in Washington, D.C., on May 17, 1957, the third anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision. From this point forward, Jackson appeared often with King, singing before his speeches and for SCLC fundraisers. In a 1962 SCLC press release, he wrote she had [...] "appeared on numerous programs that helped the struggle in the South, but <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> indicated {{that she wants to}} be involved on a regular basis". Jesse Jackson said when King called on her, she never refused, traveling with him to the deepest parts of the segregated South.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the changes}} that Ellsworth made was keeping Mari alive, as the {{character}} is found dead in the original film. The writer believes keeping Mari alive when her parents find her adds to the suspense, because there is now a [...] "ticking clock" [...] for the parents to get their daughter to the hospital. Another change to the character was making her a swimmer. Director Iliadis wanted to give Mari a [...] "big character trait" [...] that {{could be used as a}} coping mechanism for the character, as well as become an important component to her escaping Krug. As Iliadis explains, [...] "Well the idea was to find something where she channels all her energy and that was a big character trait because her brother is dead. It's like she's carrying him on her back. She needs to perform for two people <b>now.</b> <b>She</b> <b>has</b> to compensate for him so all her energy is in the water. The only area where she feels slightly free is when she's in the water swimming like crazy, so it's interesting having that as a character trait, and then having that as a key element for her trying to escape." ...|$|E
