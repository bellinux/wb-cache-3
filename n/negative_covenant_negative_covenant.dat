50|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>covenants</b> are clauses in debt {{contracts}} that limit or prohibit corporate actions (e.g. sale of assets, payment of dividends) that could impair {{the position of}} creditors. <b>Negative</b> <b>covenants</b> may be continuous or incurrence-based. Violations of <b>negative</b> <b>covenants</b> are rare compared to violations of affirmative covenants.|$|R
50|$|Default {{can be of}} two types: debt {{services}} default {{and technical}} default. Debt service default occurs when the borrower has not made a scheduled payment of interest or principal. Technical default occurs when an affirmative or a <b>negative</b> <b>covenant</b> is violated.|$|R

5000|$|In {{property}} law, land-related covenants {{are called}} [...] "real covenants" [...] {{and are a}} major form of covenant, typically imposing restrictions on how the land may be used (<b>negative</b> <b>covenants)</b> or requiring a certain continuing action (affirmative covenant). These may also [...] "run with the land" [...] (called a covenant appurtenant), meaning that any future owners of the land must abide by the terms, or may apply to a particular person (called a covenant in gross). Under English law, affirmative covenants typically do not run with the land; in the United States such covenants are examined more closely, but with exceptions affirmative covenants have been permitted to run with the land.|$|R
50|$|The ITA {{was officially}} {{launched}} on October 25, 1972. It received immediate hostility from the then governing body in the United States for track and field the AAU. The AAU banned all athletes and officials {{who took part in}} ITA competitions and put pressure on television companies not to televise the ITA meets. The athletes were also banned from competing in any Olympic Games. To help protect the athletes from retribution by the AAU if the venture failed, O'Hara placed them on <b>negative</b> <b>covenant</b> contracts - here they promised not to run for anyone else rather than to run for the ITA - with the contracts only going into legal effect if the venture took off.|$|R
5000|$|A {{covenant}} {{is a type}} {{of contract}} in which the covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (<b>negative</b> <b>covenant).</b> In real property law, the term real covenants is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A [...] "covenant running with the land", also imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. Real covenant law in the United States has been referred to as an [...] "unspeakable quagmire" [...] by one court.|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} Delaware {{corporate}} law permits shareholders to use bylaws to circumscribe the managerial {{authority of the}} board of directors. While shareholders cannot mandate action by the board, they can enact specific prohibitions on its behavior, so long as the board retains enough discretion to implement—in practice, not merely in theory—its managerial policies by other means. The use of such circumscribing bylaws to discourage shirking (or analogous managerial abuses) by the directors or officers resembles the use of <b>negative</b> <b>covenants</b> in debt contracts that seek to prevent the debtor from squandering assets. Bylaw governance thus subtly but significantly reallocates governance power within the corporation, so as to reduce the agency costs of management. Its legal validity should also prompt courts and scholars alike to focus less on the quantity of power wielded by the shareholders, and more on the ways that power can be configured to produce managerial efficiencies...|$|R
60|$|Bowes was recalled; Morton, to whom English aid {{had been}} promised, {{was left to}} take his chances. Morton had warning from Lord Robert Stewart, Mary's half-brother, to fly the country, for Sir James Balfour, with his information, had landed. On December 31, 1580, Captain Stewart accused Morton, in {{presence}} of the Council, of complicity in Darnley's murder. He was put in ward; Elizabeth threatened war; the preachers stormed against Lennox; a plot to murder him (a Douglas plot) and to seize James was discovered; Randolph, who now represented Elizabeth, was fired at, and fled to Berwick; James Stewart was created Earl of Arran. In March 1581 the king and Lennox tried to propitiate the preachers by signing a <b>negative</b> <b>Covenant</b> against Rome, later made into a precedent for the famous Covenant of 1638. On June 1 Morton was tried for guilty foreknowledge of Darnley's death. He was executed deservedly, and his head was stuck on a spike of the Tolbooth. The death of this avaricious, licentious, and resolute though unamiable Protestant was a heavy blow to the preachers and their party, and a crook in the lot of Elizabeth.|$|R

We argue that when lenders fix excessive stringent covenants this may generate inefficient underinvestment when a firm is close to a covenant violation, particularly for good quality firms.

40|$|Corporations frequently, {{make use}} of {{precommitment}} strategies. Examples include such widely used devices as <b>negative</b> pledge <b>covenants</b> and change of control clauses in bond indentures fair price shark repellents, no shop and other exclusivity provisions, in merger agreements, mandatory indemnification bylaws, and so on. This paper argues that poison pills also {{can be understood as}} a form of precommitment, by which the board of directors commits to a policy, intended either to negotiate a high acquisition price or to maintain the corporation's independence. In Quickturn Design Sys., Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp., the Delaware supreme court invalidated a no hand poison pill on grounds that a board of directors lacks authority to adopt such devices. In doing so, the court misinterpreted relevant Delaware law. It's unjustifiably called into question the validity of a host of corporate precominitment strategies. Finally, and perhaps most troublingly, it called into question the central tenet of Delaware corporate law; namely, the plenary authority of the board of directors. This article argues that the Delaware supreme court's decision was wrong both as a doctrinal and a policy matter. There simply is no firebreak between the sorts of board self disablement deemed invalid by Quickturn and the host of other precommitment strategies routinely used by corporate boards of directors. The Delaware supreme court's conclusion that the former are invalid for lack of statutory authority thus threatens to invalidate all of the latter. The article concludes by arguing that the Delaware supreme court should have analyzed the no hand pill under standard fiduciary d 4 ty principles rather than creating a new prophylactic ban on precommitment strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the ex post and ex ante benefits of accounting conservatism to lenders and borrowers in the debt contracting process. I expect conservatism to benefit lenders ex post through the timely signaling of default risk, as manifested by accelerated covenant violations, and to benefit borrowers ex ante through lower initial interest rates. Consistent with these predictions, I find that more conservative borrowers {{are more likely}} to violate debt <b>covenants</b> following a <b>negative</b> price shock, and that lenders offer lower interest rates to more conservative borrowers. ...|$|R

50|$|Grey {{was the son}} of Sir Ralph Grey of Chillingham, and {{his second}} wife Dorothy Malet, {{daughter}} of Thomas Malet of Enmore, Somerset. He matriculated at University College, Oxford on 18 November 1625, aged 14 and was a student at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1626. He was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1629. During the Civil War, he was a Colonel of dragoons in the Royalist army from 1642 until the surrender of Newark in 1646. He subscribed to the <b>Covenant</b> and the <b>negative</b> oath and compounded at £389 10s. He was in action again in the second Civil War in 1648, and commanded the royalist garrison of Berwick when he became a freeman of Berwick in 1648. He fled abroad and in 1652 his estate was sold by the treason trustee. Later in 1652 he returned to England to work for a restoration as {{one of the leaders of}} the ‘action party. He was arrested on 6 February 1655 and proven to be in contact with the court in exile but he was spared transportation because of ill-health.|$|R
40|$|In this enquiry {{the effect}} of gender on loan sums and {{conditions}} in dutch SME finance has been researched. Detailled information from a local Rabobank was retrieved out of 3, 502 loan applications which were processed during the financial crisis (2009 - 2015). With reference to existing literature not only the level of detail of research data was distinctive, the simultaneous involvement of gender effects among applicants, loan officers and their interrelation (pairs applicant - banker) was as well. In Behavorial Finance theory information asymmetry and psychology play {{an important part in}} limited rational decision making having characteristic differences between male and female. Risk aversion, motivation and intuition could lead to limitation of gender neutrality. There is an important difference between discrimination and permitted differentiation between heterogeneous groups. A sixfold hypothesis test was performed based on OLS-regression of applicants’, bankers’ and pairs’ gender on loan sums, approved part, processing time, interest, commission and fees. For financial and non-financial <b>covenants</b> a <b>Negative</b> Binomial regression analysis was applied for the determination of gender effects in that type of loan conditions. Gender effects were controlled for various loan characteristics and distinguishing marks (identified as the 5 Cs) of financed companies. Results indicated that there were gender differences among applicants, bankers and pairs both with respect to loan and loan conditions. Female applicants obtained lower loan sums and were charged higher commission but on the contrary they were constrained less covenants than their male counterparts. Female loan officers processed their applications quicker, approved higher average loan sums, discounted more interest, but they constrained more covenants per application. Mixed gender pairs differed from pairs consisting of only males by means of less financial covenants and a lower processing time. Negatively significant moderation effects on loan sums and conditions existed caused by poorer reimbursement perspectives, smaller sized companies and applications for working capital and real estate. In many regression models activities in agriculture, horticulture and fishery affected loan conditions in a positive way. Besides the appearance of some singular effects it was argued that results were in accordance with existing literature. Female applicants were expected to apply for lower loan sums because of their motivation to keep their enterprises small and because of their cognitive dissonance when making contracts with uncertain outcome. It was not expected that controlled for company characteristics they would pay higher commissions. Female applicants were favored with respect to processing time and amount of covenants constrained, so {{there was no evidence of}} discrimination. Based on literature about gender differences in risk aversion it was forseen that female loan officers would constrain more covenants in order to monitor better the perceived higher risks. Higher loan sums, interest discounts and lower processing times could therefore only be explained as i) a result from obliqueness in the allocation of applications by sectors applying for higher loan sums, ii) bankers’ freedom in defining loan conditions caused by a lack of decision-making procedures for loan conditions and iii) an intuitively perceived lower risk than calculated by the rating model. Further it was argued that working capital can be recited on a daily basis and real estate finance is often secured by a mortgage which explains the lower numbers of covenants constrained by bankers. The research showed some forms of ceilings in dutch SME finance. There appeared some gender differences, probably caused by behavorial aspects. However, there was no proof of ‘glass’ ceilings (detrimental to females). A remark has to be made that some of the regression models used had little explanatory value and the amount of female cases was relatively small. Nevertheless a recommendation was made in order to limit differentiation. Standardising decision-making rules, linking covenant constraints and unsecured liability to tarification and reviewing the ratingsystem used for start-ups can contribute to more transparancy in dutch SME financial decision making. Additional qualitative research on these topics is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Globally {{management}} agreements {{have emerged}} as more effective in assuring long-term nature conservation on private land, than regulatory mechanisms alone. Restrictive permanent covenants in particular, which are legally binding management agreements in perpetuity, have been adopted in most States and Territories in Australia. However, there is reluctance among landholders to take them up. Sound understanding {{of the factors that}} influence the decisions of landholders regarding the uptake of permanent covenants is important in planning and strategizing for increased covenant uptake. The aim of this thesis is to further this understanding and to support the design of a coordinated covenant mechanism for nature conservation on private lands in Australia. This thesis postulated that the decision of landholders regarding the uptake of permanent covenants could be explained within the theoretical framework of landholders’ adoption of land and agricultural conservation practices and technologies. Three self-administered questionnaires were employed in this study through mail surveys on three groups of landholders in two Australian States (Victoria and Western Australia) : one for permanent covenant holders, another for fixed-term agreement and fixed-term covenant holders in Victoria and Western Australia respectively, and another for non-holders of covenant or agreement holders in both States. Data, both qualitative and quantitative were collected on demographics, social-economics, landholders’ attitudes, and property characteristics. The data analysis included frequency distributions and proportions, analysis of variance, multivariate regression path analysis, and content analysis of written views of landholders on incentives and disincentives for covenant uptake. Landholders’ decisions regarding uptake of a permanent covenant are influenced directly, and/or indirectly by several interactive factors categorised into five non-mutually exclusive constructs: landholders’ confidence in permanent covenant mechanisms, nature conservation ethic, outlook on property rights, level of economic dependence o the property, and nature conservation equity. In both States, there is lack of comprehensive knowledge about permanent <b>covenant,</b> leading to <b>negative</b> perceptions about the purpose, intentions, and ability of permanent covenants to deliver the desired outcomes, and these affect landholders’ confidence in permanent covenants. In addition, misconceptions and misunderstanding abound on the rights attached to private property and the relationship between these rights and permanent covenants. Furthermore, policy measures to compensate for loss of landholders perceived property rights are likely to induce relatively similar measure of response to permanent covenant uptake among all landholder categories. There is a need for clarification of the allotment of property rights over biological resources that have a public good on private property among the different claimants. Voluntary uptake of management agreements mostly attracts the landholders who are least economically dependent on their property and those who have a high conservation ethic and appreciation of conservation values on their property. The presence of the economic dependent category of landholders justifies the use of financial incentives to motivate their uptake of permanent covenants. Recent amendments to the taxation law to address loss in land value are likely to have disproportionate magnitude of impact of conservation policy on different landholder groups, confirming the need for a pre-implementation policy impact assessment on the relevant landholder groups. There is risk of comprehensive policy framework for nature conservation on private land to address the complex issues that affect private conservation efforts. Development of incentive measures that ensure sustained motivation to conserve nature and a gradual shift from compensatory approaches to stewardship support measures are necessary. In views of the trans-generation and transferability of land, programs that promote a nature conservation ethic need to move beyond current landowners to potential future ones. Extension programs can address perceived disadvantages to, and losses to be incurred by landholders caused by, taking up a permanent covenant. Extension programs and policies that clarify the connection between biodiversity on private land, landowners’ goals and aspirations, and the link between human wellbeing and the healthy maintenance of the environment can encourage a value and ethic for nature conservation and in turn motivate the uptake of permanent covenants and land stewardship. Clarification to landholders {{of the importance of the}} biodiversity on a specific property to the overall regional and national biodiversity plans and needs, and the importance and value of a specific landholder’s contribution to conserving biodiversity are necessary to motivate the uptake of permanent covenants...|$|R
