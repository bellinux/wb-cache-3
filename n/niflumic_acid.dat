5000|$|ANO1 is {{expressed}} in the human gastrointestinal epithelium and is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal interstitial cells of Cajal, where it {{plays an important role}} in epithelial chloride secretion mediating intestinal motility. ANO1 blockers like <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> have been shown to block slow waves, which produce motility, in the human intestine. [...] ANO1-knockout mice fail to produce slow waves altogether. Carbachol has been shown to markedly activate the channel; in light of this, it's not surprising that secretory diarrhea is a Carbachol overdose symptom. Crofelemer, an antidiarrhoeal, inhibits this channel. Consequently, ANO1 activation is necessary for normal function of the ICC and its generated pacemaker activity in the smooth muscles of the intestine.|$|E

The therapeutic effects of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well known regarding different diseases. Although there remain {{a number of other}} potential sites of action for anti-inflammatory agents, the mode of action of the NSAIDs is attributed primarily to the inhibition of PG synthesis, and more specifically, to the inhibition of the COX enzyme system. In an effort to gain a deeper insight on the properties of NSAIDs as Indometacine,{ 1 -(4 -chlorobenzoyl) - 5 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1 H-indole- 3 -acetic acid}, Diclofenac,{[2 -(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) amino]-benzeneacetic acid}, and <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acids,</b> { 2 - 3 ((3 -trifluoromethyl) phenylamino) - 3 -pyridinecarboxylic acid}, that will provide knowledge of their action and thus be potentially helpful in the design of new drugs with therapeutic effects, we have performed theoretical studies for the rationale design of their activity mechanism.

Antagonism of NMDA-mediated currents by chlo-ride transport blockers was voltage independent and showed fast on-off kinetics. The action was noncompetitive with NMDA and did not arise from interaction with the Zn 2 inhibitory site, because blockade of NMDA-induced responses by furosemide and Zn 2 was additive.

40|$|Large {{conductance}} calcium-activated K+ (KCa) {{channels are}} rapidly activated by <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> dose-dependently and reversibly. External <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> was about 5 times more potent than internal <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid,</b> and its action {{was characterized by}} an increase in the channel affinity for [Ca 2 +], a parallel left shift of the voltage-activation curve, and a decrease of the channel long-closed states. <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> applied from the external side did not interfere with channel block by charybdotoxin, suggesting that its site of action is not at or near the charybdotoxin receptor.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid,</b> an {{inhibitor}} of calcium-activated chloride currents, {{were compared with}} {{the actions of the}} calcium channel blocker nifedipine on noradrenaline- and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) -induced pressor responses of the rat perfused isolated mesenteric vascular bed. Bolus injections of noradrenaline (1 and 10 [*]nmol) increased the perfusion pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Nifedipine (1 [*]μM) inhibited the increase in pressure produced by 1 [*]nmol noradrenaline by 31 ± 5 %. <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 and 30 [*]μM) also inhibited the noradrenaline-induced increase in perfusion pressure and 30 [*]μM <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> reduced the pressor response to 1 [*]nmol noradrenaline by 34 ± 6 %. The increases in perfusion elicited by 5 -HT (0. 3 and 3 [*]nmol) were reduced by <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 and 30 [*]μM) in a concentration-dependent manner and 30 [*]μM <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited responses to 0. 3 and 3 [*]nmol 5 -HT by, respectively, 49 ± 8 % and 50 ± 7 %. Nifedipine (1 [*]μM) decreased the pressor response to 3 [*]nmol 5 -HT by 44 ± 9 %. In the presence of a combination of 30 [*]μM <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and 1 [*]μM nifedipine the inhibition of the pressor effects of noradrenaline (10 [*]nmol) and 5 -HT (3 [*]nmol) was not significantly greater than with <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (30 [*]μM) alone. Thus the effects of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and nifedipine were not additive. In Ca-free conditions the transient contractions induced by 5 -HT (3 [*]nmol) were not reduced by 30 [*]μM <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid,</b> suggesting that this agent does not inhibit calcium release from the intracellular store or the binding of 5 -HT to its receptor. <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> 30 [*]μM did not inhibit the pressor responses induced by KCl (20 and 60 [*]μmol) which were markedly reduced by 1 [*]μM nifedipine. In addition, 1 [*]μM levcromakalim decreased pressor responses produced by 20 [*]μmol KCl. These data suggest that <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> does not block directly calcium channels or activate potassium channels. It is concluded that <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> selectively reduces a component of noradrenaline- and 5 -HT-induced pressor responses by inhibiting a mechanism which leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. Our data suggest that the Ca 2 +-activated chloride conductance may play a pivotal role in the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels in agonist-induced constriction of resistance blood vessels...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> on the substrate-gated {{currents}} {{mediated by the}} glutamate transporter EAAT 4 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were examined using radiolabelled substrate flux measurements and two-electrode voltage clamp techniques. <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> significantly enhanced the substrate-gated currents in EAAT 4, without affecting the affinity of the substrates towards EAAT 4. At a concentration of 300 μm, <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> caused a 19 ± 5 % reduction in l-[3 H]glutamate uptake and no {{significant effect on the}} uptake of dl-[3 H]aspartate. Thus, enhancement of the substrate-gated currents in EAAT 4 does not correlate with the rate of substrate transport and suggests that the niflumic acid-induced currents are not thermodynamically coupled to the transport of substrate. <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and arachidonic acid co-applied with substrate to EAAT 4 -expressing oocytes had similar functional consequences. However, <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> still enhanced the l-glutamate-gated current to the same extent in the presence and absence of a saturating dose of arachidonic acid, which suggests that the sites of action of the two compounds are distinct. The EAAT 4 -mediated currents for the two substrates, l-glutamate and l-aspartate, were not enhanced equally by addition of the same dose of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and the ionic composition of the niflumic acid-induced currents was not the same for the two substrates. Protons carry the l-glutamate-gated niflumic acid-induced current and both protons and chloride ions carry the l-aspartate-gated niflumic acid-induced current. These results show that <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> can be used to probe the functional aspects of EAAT 4 and that <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and other non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs could be used {{as the basis for the}} development of novel modulators of glutamate transporters...|$|E
40|$|<b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> is a noncompetitive {{inhibitor}} of chloride exchange, which binds {{to a site}} {{different from}} the transport or modifier sites. When the internal Cl- concentration is raised, at constant extracellular Cl-, the inhibitory potency of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> increases. This effect cannot be attributed to changes in membrane potential, but rather it suggests that <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> binds to the anion exchange protein band 3 only when the transport site faces outward. When the chloride gradient is reversed, with Clo greater than Cli, the inhibitory potency of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> decreases greatly, which indicates that the affinity of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> for band 3 with the transport site facing inward is almost 50 times less than when the transport site faces outward. Experiments in which Cli = Clo show no {{significant change in the}} inhibition by <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> when Cl- is lowered from 150 to 10 mM. These data suggest that the intrinsic dissociation constants for Cl- at {{the two sides of the}} membrane are nearly equal. Thus, the chloride- loaded transport sites have an asymmetric orientation like that of the unloaded transport sites, with approximately 15 times more sites facing the inside than the outside. The asymmetry reflects an approximately 1. 5 kcal/mol free energy difference between the inward-facing and outward-facing chloride-loaded forms of band 3. High concentrations of chloride (with Cli = Clo), which partially saturate the modifier site, have no effect on <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibition, which indicates that chloride binds equally well to the modifier site regardless of the orientation of the transport site...|$|E

40|$|Many new {{pharmaceuticals}} {{have low}} water solubility, hampering their pharmaceutical activity upon administering. One approach to increase solution concentrations during drug administration {{is to increase}} the surface-to-volume ratio by decreasing the crystal product size. Sub-micrometer-sized <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> crystals were produced by electrospray crystallization. Electrospray crystallization uses a high potential difference to create a mist of ultrafine charged solution droplets.

In the absence of excipients, for the sub-micrometer-sized <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> no significantly different dissolution profile compared to the conventional one was measured. However, if excipients were added, the dissolution rate for the sub-micrometer-sized product increases substantially in stimulated gastric juice, while that of the conventional product increased slightly.

The original dependent variable, ln α 2 /U, where α is the activity coefficient and U {{is related to}} the molar volume of the solute and the volume fraction of the solvent, was compared with the direct use of the logarithm of the mole fraction solubility ln X 2 in the three- and four parameter models. The activity coefficient of the drugs was calculated from the heat and temperature of fusion before and after equilibration of each solid phase with the pure solvents used. The dependent variables ln X 2 and ln α 2 /U provided similar partial solubility parameter values for piroxicam with the four parameter model. All the partial parameters of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> were significant statistically only with the variable ln X 2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spontaneous rhythmic and oxytocin-induced contractile activities of gravid rat myometrium in the presence and absence of Cl- (in the bathing medium) were studied in a tissue bath system. The effects of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (a Cl- channel blocker) on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced contractile activities were also delineated. RESULTS: Replacement of Cl [...] containing Tyrode solution with Cl [...] free medium caused transient increase in myometrial contractile tone for about 15 min (possibly due to rapid efflux of Cl-) after which gradual failure of the spontaneous contractions led to myometrial quiescence within 1 h. Normal spontaneous contractions returned after replacing Cl [...] free medium with Tyrode solution. In Cl [...] free medium, oxytocin-induced contractions of the myometrium were significantly reduced by 44 &#x 00 B 1; 9 &#x 0025;. <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (30 &#x 00 B 5;M) caused an increase in myometrial contractile tone for about 10 min followed by time-dependent inhibition of spontaneous contractions of the rat myometrium.

SNP produced concentration-dependent contractions of oesophageal longitudinal smooth muscle with an EC 50 of 239. 6 ± 78. 2 μm (mean ±s. e. m., n = 10). Maximal contraction induced by SNP (1 mm) was about 75. 5 ± 8. 5 % (n = 10) of the 60 mm KCl-induced contraction. The SNP-induced contraction was resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μm), but abolished by nifedipine (1 μm), {{as well as}} by <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (300 μm) and 9 -anthroic acid (9 -AC; 1 mm), Ca 2 +-activated Cl− channel blockers. DETA/NO at concentrations of 100 and 500 μm induced 83. 1 ± 24. 4 and 104. 1 ± 34. 9 % of the 60 mm KCl-induced contraction (n = 4), respectively, which was abolished by nifedipine (1 μm), <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (300 μm) and 9 -AC (1 mm). Pre-application of 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxidiazolo[4, 3,-α]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) (10 μm), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, significantly inhibited the SNP-induced contraction, whereas 8 -bromo-cGMP (1 mm), a membrane-permeable analogue of cGMP, mimicked the SNP-induced contraction. Intracellular recordings revealed that SNP (300 μm) depolarized resting membrane potentials (RMPs) and increased the frequency of spontaneous spike-like action potentials. However, these electrical alterations were eliminated by pretreatment with <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (300 μm).

In the present study we investigated the effect of osmotic changes on cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]c) and pH (pHi) of isolated chemoreceptor cells of the rat carotid body. In CO 2 /HCO 3 −-buffered medium, reduction of osmolality from the control level of 300 mosmol kg− 1 to 250 – 285 mosmol kg− 1 resulted in a rise in [Ca 2 +]c, as measured with Indo- 1, whereas elevation of osmolality to 350 mosmol kg− 1 had no effect. The Ca 2 + response required extracellular Ca 2 + and was reduced by application of the L-type Ca 2 + channel antagonist nifedipine (10 μm). The hyposmosis-induced Ca 2 + response could be prevented by application of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (300 μm), an inhibitor of the swelling-activated Cl− channel. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> abolished the swelling-activated Cl− current but only slightly depressed the Ca 2 + current. The inhibition of Ca 2 + current by <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> does not account for its action in preventing of hyposmosis-induced Ca 2 + response, which seems to be initiated by Cl−-mediated depolarisation. Withdrawal of CO 2 /HCO 3 − also prevented the Ca 2 + response.

Isometric tension was recorded from endothelium-denuded rat intrapulmonary artery rings (i. d. 200 - 500 µm) mounted on a wire myograph. The I(Cl,Ca) blockers, <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid and the Ca(v) 1. 2 channel blocker, nifedipine, reduced peak amplitude of contractions evoked by UTP and UDP by ∼ 45 - 50 % and in a non-additive manner. Ca(2 +) -free buffer inhibited responses by ∼ 70 %. <b>Niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and nifedipine similarly depressed contractions to ATP, but Ca(2 +) -free buffer almost abolished the response. After peaking, contractions to UTP and UDP decayed slowly by 50 - 70 % to a sustained plateau, which was rapidly inhibited by <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and nifedipine. Contractions to ATP, however, reversed rapidly and fully. Tannic acid contracted tissues per se and potentiated nucleotide-evoked contractions. I (Cl,Ca) and Ca(2 +) influx via Ca(v) 1. 2 ion channels contribute substantially and equally to contractions of rat intrapulmonary arteries evoked by UTP and UDP, via P 2 Y receptors. ATP also activates these mechanisms via P 2 Y receptors, but the greater dependence on extracellular Ca(2 +) most likely reflects additional influx through the P 2 X 1 receptor pore. The lack of a sustained response to ATP is probably due to it acting at P 2 receptor subtypes that desensitize rapidly.

40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{have been}} shown to amplify the heat shock response in cell lines by increasing the binding of heat shock transcription factor– 1 to heat shock elements within heat shock gene promoters. Because overexpression of the inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) was neuroprotective in a culture model of motor neuron disease, this study investigated whether NSAIDs induce Hsp 70 and confer cytoprotection in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures exposed to various stresses. Two NSAIDs, sodium salicylate and <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid,</b> lowered the temperature threshold for induction of Hsp 70 in glia but failed to do so in motor neurons. At concentrations that increased Hsp 70 in heat shocked glial cells, sodium salicylate failed to delay death of motor neurons exposed to hyperthermia, paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Neither sodium salicylate nor the cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor, <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid,</b> protected motor neurons from the toxicity of mutated Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD- 1) linked to a familial form of the motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

40|$|Although Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) is {{essential}} for mouse ovulation, fertilization, implantation and decidualization, the regulation and function of COX- 2 in rat reproduction are still unknown. This {{study was designed to}} examine the action of COX- 2 in rat ovulation, implantation and decidualization by using two specific inhibitors of COX- 2 (nimesulide and <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid).</b> Compared to control, either nimesulide or <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> significantly inhibited the ovulation in the superovulated rats. Although nimesulide had no obvious effects on the number of implantation sites and the vascular permeability, the expression of PPARdelta, HB- EGF and vimentin proteins was down- regulated in the nimesulide- treated groups. COX- 1 protein was upregulated by nimesulide treatment. Nimesulide also had an inhibitory effect on decidualization during early pregnancy and under artificial decidualization. Moreover, nimesulide caused the increase of the gestation period and the reduction of litter size and birth weight compared to controls. Based on our data, rat implantation and decidualization were delayed by nimesulide treatment, resulting in the reduction of litter size and birth weight and the prolongation of gestational length, suggesting that COX- 2 {{plays an important role in}} implantation and decidualization...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to produce <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> nanoparticles without using an organic solvent, in order to achieve an increased rate of dissolution of the final products. Co-grinding with excipients was used to decrease the particle size. Poloxamer 188 (P) and mannitol (M) applied as co-grinding materials stabilized the system, preventing aggregation of the nanocrystals. The morphology and particle size distribution of the products were visualized by using scanning elec-tron microscopy and laser diffraction. The crystalline states of the samples were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. The rate of dissolution of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> was measured with a paddle method from simulated media.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the roles of}} anion channels and ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein transporters in mediating elicitor-induced ATP release in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures. The elicitor-induced ATP release was effectively blocked by two putative membrane anion channel blockers, <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and Zn 2 +, but not by a specific Cl - channel blocker, phenylanthranilic acid. The elicitor-induced ATP release was also significantly suppressed by two ABC inhibitors, glibenclamide and ethacrynic acid. Notable ATP release from the hairy roots was also induced by verapamil (2 mM), an ABC activator in animal cells. The verapamil-induced ATP release was effectively blocked by <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid,</b> but only slightly inhibited by the ABC inhibitors. Another notable effect of verapamil was the induction of exocytosis, the secretion of vesicle-like particles to the root surface. The verapamil-induced exocytosis was not inhibited by nifulumic acid and YE did not induce the exocytosis. Overall, the results suggest a significant role of anion channels, a possible involvement of ABC proteins and no significant involvement of exocytosis in mediating the ATP efflux in hairy root cells.

40|$|Abstract This study {{describes}} for {{the first}} time results of a 19 F-MRS study on humans exposed to the fluorinated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid.</b> The accumulation and elimination of this commercially available selective prostaglandin synthase inhibitor is studied after an oral bolus in the human liver, in blood plasma and in urine samples. The in vivo spectra of the liver display two resonances with a similar increase in signal intensity during the investigation period of 240  min. One resonance refers to the parent compound <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (P), whereas the second resonance corresponds to a metabolite (M 1) formed by the biotransformation by liver enzymes. The spectroscopic comparison with model compounds suggests 4 ′-hydroxyniflumic acid as the metabolite. During the entire experiment the concentration ratios of these resonances (P/M 1) ranged between 0. 7 and 0. 9, indicating a high metabolite concentration most probably due to an efficient first pass metabolism. Both resonances (P, M 1) were observed in the in vitro study of the blood plasma samples after plasma protein denaturation. However, in comparison to the liver spectra, the amount of the metabolite M 1 is very small with a P/M 1 -ratio of 36. 6 after 90  min and 16. 1 after the end of measurement. This finding suggests an efficient biliary excretion of the metabolite M 1, which bypasses the blood circulation system. Both resonances are also identified in the native urine samples. The signal intensity of the parent compound dominates the spectra of all urine samples, whereas the signal intensity of M 1 increases slowly reaching a similar value to the parent compound P {{at the end of the}} measurement. This observation demonstrates an effective renal elimination of <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> and suggests the existence of an enterohepatic circuit with a re-entry mechanism for the biliary excreted metabolite M 1.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} nifedipine (L-type of calcium channel blocker), glibenclamide [cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel blocker], <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (chloride channels blocker) and 2 -aminoethyldiphenyl borate (calcium releaseactivated channels channel blocker) against chemically induced inflammatory bowel disease in male Wistar rats. Methods: Inflammatory bowel disease was induced by the administration of 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid intracolonically. Animals were divided into 7 groups by keeping 6 animals in each group. Group one and two were treated as normal control and disease control, respectively and seven pretreated with sulfasalazine and remaining groups were treated with test drugs. Animals were pretreated for 5 days before administration of 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Various parameters were recorded during and after treatment period like disease activity index (body weight, food intake, diarrhea score, occult blood score), biomarkers study in peritoneal macrophages and histopathology of colon. Results: Glibenclamide had offered significant protective effect on disease activity index, biochemical parameters confirmed by histopathological examination. 2 -Aminoethyldiphenyl borate and <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> had also shown insignificant protection in few parameters. Conclusions: Protection observed by pretreatment of glibenclamide is may be of its blocking effect of CFTR channels of the mast cells, which regulate chloride influx and efflux phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal gap {{junctions}} {{are receiving}} increasing attention as a physiological means of intercellular communication, yet {{our understanding of}} them is poorly developed when compared to synaptic communication. Using microfluorimetry, we demonstrate that differentiation of SN 56 cells (hybridoma cells derived from murine septal neurones) leads to the spontaneous generation of Ca(2 +) waves. These waves were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (1 microM), but blocked by removal of extracellular Ca(2 +), or addition of non-specific Ca(2 +) channel inhibitors (Cd(2 +) (0. 1 mM) or Ni(2 +) (1 mM)). Combined application of antagonists of NMDA receptors (AP 5; 100 microM), AMPA/kainate receptors (NBQX; 20 microM), nicotinic AChR receptors (hexamethonium; 100 microM) or inotropic purinoceptors (brilliant blue; 100 nM) was also without effect. However, Ca(2 +) waves were fully prevented by carbenoxolone (200 microM), halothane (3 mM) or <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid</b> (100 microM), three structurally diverse inhibitors of gap junctions, and mRNA for connexin 36 was detected by PCR. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed spontaneous inward currents in voltage-clamped cells which we inhibited by Cd(2 +), Ni(2 +) or <b>niflumic</b> <b>acid.</b> Our data suggest that differentiated SN 56 cells generated spontaneous Ca(2 +) waves which are propagated by intercellular gap junctions.
