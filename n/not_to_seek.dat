5|$|Ford chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> a fifth term in 1998, {{and retired}} to Owensboro. He {{worked for a}} time as a {{consultant}} to Washington lobbying and law firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky. At the time of his retirement, Ford was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. In January 2009, Mitch McConnell surpassed Ford's mark of 24 years in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Johnson decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> a {{third term}} as governor, with an eye towards {{election}} to the U.S. Senate. In 1857, while returning from Washington, his train derailed, causing serious damage to his right arm. This injury would trouble him {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|Paul Harpole (born 1950) is an American {{politician}} and businessman {{who served as}} the Mayor of Amarillo, Texas, the largest city in the Texas Panhandle, from May 2011 to May 2017. He chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election in 2017. Before serving as mayor, Harpole was an Amarillo City Councilmember from May 2005 to May 2007.|$|E

5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E
5|$|Bedell decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> {{reelection in}} 1986 after {{contracting}} Lyme Disease from a tick bite. Since then, he has founded {{a center for}} alternative medicine and is a noted advocate of health freedom. Due largely to his friendship with Tom Harkin, he remains an important political figure in Iowa, with politicians such as Howard Dean meeting him in their trips to the state. Also, the Elinor Bedell State Park was established in 1998 on land donated by Berkley and Elinor Bedell. The park is named after the Congressman's wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Morrow {{was chosen}} as the Republican {{candidate}} for the Senate seat of Thomas Paynter. Paynter had decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election, and the Democrats nominated Ollie M. James of Crittenden County. The General Assembly was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105–28. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Mason's {{political}} views prior to the 1760s, {{when he came to}} oppose British colonial policies. In 1758, Mason successfully ran for the House of Burgesses when George William Fairfax, holder of one of Fairfax County's two seats, chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election. Also elected were Mason's brother Thomson (for Stafford County), George Washington (for Frederick County where he was stationed as commander of Virginia's militia as the French and Indian War continued) and Richard Henry Lee, who would work closely with Mason through their careers.|$|E
5|$|Morrow was {{frequently}} {{mentioned as a}} potential candidate for vice president in 1920, but he withdrew his name from consideration, sticking to a campaign promise <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> a higher office while governor. On July 27, 1920, he made a speech in Northampton, Massachusetts, officially notifying Calvin Coolidge of his nomination for that office. Although he supported Frank O. Lowden for president, the nomination went to Warren G. Harding, and Morrow campaigned vigorously {{on behalf of his}} party's ticket.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided to Democratic Congressional leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election.|$|E

5000|$|The main ethical issue {{involved}} in jury nullification is {{the tension between}} democratic self-government and integrity. The argument has been raised that prosecutors are <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> jury nullification, and therefore defendants should <b>not</b> be allowed <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> it either. However, for a prosecutor to nullify a jury in this context would require negating the presumption of innocence. (For this reason, prosecutorial nullification is typically defined as declination to prosecute.) ...|$|R
5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E
5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
5|$|Eventually Shaw {{was driven}} to {{applying}} for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing. His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel, Immaturity (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879–80, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> {{a place in the}} new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament {{on the advice}} of his doctors, and also decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to make himself available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan replied that he could not absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} Governor Nunn's term approaching, a rivalry for {{leadership}} of the state Democratic party developed between Lieutenant Governor Wendell H. Ford, who had served as Combs' chief administrative assistant during his gubernatorial term, and Julian M. Carroll, speaker of the state House of Representatives. As soon as Combs resigned from the Court of Appeals, Democratic leaders began asking him to seek the party's gubernatorial nomination in 1971, uniting the party behind him rather than splintering it between Ford and Carroll. In June 1970, Carroll announced his intent to run for lieutenant governor, indicating {{that he would like}} to serve under Combs as governor. While Combs considered whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> the nomination, Ford declared his candidacy. Days later, Combs also entered the race.|$|E

5|$|As a Republican {{governor}} with a Democratic legislature, Hayes had {{a limited}} role in governing, especially since Ohio's governor had no veto power. Despite these constraints, Hayes oversaw {{the establishment of}} a school for deaf-mutes and a reform school for girls. He endorsed the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and urged his conviction, which failed by one vote in the United States Senate. Nominated for a second term in 1869, Hayes campaigned again for equal rights for black Ohioans and sought to associate his Democratic opponent, George H. Pendleton with disunion and Confederate sympathies. Hayes was re-elected with an increased majority, and the Republicans took the legislature, ensuring Ohio's ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guaranteed black (male) suffrage. With a Republican legislature, Hayes's second term was more enjoyable. Suffrage was expanded and a state Agricultural and Mechanical College (later to become The Ohio State University) established. He also proposed a reduction in state taxes and reform of the state prison system. Choosing <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election, Hayes looked forward to retiring from politics in 1872.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Willson {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. From 1910 to 1919, he served on the Harvard University Board of Overseers. In 1914, he was {{a candidate for the}} Senate seat of Johnson Camden. It was the state's first senatorial election since passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, meaning the seat would be filled by popular vote rather than by a vote of the legislature. The seat had originally belonged to former governor Bradley, who had died in office. Governor McCreary appointed Camden to fill the unexpired term, but Camden had agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> re-election so that J. C. W. Beckham could run for the seat. In the Republican primary, Willson defeated Richard P. Ernst. In the general election, the unpopularity of Willson's gubernatorial administration combined with the overwhelming popularity of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, ensured that Beckham won the seat by more than 32,000 votes. This campaign was Willson's last. He died on August 24, 1931, and is buried in the Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.|$|E
