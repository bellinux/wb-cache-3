25|$|Unicode {{deals with}} variant {{characters}} in a complex manner, {{as a result of}} the process of Han unification. In Han unification, some variants that are nearly identical between Chinese-, Japanese-, Korean-speaking regions are encoded in the same code point, and can only be distinguished using different typefaces. Other variants that are more divergent are encoded in different code points. On web pages, displaying the correct variants for the intended language is dependent on the typefaces installed on the computer, the configuration of the web browser and the language tags of web pages. Systems that are ready to display the correct variants are rare because many computer users do not have standard typefaces installed and the most popular web browsers are <b>not</b> <b>configured</b> to display the correct variants by default.|$|E
25|$|Forward secrecy is a {{property}} of cryptographic systems which ensures that a session key {{derived from a}} set {{of public and private}} keys will not be compromised if one of the private keys is compromised in the future. Without forward secrecy, if the server's private key is compromised, not only will all future TLS-encrypted sessions using that server certificate be compromised, but also any past sessions that used it as well (provided of course that these past sessions were intercepted and stored at the time of transmission). An implementation of TLS can provide forward secrecy by requiring the use of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish session keys, and some notable TLS implementations do so exclusively: e.g., Gmail and other Google HTTPS services that use OpenSSL. However, many clients and servers supporting TLS (including browsers and web servers) are <b>not</b> <b>configured</b> to implement such restrictions. In practice, unless a web service uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange to implement forward secrecy, all of the encrypted web traffic to and from that service can be decrypted by a third party if it obtains the server's master (private) key; e.g., by means of a court order.|$|E

500|$|A {{separate}} {{entry block}} was planned, {{adjacent to the}} Villy Est casemate. The underground gallery system at La Ferté is simple, limited to a gallery linking the two blocks, which were initially designed to function as separate units with separate generating plants and ventilation facilities in each block. The [...] gallery contained some shared facilities, such as a kitchen, a laundry and an infirmary, at an average depth of [...] below the surface. The gallery's small size made it most useful as a link, rather than as the garrison, magazine, command post and long-term shelter afforded by the gallery systems of most Maginot ouvrages. Unlike most ouvrages, La Ferté's living spaces were near the surface in the two combat blocks. A more typical Maginot position would have such spaces under [...] of earth or rock cover. Unlike many Maginot positions, the main drain at La Ferté was <b>not</b> <b>configured</b> as an emergency exit.

2500|$|Both the landing-gear {{issue and}} the {{concerns}} regarding speed made the captain focus {{on the possibility of}} a missed approach and the major inconvenience of diverting to Las Vegas. It was the commission's impression that the captain failed to properly monitor the approach, and crew resource management broke down. He failed to give proper instructions to the first officer and failed to carry out instructions from the first officer, which moved the first officer's attention away from his task of monitoring the flight instruments. The situation was worsened by the crew attempting to fly at [...] when the aircraft was <b>not</b> <b>configured</b> for that speed. These factors created a situation in which neither pilot was monitoring the altitude. There was also an shortcoming in the approach chart, which did not display a minimum altitude at Del Rey Intersection. This would have given the pilots an opportunity to correct the aircraft's altitude.|$|E
