40|$|The {{problematic}} conoidean genus Raphitoma s. l. in inshore <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> is revised {{based on}} fresh material from {{all along the}} coast of Norway. This largely shallow water group is represented by at least six species in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> which two, Raphitoma obesa n. sp. and R. maculosa n. sp. are described as new, and another Raphitoma aequalis (Jeffreys, 1867) is reported from Norway for the first time. The taxonomic and nomenclatural status of R. reticulata (sensu Jeffreys 1867) and R. asperrima (sensu Forbes & Hanley 1853) are discussed. Empty shells of several additional species indicate that the number of Raphitoma-species living in the North East Atlantic will be further increased in the future. The morphological variability of each species is described if possible. Shell morphology, including microsculpture and protoconch details as deduced from LM photographs, are used for distinguishing the species. Some easily observable behaviour and soft part morphology features were found to be promising areas for further studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract At least 85 mammal species (including 28 marine species) {{occur in}} Norway and <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters,</b> <b>of</b> which 18 species {{currently}} are {{listed on the}} Norwegian Red List (Storkersen, 1992). Canis lupus is considered "Endangered", Ursus major, Gulo gulo and Lutra lutra are listed as "Vulnerable", Mustela putorius and Sicista betulina as "Rare", Alopex lagopus as "Indeterminate", {{and a number of}} species, mostly bats, are "Insufficiently known". A revised list is under preparation. At least 8 species have reached the country solely through intentional or accidental releases in Norway or neighbouring countries. Many species' distribution are not well known. The Norwegian Zoological Society started a mammal atlas project in 1993, based on squares of 10 x 10 km. Data collected for this project have also been presented to the EMMA project...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Norwegian government had mobilized parts of the Norwegian Army and all but two of the Royal Norwegian Navy's warships. The Norwegian Army Air Service and the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service were also called up to protect Norwegian neutrality from violations by the warring countries. The first such violations were the sinkings in <b>Norwegian</b> territorial <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> several British ships by German U-boats. In the following months aircraft from all the belligerents violated Norwegian neutrality.|$|R

The four global populations are North Pacific, Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean populations. These populations are distinct. Although the species has {{cosmopolitan}} distribution and is usually not considered to cross the equator line, seasonal observations at Cape Verde suggest possible interactions among populations from both hemispheres.

40|$|Since tagging of grey {{seals in}} Great Britain was {{initiated}} in 1951, {{a total of}} 61 seals has been recovered in coastal <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters.</b> Most <b>of</b> the recovered seals had been tagged at the Orkney (35 recoveries) and the Farne Islands (17 recoveries) and captured in fishing gear on the southwestern coast of Norway. Recovery rates are highest from the Orkney and Shetland breeding stocks (about 12 and 10 per thousand). Among the total of 61 recoveries, 58 were recovered within six months after tagging, two after three years and one after five years. We assume that after arriving in coastal <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters,</b> the British grey seals are equally vulnerable to recovery as Norwegian grey seals of the same age. Using a known recovery rate of Norwegian grey seals, the total immigration from Great Britain {{is estimated to be}} about 14300 seals through the period 1960 - 1981 with an average of about 650 seals per year. There is no indication in the available information that British grey seals are recruiting to Norwegian breeding stocks or establishing new breeding colonies on the Norwegian coast...|$|R

40|$|Effects of minimum landing size (LC) in {{the fishery}} of Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} herring have been investigated. The herring {{is assumed to}} be a unit stock, in which the growth of immatures differs according to the distribution area. Two immature stock components are distinguished. One distributed in <b>Norwegian</b> coastal <b>waters</b> south <b>of</b> 70 degrees north and one off Northern Norway and in the Barents Sea. Stock and yield per recruit for two corresponding stock components were calculated (ICES standard programmes) using input parameters as observed in the respective areas. The weight in catch by age of immatures is set equal to that observed in autumn catches (expected to be the main fishing season of immatures) whereas the weight in catch of adults is the average over the year. The weight by age in the stock equals observed weight of prespawners. The maturity ogive by component is calculated by using the length dependent maturing scale described by Toresen (1986). The assessment shows that if this stock is managed at Foal, there is little to gain in yield and stock per recruit by introducing a mifimum landing size above 20 cm in <b>Norwegian</b> coastal <b>waters</b> (south <b>of</b> 70 N), whereas some increase in yield may be obtained in the Barents Sea...|$|R
40|$|Most {{available}} {{knowledge about}} northeast Atlantic humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) {{is based on}} information and experience gained during the pioneer period of modern whaling in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> in 1868 - 1904 when almost 1, 500 animals were taken. A literature review reveals that these humpbacks stayed in their northern feeding areas {{during most of the}} year (May-January), migrating out only during a short period in spring for breeding purposes. Recent incidental sightings data confirm these migration patterns. Seemingly, euphauciid crustaceans were their main prey items when they arrived in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> (mainly in the Bear Island area) in late spring, whereas capelin (Mallotus villosus) became more and more important throughout the season when the humpbacks proceeded eastwards into the Barents Sea. The collapse in the Barents Sea capelin stock may have contributed to a reduction in these eastwards autumn migrations after 1985. The humpback's breeding migration in early spring were observed to be directed westwards from the Barents Sea and towards the Norwegian Sea, but the migration routes and the localisation of the breeding areas were and are still unknown. Between 1904 and 1955, when the humpback was given total protection in the North Atlantic, less than 50 humpbacks were caught in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters.</b> The number <b>of</b> humpbacks in the northeast Atlantic has probably never been large. Results from more extensive sightings surveys in 1988 and 1989 seem to indicate a present abundance of about 1, 000 humpback whales in <b>Norwegian</b> and adjacent <b>waters...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the {{northeast}} Atlantic, management advice for fisheries is usually based on Virtual Population Analysis, yield per recruit, and predictions of catch and biomass. For these calculations, age distributions and weigth-at-age from commercial catches are essential. The process of sampling, age reading, and {{preparation of the}} data is time consuming and expensive. It is therefore important to find the optimum strategy for a sampling program. North-East Arctic cod, haddock and saithe are the three major demersal stocks in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> north <b>of</b> 62 °N. Sampling of Norwegian catches in coastal areas are based on 96 statistical units (gear, area, time) for each species. A model was made to simulate the stocks and exploitation in the period 1979 - 1983. The basis for the model was the observation that averaging the length frequency distribution of catches from a statistical unit over some years gave a smooth curve which could be approximated by a LOG-normal distribution. The results indicate that sampling may be omitted {{in most of the}} units without severe consequences for management advice. More length than age sampling is required...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{diversity}} and distribution of Owenia species in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> are discussed. Owenia fusiformis and the Owenia genus {{has gone through a}} turbulent history, with authors describing several new species, while other researchers have disagreed, resulting in many described species being synonymized with O. fusiformis. <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> are no exception, and the majority of samples in natural history collections are still referred to as Owenia fusiformis. In this study both morphological and molecular methods will be used to solve the issue regarding the true identity <b>of</b> Owenia in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters.</b> Along with morphological character two genes, COI and ITS 1, was sequenced and analyzed. COI proved {{to be very difficult to}} extract and amplify successfully for one group of specimens, from which no successful sequences were obtained, while being relatively unproblematic in other groups, leading the question if the COI primers are accurate enough. ITS 1 was unproblematic to amplify and sequence, but due to highly variable sequences, a lot of effort was needed to analyze the dataset. Morphological characters proved to exhibit high degrees of the variation, resulting in most of the defined characters being useless in differentiating between the species. Still, enough useful morphologic characters, the best one being the methyl blue staining pattern, were defined, making it possible to distinguish between different species occurring in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters.</b> This being congruent with the molecular results, led to the conclusion that at least two different species of Owenia is present in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters,</b> Owenia borealis Koh, Bhaud & Jirkov, 2003 and Owenia polaris Koh, Bhaud & Jirkov, with results also suggesting there might be more. Type specimens of Owenia assimilis (Sars, 1851) were also examined, concluding with this probably being identical to O. borealis, although the possibility of the type material being more than one species, leads to this being an open question, in need of more research before an answer can be given. Specimens from the O. fusiformis type locality were also examined, concluding with the presence of the true O. fusiformis in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> being highly unlikely...|$|R
