40|$|Abstract Background <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} in Sinorhizobium meliloti, the alfalfa symbiont, {{depends on a}} cascade of regulation that involves {{both positive and negative}} control. On top of the cascade, the two-component regulatory system FixLJ is activated under the microoxic conditions of the nodule. In addition, activity of the FixLJ system is inhibited by a specific anti-kinase protein, FixT. The physiological significance of this negative regulation by FixT was so far unknown. Results We have isolated by random Tn 5 mutagenesis a S. meliloti mutant strain that escapes repression by FixT. Complementation test and DNA analysis revealed that inactivation of an asparagine synthetase-like gene was responsible for the phenotype of the mutant. This gene, that was named asnO, encodes a protein homologous to glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetases. The asnO gene did not appear to affect asparagine biosynthesis and may instead serve a regulatory function in S. meliloti. We provide evidence that asnO is active during symbiosis. Conclusions Isolation of the asnO mutant argues for the existence of a physiological regulation associated with fixT and makes it unlikely that fixT serves a mere homeostatic function in S. meliloti. Our data suggest that asnO might control activity of the FixT protein, in a way that remains to be elucidated. A proposed role for asnO might be to couple <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression in}} S. meliloti to the nitrogen needs of the cells. </p...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the {{dimethylsulfoxide}} respiratory (dor) operon of Rhodobacter {{is regulated}} by oxygen, light intensity {{and availability of}} substrate. Since dimethylsulfoxide reductase contains a pterin molybdenum cofactor, the role of molybdate in the regulation of dor operon expression was investigated, In this report we show that the molybdate-responsive transcriptional regulator, MopB, and molybdate are essential for maximal dimethylsulfoxide reductase activity and expression of a dorA::lacZ transcriptional fusion in Rhodobacter capsulatus. In contrast, mop genes are not required {{for the expression of}} the periplasmic nitrate reductase or xanthine dehydrogenase in R. capsulatus under conditions of molybdenum sufficiency. This is the first report demonstrating a clear functional difference between the ModE homologues MopB and MopA in this bacterium. The results suggest that MopA is primarily involved in the regulation of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> expression in response to molybdate while MopB has a role in nitrogen fixation and dimethylsulfoxide respiration.

A coding region for two polypeptides of 68 K and 66 K was mapped using Tn 5 insertions and hybrid fusion polypeptides.

Plasmids, constitutively expressing this fixD gene from vector promoters, activated a nifHD-lacZ fusion in E. coli at a low level. Higher levels of activation were obtained following an enhanced expression of the fixD gene in plasmid pRmW 541 which was achieved by inducing deletions between the vector promoter and the fixD gene. Sequencing of these deletion mutants showed that, in most cases, fusion polypeptides of the fixD gene product and the aphI (aminoglycoside- 3 '-phosphotransferase) gene product were sufficient for activation.

40|$|The nifLA operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae {{codes for}} the two {{antagonistic}} regulatory proteins which control expression of all other <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes.</b> NifA is a transcriptional activator, and NifL inhibits NifA. The importance of a correct NifL-NifA stoichiometry for efficient regulation of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes</b> has been investigated by constructing a strain with an altered nifL-nifA gene dosage ratio, resulting from the integration of an extra copy of nifA. Results showed that a balanced synthesis of both gene products is essential for correct regulation. Effects of mutations provoking translation termination of nifL upstream or downstream of its natural stop codon, combined with overproduction of both proteins when the genes are transcribed and translated from signals of the f 10 gene of the phage T 7, showed that, {{in addition to the}} previously reported transcriptional polarity, there is translational coupling between nifL and nifA. In spite of the apparently efficient ribosome binding site of nifA, its rate of independent translation is very low. This is due to a secondary structure masking the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of nifA, which could be melted by ribosomes translating nifL. Mutational analysis confirmed the functional significance of the secondary structure in preventing independent translation of nifA. Translational coupling between the two cistrons is proposed as an efficient mechanism to prevent production of an excess of NifA, which would affect the normal regulation of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes.</b> Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología BIO 93 - 0407 El MonteJunta de AndalucíaMinisterio de Educación y Ciencia (España...|$|R

Basic transcription in the Archaea resembles eucaryal transcription. However, little is known about transcriptional regulation. We have taken an in vivo approach, using genetics to address transcriptional regulation in the methanogenic Archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis. We identified a repressor binding site that regulates nif (<b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation)</b> <b>gene</b> expression. The repressor binding site was palindromic (an inverted repeat) and was located just after the transcription start site of nifH. Mutations that changed the sequence of the palindrome resulted in marked decreases in repression by ammonia, even when the palindromic nature of the site was retained. The same mutations greatly decreased binding to the site by components of cell extract. These results provide the first partial description of a transcriptional regulatory mechanism in the methanogenic Archaea.

40|$|Transcription of {{the genes}} that code for {{proteins}} involved in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> in free-living diazotrophs is typically repressed by high internal oxygen concentrations or exogenous fixed nitrogen. The DNA sequence of a regulatory locus required for repression of Rhodobacter capsulatus <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes</b> was determined. It was shown that this locus, defined by Tn 5 insertions and by ethyl methanesulfonate-derived mutations, is homologous to the glnB gene of other organisms. The R. capsulatus glnB gene was upstream of glnA, the gene for glutamine synthetase, in a glnBA operon. beta-Galactosidase expression from an R. capsulatus glnBA-lacZ translational fusion was increased twofold in cells induced by nitrogen limitation relative to that in cells under nitrogen-sufficient conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{metabolic}} {{capacity for}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> {{is known to}} be present in several prokaryotic species scattered across taxonomic groups. Experimental detection of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> in microbes requires species-specific conditions, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive census of this trait. The recent and rapid increase in the availability of microbial genome sequences affords novel opportunities to re-examine the occurrence and distribution of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes.</b> The current practice for computational prediction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> is to use the presence of the nifH and/or nifD genes. Results Based on a careful comparison of the repertoire of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes</b> in known diazotroph species we propose a new criterion for computational prediction of nitrogen fixation: the presence of a minimum set of six genes coding for structural and biosynthetic components, namely NifHDK and NifENB. Using this criterion, we conducted a comprehensive search in fully sequenced genomes and identified 149 diazotrophic species, including 82 known diazotrophs and 67 species not known to fix nitrogen. The taxonomic distribution of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> in Archaea was limited to the Euryarchaeota phylum; within the Bacteria domain we predict that <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> occurs in 13 different phyla. Of these, seven phyla had not hitherto been known to contain species capable of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation.</b> Our analyses also identified protein sequences that are similar to nitrogenase in organisms that do not meet the minimum-gene-set criteria. The existence of nitrogenase-like proteins lacking conserved co-factor ligands in both diazotrophs and non-diazotrophs suggests their potential for performing other, as yet unidentified, metabolic functions. Conclusions Our predictions expand the known phylogenetic diversity of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation,</b> and suggest that this trait may be much more common in nature than it is currently thought. The diverse phylogenetic distribution of nitrogenase-like proteins indicates potential new roles for anciently duplicated and divergent members of this group of enzymes. </p...|$|R
40|$|It {{was assumed}} {{for a long}} time that the ability to {{catalyze}} atmospheric nitrogen (diazotrophy) has a narrow distribution among actinobacteria being limited to the genus Frankia. Recently, the number of nitrogen fixation (nifH) genes identified in other non-Frankia actinobacteria has dramatically increased and has opened investigation on the origin and emergence of diazotrophy among actinobacteria. During the last decade, Mycobacterium flavum, Corynebacterium autotrophicum and a fluorescent Arthrobacter sp. have been reported to have nitrogenase activity, but these studies have not been further verified. Additional reports of nitrogen fixation by Agromyces, Microbacterium, Corynebacterium and Micromonospora isolated from root nodules of leguminous and actinorhizal plants have increased. For several actinobacteria, nitrogen fixation was demonstrated by the ability to grow on nitrogen-free medium, acetylene reduction activity, N- 15 isotope dilution analysis and identification of a nifH gene via PCR amplification. Moreover, the analyses of draft genome sequences of actinobacteria including Slackia exigua, Rothia mucilaginosa and Gordonibacter pamelaeae have also revealed the presence of nifH-like sequences. Whether these nifH sequences are associated with effective nitrogen fixation in these actinobacteria taxa has not yet been demonstrated. These genes may be vertically or horizontally transferred and be silent sequences. These ideas merit further investigation.

Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legumes represents the main natural input of atmospheric N 2 into ecosystems which may ultimately benefit all organisms. We analyzed the nod and nif symbiotic genes and symbiotic properties of root-nodulating bacteria isolated from A. senegal and A. seyal in Senegal. The symbiotic genes of rhizobial strains from the two Acacia species were closed to those of Mesorhizobium plurifarium and grouped separately in the phylogenetic trees. Phylogeny of rhizobial <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> nifH was similar to those of nodulation genes (nodA and nodC). All A. senegal rhizobial strains showed identical nodA, nodC, and nifH gene sequences. By contrast, A. seyal rhizobial strains exhibited different symbiotic gene sequences. Efficiency tests demonstrated that inoculation of both Acacia species significantly affected nodulation, total dry weight, acetylene reduction activity (ARA), and specific acetylene reduction activity (SARA) of plants. However, these cross-inoculation tests did not show any specificity of Mesorhizobium strains toward a given Acacia host species in terms of infectivity and efficiency as stated by principal component analysis (PCA).

This paper {{presents a}} phylogenetic comparison of a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> (nifH) {{with the aim}} of elucidating the processes underlying the evolutionary history of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In the NifH phylogeny, strains of Rps. palustris were placed in close association with Rhodobacter spp. and other phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria belonging to the a-Proteobacteria, separated from its close relatives Bradyrhizobium japonicum and the phototrophic rhizobia (Bradyrhizobium spp. IRBG 2, IRBG 228, IRBG 230 and BTAi 1) as deduced from the 16 S rRNA phylogeny. The close association of the strains of Rps. palustris with those of Rhodobacter and Rhodovulum, as well as Rhodospirillum rubrum, was supported by the mol % G+C of their nifH gene and by the signature sequences found in the sequence alignment. In contrast, comparison of a number of informational and operational genes common to Rps. palustris CGA 009, B. japonicum USDA 110 and Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2. 4. 1 suggested that the genome of Rps. palustris is more related to that of B. japonicum than to the Rba. sphaeroides genome. These results strongly suggest that the nifH of Rps. palustris is highly related to those of the phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria included in this study, and might have come from an ancestral gene common to these phototrophic species through lateral gene transfer. Although this finding complicates the use of nifH to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the phototrophic bacteria in molecular diversity studies, it establishes a framework to resolve the origins and diversification of nitrogen fixation among the phototrophic bacteria in the a-Proteobacteria...|$|E

Ammonium concentrations varied by 2 orders of magnitude (< 4 to 400 ?M) across the study site. Analysis of 16 S rRNA sequences suggested that ammonium {{may have been one}} factor influencing the community composition prior to acetate amendment with Rhodoferax species predominating over Geobacter species with higher ammonium and Dechloromonas species dominating at the site with lowest ammonium. However, once acetate was added and dissimilatory metal reduction was stimulated, Geobacter species became the predominant organisms at all locations. Rates of U(VI) reduction appeared to be more related to acetate concentrations rather than ammonium levels. In situ mRNA transcript abundance of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene,</b> nifD, and the ammonium transporter gene, amtB, in Geobacter species indicated that ammonium was the primary source of nitrogen during uranium reduction. The abundance of amtB was inversely correlated to ammonium levels, whereas nifD transcript levels were similar across all sites examined. These results suggest that nifD and amtB expression are closely regulated in response to ammonium availability to ensure an adequate supply of nitrogen while conserving cell resources. Thus, quantifying nifD and amtB transcript expression appears to be a useful approach for monitoring the nitrogen-related physiological status of subsurface Geobacter species.

Northern analysis revealed the presence of either a single 7. 6 -kb nif mRNA transcript or 10 smaller mRNA species containing portions of the large transcript. Polar effects of transposon insertions demonstrated that all of these mRNAs arose from a single promoter region, where transcription initiated 80 bp 5 ′ to nifH. Distinctive features of the nif gene cluster include the presence of the six primary nif genes in a single operon, the placement of the two glnB-like genes within the cluster, the apparent physical separation of the cluster from any other nif genes that might be in the genome, the fragmentation pattern of the mRNA, and the regulation of expression by a repression mechanism described previously.

Expression of the anf gene was further investigated quantitatively under several termite feeding conditions by competitive PCR. The levels of expression of the anf gene were largely congruent with the nitrogen fixation activity displayed by the termite.

We characterized the rpoH 1 mu-tant for phenotypes related to symbiosis. Alfalfa nodules formed by the rpoH 1 mutant exhibited greatly reduced levels of acetylene reduction activity compared to the wild-type nodules. Whereas intracellular colonization by rhizobia was observed in a zone just below the apical meristem, we found ultrastructural abnormalities and signs of degeneration of bacteroids within many host cells in the proximally adjacent zone. In the proximal part of the nodule, only a few nodule cells contained bacteroids. In contrast, the rpoH 1 mutant showed nor-mal induction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> expression in microaerobic culture.

Since RpoH 1 was previously reported to be required for the synthesis of some heat shock proteins (Hsps), we examined the transcription of several genes for Hsp homologs.

However, if amplification does not occur with these primers, it does not mean that the strains are not capable of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation,</b> because the <b>gene</b> may have different nucleotide sequences between species and even within the same species Zehr et al. ([2003]). In our study, the four strains that amplified nifH with different primers were also positive to the ARA test. This result indicated that strains have the possibility to fix nitrogen. Montañez et al. ([2009]) also verified the same situation in bacteria with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> capability by the reduction of acetylene to ethylene and confirmed by PCR the presence of nifH gene. The group of Bacilli was reported to be capable of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation,</b> Ratón et al. ([2011]) and Rana et al. ([2011]) working with ARA-positive strains, indicated suitable environments for searching new inoculants or candidates for biotechnological purposes.|$|R

The chromosomal genes transferred were verified by analysis of the genomes of donor, recipient and putative transconjugants, by polymorphism of DNA bands obtained through amplification of nifH 1, nifH 2, nifH 3, nifU and nifV genes by PCR technique. The transconjugant cells promote an efficient <b>fixation</b> of <b>nitrogen</b> in liquid cultures fixed 0. 2 % nitrogen, and in the soil as inoculums of wheat plants, fixed 0. 31 % nitrogen and solublized 11. 71 ppm phosphorus, beside all advantages of Lactic acid bacteria, and probably {{to be used as}} inoculums for both <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> and solublizing insoluble phosphorus components, and used as biofertilizer...|$|R

WSM 2232 was effective in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> with G. capitatum but subsequently lost symbiotic competence during long-term storage. Here we describe the features of Burkholderia sp. strain WSM 2232, together with genome sequence information and its annotation. The 7, 208, 311 bp standard-draft genome is arranged into 72 scaffolds of 72 contigs containing 6, 322 protein-coding genes and 61 RNA-only encoding genes.

40|$|The nifA gene of Rhizobium meliloti, the {{bacterial}} endosymbiont of alfalfa, is {{a regulatory}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> {{required for the}} induction of several key nif and fix genes. Transcription of nifA is strongly induced in planta and under microaerobic conditions ex planta. Induction of nifA, in turn, is positively controlled by the fixL and fixJ genes of R. meliloti, the sensor and regulator, respectively, of a two-component system responsible for oxygen sensing by this bacterium. This system is also responsible for the positive induction of fixK. Here, we report that chemical and oligonucleotide site-directed mutageneses of the nifA promoter (nifAp) were conducted to identify nucleotides essential for induction. Nineteen mutants, including 14 single-point mutants, were analyzed for microaerobic induction of nifAp in R. meliloti. Critical residues were identified in an upstream region between base pairs - 54 and - 39 relative to the transcription start site. Attempts at separating the upstream and downstream regions of the nifA promoter so as to maintain fixJ-dependent activity were unsuccessful. A 5 ' deletion of the fixK promoter (fixKp) to - 67 indicates that sequences upstream of this position are not required for microaerobic induction. A sequence comparison of the - 54 to - 39 region of nifAp with the upstream sequences of fixKp does not reveal a block of identical nucleotides that {{could account for the}} fixJ-dependent microaerobic induction of both promoters. Many of the defective nifAp mutants in this region, however, are in residues with identity to fixKp in an alignment of the promoters according to their transcription start sites. Therefore, it is possible that there is a common sequence motif in the - 54 to - 39 region of the two promoters that is required for fixLJ-dependent microaerobic induction...|$|E
40|$|The Bradyrhizobium japonicum NifA protein, {{the central}} {{regulator}} for <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> expression, is encoded in the fixRnifA operon. This operon is activated during free-living anaerobic growth {{and in the}} symbiotic root nodule bacteroid state. In addition, it is expressed in aerobic conditions, albeit at a low level. Here, we report that this pattern of expression {{is due to the}} presence of two overlapping promoters: fixRp 1, which is of the - 24 /- 12 class recognized by the RNA polymerase sigma 54, and fixRp 2, which shares homology with the - 35 and - 10 regions found in other putative B. japonicum housekeeping promoters. Primer extension analyses showed that fixRp 1 directed the synthesis of a transcript, P 1, that starts 12 nucleotides downstream of the - 12 region. In addition to sigma 54, P 1 was dependent on NifA and low oxygen tension. Transcripts originating from fixRp 2 started at two sites: one coincided with P 1, while the most abundant, P 2 initiated just two nucleotides further downstream of P 1. Expression from fixRp 2 was dependent on the upstream - 68 promoter region, a region known to bind a putative activator protein, but it was independent of sigma 54 and NifA. This promoter was expressed in aerobic and anaerobic conditions but was not expressed in 30 -day-old bacteroids. Mutations in the conserved 12 region for the sigma 54 promoter did not show any transcript, because these mutations also disrupted the overlapping - 10 region of the fixRp 2 promoter. Conversely, mutations at the - 24 region only affected the sigma 54 -dependent P 1 transcript, having no effect on the expression of P 2. In the absence of omega(54), anaerobic expression from the fixRp(2) promoter was enhanced threefold, suggesting that in the wild-type strain, the two RNA polymerase holoenzymes must compete for binding to the same promoter region...|$|E
40|$|The genus Bradyrhizobium {{encompasses}} {{a variety of}} bacteria that can live in symbiotic and endophytic associations with legumes and non-legumes, and are characterized by physiological and symbiotic versatility and broad geographical distribution. In studies with Bradyrhizobium strains the comparison of phylogenies of nodulation and housekeeping genes has indicated a monophyletic origin of nodulation genes and diffusion by vertical and horizontal gene transfer, the last one probably influenced by the host plants. In previous studies with the strains analyzed {{in this study we}} have shown high diversity in the 16 S rRNA, ITS rRNA, atpD, glnII, dnaK and recA housekeeping genes (Menna et al., 2006, 2009). However, despite indications of great genetic variability within the Bradyrhizobium genus, {{little is known about the}} phylogeny of the nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes. In this study the nodulation genes nodY/K, nodA and nodZ and the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>gene</b> nifH of forty Bradyrhizobium strains were sequenced and analyzed. The great majority of the strains are from tropical regions and were isolated from members of the three subfamilies and nine tribes of the family Leguminosae (=Fabaceae). In all phylogenetic trees a high level of genetic diversity was observed and several clusters were correlated with the subfamilies of the host plants. One example was with the symbionts of Glycine max and Acacia sp., classified in the subfamilies Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae, respectively. In the phylogenetic trees built with nodY/K and nodA the symbionts of Acacia sp. were clustered in an isolated group, and no amplification was obtained for the nodZ gene. A successful amplification of nifH gene was obtained with all strains, and the resulting phylogenetic tree had similar clusters in comparison to the trees build with the nodulation genes (nodY/K, nodA and nodZ). The strains which failed in the amplification for some nodulation genes occupied an isolated position in the nifH tree. The comparison of all trees has shown no correlation between housekeeping and nod and nifH genes. The results pointed out the high diversity of nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes of tropical Bradyrhizobium strains and in several clusters high correlation between nod and nif genes and the host plants was observed.

40|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes</b> {{are shown}} {{to undergo a}} complex {{positive}} and negative regulation in Rhizobium meliloti. Activation of fixN by fixLJ is shown to require a third regulatory gene, fixK. As fixK is activated by fixLJ, we propose a cascade model for fixN regulation such that fixLJ activates fixN via fixK. In addition fixK negatively regulates expression of the nif-specific activator nifA {{as well as its}} own expression by autoregulation. Thus nifA and fixK are subject to a mixed regulation, positive (by fixLJ) and negative (by fixK). The sequence of fixK shows homology with the Escherichia coli regulators fnr and crp, which makes fixK the third characterized member of this family of prokaryotic regulators...|$|R

Furthermore, the nif gene arrangement was identical when the cultures were grown with combined nitrogen or under nitrogen-fixing conditions.

The induction of the gusA gene {{was used to determine}} the expression level of the different target genes under conditions partly mimicking the symbiotic environment ex planta. The green fluorescence was used to localize the bacteria in infection threads or inside the plant cells. hmong the identified R. etli mutants, several produced a Nod(-) phenotype, whereas others were Fix(-) or displayed a reduced acetylene reduction activity during symbiosis. Partial sequence analysis of the mutated genes allowed us to classify them as nodulation <b>genes,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>genes,</b> genes possessing various enzymatic functions previously not yet associated with symbiosis, and genes displaying no similarity to any other sequence in the database.
