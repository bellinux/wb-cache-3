5|$|Some {{say that}} <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> desperate than the measure, but I answer {{that the state}} of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E

The idea to go to Mexico arose {{in the minds of}} several comrades who were alarmed by the idea that, remaining in the United States, they would be forcibly restrained from leaving for Europe, where the revolution that had burst out in Russia that February promised to spread all over the continent.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to The Times {{published}} on 29 October 1860, Müller took issue with Williams. To the claim {{that it would be}} unjustifiable to teach history, philosophy, and other subjects as Boden professor, he quoted from one of Wilson's public lectures in which he had said that it had always been his intention to offer [...] "a general view of the institutions and social condition, the literature, and religion of the Hindus." [...] He noted that he had published in all three areas into which Williams divided Sanskrit literature, and disputed Williams's views on the relative importance of Vedic literature with reference to a review of one of his publications by Wilson. Williams, he said, [...] "stands as yet alone" [...] in asserting that the heroic poems and the plays, not the Vedas, were the real scriptures. He refused to accept Williams's estimate of the labour involved in the edition of the Rig Veda, and said that to compare his little effort with that carried out on the Bible was [...] "almost irreverent." [...] He concluded by attempting to rebut the claim that Boden would not have wanted the Vedic scriptures to be supported. He noted that the Bishop of Calcutta (George Cotton) had written that it was of [...] "the greatest importance" [...] for missionaries to study Sanskrit and its scriptures [...] "to be able to meet the Pundits on their own ground", and that the bishop's view was that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> valuable in this work that Müller's edition, and Wilson's translation, of the Rig-Veda." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lange {{received}} strong {{reviews for}} her performance in Titus, Julie Taymor's 1999 adaptation of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Alan Cumming. Film critic for Entertainment Weekly, Lisa Schwarzbaum, included Lange in a [...] "for your consideration" [...] article {{directed at the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She commented, [...] "Jessica Lange already has two Oscars and six nominations to her credit, so her appearance near the words 'Academy Awards' should never be a surprise. But everything about her daring performance in Titus as Tamora, the Queen of the Goths, is an astonishment. Donning breastplates, vowing vengeance, tearing into Shakespeare {{for the first time}} as if <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> fun, Lange steals the show — and when the star of the show is Anthony Hopkins, that's grand theft." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alcibiades {{thought at}} the time that Socrates really only wanted him sexually, and by letting Socrates have his way with him he would entice Socrates to teach him {{everything}} he knew (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates [...] "as if I were the lover and he my young prey!" [...] (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to view Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c-d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades might be wrong and Socrates may be of no use to him (218e-219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, to the deep humiliation of Alcibiades, Socrates made no sexual attempt (219b-d).|$|E
2500|$|Louisa May Alcott's father Amos Bronson Alcott {{predicted}} the sketches [...] "likely to be popular, {{the subject and}} style of treatment alike commending it to the reader, and to the Army especially. I see nothing {{in the way of}} a good appreciation of Louisa's merits as a woman and a writer. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> surprising to her or agreeable to us." [...] Her father was right; when it proved popular, Alcott was surprised by her own success. As she wrote: [...] "I cannot see why people like a few extracts from topsey turvey letters written on inverted tea kettles, waiting for gruel to warm, or poultices to cool, [...] for boys to wake and be tormented." [...] Henry James, Sr. wrote her a letter to applaud [...] "her charming pictures of hospital service." [...] The Boston Evening Transcript called the book [...] "fluent and sparkling, with touches of quiet humor and lively wit". Alcott herself wrote, [...] "I find I've done a good thing without knowing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{more radical}} left wing activists responded to Guevara's {{apparent}} indifference to rewards and glory, and concurred with Guevara's sanctioning of {{violence as a}} necessity to instill socialist ideals. Even in the United States, the government which Guevara so vigorously denounced, students began to emulate his style of dress, donning military fatigues, berets, and growing their hair and beards {{to show that they}} too were opponents of U.S. foreign policy. For instance, the Black Panthers began to style themselves [...] "Che-type" [...] while adopting his trademark black beret, while Arab guerrillas began to name combat operations in his honor. Addressing the wide-ranging flexibility of his legacy, Trisha Ziff, director of the 2008 documentary Chevolution, has remarked that [...] "Che Guevara's significance in modern times is less about the man and his specific history, and more about the ideals of creating a better society." [...] In a similar vein, the Chilean writer Ariel Dorfman has suggested Guevara's enduring appeal might be because [...] "to those who will never follow in his footsteps, submerged as they are in a world of cynicism, self-interest and frantic consumption, <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> vicariously gratifying than Che's disdain for material comfort and everyday desires." ...|$|E
