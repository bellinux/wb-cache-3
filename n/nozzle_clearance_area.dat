40|$|Abstract. Variable nozzle turbine (VNT) {{has become}} a popular {{technology}} for diesel application. While {{one of the major}} challenges for VNT is resonant vibration due to the fluctuating pressure in unsteady flow. Both the leakage flow forms inside the <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearances</b> and the shock produces under small nozzle openings increase the flow unsteadiness inside downstream rotor tunnel. In this paper, the unsteady simulation of the turbine was conducted to investigate the effects of <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearances</b> and openings on the transient load fluctuation of the blades. Then a finite element model of turbine wheel was built and blade forced response was simulated with harmonic analysis. The results showed that the decrease of nozzle opening would intensify rotor vibration and increase the blade dynamic stress. The simulation of blade resonance showed that the 1 st order resonance located at the blade trailing edge while the 2 nd order resonance happened at the leading edge, which was consistent with the blade actual crack...|$|R
50|$|As stated above, the {{cylinders}} in a diesel engine are fed by a unit injector, {{which in turn}} is fed by a crankshaft or charger driven injection pump. Maximum pump RPM (and thus the pressure of fuel supplied to the injectors) is regulated by a centrifugal governor. The operator regulates the <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> of the injector and the governor thus adjusts the fuel pressure to keep stable RPM. Failure of any part of the mechanism, particularly the governor can cause an uncontrolled amount of fuel to enter the nozzles creating a positive feedback loop.|$|R

40|$|The <b>clearances</b> of the <b>nozzle</b> and volute have {{significant}} {{influences on the}} unsteady flow, blade load distribution and thermodynamic performance of downstream radial turbine. The unsteady flow and blade loads are intensified due to the interactions among shock, leakage flow and nozzle wake.

Furthermore, the blade loads of the downstream rotor are considered by evaluating the effects of shock, leakage flow and nozzle wake, and the fluctuating pressures are presented in a novel space-time diagram. To reveal the flow mechanism in a variable radial turbine, two <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> sizes were chosen for investigation via numerical simulation of the unsteady flow and the interaction...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{multiband}} antenna with an unbroken metal rim for wearable applications is presented. In {{order to achieve}} a wideband behavior, minimizing {{at the same time}} the size of the <b>clearance</b> <b>area</b> on the antenna ground plane, a novel feeding structure is proposed. This is achieved by connecting the metal rim to the ground plane thus allowing generating one lower-frequency resonance without occupying a large area. An additional resonance is then obtained using a suitable shorting patch. In this way, the proposed antenna presents a broadband behavior, while the width of the <b>clearance</b> <b>area</b> on the ground plane is of only 2 [*]mm. The antenna performances in free-space and on a human phantom simulating a human body are analyzed by means of numerical simulations. Finally, the specific absorption rate (SAR) is analyzed to establish the antenna reliability in wearable applications. The experimental results demonstrate superior and stable performances of the metal-rimmed antenna when it is employed in wearable applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{factors that}} affect the {{stability}} of the melt stream during the casting of wire directly from the melt have been investigated. It is shown that the criticality of process parameters centres mostly on the forces imposed on the melt stream at confluence with the cooling water. The analysis of these forces indicated that the shear component of the disturbance is dependent on the ratio of the velocity of the melt stream (vm) to that of the cooling water (vw) in accord with results obtained from previous experiments. The role of oxide-forming elements in widening the process parameters range is attributed to the increased stability of the melt stream due to the additional shear force resistance offered by the solid oxide layer. The roles of Cr and Si oxides in stabilising the melt stream are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of wire indicating the presence of these oxides on fresh as-cast wires. Melt superheat and <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> distance are not strictly stream stability factors, but rather their role in glass formation prescribes optimal limits for fully amorphous wire...|$|R
40|$|The casting of {{amorphous}} iron-based wires of sub-millimetre diameters {{have been}} studied in a multiple jet casting condition. The effects of process parameters; melt jet to water velocity ratio (νr), melt super heat, <b>nozzle</b> diameter, <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> distance, and alloy composition on {{the stability of the}} melt jet and consequently {{on the quality of the}} wire has been studied. In order to increase the output rate, a multiple-nozzle crucible was designed for the casting process. Three nozzle designs were considered. It was found that when other cast variables were optimised, the nozzle types affected the flow and coherency of the jet. The best multi-nozzle crucible was made by using laser-drilled quartz platelets. The nozzle spacing did not affect the rapid cooling of the melt jet and thus the amorphous structures in the wires were retained for the closest spacing of 1 mm. It is demonstrated that the use of a multiple-nozzle crucible can effectively be used to increase by many folds the casting rate in the rotating water bath wire casting process...|$|R
