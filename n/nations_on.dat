5|$|As of 2004, hunting was {{restricted}} to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years {{it would take to}} reach a formal agreement.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United <b>Nations</b> <b>on</b> February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E

5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three <b>nations,</b> <b>on</b> 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In August 1989, Sihanouk {{stepped down}} as the President of FUNCINPEC and was succeeded by Nhiek Tioulong. At the same time, Ranariddh was made the Secretary-General of the party. In September 1990, the four warring Cambodian factions reached an {{agreement}} to form the Supreme National Council (SNC), an organisation designed to oversee Cambodia's sovereign affairs in the United <b>Nations</b> <b>on</b> an interim basis. The SNC consisted of twelve members from the four warring Cambodian factions, with two seats going to FUNCINPEC. Sihanouk negotiated to become the 13th member of the SNC, a proposal which Hun Sen initially rejected, but later acceded after Sihanouk relinquished his FUNCINPEC party membership in July 1991. Sihanouk was elected {{as the chairman of}} the SNC, and the SNC seats under FUNCINPEC's quota were filled up by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy. When the Paris Peace Accords were signed in October 1991, Ranariddh represented the party as its signatory.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First <b>Nations</b> <b>on</b> the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar {{became a}} Member State of the United <b>Nations</b> <b>on</b> 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its {{independence}} on 26 June 1960. As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti {{as part of}} the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both {{the quantity and quality of}} their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February 1933, {{following}} {{a report by}} the Lytton Commission, the League of Nations agreed that Japan's invasion of China had violated Chinese sovereignty. Refusing to accept the judgement of this organization, Japan withdrew from the League of <b>Nations</b> <b>on</b> the same day. Japan also immediately withdrew from the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty, thus removing all restrictions on the numbers and sizes of her capital warships. In November 1934, Kong≈ç was placed in Second Reserve in preparation for further modifications. On 10 January 1935, Kong≈ç was toured by the Nazi German naval attach√© to Japan, Captain Paul Wenneker, as part of a gunnery demonstration.|$|E
5|$|The Irish played yearly {{first-class}} matches {{with the}} Scots, only interrupted by world wars, until 1999, but all their other cricket depended upon touring international sides finding it convenient {{to include a}} visit to Ireland in their schedules. However, Ireland sometimes surprised Test <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> these occasions, beating the West Indies by 60 runs in a three-day match in Dublin in 1928, for example; it was Ireland's first match against the West Indies. In 1969, in a match played at Sion Mills in County Tyrone, the team defeated a West Indian side including Clive Lloyd and Clyde Walcott by nine wickets, after bowling them out for 25. This {{was the last time}} Ireland defeated a touring side until 2003, when they beat Zimbabwe by ten wickets.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese troops {{began to}} suffer losses in November, {{fighting}} in the northern region of Xilama. With increasing support from the populace, and the low number of Portuguese regular troops, FRELIMO was quickly able to advance south towards Meponda and Mandimba, linking to Tete {{with the aid of}} forces from the neighbouring Republic of Malawi, which had become a fully independent member of the Commonwealth of <b>Nations</b> <b>on</b> July 6, 1964. Despite the increasing range of FRELIMO operations, attacks were still limited to small strike teams attacking lightly defended administrative outposts, with the FRELIMO lines of communication and supply utilising canoes along the Ruvuma River and Lake Malawi.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time the People's Republic of China entered the {{conflict}} after issuing several warnings to the United <b>Nations.</b> <b>On</b> 19 October 1950, large formations of Chinese troops, dubbed the People's Volunteer Army (PVA), secretly crossed the border and into North Korea. One of the first Chinese units to reach the Chosin Reservoir area was the PVA 42nd Corps, and it was tasked with stopping the eastern UN advances. On 25 October, the advancing ROK I Corps made contact with the Chinese and halted at Funchilin Pass, south of the Chosin Reservoir. After the landing at Wonsan, the US 1st Marine Division of the X Corps engaged the defending PVA 124th Division on 2 November, and the ensuing battle caused heavy casualties among the Chinese. On 6 November, the PVA 42nd Corps ordered a retreat to the north with the intention of luring the UN forces into the Chosin Reservoir. By 24 November, the 1st Marine Division occupied both Sinhung-ni on {{the eastern side of the}} reservoir, and Yudami-ni on the west side of the reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Bol√≠var, {{learning}} about {{the collapse of the}} C√°diz expedition, spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela. Bol√≠var was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bol√≠var rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month truce and the regularization of the rules of engagement under the law of <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ayuntamiento of Maracaibo declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new nation-state of Gran Colombia. Miguel de la Torre, who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bol√≠var returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bol√≠var could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.|$|E
