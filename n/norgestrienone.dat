50|$|<b>Norgestrienone</b> (INN) (brand name Ogyline, Planor, Miniplanor; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} RU-2010), {{also known as}} Δ9,11-norethisterone or 17α-ethynyltrienolone (17α-ethynyltrenbolone), as well as 17α-ethynylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal progestin related to norethisterone that {{is used as a}} hormonal contraceptive, sometimes in combination with ethinylestradiol. It was developed by Roussel Uclaf and is registered for use only in France. Under the brand name Planor, it is or was marketed in France as 2 mg <b>norgestrienone</b> and 50 μg ethinylestradiol tablets. <b>Norgestrienone</b> has been found to possess similar affinity for the progesterone receptor and androgen receptor, and in accordance, has some androgenic activity. The drug was first described in the literature in 1965. Gestrinone is the 13β-ethyl variant or 18-methyl derivative of <b>norgestrienone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gestrinone, {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone, as well as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one or as 13β-ethyl-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,9,11-trien-20-yn-17β-ol-3-one), is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) {{and is a member}} of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. Gestrinone is the C18 methyl derivative of <b>norgestrienone</b> (17α-ethynyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone) and the δ9,11 analogue of levonorgestrel (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone) and is {{also known as}} ethylnorgestrienone due to the fact that it is the C13β ethyl variant of <b>norgestrienone.</b> It is also the C17α ethynyl and C18 methyl derivative of the AAS trenbolone.|$|E
50|$|Altrenogest (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand names Regumate, Matrix; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} RU-2267), {{also known as}} allyltrenbolone or allyltrienolone, as well as 17α-allyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone or 17α-allylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal progestin of the 19-nortestosterone and allyltestosterone groups related to allylestrenol, <b>norgestrienone,</b> and trenbolone that is widely used in veterinary medicine to suppress or synchronize estrus in horses and pigs. It is available for veterinary use in both Europe (as Regumate) and the United States (as Matrix), and has been marketed as Regumate since the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, <b>norgestrienone,</b> ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E

Acesso restrito. p. 207 – 217 Marked {{reduction}} of sperm count occurred in eight fertile men bearing subdermal Silastic capsules containing testosterone who received 50 mg of either <b>norgestrienone</b> or R 2323 twice weekly per OS. Four other men also bearing testosterone implants who received an equivalent dose of norethindrone have not shown a similar drop in sperm count. None {{of the patients}} who received either <b>norgestrienone</b> or R 2323 reported loss of libido or potency. These results suggest one of these nor-steroids {{may be used for}} a male contraceptive pill...|$|E

Acesso restrito. p. 335 – 353 Hemoglobin levels, blood pressure, {{body weight}} and the subjects' {{impressions}} {{of changes in}} various conditions have been recorded during a multicentered study of levonorgestrel and <b>norgestrienone</b> subdermal implants. Data {{from a group of}} women using the Copper T 200 IUD at the same clinics and admitted under the same criteria are presented for comparative purposes. A major reason for termination of use of the levonorgestrel implants was disturbance of menstrual patterns. When all subjects reported their experience with the two steroid regimens, substantially larger proportions of subjects using levonorgestrel implants noted changes in menstrual flow, duration of menses and intermenstrual bleeding and spotting than was the case of women contracepting with <b>norgestrienone</b> implants. Relative to the experience with implants, more users of the Copper T 200 in a control study reported increased dysmenorrhea, and an increase in the amount and duration of menstrual flow. Despite the reported increases in menstrual flow and duration of bleeding, women using subdermal implants of either contraceptive steroid, levonorgestrel and <b>norgestrienone,</b> showed an increase in blood hemoglobin values during the course of one year of use. In the control group using the TCu 200 IUD, no change in mean hemoglobin levels was found. Neither mean systolic nor diastolic blood pressure of the women using steroids was affected. There was a small net increase in weight among the users of steroids, but none in the Copper T controls. An increase in acne and other skin conditions was perceived by the same percentages of women using Copper IUDs as women using the steroids. A greater proportion of IUD acceptors noted increased nervousness and depression than was felt by the women contracepting with the steroid implants...|$|E

Acesso restrito. p. 411 – 427 Subdermal {{implants}} of polysiloxane (Silastic) capsules {{containing a}} number of synthetic progestagens have been studied in clinical trials to determine their contraceptive effectiveness and acceptability. The steroids studied include <b>norgestrienone</b> (R 2010), gestrigone (R 2323), megestrol acetate, d-norgestrel, norethindrone, ST- 1435, lynestrenol and R- 1364. With some of these steroids, studies have been undertaken with a varying number of implanted capsules. The estimated duration of use varies from 6 months to 6 years depending on dose and release rate of the individual steroid. The results of these studies involving about 5000 women in 8 years, indicate in general {{a high rate of}} effectiveness, as well as acceptability. Continuation rates at one year were generally 80 % or greater. Abnormal bleeding patterns are the major disadvantage. Studies with implants containing a combination of estrogen and progestogen are being undertaken in an attempt to improve the bleeding pattern...|$|E
