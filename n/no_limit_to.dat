5|$|Once elected, a {{governor}} serves a four-year term beginning {{on the date}} he is sworn into office; inauguration day is the second Monday in January. He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> how many terms {{a governor}} may serve; however, the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms {{at a time and}} may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve-year period. To be eligible to run for a third term, the governor would have to sit out for one election period.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Greenlandic {{is highly}} synthetic and exclusively suffixing, {{with the exception}} of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.|$|E

If the white dwarf is rotating, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be modified {{to take into account}} the centrifugal pseudo-force arising from working in a rotating frame. For a uniformly rotating white dwarf, the limiting mass increases only slightly. If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the mass for which it is possible for a model white dwarf to be in static equilibrium. Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the lieutenant governor was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of the same party. After a 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted upon, as a single ticket. Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both the governor and lieutenant governor to four years.

5|$|Washington was {{admitted}} to the Union on November 11, 1889. The term for governor is four years, commencing on the second Monday in the January following the election. If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is unable to discharge their duties, the lieutenant governor assumes the office of governor. If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are unable to fulfill their duties, the secretary of state is next in line, and then the treasurer. There is <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the number of terms a governor may serve. The office of lieutenant governor is not elected on the same ticket as the governor.|$|E

The episode, broadcast on June 2, 2004, {{was the first in}} a long winning streak for the software engineer, made possible due to a change at the beginning of that season (the show's twentieth on air in syndication), eliminating the longstanding rule limiting consecutive appearances for a champion to five. With <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> his appearances, Jennings began to break many game show records. As his streak continued deeper into the 21st season, Jennings was inching closer and closer to Olmstead's record. Jennings topped Olmstead's Millionaire winnings with his 65th consecutive win, finishing the day with $45,099 and a new cumulative total of $2,197,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The governor was originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving {{the beginning and the end}} of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E
5|$|Meena then realises {{that she}} has {{fallen in love with}} Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to {{disperse}} his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> what the common man can achieve.|$|E

All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected can be on the Board of Directors. There is <b>no</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those companies who serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be made up of 11 companies who are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification. Also on the same day HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,100 HDMI adopters and that over 2 billion HDMI-enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. From October 25, 2011, all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum.|$|E
