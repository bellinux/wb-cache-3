5|$|The 1995 Gulf of Aqaba {{earthquake}} (also {{known as}} Nuweiba earthquake) occurred on November 22 at 06:15 local time (04:15 UTC) and registered 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. The epicenter {{was located in}} the central segment of the Gulf of Aqaba, the <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> of water that separates Egypt's Sinai Peninsula from the western border of Saudi Arabia. At least 8 {{people were killed and}} 30 were injured in the meizoseismal area.|$|E
5|$|The sand devil has a flattened, {{moderately}} <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> with greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the}} sides of the head have smooth margins, without lobes. The large eyes are placed on top of the head and have prominent spiracles behind. The nostrils bear thin, pointed barbels with smooth or slightly fringed margins. The wide mouth is positioned terminally on the head. The jaws contain 10 upper and 9 lower tooth rows on each side, with toothless gaps at the middle. Each tooth has a broad base and a single pointed cusp with smooth edges. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|Gates 1–10 {{are located}} in Pier A; Gates 1-9 are single-airbridge gates and Gate 10 is a twin-airbridge gate {{suitable}} for an A380 aircraft, but not two <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{trains are}} based on the JR East E233 series EMU design, but with <b>narrow</b> <b>bodies</b> to permit subway running. The {{traction}} motors are fully enclosed to reduce environmental noise.|$|R
25|$|The Tg500 {{incorporated}} several features {{from the}} Kabinenroller platform {{on which it}} was based, including the <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> with tandem seating, the transparent acrylic bubble canopy, the low stance, and the direct steering.|$|E
25|$|The KR200 {{incorporated}} several features {{unique to}} the KR line and its four-wheeled derivative, the FMR Tg500. Externally, the <b>narrow</b> <b>body,</b> the transparent acrylic bubble canopy and low stance were among the more obvious features.|$|E
25|$|Gates 15 and 16 {{are located}} in Pier B, and are twin airbridges gates, each capable of {{handling}} an A380 aircraft with simultaneous double-deck boarding, or two <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> aircraft each in the A320 or B737 class.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{situations}} {{need additional}} intergovernmental coordination. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea and other relatively <b>narrow</b> <b>bodies</b> of water, EEZ of [...] are irrelevant. International waters beyond [...] from shore require explicit agreements.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a concept}} vehicle built from a 3 Series Convertible, with <b>narrower</b> <b>body</b> than the mass-produced counterpart, engine from the 2-litre 'Italian M3' (192PS) engine (later changed to 2.3-litre four-cylinder (200PS) engine).|$|R
50|$|These fishes have elongated, <b>narrow,</b> <b>bodies</b> {{surrounded}} {{by a series of}} bony rings, and small, tubular mouths. Several groups live among seaweed and swim with their bodies aligned vertically, to blend in with the stems.|$|R
25|$|It is an {{exceptional}} {{house with a}} very <b>narrow</b> <b>body,</b> a side wing with entrance on the it. Most interesting are the arrangement of loggias, pinnacles, narrow and tall windows with small gargoyles to drain the water.|$|E
25|$|Emerging from bankruptcy, Sun Country {{standardized}} its fleet on next-generation Boeing 737 <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> jets. The airline initially operated combined charter-scheduled {{services from}} Minneapolis to casinos in Laughlin, Nevada and gradually added more charter destinations as finances allowed. Soon, new scheduled service was added, focusing on Florida, Mexico and the West Coast.|$|E
25|$|There are 49 frontal {{stands at}} the main {{passenger}} concourse, 28 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. There are also five parking bays at the Northwest Concourse. A satellite concourse with 10 frontal stands for <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> aircraft has been commissioned {{to the north of}} the main concourse at the end of 2009, bringing the total number of frontal {{stands at the}} airport to 59.|$|E
50|$|Other {{situations}} {{need additional}} intergovernmental coordination. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea and other relatively <b>narrow</b> <b>bodies</b> of water, EEZ of 200 nmi km are irrelevant. International waters beyond 12 nmi km from shore require explicit agreements.|$|R
50|$|Reedsoceras {{seems to}} be derived from Simardoceras and to be more closely related to a group that also {{includes}} Sinclairoceras than to other westonoceratids, especially those with long <b>narrowing</b> <b>body</b> chambers and bent back exogastric phragmocones like Winnipegoceras.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Solaris Bus & Coach {{released}} the Solaris Alpino bus, {{which is about}} 75 cm shorter and 15 cm narrower than the Solaris Urbino 9. Due to the <b>narrower</b> <b>body</b> structure the Solaris Alpino has a different seating arrangement.|$|R
25|$|The new {{locomotives}} {{are similar}} in appearance to a Class 58; a hood unit design with a <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> typical of locomotive types in use in North America, the cabs are accessed from the rear via exterior walkways on the narrow part of the hood. The distinctive front end shape is due to crashworthiness features It is also fitted with air conditioning and acoustic insulation to improve the crew's environment, making it an improvement over the Class 66.|$|E
25|$|The <b>narrow</b> <b>body,</b> and {{corresponding}} low frontal area, was achieved with tandem seating, which also allowed {{the body to}} taper like an aircraft fuselage, within a practical length. The tandem seating also centralized {{the mass of the}} car along the longitudinal axis which, combined with the low center of gravity, low weight, and wheel placement at the vehicle's extremes, gave the Tg500 good handling characteristics. A more minor advantage of tandem seating was that it made an export version to countries that drive on the left unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, 1996, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the re-branding to US Airways, the airline placed an order for up to 400 Airbus A320-series <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> aircraft, with 120 firm orders {{at the time of}} the order signing. At the time, the order was regarded as the largest bulk aircraft request in history. In 1998, the airline followed with an order for up to 30 Airbus A330-series wide-body aircraft, with an initial firm order for seven of the Airbus A330-300 airliners. These orders enabled US Airways to replace its older aircraft with newer, more efficient aircraft, and it helped with the re-branding and repositioning efforts of US Airways.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{example of}} the hardingfele is from 1651, made by Ole Jonsen Jaastad in Hardanger, Norway. Originally, the instrument had a rounder, <b>narrower</b> <b>body.</b> Around the year 1850, the modern layout with a body much like the violin became the norm.|$|R
50|$|Totally new, <b>narrower,</b> <b>body</b> and cab. The inline engine {{permitted}} a much narrower bonnet than the Meteorite's wide vee. The gearbox was similar {{but the main}} stick (gear lever) gave six speeds (5 plus overdrive) with a single stick for all winch and PTO control functions.|$|R
50|$|The {{high cost}} of {{re-tooling}} the jigs and fixtures for construction of these <b>narrow</b> <b>bodies</b> was extensive {{and based on the}} very small number of locomotives, was financially painful to BRCW. This and other order book issues with the rolling stock business contributed to the bankruptcy of the business.|$|R
25|$|The {{completed}} works involved above ground-level (AGL) earthworks and pavement upgrades, {{extension of}} the runway length from 2454 metres to 3780 metres, widening of shoulders from 46 metres to 60 metres, extension of parallel taxiway to a full parallel taxiway with interconnection/rapid exit taxiways including widening of taxiway fillets and shoulders to 30 metres. The air-side apron works included {{the construction of a}} cargo apron, high-intensity lightings and markings. Visual and non-visual aids will be upgraded and/or relocated consistent with the upgrading plan to serve the extended runway. With nine gates, the airport can handle six <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> aircraft (such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320), three widebody aircraft and four turboprop aircraft. Of note, gate number 9 was specifically constructed for Airbus A380-800 operations.|$|E
500|$|Many {{cleaner fish}} in {{different}} families, {{such as the}} Caribbean neon goby (Elacatinus evelynae) and the Indo-Pacific cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) share the distinctive combination of a long <b>narrow</b> <b>body,</b> a longitudinal stripe, a blue colour, and small size. [...] "Convergent signalling among cleaners, using size, stripes and colour, should facilitate their recognition by fish clients." [...] This is analogous to Mullerian mimicry where genuinely aposematic species (such as wasps) mimic each other's warning colours.|$|E

50|$|Despite a {{superficial}} resemblance to primitive snakes, amphisbaenians such as Amphisbaena ridleyi have features which distinguish them from other reptiles. Internally, their right lung is reduced {{in size to}} fit their <b>narrow</b> <b>bodies,</b> whereas in snakes, it is the left lung that is reduced in size. The typical length for this species is 250 mm.|$|R
50|$|Racing car kits {{were also}} produced, {{consisting}} {{of this type}} of body plus a fabricated X-frame racing chassis manufactured from steel channel sections welded face to face to form box sections. The chassis used mechanicals from a Holden FJ, with the front suspension crossmember and rear axle assembly being shortened to suit the <b>narrower</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{drive module}} {{at the middle}} of the train is able to develop a power of 760 kW, making it able to travel at 115 115 km/h. The RABe 520 is {{slightly}} different from the standard Stadler GTW model : it has a greater capacity, a <b>narrower</b> <b>body</b> and an increased number of doors.|$|R
2500|$|His {{previous}} Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird of 1931 was rebuilt significantly. The {{overall layout}} {{and the simple}} twin deep chassis rails remained, but little else. The bodywork remained similar, with the <b>narrow</b> <b>body,</b> the tombstone radiator grille and the semi-spatted wheels, but the mechanics were new. Most significantly, a larger, heavier and considerably more powerful Rolls-Royce R V12 engine replaced the old Napier Lion, again with supercharger. This required two prominent [...] "knuckles" [...] atop the bodywork, to cover the V12 engine's camboxes.|$|E
2500|$|Air Canada {{has also}} placed orders for Boeing 737 MAX single-aisle <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> {{aircraft}} to replace its existing fleet of Airbus A320 series aircraft {{with the first}} MAX8 variant delivered on 2November 2017. [...] Some Airbus A319s will be transferred to Air Canada's Rouge subsidiary, while the remaining fleet will be retired. As part of the deal, Boeing purchased 25 Embraer E190s from Air Canada that were retired in 2016. [...] In 2016, Air Canada {{signed an agreement with}} Bombardier Aerospace to replace the E190s with CSeries aircraft from 2019.|$|E
2500|$|Terminal 2 is a 75,000 m2 (810,000 sq ft) {{terminal}} and pier (Pier E) which provides aircraft parking for 27 <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> aircraft through 19 departure gates which can handle up to 15 million passengers annually. [...] The project {{was designed by}} Pascall+Watson architects and the total cost was €600 million. [...] Aer Lingus is the main carrier operating at terminal 2 and since its opening have developed a hub at Dublin primarily for traffic traveling between Europe and the United States. [...] Terminal 2 is now the transatlantic gateway for flights to the United States as it features a US pre-clearance immigration facility which was previously housed in terminal 1.|$|E
5000|$|... 50 ton. These were a two-axle (four-wheel) {{configuration}} with a {{traction motor}} {{on each of}} the two axles. They had the same prime movers as the 45 ton, but a much lower and <b>narrower</b> <b>body,</b> designed to operate in steel mills and other very tight places at a top speed of 15 mph. The extra weight was ballast.|$|R
50|$|Kouprey have tall, <b>narrow,</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{long legs}} and humped backs. They can be grey, dark brown or black. The horns {{of the female}} are lyre-shaped with antelope-like upward spirals. The horns of the male are wide and arch forward and upward; they begin to fray at the tips at about three years of age. Both sexes have notched {{nostrils}} and long tails.|$|R
50|$|West Caucasian turs {{stand up}} to 1 m tall at the {{shoulder}} and weigh around 65 kg. They have large but <b>narrow</b> <b>bodies</b> and short legs. West Caucasian turs have a chestnut coat with a yellow underbelly and darker legs. Their horns are scimitar-shaped and heavily ridged. In males, these horns are around 70 cm, while in females they are much smaller.|$|R
