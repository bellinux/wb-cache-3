50|$|A {{clinical}} trial (Salim R et al., 2012) compared tocolytic efficacy and tolerability of atosiban {{with that of}} nifedipine. Forty-eight (68.6%) women allocated to atosiban and 39 (52%) to nifedipine did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> and did <b>not</b> require an alternate agent at 48 hours respectively (P=.03). Study concludes that atosiban has fewer failures within 48 hours. Nifedipine {{may be associated with}} a longer postponement of delivery.|$|R

40|$|Management of preterm labor {{involves}} the use of tocolytic drugs to inhibit preterm uterine contractions. This study compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous administration of atosiban and ritodrine in the treatment of spontaneous preterm labor. Methods: A randomized study was conducted in pregnant women of Chinese origin in Taiwan with threatened preterm delivery. Patients were randomized to receive either atosiban (n = 23) or ritodrine (n = 22). Tocolytic efficacy of the drug was assessed as the proportion of women who did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> and did <b>not</b> need alternative tocolytic treatment at 7 days after therapy initiation. Safety of the drugs was assessed as the number of adverse events or neonatal morbidity. Results: The number of women who did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> and did <b>not</b> require alternative tocolytic therapy at 7 days was similar between the atosiban and ritodrine groups. There were no serious adverse events, but maternal cardiovascular adverse events, particularly tachycardia, occurred significantly more in women treated with ritodrine (0 % atosiban vs. 18. 18 % ritodrine, p < 0. 05). There was no difference in neonatal or infant outcome between the two drugs. Conclusion: The present study showed similar effectiveness between atosiban and ritodrine, while tachycardia occurred more frequently in women treated with ritodrine. These results indicate that atosiban is an effective tocolytic drug without the conventional cardiovascular side effects often seen with beta-agonist treatment...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Business Information SystemsThe {{technological}} {{world is}} emerging and advancing rapidly. Organisations aspire {{to meet their}} business goals and strategic objectives. IT projects {{have the ability to}} enable organisations meet their business goals and objectives hence organisations invest {{a lot of time and}} money on implementing them. The increasing need for organisations to use technology has made organisations implement IT projects. IT projects are implemented to achieve efficiency and effectiveness that is crucial in achieving business goals and strategic objectives. Other benefits include, improved and increased customer satisfaction, improved growth and development within the teams and competitive advantage. Despite an increase in studies on the performance metrics for IT project success in organisations, IT projects still fail. Many IT Projects are considered failed when they are <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> on time, <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> within budget, and when the <b>delivered</b> solution does <b>not</b> meet the business requirements.

25|$|Cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) and neurotrophic factors embedded {{together into}} biocompatible matrices {{is a relatively}} new concept being investigated. CAMs of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), which includes L1/NgCAM and neurofascin, are particularly promising, because they are expressed in the developing nervous system on neurons or Schwann cells. They are known to serve as guidance cues and mediate neuronal differentiation. Neurotrophic factors such as NGF and growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5), however, are well established as promoters of regeneration in vivo. A recent study by Niere, Brown et al. investigated the synergistic effects of combining L1 and neurofascin with NGF and GDF-5 on DRG neurons in culture; this combination enhanced neurite outgrowth. Further enhancement was demonstrated by combining L1 and neurofascin into an artificial fusion protein, which improves efficiency since factors are <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> individually. <b>Not</b> only can different cues be used, but they may even be fused into a single 'new' cue.|$|R

40|$|To {{enable the}} rapid {{execution}} of many tasks on compute clusters, {{we have developed}} Falkon, a Fast and Light-weight tasK executiON framework. Falkon integrates (1) multi-level scheduling to separate resource acquisition (via, e. g., requests to batch schedulers) from task dispatch, and (2) a streamlined dispatcher. Falkon’s integration of multi-level scheduling and streamlined dispatchers <b>delivers</b> performance <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> by any other system. We describe Falkon architecture and implementation, and present performance results for both microbenchmarks and applications. Microbenchmarks show that Falkon throughput (487 tasks/sec) and scalability (to 54, 000 executors and 2, 000, 000 tasks processed in just 112 minutes) are one to two orders of magnitude better than other systems used in production Grids. Large-scale astronomy and medical applications executed under Falkon by the Swift parallel programming system achieve up to 90 % reduction in end-to-end run time, relative to versions that execute tasks via separate scheduler submissions...|$|R
