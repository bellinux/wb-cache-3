5|$|Selection {{for what}} {{eventually}} became the Italian Heavy Draft was begun in 1860 at the Deposito Cavalli Stalloni (military stud) of Ferrara, Italy. The breed was originally developed by crossing native stock with large Brabant horses. While the resulting horses were strong, {{they were not}} light or fast enough for the farm work required of them by the Italians. To make the breed lighter and faster, Percheron and Boulonnais blood were added. However, the resulting horse was still <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> its creators were looking for, and in the 19th century they added more Breton blood to the mix, bringing the breed to its current conformation and gaits. In 1926, a stud book was begun, and selection processes were developed to select horses for use in draft capacities. The breeding programs suffered during World War II, but a careful crossbreeding program with Ardennes, Percheron and Breton horses after the war brought the Italian Heavy Draft to its current state.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationing}} {{system also}} applied to clothing: leather was reserved exclusively for German army boots, and vanished completely from the market. Leather shoes {{were replaced by}} shoes made of rubber or canvas (raffia) with wooden soles. A variety of ersatz or substitute products appeared, which were <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> they were called: ersatz wine, coffee (made with chicory), tobacco and soap.|$|E

When she was {{asked if it was}} because the song was {{originally}} written for Britney Spears, she answered: [...] "Well that’s <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it’s my worst song {{it has nothing to do}} with the song, just my emotional connection to it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 1979 {{article on}} the band in Trouser Press, Dan Matovina bemoaned Harrison's {{reworking}} of [...] "Day After Day" [...] into [...] "a distinct copy of his own sound", {{from the point of}} view of Badfinger's career, while describing the song and [...] "Baby Blue" [...] as [...] "dazzling hits". Matovina concluded of Straight Up: [...] "What came out was a great album due to the tremendous songs, but one which lacked overall vitality. Also, in the process of the recording, many brilliant tracks were discarded ... All the [...] songs are top rate, it's a wholly consistent well-done record, only <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the group desired." ...|$|E
