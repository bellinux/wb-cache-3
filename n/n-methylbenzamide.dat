40|$|The {{rotational}} barrier in benzaldehyde was evaluated using DFT methods and CCSD. Compared to experimental values, the calculated values are typically a factor 2 too high. Evidence is provided this {{also applies to}} <b>N-methylbenzamide.</b> The results once more suggest that molecules comprising a benzene ring with a pi-conjugated substituent form a special problem with respect to calculation of the {{rotational barrier}} around the C(sp 2) -C(aryl) bond. It must be concluded that current DFT functionals cannot properly handle such barriers. Conversely, successfully describing these rotational barriers may be an appropriate and stringent test for new functionals. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|A {{kinetic study}} on {{hydrolysis}} of N-(2 '-hydroxyphenyl) phthalamic acid (1), N-(2 '-methoxyphenyl) phthalamic acid (2), and N-(2 '-methoxyphenyl) benzamide (3) under a highly alkaline medium gives second-order rate constants, k(OH), for {{the reactions of}} HO(-) with 1, 2, and 3 as (4. 73 +/- 0. 36) x 10 (- 8) at 35 degrees C, (2. 42 +/- 0. 28) x 10 (- 6) and (5. 94 +/- 0. 23) x 10 (- 5) M(- 1) s(- 1) at 65 degrees C, respectively. Similar values of k(OH) for 3, N-methylbenzanilide, <b>N-methylbenzamide,</b> and N,N-dimethylbenzamide despite the difference between pK(a) values of aniline and ammonia of similar to 10 pK units are qualitatively explained.

40|$|School of Molecular Sciences(Chemistry) The {{excited state}} proton {{transfer}} (ESPT) {{of the strong}} photoacid N-methyl- 7 -hydroxyquinolium (NM 7 HQ) was studied {{in the presence of}} <b>N-methylbenzamide</b> (NMB) as a base in the aprotic solvent of acetonitrile. In the ground state, it is found that the complexed form of NM 7 HQ and NMB exists with a 1 : 1 ratio with the association constant (K) to 22. 2 ± 1. 7 M- 1, obtained by using the Benesi-Hilderbrand relation. Also, the cationic photoacid fluorescence lifetime Stern-Volmer relation of fast decay time shows that the ESPT of NM 7 HQ and NMB has the molecularity of two with amides. Therefore, in the excited state, one more molecule of NMB is needed to the ground state NM 7 HQ-NMB complex for ESPT. It shows that the hydrogen bonded complex of 2 molecules of NMB can enhance the basicity of the NMB molecule. ope...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} oxygen- and {{nitrogen-containing}} heterocycles {{have been prepared}} by employing organopalladium intermediates. First, mercuric chloride readily adds to the carbon-carbon triple bond of certain 4 -hydroxy- 2 -alkyn- 1 -ones to give vinylmercurials which {{appear to be the}} first syn addition compounds of mercuric chloride. These vinylmercurials readily dehydrate to 3 -furylmercurials. Palladium-promoted carbonylation of these compounds affords 3 -furyl carbonyl compounds. Second, the mercuration of allenic acids and esters has been examined. Low yields of (beta) -substituted (DELTA) (2 ̆ 7 (alpha),(beta)) -butenolides could be obtained from mercuration and palladium-assisted carbonylation or acetoxylation of the allenic acid. Third, a new approach to the synthesis of tetracyclic sequiterpenes via vinylation-carbonylation of 2, 3 -dimethylnorbornadiene-palladium dichloride and 2 -methylnorbornadiene-palladium dichloride was explored. Finally, palladium-assisted olefination-cyclization of thallated p-tolylacetic acid, <b>N-methylbenzamide,</b> benzamide, and acetanilide have been studied. N-Methylisoquinolones, isocarbostyrils, and indoles have been prepared by this new route in moderate to good yields. Our method, which employs organometallic intermediates, is often shorter and more efficient than older methods for obtaining many of the compounds studied...|$|E
