25|$|A third {{mainstream}} {{theory of}} ageing, the Disposable soma theory, proposed in 1977 by Thomas Kirkwood, presumes {{that the body}} must budget {{the amount of energy}} available to it. The body uses food energy for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance. With a finite supply of food, the body must compromise, and do <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> quite as well as it would like. It is the compromise in allocating energy to the repair function that causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age. A caveat to the disposable soma theory suggests that time, rather than energy, is a limiting resource that may be critical to an organism. The concept is that each organism must reproduce in an optimal period in order to ensure the greatest chance of success for the offspring. This optimal period is dictated by the ecological niche of the organism but in essence, it limits the time that any given organism can devote to growth and development prior to bearing offspring. Thus, developmental rate and gestational rate are subject to evolutionary pressure. The need to accelerate gestation limits the time allocated to damage repair at the cellular level, resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer gestation. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.|$|E

Jesus, however, could have emerged from nothing except Israel and the Old Testament; but the study of the Old Testament does not demand that Jesus Messiah emerge from it...It is the history of Israel that sets Jesus apart from all culture-heroes, king-saviors, cosmic men, and mythological bearers of life; or, in modern terms political saviors, economic prophets, scientific sages, military heroes, and psychotherapists bearers of life. It is remarkable when one reflects that only as the Savior of Israel can Jesus be recognized as <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> other <b>things.</b> The role of Jesus can be protected from distortion only by holding fast its connection with Biblical antecedents: a non-Israelite, non-Biblical Jesus makes no sense.” A Theology of the Old Testament, pages 28, 322.|$|R

60|$|The {{care for}} the departed, the ritual of the Ka, the intense pre-occupation with the future life, which, far more than its morality, are the {{essential}} characteristics of the Book of the Dead--Israel cared for <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> animistic <b>things,</b> brought <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> or very little <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> out <b>of</b> the land of Egypt. Moses was certainly very eclectic; he took only the morality of Egypt. But as Mr. Huxley advances this opinion tentatively, as having no secure historical authority about Moses, it hardly answers our question, Whence came the moral element in Jehovah? One may surmise {{that it was the}} survival of the primitive divinely sanctioned ethics of the ancient savage ancestors of the Israelite, known to them, as to the Kurnai, before they had a pot, or a bronze knife, or seed to sow, or sheep to herd, or even a tent over their heads. In the counsels of eternity Israel was chosen to keep burning, however obscured with smoke of sacrifice, that flame which illumines the darkest places of the earth, 'a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel'--a flame how litten a light whence shining, history cannot inform us, and anthropology can but conjecture.

[...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E
