5|$|On 1 November 1956 {{the states}} of India were reorganised by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with {{neighbouring}} states to form the modern states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement, attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded {{the creation of a}} new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. The city suffered several explosions: one at Dilsukhnagar in 2002 claimed two lives; terrorist bombs in May and August 2007 caused communal tension and riots; and two bombs exploded in February 2013. On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state, and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill.

5000|$|On March 9, 2006, NASA's Cassini {{space probe}} found {{possible}} evidence of liquid water on Enceladus. According to that article, [...] "pockets of liquid water may be <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of meters below the surface." [...] These findings were confirmed in 2014 by NASA. This means liquid water could be collected {{much more easily}} and safely on Enceladus than, for instance, on Europa (see above). Discovery of water, especially liquid water, generally makes a celestial body a much more likely candidate for colonization. An alternative model of Enceladus' activity is the decomposition of methane/water clathrates - a process requiring lower temperatures than liquid water eruptions. The higher density of Enceladus indicates a larger than Saturnian average silicate core that could provide materials for base operations.|$|R

25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 13th century, many eremetical communities, {{especially}} in the vicinity of Siena, Italy, sprang up.

Their foundational spirit was one of solitude and penance. With time, some of the communities adopted a more outward looking way of life. As the number of hermit-priests increased, assisting the local clergy in providing spiritual care for their neighbors became a larger part of their lives. In 1223 four of the communities around Siena joined in a loose association, which had increased to thirteen within five years.|$|E
25|$|The {{pits and}} lands do not {{directly}} represent the zeros and ones of binary data. Instead, non-return-to-zero, inverted encoding is used: {{a change from}} pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros.

This in turn is decoded by reversing the eight-to-fourteen modulation used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding, finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the Red Book) were originally designed for CD Digital Audio, but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as CD-ROM).|$|E
25|$|Rhodes {{had already}} {{tried and failed}} to get a mining {{concession}} from Lobengula, king of the Ndebele of Matabeleland. In 1888 he tried again. He sent John Moffat, son of the missionary Robert Moffat, who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes' proposals. His associate Charles Rudd, together with Francis Thompson and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> white men would mine in Matabeleland. This limitation was left out of the document, known as the Rudd Concession, which Lobengula signed. Furthermore, it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations.

40|$|Abstract — Classification {{techniques}} {{in the big}} data scenario are in high demand {{in a wide variety}} of applications. The huge increment of available data may limit the applicability of most of the standard techniques. This problem becomes even more difficult when the class distribution is skewed, the topic known as imbalanced big data classification. Evolutionary undersampling techniques have shown to be a very promising solution to deal with the class imbalance problem. However, their practical application is limited to problems with <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands of instances. In this contribution we design a parallel model to enable evolutionary undersampling methods to deal with large-scale problems. To do this, we rely on a MapReduce scheme that distributes the functioning of these kinds of algorithms in a cluster of computing elements. Moreover, we develop a windowing approach for class imbalance data in order to speed up the undersampling process without losing accuracy. In our experiments we test the capabilities of the proposed scheme with several data sets with up to 4 million instances. The results show promising scalability abilities for evolutionary undersampling within the proposed framework. I...|$|R
25|$|The {{place where}} {{emergency}} psychiatric services are delivered are most {{commonly referred to}} as Psychiatric Emergency Services, Psychiatric Emergency Care Centers, or Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs. Mental health professionals from a wide area of disciplines, including medicine, nursing, psychology, and social work in these settings alongside psychiatrists and emergency physicians. The facilities, sometimes housed in a psychiatric hospital, psychiatric ward, or emergency room, provide immediate treatment to both voluntary and involuntary patients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Within a protected environment, psychiatric emergency services exist to provide brief stay of two or three days to gain a diagnostic clarity, find appropriate alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for the patient, and to treat those patients whose symptoms can be improved within that brief period of time. Even precise psychiatric diagnoses are a secondary priority compared with interventions in a crisis setting. The functions of psychiatric emergency services are to assess patients' problems, implement a short-term treatment consisting of <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> meetings with the patient, procure a 24-hour holding area, mobilize teams to carry out interventions at patients' residences, utilize emergency management services to prevent further crises, be aware of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric resources, and provide 24/7 telephone counseling.|$|E

500|$|Portal is Valve's spiritual {{successor}} to the freeware game Narbacular Drop, the 2005 independent game released by students of the DigiPen Institute of Technology; the original Narbacular Drop team is now employed at Valve. Valve became interested in Narbacular Drop after seeing the game at DigiPen's annual career fair; Robin Walker, one of Valve's developers, saw the game at the fair and later contacted the team providing them with advice and offering to show their game at Valve's offices. After their presentation, Valve's president Gabe Newell quickly offered the entire team jobs at Valve to develop the game further. Newell later commented that he {{was impressed with the}} DigiPen team as [...] "they had actually carried the concept through", already having included the interaction between portals and physics, completing most of the work that Valve would have had to commit on their own. Certain elements have been retained from Narbacular Drop, such as the system of identifying the two unique portal endpoints with the colors orange and blue. A key difference in the signature portal mechanic between the two games however is that Portals portal gun cannot create a portal through an existing portal unlike in Narbacular Drop.
