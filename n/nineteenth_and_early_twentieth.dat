5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in 'old-style' serif typefaces {{took place in the}} late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. This saw a revival of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (the office was now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond's own work, had survived in Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon in the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E

5|$|Much work on hypercomplex {{numbers and}} group {{representations}} {{was carried out}} in the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras. Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Pensford was an {{important}} coal mining area during the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> centuries when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield, {{although there are no}} working coal mines today. The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E

5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists in the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Roman Revival {{building}} of the observatory was designed by architect Willard Smith after the Roman Tower of the Winds in Athens and was built in 1865.

Outfitted with telescopes, clocks, and other scientific equipment donated to Rutgers, the Schanck Observatory served as the university's first astronomical observatory and was used to provide instruction to its students through the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.|$|E
5|$|The late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century {{demand for}} coffee and rubber led to Brazil's coffee economy and rubber boom. At the time, it was {{estimated}} that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, Minas Geraes, and Rio de Janeiro. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years. Simultaneously, there was an {{effort on the part of}} prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the main}} reasons for the {{delivery}} of the territory are the rubber boom, which occurred in the late <b>nineteenth</b> century <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, <b>and</b> the revolt of the inhabitants of the region who were in mostly Brazilian.|$|R
