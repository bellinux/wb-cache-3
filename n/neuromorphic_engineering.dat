40|$|Introduction A winner-take-all (WTA) circuit is {{a system}} of {{interconnected}} neurons where only the neuron with the highest input remains active, whereas all other neurons are suppressed. Thus, a WTA circuit decodes the maximum of n values.

Numerous WTA mechanisms have been proposed 1 Γ 7.

We {{introduce a}}n efficient EM-type optimization algorithm tailored to this technique. We also introduce other consistency hints, and balance their weights using canonical errors. We calibrate the correlated multi-factor Vasicek model of interest rates, and apply it successfully to Japanese Yen swaps market and US Dollar yield market.

50|$|An {{optical flow}} sensor is a vision sensor capable of {{measuring}} optical flow or visual motion and outputting a measurement based on optical flow. Various configurations of optical flow sensors exist. One configuration {{is an image}} sensor chip connected to a processor programmed to run an optical flow algorithm.

In some cases the processing circuitry may be implemented using analog or mixed-signal circuits to enable fast optical flow computation using minimal current consumption.

50|$|Boahen {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the pioneers of <b>neuromorphic</b> <b>engineering,</b> a field founded by Carver Mead in the 1980s. In contrast to the field of artificial intelligence, which merely takes inspiration from the brain, neuromorphic engineers seek to develop a new computing paradigm based on the brain's organizing principles. The brain employs a computing paradigm that is fundamentally different from digital computers. Instead of using digital signals for computation as well as communication, the brain uses analog signals (i.e., graded dendritic potentials) for computation and digital signals (i.e., all-or-none axonal potentials) for communication. Having explored this unique hybrid of digital and analogue techniques over the past three decades, neuromorphic engineers are now beginning to understand and exploit its advantages. Potential applications of their work include brain-machine interfaces, autonomous robots, and machine intelligence. Boahen often speaks of the promise of efficient computing as an inspiration for his work, writing “A typical room-size supercomputer weighs approximately 1,000 times more, occupies 10,000 times more space and consumes a millionfold more power than does the cantaloupe-size lump of neural tissue that makes up the brain.”With contributions in circuit design, chip architecture, and neuroscience, Boahen has brought together ideas from many disciplines to build novel computer chips that emulate the brain. Widely renowned for his engineering accomplishments, Boahen was named an IEEE fellow in 2016. Specific contributions throughout his career include the development of the current-mode subthreshold CMOS circuit design paradigm, the address-event approach to communicating spikes between neuromorphic chips, and the scalable design of multi-chip systems. Boahen’s chips are mixed-mode: they employ analog circuits for computation and digital circuits for communication.|$|E
