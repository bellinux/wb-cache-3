5|$|Almost all large wind {{turbines}} {{have the same}} design— a {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} having an upwind rotor with three blades, attached to a <b>nacelle</b> on top of a tall tubular tower.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the aerodynamic design of the blades, {{the design of a}} complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation's rotor hub, <b>nacelle,</b> tower structure, generator, controls, and foundation.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the engine to the sides. The resulting flattened <b>nacelle</b> bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the NACA 19 -foot {{pressure}} tunnel of a simplified twin-engine bomber model with an NACA low-drag wing primarily to obtain an indication of the effects of engine <b>nacelles</b> on the characteristics of the model both with and without simple split trailing-edge flaps. <b>Nacelles</b> with conventional-type cowlings representative of those used on an existing high-performance airplane and with NACA high-speed type E cowlings were tested. The tests were made without propeller slipstream. The aerodynamic effects of adding the <b>nacelles</b> to the low-drag wing were similar to the effects commonly obtained by adding similar <b>nacelles</b> to conventional wings. The maximum lift coefficient without flaps was slightly increased, but the increment in maximum lift due to deflecting the flaps was somewhat decreased. The stalling characteristics were improved by the presence of the <b>nacelles.</b> Addition of the <b>nacelles</b> had a destabilizing effect on the pitching moments, as is usual for <b>nacelles</b> that project forward of the wing. The drag increments due to the <b>nacelles</b> were of the usual order of magnitude, with the increment due to the <b>nacelles</b> with NACA type E cowlings approximately one-third less than that of the <b>nacelles</b> with conventional cowlings with built-in air scoops...|$|R
50|$|Initial designs {{incorporated}} a Bristol Pegasus vectored-thrust turbofan {{in each of}} the two inboard <b>nacelles</b> and four Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines {{in each of the}} outer <b>nacelles.</b> It was planned to dispense with the outer <b>nacelles</b> and their engines when larger RB153 turbofans (of approximately 5000 lbf kN thrust) became available. By mounting the engines in pods, the fuselage could provide a capacious hold with a rear loading ramp.|$|R
50|$|Two 220-250 hp engines were {{intended}} to be fitted to the welded steel tube engine <b>nacelles</b> but the prototype was fitted with two 205 hp Walter Major six cylinder engines, instruments for the engines were fitted to the inner sides of the <b>nacelles</b> where they were clearly visible to the flight crew. Two fuel tanks of 140 l each were housed in the wings with oil tanks in the engine <b>nacelles.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it {{was essentially a}} fan placed outside the engine <b>nacelle,</b> offering speed of a turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA894 flew {{with five}} Olympus engines, the {{standard}} four Mk.101s, plus a reheated Olympus 320 {{destined for the}} BAC TSR-2 in an underslung <b>nacelle.</b> This aircraft was destroyed in a ground fire at Filton on 3 December 1962.|$|E
5|$|E-767 – the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) {{platform}} for the Japan Self-Defense Forces; it is essentially the Boeing E-3 Sentry mission package on a 767-200ER platform. E-767 modifications, completed on 767-200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita, Kansas, include strengthening to accommodate a dorsal surveillance radar system, engine <b>nacelle</b> alterations, as well as electrical and interior changes. Japan operates four E-767s. The first E-767s were delivered in March 1998.|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} method for integrating the engine <b>nacelles</b> on a wing-fuselage-fin(s) configuration has been described. This method {{is based on}} Whitham theory and Seebass and George sonic-boom minimization theory, With it, both reduced sonic-boom as well as high aerodynamic efficiency methods {{can be applied to}} the conceptual design of a supersonic-cruise aircraft. Two high-speed civil transport concepts were used as examples to illustrate the application of this engine-nacelle integration methodology: (1) a concept with engine <b>nacelles</b> mounted on the aft-fuselage, the HSCT- 1 OB; and (2) a concept with engine <b>nacelles</b> mounted under an extended-wing center section, the HSCT- 11 E. In both cases, the key to a significant reduction in the sonic-boom contribution from the engine <b>nacelles</b> was to use the F-function shape of the concept as a guide to move the <b>nacelles</b> further aft on the configuration...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} flutter {{results are presented}} for a simplified 1 / 50 -size wind-tunnel model of an arrow-wing configuration. Transonic flutter characteristics are presented for three configurations - wing without engine <b>nacelles,</b> wing with flow-through <b>nacelles,</b> and wing with pencil <b>nacelles</b> (thin, streamline bodies). Experimental results are correlated with analytical results obtained from kernel-function and doublet-lattice unsteady aerodynamic theories. Theoretical results are presented that show the effects on flutter of systematic changes in structural stiffness and mass...|$|R
40|$|A twin-engine, low-wing {{transport}} model, with a {{supercritical wing}} {{designed for a}} cruise Mach number of 0. 77 and a lift coefficient of 0. 55 was tested in the 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center. The purpose of this test was to compare the wing/nacelle interference effects of superfans (BPR 18) with the interference effects of advanced turbofans (BPR 6). Flow-through <b>nacelles</b> were used. Forces and moments on the complete model were measured using a strain gage balance, and extensive surface static pressure measurements were made on the model's wing, <b>nacelles,</b> and pylons. Results of the investigation indicate that superfan <b>nacelles</b> can be installed with approximately the same drag penalty as conventional turbofan <b>nacelles...</b>|$|R
5|$|On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was {{extensively}} {{damaged by}} fire while landing at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The {{investigation into the}} incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main landing gear as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine <b>nacelle,</b> airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32million.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine <b>nacelle</b> was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the <b>nacelle</b> was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the <b>nacelle</b> design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
50|$|Tail light <b>nacelles</b> were removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a low-wing cantilever monoplane {{with a similar}} fuselage to the Bellanca 28-70 and 28-90, but was fitted with three engines, one in the nose, and one in each of two underwing <b>nacelles.</b> The <b>nacelles</b> also housed the main undercarriage units when retracted.|$|R
50|$|The {{proportions}} of the Galaxy-class Enterprise-D were different from the original Enterprise while retaining its familiar dual warp <b>nacelles</b> and saucer section appearance. The <b>nacelles</b> were made proportionally smaller than the saucer section, {{based on the idea}} that warp engines would have become more efficient over time.|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine <b>nacelle</b> for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the engine <b>nacelle</b> its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} engine <b>nacelle</b> with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E
50|$|Four-engines {{in tandem}} {{push-pull}} <b>nacelles</b> - two built.|$|R
50|$|The Su-30MKI is {{a highly}} {{integrated}} twin-finned aircraft. The airframe is constructed of titanium and high-strength aluminium alloys. The engine intake ramps and <b>nacelles</b> are fitted with trouser fairings to provide a continuous streamlined profile between the <b>nacelles</b> and the tail beams. The fins and horizontal tail consoles are attached to tail beams. The central beam section between the engine <b>nacelles</b> consists of the equipment compartment, fuel tank and the brake parachute container. The fuselage head is of semi-monocoque construction and includes the cockpit, radar compartments and the avionics bay.|$|R
500|$|The V-22 has triple-redundant {{fly-by-wire}} {{flight control}} systems, which included computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With the <b>nacelles</b> pointing {{straight up in}} conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With the <b>nacelles</b> in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles' rotation range; the lower the <b>nacelles,</b> the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. The <b>nacelles</b> can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the [...] "80 Jump" [...] orientation with the <b>nacelles</b> at 80° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The control systems automate and simplify {{to the extent that}} the V-22 can hover in low wind with no hands on the controls. According to some who have flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter ones as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering.|$|R
5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission <b>nacelle</b> mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine <b>nacelle</b> housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine <b>nacelle</b> was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its <b>nacelle</b> and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the starboard wing caught on fire.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nacelle</b> was a simple, short, flat sided structure. It was {{supported}} above the lower wing on two more pairs of interplane struts which passed within the <b>nacelle.</b> The Anzani engine was mounted uncowled at the front, with the pilot seated under the trailing edge.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nacelle</b> {{was built}} in 1928 by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH for the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin (Count Zeppelin). The {{propulsion}} system of this airship consisted of five nacelles fixed to the hull. Every <b>nacelle</b> contained a Maybach engine, type VL 2, which drove a propeller at the nacelle’s tail. A mechanic was stationed at each engine at all times.|$|E
