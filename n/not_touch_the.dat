5|$|On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan {{approved}} Resolution 28, bringing {{into effect}} National Flag Rules {{drafted by the}} Cabinet. The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag's colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate {{to the size of}} the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as much respect as the Bhutanese state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E

A complete and well-preserved skeleton of the North American Hipparion shows an animal {{the size of a small}} pony.
