5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
25|$|He entered Komulo Primary School, {{then called}} Komulo School, in 1925. After passing the entry exam in 1927, he was {{admitted}} to Maseno School in 1928. His three years of study there were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> experience, as he was very far from home. He still was influenced by Edward Carey Francis, the headmaster, who helped grow his Christian faith. Under his guidance, he taught Sunday school classes at the area and also encouraged planting trees near the village churches. While at Maseno he was confirmed in the Anglican faith. He spoke English fluently by his third year at the school. He was the only Christian at his family {{at this point in}} time.|$|E

500|$|Mara Carfagna has posed nude for Maxim. Reluctant to {{talk about}} her {{modeling}} past, she has nevertheless suggested that she had certain reservations about the work. On one occasion she said: [...] "I am a bit of a prude and I found getting undressed {{in front of a camera}} <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> experience." [...] She states that she is a firm believer in family values, and claimed in an interview that she once refused to take part in a movie directed by erotic filmmaker Tinto Brass, when she was twenty years old.|$|E
500|$|Bill Drummond {{summed up}} The JAMs' {{approach}} to composition {{in the first}} [...] "KLF Information Sheet", sent out in October 1987: [...] "We made [...] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff {{that came out of}} our mouths.... <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Cycling {{magazine}} wrote {{a scathing}} {{report on the}} [...] "scantiness" [...] of the outfit, complaining of loss of modesty and calling the feat a [...] "lamentable incident". Similarly, the Yorkshire Evening Post pointed out that cycling was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> sight for a man, but that a woman's [...] "abnormal hips" [...] made it worse. The publicity, despite being negative, helped improve women's rights with the suffragette movement in particular noting {{it was a big}} milestone. Further, it helped show that women need not be tied to the street that they grew up in and had a means to travel. Another effect of the publicity was that Reynolds received love letters, including a marriage proposal from a stranger who was apparently significantly older than her. Reynolds and her family took advantage of the celebrity status, with Reynolds promoting a number of female bicycles over the following years, always in rational cycling attire.|$|E

500|$|The game's overall {{narrative}} {{was highly}} praised by critics; many considered it compelling, engaging, riveting, and mature, and {{viewed it as}} the standout feature of the game. Some believed that the story had an excellent presentation with decent voice-acting, memorable characters, and atmospheric soundtracks. North's performance was particularly praised. Many critics {{thought it was a}} bold attempt by Yager and that the story about mistakes and consequences allowed the game's narrative to exceed its competitors in terms of quality. Some critics believed that Yager deserves respect for successfully creating a message through the story and delivering it to the player, and trying to do something different. Mitch Dyer of IGN thought that the game's narrative made violence [...] "meaningful", and that the story was unexpectedly good and personal. Some believed the story is impactful and at times shocking, and that the plot would make [...] "Modern Warfare 2s nefarious No Russian look pretty tame". The game's choices were praised for being [...] "powerful" [...] despite not offering a branching storyline. Some critics believed that these choices are provocative, organic, impactful, upsetting, and thematically correct, though unsatisfying and sometimes hollow and binary. The endings of the game were praised. Some critics noted that emotionally Spec Ops: The Line is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> game.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1951, Middleton {{got a call from}} General J. Lawton Collins, who was now the Army Chief of Staff, asking for Middleton to take an {{assignment}} on behalf of the Army. [...] Middleton was compelled to say yes. There were allegations of wholesale honor code violations at the U. S. Military Academy in West Point, and Middleton was to serve on a committee to oversee the proceedings and make recommendations. [...] Though personally painful to Middleton, the committee's recommendation was to dismiss 82 cadets for cheating, including most {{of the members of the}} football team. A headline in a New Orleans newspaper wryly summarized the event as [...] "Army Football Team Severely Penalized for Illegal Passing." [...] While this was a drastic undertaking, the committee also recommended that the same tests not be given to different groups on different days, which practice offered the cadets a big temptation to cheat. [...] Though this was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> assignment for Middleton, he had been selected for the task because of his reputation for fairness. [...] Though he had never attended West Point, in 1952 he was asked to serve the academy on its Board of Visitors, a position which he held for one three-year term.|$|E

She was repeatedly interrupted {{when she was about}} to sing by Colonel Stacy, in the midst of preparing to fire the [...] "Chicken Cannon". Although she got to fire the cannon, her experience on Air Farce, as she described it, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> one.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{machinery}} alone {{remained to}} be tried. To {{the best of}} my recollection we made one mile and a quarter in just two hours and a half. It was ... a brief if <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> trip, to all on board—including myselfespecially considering that I had waited eight months for the adaptation of this machinery. I could have had fifty engines built during this time notwithstanding the [...] "Government pressure". We should have proceeded further down the river, but at Corlear's Hook we were driven backby the tide.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2006, US Vice President Dick Cheney {{referred}} {{to himself as}} the Darth Vader of the Bush administration. Discussing the administration's philosophy on gathering intelligence, he said to CNN's John King, [...] "It means {{we need to be}} able to go after and capture or kill those people who are trying to kill Americans. That's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> business. It's a very serious business. And I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of the administration.'" [...] Jon Stewart put on a Darth Vader helmet to address Dick Cheney as a [...] "kindred spirit" [...] on The Daily Show on January 25, 2007. Cheney's wife, Lynne, presented Stewart with a Darth Vader action figure on her appearance on the show on October 10, 2007. Both Stewart and Stephen Colbert have occasionally {{referred to}} Cheney as [...] "Darth Cheney". In the satirical cartoon show Lil' Bush, Dick Cheney's father is portrayed as being Darth Vader. At her presidential campaign event on September 19, 2007, Hillary Clinton also referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. At the 2008 Washington Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, Cheney joked that his wife Lynne told him that the Vader comparison [...] "humanizes" [...] him. George Lucas told The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, however, that Cheney is more akin to Emperor Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be George W. Bush. An issue of Newsweek referenced this quote, and compared Bush and Cheney to Vader and Palpatine, respectively, in a satirical article comparing politicians to various Star Wars and Star Trek characters.|$|E
