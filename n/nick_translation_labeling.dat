40|$|Injury to {{the growth}} plate is common and yet the injured {{cartilage}} is often repaired with undesirable bony tissue, leading to bone growth defects in children. Using a rat tibial growth plate injury model, our previous studies have shown sequential inflammatory, fibrogenic, osteogenic and bone maturation responses involved in the bony repair. However, it remains unclear whether there is progressive accumulation of bone within the injury site and any potential degenerative changes at the adjacent non-injured area of the growth plate. This study examined effects of growth plate injury on the structure, composition and some cellular and molecular changes at the injury site and adjacent uninjured area. Micro-CT analysis revealed that while the bone volume within the injury site at day 14 was small, the bone bridge was considerably larger at the injury site by 60 days post-injury. Interestingly, formation of bone bridges in the adjacent uninjured area was detected in 60 % of injured animals at day 60. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed reduced chondrocyte proliferation (PCNA labelling) but increased apoptosis (<b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> <b>labelling)</b> in the adjacent uninjured area. RT-PCR analysis on adjacent uninjured growth plate tissue found increased expression of osteocalcin at day 60, differential expression of apoptosis-regulatory genes and alterations in genes associated with chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation, including Sox 9 and IGF-I. Therefore, {{this study has demonstrated}} progressive changes in the structure/composition of the injury site and adjacent uninjured area and identified cellular and molecular alterations or degeneration in adjacent uninjured growth plate in response to injury.

Two of the five cloned fragments hybridized only to DNA from B. thetaiotaomicron. Each of these two fragments hybridized to the same DNA restriction fragment in five strains of B. thetaiotaomicron other than the strain from which the DNA was cloned.

40|$|Directly labeled {{fluorescent}} DNA probes {{have been}} made by <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> and PCR using dUTP attached to the fluorescent label, Cy 3, with different length linkers. With preparation of probes by PCR we find that linker length affects the efficiency of incorporation of Cy 3 -dUTP, the yield of labeled probe, and the signal intensity of labeled probes hybridized to chromosome target sequences. For <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> and PCR, both the level of incorporation and the hybridization fluorescence signal increased in parallel when the length of the linker arm is increased. Under optimal conditions, PCR yielded more densely labeled probes, however, the yield of PCR labeled probe decreased with greater linear density of labeling.

40|$|Human {{metaphase}} chromosomes {{were isolated}} and digested in situ with HaeIII restriction enzyme to detect cytosine and guanine-rich sequences (CpG islands), which {{are known to}} be associated with most of the mammalian genes. Digested DNA was reconstructed by in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> employing digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides. The DNA sequences were revealed by antibodies conjugated either with fluorescein isothiocyanate or 1 -nm colloidal gold. DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide. A sensitive, high resolution method for visualizing three signals, simultaneously excited by a single argon laser line of 488 nm has been developed. The green fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate was detected in combination with the red fluorescence of propidium iodide, and the third signal was imaged by employing the reflectance mode of the confocal microscope after silver enhancement of the gold beads. The high reflectance intensity, the accurate localization and the non-fading properties of colloidal gold made the reaction a valuable tool for the detection of antigens and, as a consequence, of specific DNA sequences in chromosome preparations. Overlaying of three signals allowed the simultaneous observation of distinct structures: total DNA, as well as fluorescein- and gold-labeled sequences after in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation,</b> or total DNA and centromeric sequences of two different chromosome pairs (17 and X) after in situ hybridization. The use of HaeIII restriction enzyme that cut CpG islands combined with in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> identified the chromosome sites where active, inactive or housekeeping genes can be located. In chromosomes, the fluorescent reaction pattern showed large areas of labeling, while a more defined staining, often organized in spot pairs that resembled an R-like banding, was detected when the reflected mode was used. These results are confirmed by the observation that R-like bands actually are multiple symmetrical spots localized on sister chromatids. In addition, some chromosomes, and in particular 1 and 9, displayed a C-negative banding due to the negativity of the centromeric areas. Reflectance confocal scanning microscopy and in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> represent a powerful tool to study the in situ genome organization...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{frequency}} and mechanism of cell death in atherosclerotic plaques with a recent history (70 % diameter reduction undergoing carotid endarterectomy. In situ tailing and <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> of fragmented DNA, agarose gel electrophoresis of plaque DNA and electron microscopy were used to identify cell death by apoptosis (programmed cell death) and oncosis. The mean number of cells containing fragmented DNA in the plaques was 12. 7 ± 3. 5 % (n = 15). Focal accumulations of cells with DNA fragmentation occurred in the fibrous cap, at sites of rupture, close to lipid deposits and necrosis and was always accompanied by the presence of inflammatory cells. Electrophoretic separation of DNA isolated from part of plaques, where the presence of DNA fragmentation had previously been demonstrated by in situ DNA <b>nick</b> <b>translation,</b> resulted in multiple ladders of 180 - 200 base pairs characteristic of apoptosis. Electron microscopic analysis revealed presence of cells with morphological signs of degeneration in a frequency even higher than that found by in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation.</b> Some of these cells had a characteristic apoptotic appearance with condensed chromatin and cytoplasm, but the large majority of the cells had an ultrastructure typical for cells undergoing cell death by oncosis with membrane disruption and swollen, disintegrating organelles.

In addition to this, in ~ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> has been used to distinguish constitutive heterochromatin in mouse and human mitotic chromosomes. Based on relative levels of DNAse I sensitivity, the inactive X chromosome could not be distinguished from the active X chromosome in either mouse or human tissues but regions of constitutive heterochromatin could be distinguished by their relative DNAse I insensitivity. The use of !D situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> was also applied to tissue sections of 7. 5 day mouse embryos to ask whether differing levels of DNAse I sensitivity could be detected between different tissue types. Differences in DNAse I sensitivities were detected in three tissues examined; embryonic ectoderm, an embryo-derived tissue, and two extraembryonic tissues, extraembryonic ectoderm and ectoplacental cone. Embryonic ectoderm and extraembryonic ectoderm nuclei possessed comparable levels of DNAse I sensitivity while ectoplacental cone was significantly less DNAse I sensitive.

METHODS: Spermatozoa from patients undergoing IVF were analysed by examining the conventional semen parameters and DNA/chromatin integrity, using in-situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> (NT) and the Chromomycin A(3) fluorochrome, which indirectly demonstrates a decreased presence of protamine. Samples were examined before and after preparation using discontinuous density gradient centrifugation.

Sperm nuclear integrity as assessed by in-situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> (NT) demonstrated a very clear relationship with sperm concentration, motility and morphology. Morphology correlated with fertilization rates of patients undergoing IVF, while NT values of the spermatozoa post-preparation were significantly lower in pregnant patients.

In contrast to HL 60 cells, biotinylated dUTP could not be effectively incorporated into apoptotic CLL lymphocytes using exogenous TdT. This suggested that CLL lymphocytes possess a different type of endonuclease that cleaves DNA, leaving blunt or 3 &# 39; recessed DNA breaks, which are poor substrates for TdT. This possibility was tested using lambda exonuclease, which can convert a blunt or 3 &# 39; recessed DNA break into a 3 &# 39; overhang. Apoptotic CLL lymphocytes pre-treated with lambda exonuclease demonstrated increased nucleotide incorporation with TdT. Single-strand DNA breaks are also present in apoptotic CLL lymphocytes, as labelled nucleotides could be incorporated using the in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> assay.

40|$|International audienceEpithelial {{cells from}} the lens equator {{differentiate}} into elongated fiber cells. In the final steps of differentiation, the chromatin appears quite condensed and chromatin breakdown into nucleosomes occurs. DNA breaks due to an endodeoxyribonuclease activity corresponding to at least two polypeptides of 30 and 40 kDa have been identified. To identify the nature and the developmental appearance of initial breaks, <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> reaction was followed both biochemically and in situ in fiber and epithelial cells from chick embryonic lenses. There is no accumulation of single-strand breaks (SSB) with 3 'OH ends in lens fiber cells during embryonic development. Such damage can be increased in these cells by treatment with DNAase I indicating {{the absence of an}} inhibitor of the <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> reaction in fiber cells. However, there are indications of the presence of DNA breaks with blocked termini when the phosphatase activity of nuclease P 1 is used. The presence of breaks is also indicated by the large amounts of (ADP-ribose) n found in lens fibers particularly at 11 days of embryonic development (E 11) as ADP-ribosyl transferase binds to and is activated by DNA strand breaks. Incubation of lens cells in vitro, which causes nucleosomal fragmentation only in fiber cells, produces SSB with 3 'OH ends in both epithelia and fibers. Incubation for short periods, observed in experiments in situ, induces SSB first in the central fiber nuclei, which are late in differentiation. This may indicate that these SSB play a physiological role. Long incubations produce larger numbers of SSB in epithelia than fibers. The SSB in the fibers may have been converted into double-strand breaks (D SB), seen as nucleosomal fragments, and therefore no longer act as substrates for <b>nick</b> <b>translation.</b> The nuclease activity responsible for SSB production is independent of divalent cations and could be implicated in lens terminal differentiation...|$|R

This model of limbic status epilepticus {{has been widely}} studied using classical neuropathological techniques. We used in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> histochemistry to examine patterns of DNA fragmentation in this model. We found a stereotyped and reproducible pattern of neuronal populations that demonstrate evidence of DNA fragmentation from 24 h to one week after kainate treatment. Neither blockade of new protein synthesis nor blockade of the N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors significantly altered this response. Moreover, we saw no evidence of the regular internucleosomal cleavage of DNA that produces a characteristic laddered appearance of 180 – 200 bp DNA fragments after gel electrophoresis in samples obtained from microdissected aVected regions. These studies suggest that DNA fragmentation after systemic kainate-induced seizures is {{not the result of}} programmed cell death.
