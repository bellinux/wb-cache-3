5|$|Some <b>nuclear</b> <b>safety</b> {{agencies}} {{make recommendations}} {{about the use}} of thorium mantles and have raised safety concerns regarding their manufacture and disposal; the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem, but that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is.|$|E
5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for <b>nuclear</b> <b>safety</b> reasons.|$|E

To complete the fault tree automatic modeling, the Visio Automation software technology is used to ana-lyze the topology of the <b>nuclear</b> power <b>safety</b> I&C system hardware device and software function. The good result in practical implementations shows that the <b>nuclear</b> power <b>safety</b> I&C system fault tree modeling work is successfully simplified...|$|R

5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Safety</b> Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{university}} also operates the McMaster Nuclear Reactor, used for nuclear {{science and engineering}} research since 1959. The University regularly acquires an operating license for the reactor from the Canadian <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Safety</b> Commission, with the latest 10-year license issued on 1 July 2014. The strength of nuclear science at McMaster was augmented in 1968 under the presidency of Dr. H.G. Thode by {{the construction of a}} 10MV Model FN Tandem particle accelerator. The 3MV Model KN single-ended accelerator was added the same year. The academic direction of the laboratory fell to the Physics Department in the early days, as it was primarily a nuclear structure laboratory. During the next 28 years, the nuclear research effort was extensive, with hundreds of graduate students trained and many publications generated. The SLOWPOKE reactor is used for research, educational, and commercial applications such as neutron radiography, and medical radioisotope production; Iodine-125 is used in cancer therapy. The reactor at McMaster produces 25 percent of the world's supply of iodine-125, an isotope used in nuclear medicine to treat prostate cancer. The production of molybdenum-99 at Chalk River Laboratories has occasionally been moved to the University's reactor, when Chalk River's National Research Universal reactor is forced to shut down.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Arthur's arrival, Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources {{in case of}} power outages and other impacts in the region. Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival. Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by battening down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches and camping grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees. Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel {{would be prepared to}} respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for emergency assistance. The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm, with Canadian <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Safety</b> Commission employees deployed to the site.|$|E

25|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>safety</b> {{covers the}} actions taken to prevent nuclear and {{radiation}} {{accidents and incidents}} or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs {{but there is no}} guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake, despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>safety</b> administration. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master <b>nuclear</b> <b>safety.</b> Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable. An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005–2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.|$|E

40|$|The <b>nuclear</b> {{criticality}} <b>safety</b> {{for handling}} and burial of certain special nuclear materials (SNM) at low-level-waste (LLW) facilities is {{licensed by the}} US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the approach used {{to resolve the}} <b>Nuclear</b> Criticality <b>Safety</b> Issue for the Hanford Site high-level waste tanks. Although operational controls {{have been in place}} at the Hanford Site throughout its operating life to minimize the amount of fissile material discarded as waste, estimates of the total amount of plutonium that entered the waste tanks range from 500 to 1, 000 kg. <b>Nuclear</b> criticality <b>safety</b> concerns were heightened in 1991 based on a review of waste analysis results and a subsequent U. S. Department of Energy 1399 review of the nuclear criticality program. Although the DOE review team concluded that there was no imminent risk of a criticality at the Hanford Site tank farms, the team also stated its concern regarding the lack of definitive knowledge of the fissile material inventory and distribution within the waste tanks and the lack of sufficient management support for the overall criticality safety program. An in-depth technical review of the <b>nuclear</b> criticality <b>safety</b> of the waste tanks was conducted to develop a defensible technical basis to ensure that waste tanks are subcritical. The review covered all relevant aspects of <b>nuclear</b> criticality <b>safety</b> including neutronics and chemical and physical phenomena of the waste form under aging waste conditions as well as during routine waste management operations. This paper provides a review of the technical basis to support the conclusion that given current plutonium inventories and operating conditions, a nuclear criticality is incredible. The DOE has been requested to close the <b>Nuclear</b> Criticality <b>Safety</b> Issue. The Defense <b>Nuclear</b> Facilities <b>Safety</b> Board is currently reviewing the technicalbasis...|$|R
