For introducing interfaces into <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials,</b> the nanoparticle tableting method [16 – 21] is applied to prepare the <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials</b> in this paper.

There are three different ways to prepare nanoparticle tablets [22 – 28]: the hot-pressing method, the cold-pressing method, and the self-forming method. Different methods will lead to different porosities. The porosity of a nanoparticle powder can be larger than 85 % {{in the absence of}} the pressing method applied [29, 30]. For the hot-pressing method, the porosity of the nanoparticle tablet can be lower than 10 % [31], while the porosity could span a large scale for the cold-pressing method. Nanoporous tablet which is composed of air and nanoparticles is also called a nanoparticle packed bed (NPB). The cold-pressing method is applied in this paper to obtain a large span of porosity, which ranges from 15 to 40 %.|$|R

Paper does not, however, readily enable advanced functionality required for complex diagnostics, such as analyte concentration and controlled analyte transport. That is, after the initial wetting, no further analyte manipulation is possible. Here, we demonstrate active concentration and transport of analytes in fully wet paper-based assays by leveraging <b>nanoporous</b> <b>material</b> (mean pore diameter ≈ 4 nm) and ion concentration polarization. Two classes of devices are developed, an external stamp-like device with the <b>nanoporous</b> <b>material</b> separate from the paper-based assay, and an in-paper device patterned with the <b>nanoporous</b> <b>material.</b> Experimental results demonstrate up to 40 -fold concentration of a fluorescent tracer in fully wet paper, and directional transport of the tracer over centimeters with efficiencies up to 96 %. In-paper devices are applied to concentrate protein and colored dye, extending their limits of detection from ∼ 10 to ∼ 2 pmol/mL and from ∼ 40 to ∼ 10 μM, respectively. This approach is demonstrated in nitrocellulose membrane as well as paper, and the added cost of the <b>nanoporous</b> <b>material</b> is very low at ∼ 0. 015 USD per device.

The results showed a fast response within 4 s and a linear glucosedependent electrochemical response over a wide range of glucose concentration (500 nM- 10 mM). The measurements of intracellular glucose concentrations with our biosensor were consistent with the values of intracellular glucose concentrations reported in the literature. The sensor also demonstrated its capability by detecting an increase in the intracellular glucose concentration induced by insulin. We found that the ZnO <b>nanoporous</b> <b>material</b> provides sensitivity as high as 1. 8 times higher than that obtained using ZnO nanorods under the same conditions.

40|$|<b>Nanoporous</b> <b>materials</b> {{have been}} widely used in the fields of {{biological}} and chemical sensing, chemical separation, heterogeneous catalysis and biomedicine due to their merits of high surface area-to-volume ratio, chemical and thermal stabilities, and flexible surface modification. However, as the nature of <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials,</b> they are inherently heterogeneous in the micro- and nanoenvironments. The environmental heterogeneity plays a decisive role in determining the performance of various applications of <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials.</b> In order to provide an in-depth understanding of the <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials,</b> it is of great interest to investigate the environmental heterogeneity in them. Single molecule spectroscopy, combined the quantitative confocal fluorescence imaging which possesses the capability of optical sectioning, has demonstrated to be a powerful tool to approach the environmental heterogeneity inside <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials.</b> Single molecule spectroscopy is an ultrasensitive technique for probing molecular transport and properties of individual molecules. This technique has been extensively used in the research of environmental heterogeneity in <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials</b> since it removes the issues of ensemble averaging and directly approaches detailed information that is obscured in ensemble measurements. In order to proficiently interpret single molecule data, we developed a comprehensive methodology – single molecule counting – for characterizing molecular transport in nanoporous silica. With this methodology as a tool, the nanoenvironmental heterogeneity inside the nanopores of C 18 -derivatized silica particles was explored by probing single molecular diffusion inside the pores. By employing single molecule ratiometric spectroscopy and a solvatochromic fluorophore as viii reporter of local environment, the gradient in nanopolarity as well as the nanoviscosity along the C 18 layer after the inclusion of solvent was uncovered. The chemical properties of solute molecules at the nanopore surface are ultimately controlled by the energetics of the solute-interface interactions. The imaging of distribution of energies would be a decisive approach to assess the fundamental heterogeneity of the interface. To this end, we investigated the ΔG distribution of C 18 -derivatized nanoporous silica particles with quantitative confocal imaging. The pixel-to-pixel and particle-to-particle analysis showed the existence of ΔG heterogeneity between particles as well as within individual particles. The heterogeneity in ΔG could be partially responsible for band broadening in chemical separations and significantly affect overall reaction yield when using <b>nanoporous</b> <b>materials</b> as solid support for heterogeneous catalysis...|$|R
