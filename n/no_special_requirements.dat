50|$|Where agents replace {{both human}} teams, the {{simulation}} can become fully computerised and can, with minimal supervision, run by itself. The main {{advantage of this}} is the ready accessibility of the simulation—beyond the time required to program and update the computer models, <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> are necessary. A fully computerised simulation can run at virtually any time and in almost any location, the only equipment needed being a laptop computer. There is no need to juggle schedules to suit busy participants, acquire suitable facilities and arrange for their use, or obtain security clearances. An additional important advantage is the ability to perform many hundreds or even thousands of iterations in the time that it would take a manual simulation to run once. This means statistical information can be gleaned from such a model; outcomes can be quoted in terms of probabilities, and plans developed accordingly.|$|E

40|$|Optimization of {{a process}} for extracting {{astaxanthin}} from Phaffia rhodozyma by acidic method was investigated, regarding several extraction factors such as acids, organic solvents, temperature and time. Fractional factorial design, central composite design and response surface methodology were used to derive a statistically optimal model, which corresponded to the following optimal condition: concentration of lactic acid at 5. 55 mol/L, ratio of ethanol to yeast dry weight at 20. 25 ml/g, temperature for cell-disruption at 30 °C, and extraction time for 3 min. Under this condition, astaxanthin and the total carotenoids could be extracted in amounts of 1294. 7 μg/g and 1516. 0 μg/g, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, the {{extended}} {{finite element method}} (X-FEM) is employed to present a static fracture analysis of two-dimensional interfacial crack problems in linear magnetoelectroelastic (MEE) bimaterials. Magnetoelectrically impermeable crack-face boundary conditions are adopted and the multi-field coupled effect in MEE bodies is considered. In order to capture the oscillating singularity of {{the extended}} stresses near the interfacial crack tip, suitable crack tip enrichment functions for anisotropic and transversely isotropic MEE bimaterials are newly derived and further applied to perform X-FEM analysis. As the fracture parameter, the J-integral is evaluated using the domain form of the contour integral. By comparing yielded results with the analytical and numerical solutions of the corresponding interfacial crack problems, {{the validity of the}} proposed formulation is verified. Moreover, it is shown that the results obtained by way of the new enrichment functions are superior to those obtained by the fourfold enrichment functions and twelvefold enrichment functions, {{especially in the case of}} topological enrichment. If there is <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>requirement</b> for precision, the fourfold enrichment functions with less computational cost can also be used to conduct X-FEM analysis for the present proble...|$|R

30|$|EVs should {{satisfy the}} norms and {{requirements}} of the power system, and become well-behaved loads. Compared to other loads, EVs have <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> for power quality. On the rare occasions when an EV is not available because of a power outage, the user can often choose alternate travel modes or can cancel his or her trip plans; generally, {{there would be no}} unavoidable great losses. In contrast, the enormous scale of the power system makes it difficult to estimate and manage the losses caused by breakdowns. Obviously, the safety and reliability of the power system should not be affected by EVs. Additionally, from the perspective of technical considerations, EVs can deal with harmonics and fluctuations that they cause by advanced converters and control technology.|$|E
40|$|The {{abundance}} of heavy elements (metallicity) in the photospheres of stars {{similar to the}} Sun provides a 'fossil' record of the chemical composition of the initial protoplanetary disk. Metal-rich stars {{are much more likely}} to harbour gas giant planets(1 - 4), supporting the model that planets form by accumulation of dust and ice particles(5). Recent ground-based surveys suggest that this correlation is weakened for Neptunian-sized planets(4, 6 - 9). However, how the relationship between size and metallicity extends into the regime of terrestrial-sized exoplanets is unknown. Here we report spectroscopic metallicities of the host stars of 226 small exoplanet candidates discovered by NASA's Kepler mission(10), including objects that are comparable in size to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. We find that planets with radii less than four Earth radii form around host stars with a wide range of metallicities (but on average a metallicity close to that of the Sun), whereas large planets preferentially form around stars with higher metallicities. This observation suggests that terrestrial planets may be widespread in the disk of the Galaxy, with <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>requirement</b> of enhanced metallicity for their formation...|$|R

But these debates seem meaningless because {{most of them were}} based on different definitions. In this paper, diversity has two components: richness based on the total number and evenness based on the relative abundance. Species diversity is distinguished into individual-counting diversity and biomass-based diversity. Ecotope diversity is divided into individual ecotope-counting diversity and ecotope-area based diversity. Under this definition, we make a comprehensive investigation into Dongzhi tableland of Loess Plateau by cooperating with local technicians. We find that individual-counting diversity is significantly correlated with biomass-based diversity in grassland ecosystems; individual ecotope-counting diversity and ecotope-area based diversity have a significant correlation. Therefore, it is unnecessary to divide species diversity into individual-counting diversity and biomass-based diversity in grassland ecosystems and to distinguish ecotope diversity into individual ecotope-counting and ecotope-area based diversity for the issues that have <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>requirement</b> for accuracy. But the analyses of the investigation data demonstrate that species diversity has no significant correlation with ecotope diversity...|$|R
40|$|Data centers provide {{resources}} {{for a broad}} range of services, such as web search, email, web sites, etc, each with different delay requirements. For example, web search should cater to users' requests quickly, while data backup has <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>requirement</b> on completion time. Different applications also introduce flows with very different properties (e. g., size and duration). The default method of transport in data centers, namely TCP, treats flows equally, forcing equal share of the bottleneck network bandwidth. This fairness property leads to poor outcomes for time-sensitive applications. A better solution is to allocate more bandwidth to time-sensitive applications. However, the state-of-the-art approaches that do this all require forklift changes to data center networking gear. In some cases, substantial changes need to be made to end-system stacks and applications as well. In this paper, we argue that a simple modification to TCP can help better meet the requirements of latency-sensitive applications in the data center. No modification to end-systems, applications or networking gear is necessary. We motivate our design using measurements of real data center traffic. We analytically derive the parameters to use in our proposed modification to TCP. Finally, we use extensive simulations in NS 2 to show the benefits of our approach...|$|R
