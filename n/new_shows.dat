5|$|Troy McClure hosts a {{television}} special {{from the museum}} of TV and television introducing three spin-off productions, created using characters from The Simpsons. The Fox network only has three filled slots for the next season and so commissions the producers of The Simpsons to create thirty-five <b>new</b> <b>shows.</b> The producers instead decided to create just three <b>new</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|E
5|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce <b>new</b> <b>shows</b> for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal and the 1970s horror series , triggered the idea for The X-Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create <b>new</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|E
50|$|In December 1992, for {{the premiere}} of The Jackie Thomas Show, a hot switch was used where {{the end of an}} episode of Roseanne had the Connor family {{watching}} the <b>new</b> <b>show</b> on television, and then the <b>new</b> <b>show</b> then began. To see if this worked, ABC paid ACNielsen for a minute by minute ratings report, and found that most viewers stayed with the <b>new</b> <b>show</b> for the entire pilot episode.|$|R

5|$|The series {{premiere of}} The Playboy Club was {{initially}} broadcast on September 19, 2011 in the United States on NBC. It was watched by 5.02 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with Hawaii Five-0 on CBS and Castle on ABC. That {{was the lowest}} viewership among the major networks in its 10 p.m. timeslot, with Castle drawing 13.28 million households and Hawaii Five-0 attaining 12.19 million households. The episode gradually shed viewers from the first half to the next, {{with an average of}} 5.36 million households tuning in for the first half-hour and an average of 4.69 million households for the second. The debut earned a 1.6 rating/4 share among viewers in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielson ratings, indicating it was viewed by four percent of those in the demographic who were actively watching television during the broadcast, which represented 1.6 percent of the total demographic. This was considered a disappointing result for a coveted demographic. Speculations regarding the possible cancelation of the series immediately surfaced, but NBC officials told Deadline.com that such a decision would not be rushed because NBC Chairman Bob Greenblatt wanted to send a message that the network was willing to give all their <b>new</b> <b>shows</b> the necessary time to find an audience and succeed. Similarly in Canada, the pilot episode was viewed by 485,000 viewers.|$|E
5|$|US {{cast members}} Kevin Clash and Marty Robinson have cast and trained the {{international}} puppeteers. At first, Muppet builder Kermit Love constructed the puppets for the <b>new</b> <b>shows</b> in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, Jim Henson's Creature Shop, overseen by Connie Peterson, {{has taken over}} puppet creation. The producers of Sisimpur, the Bangladesh co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and {{an important part of}} their culture. The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research to ascertain whether their curriculum goals were met, just as was done in the US after the first season of Sesame Street. According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, riots and conflicts between Serbs and Albanians in 2004 delayed production of the Kosovo co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.|$|E

50|$|During this period, some {{elements}} for the <b>new</b> <b>show</b> {{had already been}} installed in preparation of the <b>new</b> <b>show</b> {{and had to be}} hidden. This included the Audio-Animatronic figure of Ellen DeGeneres in the diorama. To solve this, temporary rockwork was placed in front of the figure hiding it from view. However, the Elasmosaurus figure had already been reprogrammed for the <b>new</b> <b>show,</b> leading to the awkward result of having it lunge at rocks instead of at the ride vehicles as it had originally done.|$|R
