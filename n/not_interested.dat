[...] "'The individual’ is the category of spirit, of spiritual awakening, a thing as opposite to politics as well could be thought of. Earthly reward, power, honour, etc., have no connexion with the right use of this category. For even if it is used {{in the interest of the}} established order, inwardness does <b>not</b> <b>interest</b> the world; and when it is used catastrophically, it still does <b>not</b> <b>interest</b> the world, for to make sacrifices, or to be sacrificed (which may in fact be the consequence of declining to entertain the thought of becoming a power of a material sort), does <b>not</b> <b>interest</b> the world. ‘The individual’-that is the decisive Christian category, and it will be decisive also for the future of Christianity." ...|$|R
5|$|Despite the game's {{receiving}} general {{critical acclaim}} and selling well, Peter Jackson, {{director of the}} Lord of the Rings film trilogy, stated that the video game tie-in for his next film, King Kong, would not be developed by EA but by Ubisoft.

5|$|On 15 August 2008, 1FLTV, {{licensed}} by Liechtenstein's Government, {{became the first}} broadcaster based in Liechtenstein.

Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced that they were <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> in joining the EBU or Eurovision at that time {{because they had no}} budget for membership.|$|E

5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the front office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company.

However, Liberty was <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E
