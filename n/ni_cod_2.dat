40|$|X linked {{progressive}} cone-rod dystrophy (COD) is a retinal disease primarily {{affecting the}} cone photoreceptors. The disease is genetically heterogeneous and two loci, COD 1 (Xp 21. 1 - 11. 4) and <b>COD</b> <b>2</b> (Xq 27. 2 - 28), have been previously identified. COD 1 was recently {{shown to be}} caused by mutations in RPGR exon ORF 15 (Xp 21. 1), the gene that is also responsible for RP 3 type retinitis pigmentosa. In this study, we performed a linkage study to map the disease gene in a large Finnish family with X linked cone-rod dystrophy, using a panel of 39 X chromosomal markers. Several recombinations between the disease gene and markers in the Xp 21. 1 -p 11. 4 region have excluded COD 1 as a candidate locus in this family. Consistent with the linkage results, no mutation was detected by direct PCR sequencing of the coding region of RPGR, including exon ORF 15. The <b>COD</b> <b>2</b> locus has been also excluded as the site of the gene on the basis of negative lod score values obtained for <b>COD</b> <b>2</b> linked markers. The disease causing gene of the studied COD family has been localised between the markers DXS 10042 and DXS 8060 on Xp 11. 4 -q 13. 1. Positive pairwise lod scores > 3 were obtained for markers DXS 993, MAOB, DXS 1055, and DXS 1194.

Most of the synthesized species were found to be nonrigid in solution, and their fluxional behavior was studied by variable-temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy. An X-ray diffraction study of the assemblies (1 a) 2 and (1 d) 2 revealed the formation of rectangular (9. 6 Å × 6. 6 Å) hexanuclear metallomacrocycles with alternating dinuclear (Rh 2) and mononuclear (Rh or Pt) corners.

This longitudinal and cross-sectional study aimed to analyze {{the effectiveness of a}} motivational activity program for oral hygiene habits formation after motivation and without constant reinforcement. Materials and Methods: The sample was constituted of 26 children (mean 6 years old) from a Public Kindergarten School in Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil. Data were collected applying a test-chart, with figures reporting the process of dental health/illness. Some figures were considered positive to dental health (dentist/Cod 1, toothbrush/Cod 3, dentifrice/dental floss/Cod 6, fruits/vegetables/Cod 7 and tooth without caries lesion/Cod 8) and negative on dental health (sweets/Cod 2, bacteria/Cod 4, tooth with caries lesion/Cod 5). The figures presentation occurred in three different stages: First stage - figures were presented to children without previous knowledge; second stage - following the motivational presentation, and third stage - 30 days after the first contact. Results: On the first stage, most children select good for the figures considered harmful to their teeth (<b>Cod</b> <b>2</b> - 88 %; Cod 4 - 77 % and Cod 5 - 65 %). On the second stage, there was a lower percentage: 23 % (P < 0. 0001), 8 % (P < 0. 0001), and 23 % (P = 0. 0068) related to the <b>Cod</b> <b>2,</b> 4, and 5.

Multi-player online games (MPOG) are constituting {{a large portion of}} the Internet traffic. MPOG players demand high bandwidth and low delay due to high interaction in these games. Moreover, they generate bursty traffic. In this paper, we analyze the traffic characteristics of a popular MPOG type game; Call of Duty 2 version 1. 0 (<b>CoD</b> <b>2).</b> We use several game sessions to extract packet size and inter-arrival time distributions.

For the server-side, traffic characteristics vary with the number of players, but the traffic is long-range dependent most of the time. There are several intervals when the traffic process is non-stationary where the analysis of self-similarity becomes trivial. For the client-side, the traffic shows little variations however there are still some cases where the analysis of self-similarity becomes intricate because the traffic process reveals deviation from stationarity.
