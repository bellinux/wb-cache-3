40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) calculate aggressive interactions around the water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> and to (2) determine preference for a water bowl location when pigs were offered either one, two or three water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. Information is available on the current drinker to nursery pig’s ratios (drinker: pigs). In the UK producers are recommended 1 : 15, while in the US it is 1 : 10 for nursery pigs. A total of 225 crossbred were seven weeks of age. Conventional nursery pens had plastic flooring and all pigs had ad-libitum access to a commercially formulated diet. Water was delivered through a single stainless steel water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> and was provided ad libitum. All pigs received a natural light cycle from a curtain sided building. Nine pens were used for behavioral measures. Three treatments were compared. Treatment one (TRT 1; n = 3) was defined as one water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> per pen. Treatment two (TRT 2; n = 3) was defined as two water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. Treatment three (TRT 3; n = 3) was defined as three water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. One day prior to visual recording of drinking behavior, all pigs in a pen were identified with an individual number. One 12 V black and white CCTV camera was positioned over each water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> and behavior was recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days onto a DVR at 1 frame per second. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> for 5 s or longer) was obtained by three experienced observers who viewed the recordings using 24 h mode (5 frame / s) onto the Observer software. Total number of aggressive interactions and length of aggression around the water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> over the 6 h period was not (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) different between the treatments. The total amount of time that nursery pigs spent when offered two (F vs. O) water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> in a pen did not (P = 0. 47) differ. However, when pigs were offered three (F vs. O vs. A) water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> in a pen there was a difference (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) for total amount of time spent at all three locations. In conclusion, pigs displayed a water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> preference with the alley location being the least favored however, there were no difference in the number or length of aggressive interactions...|$|R
40|$|A summer {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{examine the impact of}} drinker design on pig performance, water use and manure volume. Pigs with access to Drik-O-Mat® <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> had similar daily gains, lower feed intake and improved feed conversion compared to pigs with access to a WaterSwing® nipple drinker. Water use was reduced 24. 8 percent for the <b>bowl</b> versus swing <b>drinkers.</b> Manure volume was reduced 21. 6 percent for the <b>bowl</b> versus swing <b>drinker.</b> The difference in manure volume is most likely due to a reduction in water wastage. Selection of drinker devices must include consideration of the manure system design and the need for wasted water for the manure system to function correctly...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{information}} on the pigs 2 ̆ 7 temporal drinking patterns is essential when delivering water based health products {{because there is a}} risk that not all pigs will visit the drinker adequately and hence, may not have received sufficient vaccine or antibiotics required to protect the animal. Limited research has evaluated drinking visits and water disappearance in nursery pigs. Recent work has begun to investigate the pig to water resource ratio and the placement and type of water delivery systems.;This thesis covers the areas of: (1) drinking behavior of seven week old pigs when water is either withheld for a period of 15 h or provided ad libitum and (2) drinking behavior, aggressive interactions, water bowl preference, and performance measures between seven week old nursery pigs when provided a 1 : 25, 1 : 12, or 1 : 8 drinker to pig ratio.;In the first study a total of 194 seven week old PIC (USA) pigs, weighing 22. 98 +/- 5. 38 kg were housed in single sex pens in a commercial nursery facility. Two treatments were compared; treatment one; withheld (WH; n = 4) pigs did not have access to water for 15 h and treatment two, control (CONT; n = 4) pigs had continuous ad libitum access to water. Drinking behavior was recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the nipple-cup drinker for 5 s or longer) was obtained. Total number of visits, visit lengths and water disappearance were analyzed.;This study found that manipulating water access for a period of 15 h affected the number and length of drinking visits to the nipple cup drinker over a 6 h period, with WH pigs spending longer at the water resource and visiting more often than their CONT counterparts. Upon breaking each hour down respectively the differences (P = 0. 0001) were noted in the first hour (0700) after water was restored with the control group making fewer visits (1. 96 vs. 4. 46 +/- 0. 26) and spending less time (18. 08 +/- 4. 04 vs. 64. 44 +/- 4. 02) at the nipple cup drinker when compared to the withholding group. After 60 min of water restoration there were no differences in the number of visits or length of time spent at the nipple cup drinker between treatments. In addition, water disappearance over the observational period was greater for pigs that had water withheld compared to pigs that were in the control treatment.;In the second study a total of 225 crossbred (21 +/- 4 d) gilts weighing 5. 38 +/- 2. 65 kg were used. Nine pens were used for behavioral and performance measures (average daily gain [ADG]), and three treatments were compared. Treatment one (TRT 1; n = 3) was defined as one water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> per pen. Treatment two (TRT 2; n = 3) was defined as two water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen and treatment three (TRT 3; n = 3) was defined as three water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. Drinking behavior, aggressive interactions and water bowl preference were recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> for 5 s or longer) was obtained. The total number of drinking visits and visit lengths, number of aggressive interactions and duration, water bowl preference, in regards to the length of time spent at each drinker, and performance measures were analyzed.;When offered more places to drink, pigs visited the water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> more often (P = 0. 0209) which tended (P = 0. 06) to increase ADG in nursery aged pigs. In addition, pigs displayed a water <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> preference with the alley location being the least favored. Additional {{information on}} placement of key resources within a pen to enhance the drinking behavior for the pig is a useful tool for the swine industry and stakeholders when designing water delivery systems to enhance pig well-being and overall profitability.;Water functions, water quality, and water requirements are all essential to the well-being of the individual pig. It has been stated by numerous authors that water is the 2 ̆ 2 forgotten nutrient. 2 ̆ 2 Yet, information regarding water requirements for all stages of pig production, the specifics to optimize water delivery to the pig, water resource location within the home pen and the ratios of pigs to the drinking resource are to date limited. This research provides new information on water management manipulation and water bowl placement within a nursery pen that may affect the drinking patterns of the individual pig...|$|R
