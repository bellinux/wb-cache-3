40|$|To reach a <b>National</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Network</b> (NEN), further {{efforts in}} spatial {{planning}} {{of the green}} space are necessary. This is the main outcome of Nature Balance 2002. Nature has high social and economical values. According to the inhabitants of The Netherlands, nature areas and variation in landscape contribute significantly to their well-being. Nature and landscape also have ion and increases prices of housings in green areas. Evidence grows that green surroundings benefit people?s health. The European Union has composed a list of international protected plants and animal species. The Netherlands has accepted these duties as established in the Birds and Habitats Directives. More insight in the occurrence of these species in specific habitats is needed. This may increase public acceptance and implementation of species protection policies. In order to meet nature targets, spatial planning of the green environment is a necessity. Only {{in this way the}} coherent <b>National</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Network</b> can be realized. Offers of land to be incorporated in the NEN have increased during the last three years. The Dutch Government plans to halve the budget for acquiring land and instead have private land owners participate in nature management. Signing long-term contracts with these private owners can contribute to the nature goals, but is hardly less expensive than buying the land. Also more spatial protection of the NEN will be needed when less land for nature development is purchased...|$|E

40|$|The pan European {{biological}} and landscape diversity strategy (PEBDLS) was developed {{under the auspices}} of the Council of Europe in order to achieve the effective implementation of the convention of biological diversity (CBD) at the European level. A key element of PEBLDS has been the development of the Pan European <b>Ecological</b> <b>Network</b> (PEEN) as a guiding vision for coherence in biodiversity conservation. PEEN has been developed in three subprojects: Central and Eastern Europe, completed in 2002; South-eastern Europe, completed in 2006; and Western Europe, also completed in 2006. The methodology of the development of the three maps has been broadly comparable but data availability, differences in national databases, technical developments and geographical differences caused variations in the detailed approach. One of the challenges was to find common denominators for the habitat data in Europe; this was solved differently for the subprojects. The project has resulted in three maps that together constitute the PEEN. They differ in terms of ecological coherence and the need for ecological corridors; for example, in Central and Western Europe corridors are essential to provide connectivity, while in Northern, Eastern and South-eastern Europe larger, coherent natural areas still exist. The future steps in developing PEEN should include the implementation of <b>national</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> and, in particular, the pursuit of international coherence through the development of trans-European ecological corridors.
