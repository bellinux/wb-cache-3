5|$|After Burke's first {{campaign}} for alderman, {{he has been}} unopposed in most of his re-election campaigns.

A Burke supporter unsuccessfully challenged {{the validity of the}} opponent's ballot application, but the case was tied up in court for most of the campaign, and Burke went on to win with nearly 90 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks <b>never</b> <b>run</b> simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can <b>never</b> <b>run</b> from his past.|$|E

CNEV had no boats, no clubhouse, only four members (vice presidents of the Spanish Sailing Federation), and had <b>never</b> <b>run</b> a regatta of any type. On July5, 2007 SNG and CNEV released the protocols for the next Cup regatta.

25|$|An {{effort to}} get him to run for the U.S. Senate has stalled indefinitely, Zinni having said he will <b>never</b> <b>run</b> for office. He says his {{decision}} to endorse President George W. Bush in 2000 was a mistake, and in 2003, indicated that he plans to avoid politics in the future. However, on March 3, 2006, Zinni joined fellow former United States Marines General Joseph P. Hoar, Lt. General Greg Newbold, Lt. General Frank Petersen, and Congressman Jack Murtha in endorsing fellow former U.S. Marine and Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb for U.S. Senate in Virginia. Zinni had been floated as a possible Vice Presidential running mate of Barack Obama, the 2008 Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|Although {{one of the}} {{original}} purposes of the second-tier series was for driver development, Cup Series drivers have been moonlighting in the series since its inception in 1982 (as the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series), when Winston Cup Champion Dale Earnhardt won the series' inaugural event at Daytona International Speedway. Prior to the year 2000, Cup drivers would often limit their schedules in the Busch Series, partially because the majority of the races were held at separate venues from the Cup Series. Two of the most notable drivers to frequent the second-tier series, Mark Martin and Harry Gant, have <b>never</b> <b>run</b> more than 17 Busch series races during any single season in their career except for Martin's 1987 season. In the past, Cup drivers had also run in equipment independent from Cup Series teams; drivers Michael Waltrip and Joe Nemechek for example fielded their own race teams in the then-Busch Series for many years. The presence of veteran Cup drivers helped to develop several future Cup Series regulars, including Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte, and Jeff Burton.|$|E

25|$|Booth's sawmill {{operations}} could <b>never</b> <b>run</b> at {{full capacity}} because the output {{could not be}} carried out of the lumber yards fast enough. Because of these transportation problems in the Ottawa area, Booth became an important participant {{in the development of}} Canada's railway system when he purchased the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway (M) and the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company (C) in 1879, amalgamating them to form the Canada Atlantic Railway. The M had received a charter to build southeast from Ottawa to Coteau Landing on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River. The C had received a charter to build a bridge across the St. Lawrence River to Valleyfield, Quebec and then operate a railway across southwestern Quebec to the United States border. Due to financial difficulties, neither line had been completed, and Booth worked to complete the entire route by 1882. The Coteau bridge was completed in 1890, thus eliminating the necessity of transshipping cargo by barge. The CAR formed a subsidiary, the Vermont and Province Line Railroad, which would build a line to Swanton, Vermont on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain in 1897, thus connecting Ottawa to the United States via the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Rutland Railroad, and the Central Vermont Railway.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of putting}} the clauses {{creating}} CPE inside the bill it was proposing to Parliament, the government chose to submit it as an amendment of its own text. This bypasses some compulsory legal review by the Conseil d'État and reduces the time available for examination {{by members of the}} Parliament. Earlier in 2006, president of the Assembly Jean-Louis Debré, though a fellow member of UMP and an ally of Villepin, complained about the Villepin government submitting lengthy amendments of its own bills and said that it showed these bills were badly prepared. Furthermore, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin forced approval of the law by the Assembly on its first reading by invoking article 49-3 of the Constitution: under 49-3, a bill is considered approved in its present state by the Assembly unless the Assembly chooses to dismiss the Prime Minister. Such a move hardly ever occurs, since both the Assembly and the Prime Minister are from the same majority. Use of 49-3 is seen as an infringement on the legislative prerogatives of Parliament and is thus reserved for exceptional cases. As many have pointed out, especially when the Prime Minister announced the use of 49-3, Dominique de Villepin has <b>never</b> <b>run</b> for elected office.|$|E
25|$|After her disappointing {{performances}} at the 1996 Olympic Games, and her relatively poor season in 1997, few {{would have predicted}} the remarkable comeback that Sonia O'Sullivan made in 1998. Her year got off to an amazing start at the World Cross-Country Championships at Marrakech in March. O'Sullivan entered both the short course (4km) and long course (8km) events, a double which few athletes even attempt, much less have any success at. On successive days, O'Sullivan won both events, and her 4km time of 12:20 was a massive 14 seconds ahead of her nearest rival. O'Sullivan continued this form into the track season, where her performances in the 1500 m, 3000 m and 5000 m were close to those she had produced at her peak in 1994 and 1995. At the European Athletics Championships in Budapest, the 1500 m and 5000 m finals, events at which O'Sullivan usually doubled at major championships, were scheduled to be run on the same day, thus denying her the opportunity of competing in both events. Undeterred, O'Sullivan entered the 5000 m and 10000 m, having <b>never</b> <b>run</b> the latter event before on the track. In the 10000 m final, on 19 August, she shadowed the leaders, and then produced an astonishing 28.1 second final 200 metres to win {{the gold medal in}} 31:29.33 in her debut at the distance. Four days later, in the more familiar territory of the 5000 m, the pace was set by Romanian Gabriela Szabo, but again, O'Sullivan produced an explosive finishing sprint to defeat Szabo in 15:06.50. At the World Cup held the following month in Johannesburg, O'Sullivan won her second major international 5000 m competition of the year, again sprinting clear of the opposition following a very slow pace. She concluded her year by winning the BUPA Great North Run.|$|E
