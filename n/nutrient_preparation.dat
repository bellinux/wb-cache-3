40|$|Abstract. Experience {{with use}} of the {{artificial}} kidney in the home led {{to the concept of}} self-infusion of parenteral nutrients at home. Originally c d e d an artificial gut, the term has been changed to home parenteral nutrition. The original method proposed for circulatory access, a side-arm on an A-V shunt, failed and forced the development of a right atrial catheter which proved to be both safe and longlasting. A safe and rapid self-mix system of <b>nutrient</b> <b>preparation</b> was developed which made the patient independent of the hospital pharmacy. A wearable infusion device proved workable but was abandoned because it was unnecessary and greatly interfered with patient rehabilitation. A portable infusion system has been developed which facilitates patient mobility during infusions as well as patient travel. On March 9, 1960 the first A-V shunt was placed in...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Rapid {{urbanization}} {{and population}} growth are largely responsible for&# 13; very high increasing rate of solid waste in the urban areas, its proper management and recycling is&# 13; major problems of Municipal Corporation. Conversion of industrial wastes in to beneficial&# 13; vermicompost not only solves solid waste accumulation but also yield highly nutritive organic manure. Approach: Enhancing the efficiency of earthworm that is involved in process of converting sugar mill&# 13; filter press mud in to vermicompost, will be highly economical. An African earthworm Eudrilus&# 13; eugeniae was used to convert the sugar mill filter press mud into nutritive vermicompost. To enhance&# 13; vermicomposting efficiency, an organic <b>nutrient</b> <b>preparation</b> Jeevamirtham, an effective microbial&# 13; suspension was supplemented. Results: The vermicompost yielded in Jeevamirtham supplemented&# 13; vermibed had a significantly high nitrogen, phosphorus and micronutrient value. In the Jeeamirtham&# 13; supplemeted vermicompost C/N ratio was 55. 5 % higher than that was present in the cowdung added&# 13; vermicompost. In filtermud-Jeevamirtham, vermibed the mean egg production by a single worm at 45 &# 13; days of growth was 12 &# 13; &# 13; Normal &# 13; 0 &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; false &# 13; false &# 13; false &# 13; &# 13; EN-US &# 13; X-NONE &# 13; X-NONE &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; /* Style Definitions */&# 13; table.

Jeevamirtham had influenced the egg production. When&# 13; compared to filtermud-cowdung vermibed reared worm, (77. 4 %) the hatchability of eggs in filtermud&# 13; jeevamirtham vermibed was high (85. 8 %). This indicates that the jeevamirtham supplementation&# 13; strengthens viability of the eggs. Conclusion: The present study recommends utilization of effective&# 13; microorganism suspension, Jeevamirtham for vermicomposting to enhance the functioning of the&# 13; earthworm and to increase fertilizer value of vermicompost. In the present study also macronutrient&# 13; and micronutrient content increased significantly in vermicompost prepared from pressmud waste&# 13; due to the supplementation of Jeevamirtham.

30|$|In many viticultural regions {{the natural}} {{nutrient}} composition of grape juice is considered suboptimal and {{may lead to}} a variety of fermentation problems including slow or stuck fermentations and formation of undesirable off-flavours (Blateyron and Sablayrolles 2001; Henschke and Jiranek 1993; Mendes-Ferreira et al. 2009; Sablayrolles et al. 1996; Schmidt et al. 2011; Torrea et al. 2011; Ugliano et al. 2010). To alleviate these deficiencies, various yeast <b>nutrient</b> <b>preparations</b> are often added to the juice prior to or during alcoholic fermentation, to contribute to the production of a quality wine. Among the nutrient supplements allowed by wine regulatory authorities in many countries are vitamins, inorganic nitrogen, usually in the form of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and organic <b>nutrient</b> <b>preparations.</b> The latter are typically prepared from inactive or autolysed yeast and are therefore usually composed of lipids, micro- and macro-elements, amino nitrogen, mannoproteins and insoluble material (for example see Pozo-Bayón (2009). Effects of these nutrients on the formation of key aroma groups in wine have been studied widely. The concentration of esters and higher alcohols, which impart fruity and fusel aromas respectively, were found to be influenced mostly by nitrogen availability (reviewed by Bell and Henschke (2005). Nitrogen is also considered a key modulator in the formation of volatile sulfur compounds, including H 2 S, a highly potent compound which possesses an odour reminiscent of rotten egg (Rauhut 1993).|$|R

40|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} (MLF) is {{an important}} step in wine production, and can take place spontaneously or by induction, typically after the completion of alcoholic fermentation. MLF is known to reduce unwanted acidity and produce desirable aromas in some wine styles. Wine lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used for MLF have fastidious nutritional requirements, which may not be met by wine constituents, impeding MLF. Commercial <b>nutrient</b> <b>preparations</b> are available to assist malolactic fermentation, but little is known about their exact composition and ability to support bacterial growth and performance. The aim {{of this study was to}} carry out a detailed chemical analysis of enological and malolactic nutrients, and to evaluate their effect on the growth of commercial malolactic bacterial strains. Six commercial nutrients were analyzed for moisture content, turbidity, elemental composition, free amino nitrogen (FAN), free amino acids, total amino acids, vitamins, and fatty acids. Two Oenococcus oeni and one Lactobacillus plantarum strains were used, in combination with each of the six nutrients, for growth studies under anaerobic conditions in a model wine solution. The six nutrients varied significantly in individual analytes, and both bacterial growth and the conversion of malic acid by the MLF were determined by the type of nutrient used.

40|$|Water {{availability}} in the Brazilian semiarid {{is restricted}} {{and often the}} only water source available has high salt concentrations. Hydroponics allows using these waters for production of various crops, including vegetables, however, the water salinity can cause nutritional disorders. Thus, two experiments were conducted in a greenhouse at the Department of Agricultural Engineering of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, to evaluate the effects of salinity on the mineral nutrition of crisphead lettuce, cultivar Taina, in a hydroponic system (Nutrient Film Technique), using brackish water in the nutrient solution, which was prepared by adding NaCl to the local water (0. 2 dS m- 1). A randomized blocks experimental design was used in both experiments. The treatments consisted of water of different salinity levels (0. 2, 1. 2, 2. 2, 3. 2, 4. 2 and 5. 2 dS m- 1) with four replications, totaling 24 plots for each experiment. The water added {{to compensate for the}} water-depth loss due to evapotranspiration (WCET) was the brackish water of each treatment in Experiment I and the local water without modifications in Experiment II. The increase in the salinity of the water used for the <b>nutrient</b> solution <b>preparation</b> reduced the foliar phosphorus and potassium contents and increased the chloride and sodium contents, regardless of the WCET.

40|$|Background: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) {{contributes}} to satiety and plays {{a pivotal role}} in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Similar to GLP- 1, peptide YY (PYY) and cholecystokinin also influence food intake. The secretion of these hormones by enteroendocrine cells along the intestine is modulated by <b>nutrients.</b> <b>Preparations</b> from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, including rebaudioside A, are increasingly being used as noncaloric sweeteners. Objective: We investigated the effects of rebaudioside A on enteroendocrine cells by assessing both cell numbers as well as their secretory capacity in an organoid model. Methods: A 2 -dimensional organoid model derived from duodenal, jejunal, and ileal crypts of a C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse was developed and characterized with the use of gene expression and immunofluorescence. We stimulated these organoids with 10 mmol/L rebaudioside A for 1 h and measured their GLP- 1, PYY, and cholecystokinin release. We also analyzed the effects of rebaudioside A on gene expression in enteroendocrine cells after an 18 -h incubation. Results: The 2 -dimensional organoids contained crypt cells and differentiated villus cells, including enterocytes and goblet and enteroendocrine cells. These enteroendocrine cells stained positive for GLP- 1, PYY, and serotonin. The cultured 2 -dimensional organoids maintained their location-specific gene expression patterns. Compared with the control, rebaudioside A induced GLP- 1 secretion 1. 7 -fold in the duodenum (P < 0. 01), 2. 2 -fold in the jejunum (P < 0. 01), and 4. 3 -fold in the ileum (P < 0. 001). PYY release was increased by rebaudioside A 3 -fold in the ileumcompared with the control (P < 0. 05). Long-term (18 -h) stimulation with the sweetener induced the expression of the enteroendocrine-specific markers chromogranin A, glucagon, Pyy, and cholecystokinin 3. 5 - (P < 0. 001), 3. 5 - (P < 0. 001), 3. 8 - (P < 0. 05), and 6. 5 -fold (P < 0. 001), respectively. Conclusions: These results show novel ex vivo effects of rebaudioside A on enteroendocrine cells of the mouse small intestine and highlight potentially new applications for rebaudioside A in metabolic diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Low {{nitrogen}} Chardonnay {{juice from}} an Oregon winery was fermented {{with a series}} of nutrient supplements, including diammonium phosphate (DAP), Fermaid K, Superfood, yeast extract, yeast hulls and thiamine. These treatments were evaluated for their contribution to the yeast assimilable nitrogen content (YANC) of the juice, which consists of the ammonium ion and α-amino acid content by NOPA (nitrogen by ophthaldialdehyde). The fermentation characteristics and the nutritional and chemical status of the finished wines were compared. Diammonium phosphate added 25 mg N/L from ammonia for every pound/ 1000 gallons (12. 5 g/hL) used. Commercial yeast <b>nutrient</b> <b>preparations</b> were found to contribute around 10 mg N/L from ammonium ion per pound/ 1000 gallons (12. 5 g/hL). NOPA and HPLC analysis of Superfood and Fermaid K indicated that they contributed only a small amount of amino acids. NOPA analysis of PL- 50 yeast extract indicated that it may have added some nitrogen from amino acids. Nitrogenous compounds were taken up within {{the first few days of}} fermentation. Ammonium ion was depleted very quickly and did not reappear later in fermentation. Alpha-amino acids reached a low within approximately ten days of fermentation, then leveled out or increased towards the end of fermentation. Treatments containing high amounts of ammonia were observed to produce the most vigorous fermentations. These treatments were found to have the highest apparent levels of amino acids at the end of fermentation. The Control treatment, which had the lowest YANC content, appeared to utilize proline during fermentation. Sensory analysis was not conducted on the finished wines due to replication differences in reduced sulfur aroma found in preliminary screening. GC-MS analysis showed that the higher nitrogen treatments had levels of reduced sulfide compounds that were above sensory threshold, whereas moderate nitrogen treatments did not. Ethyl carbamate was not found in any of the finished wines. These data suggest that moderate levels of supplementation had a positive effect on both fermentation and finished wine quality. Higher levels of nutrient addition were effective at increasing fermentation rates but negatively affected the sulfide profile of finished wines...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{show that}} in {{anaerobic}} fermentation with limiting lipid <b>nutrients,</b> cell <b>preparation</b> impacts the viability assessment of yeast cells, and to identify the factors involved. Methods and Results: Saccharomyces cerevisiae viability was determined using propidium iodide staining and the flow cytometry. Analyses identified intact cells, dead cells and, under certain conditions, {{the presence of a}} third subpopulation of apparently damaged cells. This intermediate population could account for up to 40 % of the entire cell population. We describe, analyse and discuss the effects of different solutions for cell resuspension on the respective proportion of these three populations, in particular that of the intermediate population. We show that this intermediate cell population forms in the absence of Ca 2 +/Mg 2 +. Conclusions: Cell preparation significantly impacts population viability assessment by FCM. The intermediate population, revealed under certain conditions, could be renamed as 'fragile cells'. For these cells, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + reduce cell membrane permeability to PI. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study that analyses and discusses the factors influencing the formation of an intermediate population when studying viability in yeast alcoholic fermentation.

Storing sweet detar at temperatures around 4 degrees Celsius will preserve its quality by limiting the loss of vitamin C. As the fruit goes bad, the coating will change to a brown-yellow colour. A sieve is useful for separating debris and the seed from the pulp of the fruit and {{a mortar and pestle}} work well for pureeing the pulp. Though some Detarium senegalense trees produce toxic fruits, these are often identifiable by the presence of fruits remaining under the trees. If left behind, the trees are likely toxic as animals are normally very quick to take the fruits. Propagation time can be decreased by grafting. For the Detarium senegalense tree, the apical graft is the most effective when employed {{at the end of the}} dry season. It is also important to work toward increasing the local dependency and appreciation of wild fruits when creating interventions as there are some traditional negative stigmas and beliefs concerning the consumption of wild fruits. Conflicts around ownership may arise if trees remain undomesticated. A potential solution is the adoption of salvation forestry, where local people produce local products in a manner that guarantees them a share in the yields.|$|R

The ORS-positive control group rats were recovered on the 6 th day, while diarrheal symptoms still appeared on the negative control rats (subjected with basal diet only; without ORS) with 16 % death rate. Minerals, especially sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus, were the most significant biochemical parameters for following recovery from diarrhea. The normal levels of these minerals were recovered in the blood serum {{at the end of}} experiment in rats administrated with the fermented products (FSM, FM and CY). Some renal functional parameters were suggested to follow diarrhea, but all studied liver functional parameters were not significantly recommended. </span...|$|R
40|$|In {{a time of}} adolescence, {{consuming}} {{vitamins and}} minerals (elements), water, and roughage is very important. Vegetables {{should be on the}} menu every day in a week. In a time of adolescence, consumption of vegetables is below recommendations. It is recommended to consume 400 to 650 g of vegetables. It depends on numerous factors whether youth and children eat healthy food or not. Such factors are culture, social environment (family, friends, classmates, school), exposure (accessibility, inaccessibility), social-economic condition, emotions, self-efficiency, sensory characteristics (form, color, smell, taste, texture), knowledge (<b>nutrients,</b> health effect), <b>preparation</b> (method of preparation – cooking, roasting, frying, mashing; form of vegetables – strips, cubes) and serving the vegetables (color, layout). The purpose of the thesis was to research and to compare the relationship of pupils of the fifth and the ninth grades of the elementary school to consuming vegetables. Forty-six pupils of the fifth grade and sixty-six pupils of the ninth grade were included in the research, altogether 112. The technique of data collection was anonymous survey questionnaire. The results show that there are no bigger differences in relationship towards vegetables between the pupils of the fifth and the ninth grades. The answers were quite similar. The participants are deterred by sensory characteristics of vegetables, while their families encourage them to consume vegetables: most of them consume it every day. The school is encouraging them as well. The pupils of the both grades prefer cooked or raw vegetables. They would consume more vegetables if they prepared it by themselves. They realize the important effect of vegetables for health. They know nutrients contained by vegetables. However, they wish no more vegetables in meals in school. ...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis is {{the most}} common joint disease and an {{important}} cause of physical disability. Clinical symptoms are frequently associated with a significant functional impairment and signs and symptoms of inflammation, including pain, stiffness and loss of mobility. In osteoarthritis the balance between cartilage synthesis and degradation is disturbed {{as a result of an}} altered mainly autocrine exposure of the chondrocytes to various cytokines and growth factors. RA is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic autoimmune disease. The cartilage and bone destruction in RA are directly linked to the exacerbation of inflammatory processes in the synovial membrane. The prevalence rates of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increasing proportion of the elderly in the population. Up to 50 % of the patients suffering from osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis report the use of alternative remedies including natural products. These so-called nutraceuticals cover a broad range of products including <b>nutrients,</b> herbal <b>preparations</b> and dietary supplements. The way of action of a number of possible cartilage-protective and/or anti-inflammatory natural products is studied in vitro and in different in vivo mouse models A Grifola frondosa (Maitake) extract and a Centella asiatica fraction have been evaluated. Both, the Grifola frondosa extract and the Centella asiatica triterpenes fraction were able to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis and inhibit proteoglycan degradation by bovine chondrocytes. In vivo studies demonstrated that the tested Centella asiatica fraction was able to inhibit the zymosan-induced cartilage degradation, although the zymosan-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and joint swelling were not affected. These results picture a cartilage protective effect. The herbal mixture SKI 306 X is on the market in Australia and Korea as a remedy for OA patients. The inhibitory effect of SKI 306 X and its individual herbal extracts on IL- 1 beta-induced proteoglycan degradation and nitric oxide and PGE 2 production by bovine cartilage explants indicate a cartilage protective effect. Moreover, SKI 306 X also inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF-alpha, IL- 1 beta and PGE 2 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, demonstrating an anti-inflammatory and possibly an analgesic capacity. Apocynin can be isolated from the Himalayan herb Picrorhiza kurrooa. It was found that orally ingested apocynin partially counteracts the zymosan-induced inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis in the mouse knee joint. Moreover, apocynin is able to induce a cyclooxygenase inhibitory effect in mice, similar ibuprofen. The simple amino acid glycine and the milk protein lactoferrin have been indicated to contain anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities. Both glycine and bovine lactoferrin are able to decrease ear swelling in a zymosan-induced ear-skin inflammation model. A combination of bovine lactoferrin and glycine counteracted the zymosan-induced ear swelling synergistically. The combination of glycine and bovine lactoferrin was tested in the collagen-induced arthritis mice model. Intervention with glycine and bovine lactoferrin results in a decrease in TNF-alpha and IL- 6 cytokine serum levels and more importantly inhibition of arthritis development. The studied nutraceuticals are interesting candidates for the development of cartilage protective or anti-inflammatory agents for treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Under {{nutrition}} {{remains the}} world’s most serious health problem which contributes to high child morbidity and mortality. About one third (24. 1 %) {{of the school}} children in the developing countries are underweight, wasted or stunted. The school age period is nutritionally significant phase {{because this is the}} prime time to build up body stores of <b>nutrients</b> in <b>preparation</b> for rapid physical growth and mental development of children. Prolonged under nutrition in this age group impairs their growth also increases children’s susceptibility to disease. Despite continued prevention efforts, child under nutrition remains a major problem in Tanzania, this is even worse in rural areas such as Kiteto district where there is no nutritional database among school children aged 11 - 14 years. Therefore, this study was carried out to establish nutritional status and its associated factors among school children in rural areas. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study of 425 school children aged 11 - 14 years which was selected by multistage simple random sampling method from primary schools was carried out. Their nutritional status was determined using anthropometric indicators BMI-for-Age (Wasting) and Height-for-Age (stunting). Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 20) and WHO AnthroPlus 2006 software package. The socioeconomic, demographic and individual variables were analyzed to determine their association with under-nutrition among school children. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine how independent variables influence dependent variable. Results: A total of 425 school children aged 11 - 14 years were recruited, mean age was = 13 years, SD = 1. 00. About 95 (22. 3 %) were found to be wasted and 137 (32. 2 %) were stunted. Bivariate results, revealed factors which were found to be significantly associated with wasting which included high mother’s education level (secondary and higher education OR= 14. 561, p= 0. 035, OR= 0. 064, p= 0. 041), food diversification (OR= 2. 329, p= 0. 041) and hand washing practices (OR= 0. 336, p= 0. 011). Factors which were found to be significantly associated with stunting on the other hand were age (11 years OR= 0. 402, p= 0. 023 and 12 years with OR= 0. 490, p= 0. 030), sex (OR= 0. 613, p= 0. 032), food diversification (OR= 1. 780, p= 0. 020) and walking distance (OR= 4. 049 E 8 p= 0. 000 and OR= 3. 530 E 8, p= 0. 000). In multivariate analysis, factors remained significantly associated with wasting is mother’s level of education (Primary education, AOR= 12. 877, p= 0. 040 and secondary education and higher AOR= 16. 225, p= 0. 032). On other hand, number of food groups consumed (AOR= 1. 780, p= 0. 020), age (11 years, AOR= 0. 403, p= 0. 024, 12 years, AOR= 0. 485, p= 0. 029) and sex (AOR= 0. 616, p= 0. 034) were found to be statistically significantly associated with stunting among school children aged 11 - 14 years in the district. Conclusion: Nutritional status of school children age children (11 - 14 years) in Kiteto district is not satisfactory. High proportion of school age children are either wasted or stunted due to underlying factors like mother’s education, food diversification, age and sex. Therefore interventions targeting school children should aim at increasing awareness among parents (especially mothers) and school children regarding recommended nutritional intake requirements especially in rural communities where they mostly prepare food traditionally. Additionally, awareness should be created among policy makers to include nutrition interventions in different programs...|$|R
