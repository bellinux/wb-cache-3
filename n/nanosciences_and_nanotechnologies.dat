40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] jumptype=rssInternational audienceThis literature review {{provides an overview of}} recent studies on the introduction of <b>nanosciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnologies</b> in secondary education. Four salient research topics have emerged: questions and reflections preceding curriculum development on <b>nanosciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnologies</b> lessons; research on students' conceptualisations of nano-related concepts; the use of haptic tools to teach nanosciences and nanotechnologies; and professional development for secondary schools teachers. In a final critical discussion, the lack of studies in the literature considering <b>nanosciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnologies</b> as a socioscientific issue in secondary education is emphasised. In addition, implications for future research as well as suggestions for <b>nanosciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnologies</b> curriculum development are considered...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nanotechnology</b> {{research}} although {{growing at}} very fast rate, its disciplinary identity remains ‘ill-defined’. It is {{often viewed as}} multidisciplinary; and/or interdisciplinary science or even as a unique discipline on its own way. As a consequence, whether this growing research area requires researchers that have studied specialised undergraduate or postgraduate <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> programmes; or traditional science and engineering disciplines is still less understood. The examination of postgraduate researchers’ experiences of <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> research can provide a way of understanding <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> research <b>and</b> the associated forms of disciplinarity, which in turn can address what the type of graduates are required to work in this area. In this paper, we review the different forms of disciplinarity associated with <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> research <b>and</b> demonstrate that disciplinary identity of <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> research is not yet clear. This study encouraged us to design a qualitative research framework to collect and examine postgraduate researchers’ experiences of <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> research for understanding what <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> research is <b>and</b> thus operationalize disciplinarity associated with it.

BACKGROUND Nanotechnologies are enabling technologies manipulating matter at the atomic scale and exploiting new properties and functionalities for new applications that may bring benefits to the whole society. Industry is increasingly using nanotechnology in sectors such as healthcare (targeted drug delivery, regenerative medicine, diagnostics), electronics, cosmetics, textiles, food, information technology, seed production, pesticides, and the environmental protection. The EU Strategy and the Action Plan for Nanotechnology define the EU approach and actions in <b>nanosciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnologies</b> and 3. 5 billion euros in the 7 th Framework Programme for Research and Technological development in 2007 - 2013 is allocated in these fields.

40|$|<b>Nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> are {{research}} {{areas of}} a multidisciplinary nature. Having a good {{knowledge of the}} rapidly evolving nature of these research areas {{is important to understand}} the research paths, as well as national and global developments in these areas. Accordingly, in this reported study <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> research undertaken globally was compared with that of Australia by way of analyzing research publications. Initially, four different bibliometric Boolean-based search methodologies were used to analyze publications in the Web of Science database (Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Knowledge). These methodologies were (a) lexical query, (b) search in <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> journals, (c) combination of lexical query and journal search and (d) search in the ten nano-journals with the highest impact factors. Based on results obtained, the third methodology was found to be the most comprehensive approach. Consequently, this search methodology was used to compare global <b>and</b> Australian <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> publications for the period 1988 - 2000. Results demonstrated that depending on the search technique used, Australia ranks fourteenth to seventeenth internationally with a higher than world average number of <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> publications. Over the last decade, Australia showed a relative growth rate in <b>nanoscience</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> publications of 16 % compared to 12 % {{for the rest of the}} world.

The main result is that the concentration ratio of the production of nanotechnology research across different macro subject areas has been reducing over time and space, because knowledge dynamics of nanotechnology research has been spreading among new research fields and different industries. In addition, South Korea and China show higher performance than other countries in nanotechnology scientific products per million people.

40|$|<b>Nanosciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>nanotechnologies</b> are {{developing}} at an incredibly rapid pace, promising a true revolution {{in a wide}} variety of fields where the capability to manipulate matter at the atomic or (supra) molecular scale is essential. This includes information processing systems, medical diagnoses and treatments, energy production and sustainable development, as well as a number of more futurist ideas that, as yet, remain pure fiction. These developments have begun to generate controversies and fears in the scientific community itself and the larger public. This article critically reviews the potential problems of an uncontrolled 'nanoworld' (grey goo, toxicity of nanoparticles, RFIDs, privacy, etc.) and the associated fears, as they appear in the literature.

40|$|Nanotechnology is {{developing}} {{at a rapid}} pace. Concerns have been raised about the risks nanotechnology may carry for {{human health and the}} environment. The precautionary principle has developed within environmental ethics as a way {{to reduce the risk of}} harm with emerging technologies.

The central features of the precautionary principle are reviewed here. These include addressing situations of scientific uncertainty and serious or irreversible harm, developing a proportionate response, and having reasonable grounds for concern. These factors will be applied to carbon nanotubes to demonstrate how the precautionary principle can lead to practical guidelines during the development of nanotechnology...|$|E

We report in this paper the first synthesis of hybrid single-walled imogolite nanotubes (OH) 3 Al 2 O 3 SixGe 1 ?xCH 3 with diameter-controlled hydrophobic nanopores varying from 1. 8 to 2. 4 nm. Methylation and nanotube dimensions are studied by combining infrared spectroscopy, cryo-TEM observations, and X-ray scattering measurements. We show that, in solution, the water density inside methylated nanotubes is decreased {{by a factor of}} 3 compared to the bulk value. Spontaneous confinement of bromopropanol molecules inside the nanotubes, when added to the solution, is demonstrated. These newly synthesized nanotubes may open up possibilities for water filtration or water decontamination...|$|E

Three broad notions of responsible nanoresearch are presented. The article concludes by arguing that while the suggestion put forward in the EC-CoC brings the concept of responsible nanoresearch a long way, one crucial element is to be wanted, namely responsible nanoresearch as increased awareness of moral choices...|$|E
