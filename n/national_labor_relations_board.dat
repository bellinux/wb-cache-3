The NFL players wanted Ed Meador—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted Jack Kemp. The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference. The AFL players agreed to Mackey's election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to.

5|$|In {{response}} to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts.

5|$|In early 1990, the drivers' {{contract}} from 1987 expired {{at the end}} of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began its strike against Greyhound. The 1990 drivers' strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a Greyhound bus driven by a strikebreaker, and a shot was fired at a Greyhound bus. During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, Greyhound idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, Greyhound was having to contend with the rise of low-cost airlines like Southwest Airlines, which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike's lower revenues and higher costs for security and labor-law penalties caused Greyhound to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike would not be settled for 38 months under terms favorable to Greyhound. While the <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Board</b> (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1938, {{when there}} was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor {{practices}} by the studios against directors, Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios, alongside Darryl Zanuck and E.

In 1939, Briskin was once again involved in potential legal proceedings, being {{one of a number of}} producers who were called to testify before the <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Board,</b> regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild (SWG). During the hearings, it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild. After the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia at the beginning of World War II, AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee, which was a sub-committee of the organization's Research Council. Headed by the council's chairman, Darryl F. Zanuck, Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee. The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production. In mid-November 1940 Briskin, along with the committee's chair Major Nathan Levinson, participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild, in order to select writers to go to Monmouth, New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} theorists such as Claus Offe, Theda Skocpol, and Fred Block {{have contributed to}} the {{development}} of a new understanding of the functioning of the modern capitalist state. This developing perspective offers new insight into the limits and possibilities of political change in the United States. ^ Drawing on this work and the growing literature on the theory of the state, this study presents a model of the political process in modern capitalist democracies. The model posits three structural modes of domination (ideological, political, and economic) which provide the setting and, normally, the limits for political activity. Within these structural modes, the most important political activity centers on the struggles between capitalists, the working class, and the state itself. These struggles are the engine of the attempted and sometimes successful rationalizations of the state which occur largely within the boundaries of the structural modes. ^ This model is then applied to the enactment of the <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Relations</b> Act (NLRA) in 1935 as an example and a test. The NLRA was chosen because it was a prerequisite to the growth of Big Labor and, ultimately, to the development of the alliance of labor and the Democratic Party which is a key feature of the Fifth or New Deal Party System. Despite the NLRA 2 ̆ 7 s admitted importance, its enactment has been studied very little. The parameters of its passage are clear: Roosevelt and the executive branch were basically neutral; the press was generally hostile; business support was non-existent while opposition was vociferous; labor support was strong but labor 2 ̆ 7 s strength was questionable; and Congress passed the bill overwhelmingly but with little enthusiasm. ^ This easy passage in the face of so little support can only be understood in the context of the effects of the Great Depression on the structural modes of domination. After six years, new openings had developed in the structural modes through which Senator Robert F. Wagner and a small band of allies steered the bill to enactment. Composed primarily of academics and past and present personnel of the tiny and weak <b>national</b> <b>labor</b> <b>relations</b> <b>boards,</b> Wagner 2 ̆ 7 s circle advocated a detailed labor policy based on the experiences of the <b>national</b> <b>labor</b> boards in 1933 and 1934. ^ By helping to trigger the growth of organized labor and its alliance with the Democratic Party, the new labor policy aided in the development of the political support necessary for its own survival. Moreover, the NLRA was a crucial step in the developments that led to modifications of the ideological and political structural modes of domination. Though the modifications were limited and the institutionalization of the NLRA itself was shaped by those limitations, those modifications stand as the most significant changes in the American state in recent history. ^ The enactment of the NLRA is not presented as typical but rather as an important instance which any theory of the state or of the political process must be able to explain. The model applied to the Wagner Act in this study provides some explanation of the ways in which the act represented the limits and possibilities of political change in the United States. The study indicates that the general approach represented by the model could be applied to a wider variety of events and policies in recent American history. ...|$|R

40|$|For years, {{scholars}} {{have criticized the}} <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Board’s</b> (NLRB’s or Board’s) reliance on adjudication rather than rulemaking. The use of adjudication rather than rulemaking is problematic for the NLRB because of continued “policy oscillation”—frequent changes in agency policy between presidential appointments—in Board adjudications, which “sows disrespect for the agency. ” Additionally, the NLRB’s sole use of adjudication precludes public participation, encourages fact‑specific policymaking, and fosters the problem of agency nonacquiescence. Scholars argue that by rulemaking, the NLRB could ameliorate the appearance of political bias, articulate clear precedents, and encourage public participation in policymaking. Despite the promise of clearer precedents and a more politically neutral appearance, the NLRB has largely refrained from notice‑and‑comment rulemaking. The NLRB claims that rulemaking procedures are too rigid for union policymaking, which must be quick to respond to specific fact patterns. This raises ossification of rulemaking issues, including problems posed by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Congressional Review Acts (CRA), {{and the threat of}} judicial review. The threat of congressional intervention also influences the NLRB 2 ̆ 7 s decision to refrain from rulemaking. There has been renewed scholarship criticizing the NLRB’s avoidance of rulemaking and suggesting that the current Board is in a good position to begin rulemaking. Heeding scholars’ pleas, on December 22, 2010, the NLRB issued its first notice of proposed rulemaking since its only recent successful rule in 1989 defining bargaining units in healthcare facilities. In light of this renewed discussion about the benefits of rulemaking in the inherently political unionization context, this Comment will examine the recent and controversial representation election procedure rulemaking by the National Mediation Board (NMB) —the federal agency charged with overseeing <b>labor</b> <b>relations</b> in the railway and airline industries—as a point of comparison for the NLRB. Both agencies are bipartisan, independent, and facing the challenge of regulating in a highly political industry. In November 2009, the NMB proposed a change in the way it counts union election ballots. For seventy‑five years, the NMB’s election procedure required that a majority of all eligible voters in the voting class cast valid ballots in favor of representation to certify the union. Under the new rule, the NMB counts a majority of the valid ballots actually cast to determine if the class has elected a representative, a process which conforms to NLRB voting procedures. The NMB engaged in notice‑and‑comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), invited written submissions, and even held a public hearing on the issue before adopting the final rule on May 11, 2010. Controversy surrounded the rule change—the agency received almost 25, 000 comments during its sixty‑day comment period and heard thirty‑one witnesses at the open hearing. Those who opposed the rule argued that the NMB rushed through the notice‑and‑comment process just before Delta, whose employees were traditionally anti-union, merged with Northwest, a traditionally pro‑union organization. Additionally, NMB Chairman Elizabeth Dougherty dissented from both the proposed and final rules, complaining that as the minority Republican member of the NMB she was given insufficient time to review the rule before its publication. Ultimately, the NMB successfully defended itself in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia against arguments that it lacked statutory support to alter election procedures, that the majority prejudged the issues involved, and that it lacked factual support to justify the policy change. Although the Air Transport Association (ATA) has appealed the decision, the rule has also withstood a Senate joint resolution vote to return to the old election procedures. Given the similarities between the NMB and the NLRB, the NMB’s successful rulemaking attempt demonstrates that the NLRB has the wherewithal to engage in notice‑and‑comment rulemaking, and it should look to the NMB’s procedures as a guideline for conducting rulemaking in the future. This Comment analyzes the predictive and instructive value of the NMB’s representation election procedure rulemaking for the NLRB...|$|R

One of the most important sections of the NLRA is section 7 which gives employees rights to organize labor unions without the fear of retaliation from their employer.
