500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> <b>I</b> Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{was given}} his own {{laboratory}} called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped {{to obtain a}} British work visa. His pay eventually rose to £6,000 per year, and an American patent attorney, Alfred Crotti, moved to England to assist Mardas. In a historical TV promo for Apple Corps included on the Beatles Anthology DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, [...] "Hello, I'm Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I {{would like to say}} 'Hello' to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics." [...] Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope, and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes. A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: [...] "I'm a rock gardener, and now I'm doing electronics. Maybe <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant".|$|E
2500|$|As the [...] "package" [...] grew, {{testing it}} became {{increasingly}} difficult and engineers were commenting {{as early as}} 1995 that Apple's announced 1996 release date was hopelessly optimistic: [...] "There's no way in hell Copland ships <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> <b>I</b> just hope it ships in 1997." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 28, 2015, the Dodgers announced—via {{a series}} of cue cards {{presented}} by comedian Jimmy Kimmel on the Dodger Stadium video board—that Scully would be back for the 2016 season, his 67th with the Dodgers. At a press conference August 29, Scully said 2016 would probably be his final year. [...] "I mean, how much longer can you go on fooling people?

2500|$|In their post-season reviews, The Michigan Daily gave Coven a B+, saying, [...] "And {{while its}} conclusion, {{appropriately}} titled [...] "The Seven Wonders", never quite matched the high standard it set for itself throughout the season, Covens reputation will nonetheless remain a solid one." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave the season a B rating and said, [...] "I can't deny my experience: Week to week, {{the excesses of}} Coven were wickedly amusing. <b>Next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> hope American Horror Story can be more than that, and with less." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I wrote a line home, mother, as you {{too well}} know, to say I had 'listed under another name, and I went abroad. Abroad, {{at one time}} I thought I would write home <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> when <b>I</b> might be better off; and when that <b>year</b> was out, <b>I</b> thought I would write home <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> when <b>I</b> might be better off; and when that year was out again, perhaps I didn't think much about it. So on, from year to year, through a service of ten <b>years,</b> till <b>I</b> began to get older, and to ask myself why should I ever write." ...|$|R

2500|$|Deneuve {{appeared}} nude in two Playboy pictorials in 1963 and 1965. Her {{image was}} used to represent Marianne, the national symbol of France, from 1985 to 1989. As the face of Chanel No. 5 in the late 1970s, she caused sales of the perfume to soar in the United Statesso {{much so that the}} American press, captivated by her charm, nominated her as the world's most elegant woman. In 1983, American Home Products retained her to represent their cosmetics line and hired world-renowned photographer Richard Avedon to promote its line of Youth Garde cosmetics, for which she famously proclaimed, [...] "Look closely. <b>Next</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> will be 40." ...|$|E
2500|$|A tribute of 3,000 gold pieces {{each year}} must have proven {{too much for}} the {{revenues}} of the Empire, because either John or David approached their relative by marriage Uzun Hasan about transferring the allegiance of Trebizond from the Ottomans to him. Uzun Hasan agreed to this, and sent envoys to Mehmed II. However, these envoys not only asked for the tribute to be transferred to the Aq Qoyunlu, they demanded on behalf of their master that Mehmed resume payment of tribute Mehmed's grandfather was said to have sent to the Aq Qoyunlu. The sources disagree on exactly how Mehmed II answered, but both versions were ominous. In one version, he told the envoys [...] "that it would not be long before they learned what they ought to expect from him." [...] In the other, Mehmed's response was, [...] "Go in peace, and <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> will bring these things with me, and I will clear up the debt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 22 November {{visit to}} the coastal city of Cartagena, US President George W.

Since the year 2000, when we began Plan Colombia, the United States has provided more than $3 billion in vital aid. We'll continue providing aid. We've helped Colombia to strengthen its democracy, to combat drug production, to create a more transparent and effective judicial system, to increase the size and professionalism of its military and police forces, to protect human rights, and to reduce corruption. Mr. President, you and your government have not let us down. Plan Colombia enjoys wide bipartisan support in my country, and <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> will ask our Congress to renew its support so that this courageous nation can win its war against narco-terrorists." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Wireless mesh {{networks}} {{have the potential}} to provide ubiquitous high-speed Internet at low costs. The good news is that initial deployments of WiFi meshes show the feasibility of providing ubiquitous Internet access. However, their performance is far below the necessary and achievable limit. Moreover, users subscription in the existing meshes is dismal even though the technical challenges to get connectivity are low. This paper provides an overview of the current status of mesh network deployment and highlights the technical, economical and social challenges {{that need to be addressed}} in the <b>next</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Presidents {{have also}} {{discussed}} {{the role of}} endowment, correlating a high ranking on the survey with institutional wealth. President of Muhlenberg College, Peyton Helm, argued that [...] "most of the other factors weighted by U.S. News in their rankings (in a secret formula they will not reveal, that is changed every year, and that independent researchers {{have been unable to}} replicate) are based, ultimately, on institutional wealth [...] A trustee once asked me what it would take for Muhlenberg to be ranked in the top five by U.S. News. My answer was simple: A check for $800 million placed directly in the endowment would do it -- even if we never changed another thing we were doing." [...] Helms also noted that, [...] "what you won't read in U.S. News {{is that most of the}} data they use is public information, readily available on the Web sites of most colleges and universities, as well as on the U.S. Department of Education Web site. There is no single formula for weighting these factors -- they will have different significance for different students and families. So, <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> and many other leaders of our nation's best colleges and universities will be working on a new and better Web-based tool for families engaged in the college search." [...] Millsaps College president, Frances Lucas, further noted that, [...] "she previously had paid little attention to the rankings debate because her own institution was rated highly in U.S. News. But after learning more about the magazine's methodology and discussing the issue with colleagues at this week's meeting, she concluded that the rankings were based too heavily on measurements determined by institutional wealth." ...|$|E
