In {{the same way that the}} <b>negative</b> <b>pole</b> receives the current from the positive pole, the poet receives impulses from a world that is full of mystery and doubt, which cannot be explained but which the poet can translate into art.|$|E

25|$|If {{the circuit}} is {{operated}} asymmetrically (as a simple supply voltage {{with just one}} positive pole), both {{the positive and negative}} poles (or the isolated reference potential) are pulsating opposite the center (or the ground) of the input voltage analogously to the positive and negative waveforms of the phase voltages. However, the differences in the phase voltages result in the six-pulse DC voltage (over the duration of a period). The strict separation of the transformer center from the <b>negative</b> <b>pole</b> (otherwise short-circuit currents will flow) or a possible grounding of the <b>negative</b> <b>pole</b> when powered by an isolating transformer apply correspondingly to the symmetrical operation.|$|E

25|$|Arguments favoring {{discrimination}} against women are explicit in the handbook. Those arguments are not novel but constitute a selection from the long tradition of Western misogynist writings. However, according to Brauner, they are combined to produce new meanings and result in a comprehensive theory. It mixes elements borrowed from Formicarius (1435), Preceptorium divinae legis (1475) and Lectiones super ecclesiastes (1380).Kramer and Sprenger develop a powerful gender-specific theory of witchcraft based on a hierarchical and dualistic view of the world. Everything exists in pairs of opposites: God and Satan, Mary and Eve, and men (or virgins) and women. Each positive principle in a pair is delineated by its <b>negative</b> <b>pole.</b> Perfection is defined not as the integration or preservation of opposites, but rather as the extermination of the negative element in a polar pair. Because women are the negative counterpart to men, they corrupt male perfection through witchcraft and must be destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|What {{makes this}} {{magnesium}} blockade of the NMDAR channel particularly significant {{in terms of}} LTP induction is that the block is membrane voltage-dependent. [...] The basis of this voltage dependence is relatively straightforward. [...] The NMDAR channel is a transmembrane protein; that is, it spans the cell membrane. As such, it also spans the electric field generated by the membrane potential. [...] The magnesium binding site within the NMDAR channel is physically located within this electric field. [...] Magnesium ions carrying a double positive charge can be acted upon by the field. [...] When the cell is hyperpolarized, magnesium is stabilized inside the channel (i.e. the two positive charges on the magnesium ion are attracted toward the <b>negative</b> <b>pole</b> of the electric field, which points toward {{the inside of the}} cell). [...] As a cell is depolarized, the field effect on the magnesium ion weakens, and the dwell time of magnesium ions within the channel decreases. [...] Thus, the kinetics of the binding reaction between magnesium and the NMDAR channel are such that magnesium periodically unbinds and leaves the channel, only to be replaced by another magnesium ion. [...] During the (very brief) time that the magnesium is absent from the open channel, other ions (such as sodium and calcium) can flow through the channel. [...] However, when the cell is more hyperpolarized, the bound state of magnesium is stabilized and it leaves the channel less often and for a shorter period of time (on average). [...] When the cell is less hyperpolarized, the magnesium leaves the channel more often and stays away for longer (on average). [...] Hence, the magnesium blockade of the open NMDAR channel is membrane voltage-dependent.|$|E
