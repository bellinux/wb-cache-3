In Europe, it was developed {{in response to the}} difficulty to obtain a criminal conviction. According to different legal disciplines and purposes, the constructions of NCBC can be classified into three models: the criminal law model, the civil law model and the police law model. The policy-oriented approach applied in an appropriate manner will not lead to breaches of ECHR rights, which apply in cases considered “criminal” according to the Engel criteria. In the context of the multilevel human rights system in Europe, it is different among different legal regimes in terms of whether and how NCBC measures are limited by non-criminal human rights. At present, at the EU level, the Parliament advocates the establishment of NCBC and its extended use in the Member States. At national levels, it makes sense to create a non-criminal model for confiscations in criminal justice system designed to re-establish the status quo ante, which takes the form of an in rem procedure against property, similar to the common law model...|$|E

During the last four decades, significant efforts have been made, both on the international and national levels, to develop fair and efficient rules enabling the authorities to forfeit assets derived from crime. However, the vast majority of legal systems throughout Europe have not succeeded in upholding this important aspect of the rule of law. The European Commission held in 2012 that “confiscation of criminal assets remains underdeveloped and underutilized” in the EU Member States, and that “there is a significant underutilisation of asset confiscation laws throughout the EU. ” The main reason why confiscation legislation has proven inefficient lies in the many difficulties in reaching a criminal conviction of the offender. In order to remedy this situation, new strategies are emerging. One of the most radical but at the same time efficient legal tools that has been developed to overcome the “criminal conviction problem” is the introduction of rules enabling confiscation without a former criminal conviction: <b>Non-Conviction-Based</b> <b>Confiscation</b> (NCBC). The purpose of this book is to get the reader acquainted with different NCBC legislation models, to analyze the diverse structural issues and human rights issues that NCBC legislation raises in a European context, and to discuss and carve out some guidelines for legislating NCBC. This book is essential reading for policy makers, practitioners, and academics throughout Europe who believe that crime should not pay...|$|E
