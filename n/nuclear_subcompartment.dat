40|$|Enucleation, a rare {{feature of}} {{mammalian}} differentiation, occurs in 3 cell types: erythroblasts, lens epithelium, and keratinocytes. Previous investigations suggest that caspase activation functions in lens epithelial and keratinocyte enucleation, {{as well as}} in early erythropoiesis encompassing erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) differentiation to proerythroblast. To determine whether caspase activation contributes to later erythropoiesis and whether nuclear substructures other than chromatin reorganize, we analyzed distributions of <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartment</b> proteins and assayed for caspase-induced cleavage of subcompartmental target proteins in mouse erythroblasts. We found that patterns of lamin B in the filamentous network interacting with both the nuclear envelope and DNA, nuclear matrix protein NuMA (Nuclear mitotic apparatus), and splicing factors Sm and SC 35 persisted during nuclear condensation, consistent with effective transcription of genes expressed late in differentiation. Thus, nuclear reorganization prior to enucleation is selective, allowing maintenance of critical transcriptional processes independent of extensive chromosomal reorganization. Consistent with these data, we found no evidence for caspase-induced cleavage of major <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartment</b> proteins during late erythropoiesis, in contrast to what has been observed in early erythropoiesis and in lens epithelial and keratinocyte differentiation. These findings imply that nuclear condensation and extrusion during terminal erythroid differentiation involve novel mechanisms that do not entail major activation of apoptotic machinery.

The nucleus and nuclear processes are organized into functionally and morphologically separated <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartments.</b> This thesis is particularly concerned with the three following nuclear subcompartments: sites of DNA replication, Polycomb bodies and nuclear inclusions constituted of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH 2).

Using immunofluorescent labeling of cells extracted prior fixation and applying cross-correlation function analysis, we showed that MCM proteins are present at the sites of active DNA synthesis. Our results contributed to the solving of the first part of so-called MCM paradox. Second, we studied the structural basis of the Polycomb bodies.

Genes and their respective chromosome territories were simultaneously visualized in three-dimensionally preserved nuclei applying dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three coding (DMD, MYH 7, and HBB) and two noncoding sequences (D 1 Z 2 and an anonymous sequence) were analyzed in four different cell types, including cells where DMD and MYH 7 are actively transcribed. Spatial analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the genes are preferentially located in the periphery of chromosome territories. This positioning was independent from the activity of the genes. In contrast, the non-expressed anonymous fragment was found randomly distributed or localized preferentially in the interior of the corresponding chromosome territory. Furthermore, the distribution of the analyzed genes within the territorial peripheries was found to be highly characteristic for each gene, and, again, independent from its expression.

We observed locked genomic loci resistant to spatial repositioning and unlocked loci that could be repositioned to different <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartments</b> with distinct chromatin signatures. Focal protein recruitment caused the entire subTAD, but not surrounding regions, to engage in new genomic contacts.

To further understand this pathology, we searched for Dyrk 1 A-interacting proteins and identified Arip 4 (androgen receptor-interacting protein 4), a SNF 2 -like steroid hormone receptor cofactor. Mouse hippocampal and cerebellar neurons coexpress Dyrk 1 A and Arip 4.

Inhibition of endogenous Dyrk 1 A and Arip 4 expression by RNA interference showed that both proteins are necessary for the efficient activation of androgen receptor- and glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription.

During the first 24 hours of development, embryonic cells displayed up to 30 CBs per nucleus; these dispersed prior to mitosis and reassembled within minutes upon daughter cell nucleus formation. Following zygotic genome activation, snRNP biogenesis was required for CB assembly and maintenance, suggesting a self-assembly process that determines CB numbers in embryos. Differentiation into muscle, neurons and epidermis was associated with the achievement of a steady state number of 2 CBs per nucleus.

How these structures affect NER is poorly understood. Our data indicate that the X-type, but not the Y’-type, sub-telomeric chromatin modulates NER, a consequence of Sir protein-dependent nucleosome stability.

We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the proteins containing homopolymeric histidine tracts in the human genome and identified 86 human proteins that contain stretches of five or more histidines. Most of them are endowed with DNA- and RNA-related functions, and, in addition, there is an overrepresentation of proteins expressed in the brain and/or nervous system development. An analysis of their subcellular localization shows that 15 of the 22 nuclear proteins identified accumulate in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartment</b> known as nuclear speckles. This localization is lost when the histidine repeat is deleted, and significantly, closely related paralogous proteins without histidine repeats also fail to localize to nuclear speckles. Hence, the histidine tract appears to be directly involved in targeting proteins to this compartment. The removal of DNA-binding domains or treatment with RNA polymerase II inhibitors induces the re-localization of several polyhistidine-containing proteins from the nucleoplasm to nuclear speckles. These findings highlight the dynamic relationship between sites of transcription and nuclear speckles. Therefore, we define the histidine repeats as a novel targeting signal for nuclear speckles, and we suggest that these repeats are a way of generating evolutionary diversification in gene duplicates.

We detected the radioactive signals in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-IRS- 1 proportional to the UV irradiation, {{but not in the}} immunoprecipitates of FLAG-IRS- 2, suggesting the direct contact of RNAs with IRS- 1. RNAs cross-linked to IRS- 1 were then amplified by RT-PCR, followed by sequence analysis. We isolated sequence tags attributed to 25 messenger RNAs and 8 non-coding RNAs, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). We focused on the interaction of IRS- 1 with U 96 A snoRNA (U 96 A) and its host Rack 1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) pre-mRNA. We confirmed the interaction of IRS- 1 with U 96 A, and with RACK 1 pre-mRNA by immunoprecipitation with IRS- 1 followed by Northern blotting or RT-PCR analyses. Mature U 96 A in IRS- 1 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts was quantitatively less than WT.

Colocalizations with proteins Ki- 67, HP 1 �, and PCNA, respectively, have further shown that the staining pattern of NO 66 overlaps with certain clusters of late replicating chromatin. Biochemical experiments have revealed that protein NO 66 cofractionates with large preribosomal particles but is absent from cytoplasmic ribosomes. We propose that in addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis protein NO 66 has functions in the replication or remodeling of certain heterochromatic regions.

To examine whether gene regulation is related to a discernible pattern of genomic organization, we analyzed the linear arrangement of co-regulated genes along chromosomes and determined the organization of chromosomes during the differentiation of a hematopoietic progenitor to erythroid and neutrophil cell types. Our analysis reveals that there is a significant tendency for co-regulated genes to be proximal, which is related to the association of homologous chromosomes and the spatial juxtaposition of lineage-specific gene domains.

More specifically, the aim was to elucidate mechanisms by which Hes and RUNX-mediated transcriptional control is modulated, with respect to their interactions with each other and the Groucho/TLE proteins. It is shown here that mammalian Hes 1 requires TLEs to repress gene expression, similar to the requirement Drosophila Hes proteins have for Groucho. It is shown further that TLEs also interact with mammalian RUNX proteins and inhibit RUNX's ability to transactivate gene expression. In contrast, Hes 1 also physically associates with RUNX and enhances RUNX-mediated transactivation. These results, together with our additional finding that RUNX can inhibit Hes 1 -mediated transcriptional repression, suggest {{for the first time that}} RUNX and Hes 1 proteins regulate each other's transcriptional functions. This thesis also shows that Hes 1 can be found in a discreet <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartment</b> {{involved in the}} regulation of gene expression, termed the nuclear matrix. Nuclear matrix binding is mediated by the same Hes 1 C-terminal domain that acts as a binding site for Groucho/TLEs, which also localize to the nuclear matrix and are required for Hes 1 -mediated transcriptional repression. Both the nuclear matrix association and transcription repression activity of Hes 1 are inhibited by deletion of its C-terminal region, indicating that Groucho/TLEs act as transcriptional corepressors for Hes 1. Together, the material presented in this thesis suggests that Hes 1 and RUNX proteins interact with each other to modulate gene expression in the development of a number of tissues...|$|E
40|$|Reactivation of dormant chick {{erythrocyte}} (CE) nuclei was {{studied by}} fusing chick red cells with rat myoblasts, HeLa cells, and chick fibroblasts. Heterokaryons representing {{different stages of}} nuclear reactivation were fixed and examined for nuclear antigens using polyclonal patient autoantisera reacting with mammalian (human, mouse, and rat) nuclear envelope, nucleoplasm, and chromatin (DNA) antigens. Reactivation of CE nuclei was associated with marked changes in nuclear antigenicity. In rat myoblast and HeLa heterokaryons the CE nuclei acquired mammalian nucleoplasmic and nuclear envelope antigens in the corresponding <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartments.</b> Drastic changes in nuclear antigenicity were noted also in heterokaryons stained with DNA antisera. The compact chromatin of nuclei in mature chick erythrocytes showed little binding of DNA antibodies. Isolated nuclei {{on the other hand}} gave a strong immunofluorescence. CE nuclei in heterokaryons were strongly positive during the early stages of nuclear reactivation but then exhibited decreased reactivity. An unexpected finding was a marked reduction in the capacity of mammalian nuclei in heterokaryons to bind DNA-antibodies. This observation is discussed in relation to the previous finding that in CE-heterokaryons these nuclei often show reduced transcription and replication. The present results indicate that in heterokaryons both types of nuclei exchange macromolecules of regulatory importance via the common cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{evidence}} suggests that SUMOylation of proteins plays a key regulatory role in the assembly and dis-assembly of <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartments,</b> and may repress transcription by modifying chromatin. Determining whether a protein contains a SUMOylation site or not thus provides essential clues about a substrate’s intra-nuclear spatial association and function. Previous SUMOylation predictors are largely based on a degenerate and functionally unreliable consensus motif description, not rendering satisfactory accuracy to confidently map the extent of this essential class of regulatory modifications. This paper embarks on an exploration of predictive dependencies among SUMOylation site amino acids, non-local and structural properties (including secondary structure, solvent accessibility and evolutionary profiles). An extensive examination of two main machine learning paradigms, Support-Vector-Machine and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks, demonstrates that (1) with careful attention to generalization issues both methods achieve comparable performance and, that (2) local features enable best generalization, with structural features having little to no impact. The predictive model for SUMOylation sites based on the primary protein sequence achieves an area under the ROC of 0. 92 using 5 -fold cross-validation, and 96 % accuracy on an independent hold-out test set. However, similar to other predictors, the new predictor is unable to generalize beyond the simple consensus motif. ...|$|R
40|$|DNA topoisomerase (topo) II catalyses topological genomic changes {{essential}} for many DNA metabolic processes. It is also {{regarded as a}} structural component of the nuclear matrix in interphase and the mitotic chromosome scaffold. Mammals have two isoforms (α and β) with similar properties in vitro. Here, we investigated their properties in living and proliferating cells, stably expressing biofluorescent chimera of the human isozymes. Topo IIα and IIβ behaved similarly in interphase but differently in mitosis, where only topo IIα was chromosome associated to a major part. During interphase, both isozymes joined in nucleolar reassembly and accumulated in nucleoli, which seemed not to involve catalytic DNA turnover because treatment with teniposide (stabilizing covalent catalytic DNA intermediates of topo II) relocated {{the bulk of the}} enzymes from the nucleoli to nucleoplasmic granules. Photobleaching revealed that the entire complement of both isozymes was completely mobile and free to exchange between <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartments</b> in interphase. In chromosomes, topo IIα was also completely mobile and had a uniform distribution. However, hypotonic cell lysis triggered an axial pattern. These observations suggest that topo II is not an immobile, structural component of the chromosomal scaffold or the interphase karyoskeleton, but rather a dynamic interaction partner of such structures...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} shows that the spatial organization of transcription is an important epigenetic factor in eukaryotic gene regulation. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum shows a remarkably complex pattern of gene expression during the erythrocytic cycle, paradoxically contrasting with the relatively low number of putative transcription factors encoded by its genome. The spatial organization of <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartments</b> has been correlated with the regulation of virulence genes. Here, we investigate the nuclear architecture of transcription during the asexual cycle of malaria parasites. As in mammals, transcription is organized into discrete nucleoplasmic sites in P. falciparum, but in a strikingly lower number of foci. An automated analysis of 3 D images shows that the number and intensity of transcription sites vary significantly between rings and trophozoites, although the nuclear volume remains constant. Transcription sites are spatially reorganized during the asexual cycle, with {{a higher proportion of}} foci located in the outermost nuclear region in rings, whereas in trophozoites, foci are evenly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. As in higher eukaryotes, transcription sites are predominantly found in areas of low chromatin density. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that transcription sites form an exclusive nuclear compartment, different from the compartments defined by the silenced or active chromatin markers. In conclusion, these data suggest that transcription is spatially contained in discrete foci that are developmentally regulated during the asexua...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cellular}} and viral {{genes are}} parts of complex transcription units containing multiple splicing choices. During {{the course of an}} adenoviral replicative cycle, different spliced versions of a single gene predominate, depending on the stage of infection. This is true for several adenoviral genes. In this paper we show for the viral E 1 B transcription unit that splice site usage regulates this process. The change in alternative splicing in this system does not depend on the sequence of the transcribed genes. Non-adenoviral genes, such as the SV 40 early region and the polyoma early region, which normally show little or no regulation of spliced RNA product formation, become regulated for mRNA production after insertion into the adenoviral genome. Additional studies show that E 1 B splicing regulation in adenovirus is a cis effect. Staggered infections using two discernable viral genomes resulted in a situation where both early and late genomes exist in the same nucleus. Neither genome was able to impose its regulated splicing pattern on the other, indicating that the cue for the switch in viral gene splicing is not directly dependent on global changes in trans-acting splicing factors. This suggests a model where the signal for changes in RNA processing for the E 1 B gene is linked to the state of the DNA template or its localization within <b>nuclear</b> <b>subcompartments...</b>|$|R
