5|$|Clairmont accused Byron {{of murdering}} Allegra {{and demanded that}} Byron send her a {{portrait}} of Allegra, a lock of the child's hair, and that she be placed {{in charge of the}} funeral arrangements. In the end, though, Clairmont could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> see Allegra's coffin or to hold a funeral service for her daughter. She blamed Byron {{for the rest of her}} life for Allegra's death.|$|E
5|$|Armin {{was once}} a troubled young man from Capital City, and finds himself in the Army. There, he met and befriended the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who became his mentor and helped him find meaning in his troubled life. Seymour told Armin that his dream was to become an {{elementary}} school principal after the war. Later, Seymour was declared missing and presumed dead. Armin took {{the news of the}} apparent death to Seymour's mother, Agnes. Upon meeting him, however, Agnes mistook him for her son, and Armin could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> deliver the message. He instead allowed Agnes to call him Seymour, and took over Seymour's life. Meanwhile, the real Seymour Skinner spent five years in a POW camp, then worked in a Chinese sweatshop for two decades until it was shut down by the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> put her in danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce was {{generous with}} {{his time and}} money, believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a {{significant}} portion of their income to the needy. Yearly, he gave away thousands of pounds, much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes. He paid off the debts of others, supported education and missions, and in a year of food shortages, gave to charity more than his own yearly income. He was exceptionally hospitable, and could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> sack any of his servants. As a result, his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity. Although he was often months behind in his correspondence, Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships, military promotions and livings for clergymen, or for the reprieve of death sentences.|$|E
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

25|$|Byat Za {{came to see}} Lagun Ein in prison, {{and asked}} why he {{revealed}} the plan. Lagun Ein answered {{that he wanted to}} win justly, not through manipulation and misrepresentation, and that he was never comfortable with the plan, and could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> lie. The minister-general replied that the only way for Lagun Ein to escape the execution was for him to assassinate Minkhaung. Lagun Ein reluctantly accepted the offer. Byat Za still needed to convince the king, who grudgingly agreed.|$|E
25|$|The actress {{was known}} for her {{kindness}} to animals. She could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> see them abused or badly treated. Wheatley came upon a mule being beaten on Forsyth Street while {{she was a member}} of the Fawcett Stock Company in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1907. The animal was being beaten by a man with a hickory stick. She implored him to stop. Wheatley gave him a half dollar and begged him to restrain his temper. When she left the mule's handler was coaxing him in a soothing manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an old horse.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s New York State Police responded {{many times to}} the village, which has a {{generally}} low crime rate otherwise, when self-described dissidents reported harassment such as broken windows and graffiti of Hebrew profanity on their property. In one incident, troopers rode a school bus undercover to catch teenage boys stoning it; the boys later stoned a backup police cruiser when it arrived. One of Weider's nephews was among those arrested. He admitted {{that some of the}} village's young men took it upon themselves to act violently against dissidents because they could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> hear the grand rebbe criticized, although he said most of them were provoked to do so by dissidents.|$|E

25|$|Fakhr Al-Din Al-Turaihi, a Muslim {{scholar who}} lived in the 17th Century C.E, {{believed}} that the archangel Gabriel {{is the head of the}} cherubim. A Hadith in Shiite tradition tells us that Muhammad heard cherubs wailing and crying with sympathy for sinners in Heaven during his night journey, known as Isra and Mi'raj. Other traditions say that cherubs are so bright that the light of one of them could suffice the whole world. When Moses asked God to show him his face, he made one of his cherubs shine upon the mountain, shattering it to pieces. According to this tradition, God was showing Moses that since he could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> look at a cherub, he would not be able to bear looking at God.|$|E
500|$|Cielo was a {{childhood}} friend of André Schultz. When Cielo was a child, his father formed a group to organize and encourage swimming at Esporte Clube Barbarense. Werner Schultz, André Schultz's father, also belonged to the group. They began to create competitions and take the boys on trips. At one point, there were 500 people practicing swimming at the club, in a city, which almost 20 years later, has less than 200,000 inhabitants. Werner Schultz constructed a swimming pool with two Olympic lanes {{in the courtyard of}} his house, where Cielo used to train. Since childhood, Cielo could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> lose. Maria Schultz, mother of André Schultz, said, [...] "He could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> lose. Several American coaches say this: that good swimmers like to win, and exceptional not afford to lose. Such is the case of Cesão." [...] Cielo was so eager for victory that during the 1996 Summer Olympics, at nine years old, he was already studying his main reference, Russian Alexander Popov, through videos, noting details like his starts (block outputs) and turnarounds.|$|E
500|$|Jessie Bond {{wrote that}} Gilbert [...] "was quick-tempered, often unreasonable, {{and he could}} <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> be thwarted, but how anyone could call him unamiable I cannot understand." [...] George Grossmith wrote to The Daily Telegraph that, {{although}} Gilbert had been described as an autocrat at rehearsals, [...] "That was really only his manner when he was playing the part of stage director at rehearsals. As a matter of fact, he was a generous, kind true gentleman, and I use the word in the purest and original sense." ...|$|E

500|$|The Sum of Things was {{published}} posthumously, for on 4July 1980 Manning suffered a severe stroke while visiting {{friends in the}} Isle of Wight. She died in hospital on 23July; somewhat typically, Reggie, having been recalled from Ireland, was not present when she died. He could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> see her [...] "fade away" [...] and had gone to London to keep himself busy. Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Reggie would be late for her funeral, and he almost was. In addition, his mourning period, characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth, was precisely how Manning had imagined Guy Pringle's reaction to Harriet's supposed death in The Sum of Things. Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at Billingham Manor on the Isle of Wight.|$|E
500|$|After {{traveling}} to Florence, Mary Shelley wrote to Lady Mountcashell, praising Laurette's [...] "simplicity and frankness". By way of her mother, Laurette inquired after Mary's health and requested her presence. Mary Shelley invited Laurette {{to stay with}} her in Florence two months after the birth of Percy Florence, but the girl's mother could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> part with her. In early 1820, the group moved to Pisa and Claire became like an elder sister to Laurette, taking her to operas and the Carnival. In the summer, the group moved again, from Pisa to Livorno, and Mary Shelley began researching her historical novel Valperga. Throughout the summer, Claire wrote anxiously to Byron, begging to see Allegra. Believing that the Shelleys were careless parents who were {{responsible for the deaths of}} their children and concerned that the children were not receiving proper religious training, he consistently refused to let Claire see their daughter.|$|E
500|$|Bodies of {{the dead}} and injured were brought to Tan-y-Deri, the nearby home of Wright's sister, Jane Porter. Wright {{returned}} to Taliesin that night with his son John and Edwin Cheney. Cheney brought the remains of his children back to Chicago while Wright buried Mamah Borthwick on the grounds of nearby Unity Chapel [...] (the chapel of the mother's side of his family). Heartbroken over the loss of his lover, Wright did not mark the grave because he could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> be reminded of the tragedy. He also did not hold a funerary service for Borthwick, although he did fund and attend services for his employees. Wright struggled with the loss of Borthwick, experiencing symptoms of conversion disorder: insomnia, weight loss, and temporary blindness. After a few months of recovery, aided by his sister Jane Porter, Wright moved to an apartment he rented in Chicago at 25 Cedar Street. The attack also {{had a profound effect on}} Wright's design principles; biographer Robert Twombly writes that his Prairie School period ended after the loss of Borthwick.|$|E

500|$|The {{evolution}} and maturation of the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, {{is central to}} the story. This journey of maturation, where Bilbo gains a clear sense of identity and confidence in the outside world, may be seen as a Bildungsroman rather than a traditional quest. The Jungian concept of individuation is also reflected through this theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the arrested development of the dwarves. Thus, while Gandalf exerts a parental influence over Bilbo early on, it is Bilbo who gradually takes over leadership of the party, a fact the dwarves could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge. The analogue of the [...] "underworld" [...] and the hero returning from it with a boon (such as the ring, or Elvish blades) that benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic archetypes regarding initiation and male coming-of-age as described by Joseph Campbell. Chance compares the development and growth of Bilbo against other characters to the concepts of just kingship versus sinful kingship derived from the Ancrene Wisse (which Tolkien had written on in 1929) and a Christian understanding of Beowulf.|$|E
500|$|In 1913, Lloyd {{was booked}} by the Orpheum Syndicate {{to appear at}} the New York Palace Theatre. She and Dillon set sail on the RMS Olympic under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided {{in the country for}} many years. Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the {{authorities}} found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of moral turpitude and were sent to Ellis Island while an enquiry took place. [...] Dillon was charged under the White Slave Act with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent. [...] After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914. [...] Alice later stated that [...] "the indignity of the subsequent experience [...] went to Marie's heart in a way she never survived. [...] She could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> talk of that awful twenty-four hours." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1912, The Youngstown Daily Vindicator {{reported}} that Hogan would once again manage a local minor league ball club. The paper added, however, {{that the former}} Ohio Works manager was also considering an offer in Zanesville. Hogan evidently led the Zanesville team the previous season. [...] In November 1912, Sporting Life {{reported that}} the manager was still mulling his next move when he attended {{the annual meeting of}} the National Association in New York. [...] "Marty Hogan, the veteran minor league manager, who is known from end to end of the land as a developer of minor league talent and winner of pennants, could <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> miss meeting his old friends", the paper stated. [...] "Marty wound up the season with Zanesville and has not definitely decided upon his plans for the coming season". [...] Ultimately, Hogan went to Zanesville, where he managed the Zanesville Flood Sufferers in 1913. [...] The team's nickname was evidently inspired by a massive flood that had devastated cities and towns throughout central and southern Ohioincluding Zanesvillein the spring of 1913. [...] In April 1913, Sporting Life noted that the Zanesville club would [...] "stick to the circuit", despite the fact that the city was [...] "hit hard by the recent floods".
