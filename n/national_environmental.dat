5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act. This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E
5|$|After President Nixon {{was elected}} in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E

5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|Lynton Keith Caldwell (November 21, 1913 – August 15, 2006) was an American {{political}} scientist and a principal {{architect of the}} 1969 <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act, the first act {{of its kind in}} the world. He was educated at the University of Chicago and spent most of his career at Indiana University Bloomington, where he received tenure in 1956 and retired as Arthur F. Bentley Professor Emeritus of Political Science in 1984. Caldwell was the internationally acclaimed author or coauthor of fifteen books and more than 250 scholarly articles, which may be found in at least 19 different languages. He served on many boards and advisory committees, as a consultant on environmental policy issues worldwide, and received numerous honors and awards.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, 1970, Judge George Luzerne Hart, Jr., of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, {{ordered the}} Interior Department to not issue a {{construction}} permit for {{a section of}} the project that crossed one of the claims. Less than two weeks later, Hart heard arguments from conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act, which had gone into effect {{at the start of the}} year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction permit and halting the project in its tracks.|$|E

5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the <b>National</b> <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an honorary member of the International Association for Impact Assessment. Annually since 1995 the American Political Science Association has awarded the Lynton Keith Caldwell Prize for the best book in environmental politics and policy published during the previous three years. Shortly after his death in 2006, the Caldwell Center for Culture and Ecology was established in Bloomington, IN to provide environmental education for youth and adults.|$|E
