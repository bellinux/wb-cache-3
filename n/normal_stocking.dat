40|$|Stocking {{density is}} a {{management}} factor which has critical {{implications for the}} poultry industry. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of high stocking density as a predisposing factor in an experimental model of necrotic enteritis in broiler chicks. The experimental challenge model included an oral inoculation with 10 -fold dose of attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and multiple oral inoculations with a specific strain of Clostridium perfringens. Two hundred and forty as hatched day-old broiler chicks were randomly allocated to four treatment groups according to the following experimental design: group N, with <b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> density (15 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group D, with high stocking density (30 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group P, with <b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> density and positive challenge; and group DP, with high stocking density and positive challenge. From each bird, the intestine, gizzard and liver were collected and scored for gross lesions. The intestinal digesta was collected for pH and viscosity determination. One caecum from each bird was taken for microbiological analysis. The statistical analysis and evaluation of the experimental data revealed significant interaction effects between "stocking density" and "challenge", regarding gross lesion scores in intestine and liver, pH values in jejunum, ileum and caeca as well as C. perfringens counts in the caeca (P <= 0. 05). High stocking density in challenged birds increased the gross lesion score in the intestine (P <= 0. 05), contrary to unchallenged birds. It can be concluded that high stocking density affects unfavourably the welfare and gut health of broiler chicks, predisposes to necrotic enteritis in a subclinical experimental model and increases further its importance as a management factor for the poultry industry...|$|E

A hundred and thirty-six one-day-old Japanese quails were divided into eight equal groups of 17 quails each. The experiment was designed based on completely randomized design in two controls and six treatment groups: high stocking density, basal diet, control group (HSD; control 1); <b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> density, basal diet, control group (NSD; control 2); HSD, basal diet + 900 mg kg– 1 choline (A); NSD, basal diet + 900 mg kg– 1 choline (B); HSD, basal diet + 1800 mg kg– 1 choline (C); NSD, basal diet + 1800 mg kg– 1 choline (D); HSD, basal diet + 3600 mg kg– 1 choline (E); and NSD, basal diet + 3600 mg kg– 1 choline (F). Feeds and water were supplied ad libitum. Continuous light was provided. Quails were kept in cages of 50 × 100 cm in size. The choline content of quail meat increased with increasing amount of added choline to feed. The highest choline content (439. 2 and 561. 2 mg kg– 1) in quail meat was detected in E and F groups which fed the 3600 mg kg– 1 choline supplemented diet. The total lipid content of liver in E and F groups was reduced by 42 % compared with the control groups.

40|$|Boneseed, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera (Asteraceae) is {{concentrated}} in and near cities and towns on {{the north and east}} coasts ofTasmania. Its absence from intervening rural and bushland areas cannot be attributed to environmental conditions or a lack of time for dispersal from introduction points. The hypothesis tested in the present paper is that the range of boneseed in Tasmania is limited by biotic resistance through herbivory. Cafeteria experiments and field observations showed that sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos taurus),Tasmanian pademelons (Thylogale billardierii), Bennett’s wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus), garden weevils (Phlyctinus callosus) and native invertebrates all consumed boneseed, while common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) did not. A boneseed population subjected to sheep grazing for 168 days suffered high mortality, while an adjacent ungrazed population survived intact. A replicated exclosure experiment showed that 75 days of grazing by cattle reduced the size of boneseed plants. Observations of a population subject to Bennett’s wallaby and Tasmanian pademelon grazing over 1 year and 2 months showed consistently high leaf damage to foliage within pademelon reach and a decline in population, with high mortality rates in the driest and coldest times. Leaf loss attributable to invertebrates did not prevent a nearby population without wallabies from growing. The distributions of the taxa were consistent with biotic resistance, with those demonstrating no severe effect on boneseed individuals widespread, while those with evidence of severe effects more common in rural areas than in urban areas. Boneseed seemed unlikely to survive for very long at <b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> levels. Macropod grazing, particularly that of T. billardierii, may also inhibit the invasion of boneseed. Thus, the recent introduction of foxes to Tasmania may not only cause the extinction of species such as T. billardierii, but also may cause an expansion of the range of boneseed...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted {{to aid in the}} integration of crop and livestock systems. A study was initiated to evaluate the impact of spring corn residue grazing and tillage on subsequent crop yields in a corn-soybean rotation. Crop yields were evaluated for two different stocking rates. <b>Normal</b> <b>stocking</b> rates showed no detrimental impacts of grazing or tillage on subsequent crop yields. At higher stocking rates (2. 5 times normal) grazing increased soybean yields. However, corn yields were depressed under no-tillage 2 years post grazing. The results from this study suggest that producers can maintain livestock on crop acres in the spring if soybeans are planted the subsequent growing season. ^ Another study evaluated transgenic (Corn Rootworm protected and Roundup Ready®) corn and non-transgenic corn for residue grazing. Growth performance of steers grazing corn residue from transgenic corn or their respective non-transgenic control was not different. This demonstrates that the feeding value of corn residue does not differ between transgenic corn hybrids and their parental controls. ^ A trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of increasing levels of salt (NaCl) inclusion on animal performance and feed intake. Cattle were individually fed one of five treatments to include increasing levels of NaCl in the supplement from 0 to 0. 5 % of diet DM. Overall, NaCl supplementation was not effective in increasing animal performance or feed intake. Results suggest that NaCl inclusion in diets is not necessary. ^ An experiment was conducted to evaluate pen cleaning frequency and the impact on nitrogen (N) volatilization during summer months and during composting of manure. Either monthly cleaning (MC) or cleaning pens {{at the end of the}} feeding period (EC) were evaluated. Within cleaning frequency, collected manure was composted with and without sawdust amendment.

40|$|Necrotic {{enteritis}} (NE) {{is described}} as a disease of high economical impact which affects health and welfare of broilers and may also pose a threat to public health. Therefore any predisposing factor to NE is regarded very important. The effect of stress factors attributed to management practices such as feed deprivation, high stocking density, heat stress, cold stress and vaccination with live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine on the pathogenesis of NE has not been studied adequately. Therefore, the objective {{of the present study was}} to validate the effect of the above mentioned management stressors on the pathogenesis of NE by the use of an effective experimental model. For this purpose five experiments were carried out. In each one of the four experiments 240 day old broiler chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly allocated into four experimental groups of 60 broilers each, while in the fifth experiment for the evaluation of vaccination with live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine on the pathogenesis of NE, 300 day old broilers chicken were randomly allocated into five experimental groups of 60 broilers each. Each experimental group consisted of two replicates (subgroups). The experimental period for each experiment was set to 24 days. On day 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24, six birds per subgroup were euthanized. The examinations conducted at each sampling day included the gross lesion scoring of intestine, gizzard and liver, the histopathology of intestine and liver, the flotation of feces, the microscopic examination of wet smears from intestinal mucosa and content, the measurement of pH of intestinal content, the measurement of viscosity of contents of jejunum and ileum, the bacterial cultivation of C. perfringens from liver and swab samples of gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the quantification of C. perfringens in cecum. Moreover, broilers were weighed on day 1, 9, 16, 17 and 21, while feed conversion ratio was calculated for the periods of 10 - 16 days of age and 17 - 21 days of age. In order to reproduce the NE, an experimental challenge model using C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live anticoccidial vaccine was adopted. Experimentally challenged birds were orally infected three times per day with 4 x 108 cfu C. perfringens for four consecutive days (days 17, 18 19 and 20). The used strain was resistant to rifampicin. For the induction of NE, at day 18 birds were also inoculated orally with tenfold dose of a live anticoccidial vaccine (Paracox TM- 5) which consisted of oocysts of E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. mitis and E. tenella. Broilers in all groups were fed a specially formulated three phase ratio (starter 1 - 9 d, grower 10 - 16 d and finisher 17 - 24 d), which included large quantities of wheat, rye and soya. In the finisher ration soya was replaced by fishmeal which acted as predisposing factor of NE. The use of antibiotic growth promoters and anticoccidial drugs was avoided. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the effect of feed deprivation on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group SN where feed deprivation was applied, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and group SP where birds were both experimentally challenged and suffered starvation. In groups where feed deprivation was applied, the feed was withdrawn at days 16, 17, 18 and 19 for 12 hours daily starting from 21 : 00 to 09 : 00. The results of the experiment demonstrated that starvation has a significant protective effect against the experimentally induced NE in broilers, by limiting the C. perfringens caeca counts and reducing the severity of the NE lesions. The objective of second experiment was to assess the influence of high stocking density as a predisposing factor in NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were control group N where birds were at <b>normal</b> <b>stocking</b> density (15 birds/m 2) and not challenged, group DN where birds were raised at 50 % increased stocking density from 1 st day (30 birds/m 2), group P where birds were raised at standard stocking density and challenged with C. perfringens and with tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and group DP where birds were challenged and raised at increased stocking density as described above. The experiment provides evidence that high stocking density increased the frequency and severity of NE. The purpose of third experiment was to investigate the effects of heat stress on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group HN where heat stress (35 oC) was applied, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and with tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine, and group HP where birds were both experimentally challenged and suffered heat stress. In groups where heat stress was applied, temperature was increased from 25 νC (the recommended temperature for broilers at the respective age) to 35 νC at days 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 for 12 hours daily starting from 21 : 00 to 09 : 00 h. Heat stress predisposes broilers to the manifestation of NE, because it provokes the occurrence of NE lesions in non challenged birds and also caused further increase of the severity of lesions in challenged birds. The objective of fourth experiment was to assess the influence of cold stress on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group CN where cold stress (15 oC) was applied, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and group CP where birds were both experimentally challenged and suffered cold stress as described above. In groups where cold stress was applied, temperature was decreased from 25 νC (the recommended temperature for broilers at the respective age) to 15 νC at days 17, 18, 19 and 20 for 12 hours daily starting from 9 : 00 to 21 : 00. The experiment provides evidence that cold stress increased severity of subclinical NE. The objective of fifth experiment was to assess the influence of live anticoccidial vaccine on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens and to establish a more efficient experimental model for the reproduction of NE. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group PN where birds vaccinated at day 1 with live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine, group M where birds were challenged with C. perfringens and E. maxima and group PM where birds vaccinated at day 1 and were challenged with C. perfringens and E. maxima. The study provides evidence that live anticoccidial vaccine decreased the frequency and severity of experimental NE. Furthermore, the challenge of birds with C. perfringens and E. maxima increased the frequency and aggregated the severity of NE lesions compared to challenge with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live anticoccidial vaccine. It is evident from our studies that among the management factors in intensive broiler production systems, high stocking density, heat stress and cold stress pose a significant predisposal role for the induction of NE, while feed deprivation and vaccination against coccidiosis act protectively against it. ...|$|E

He went to the dressing-tent, and on examining his watch was horrified to find that he had just ten minutes in which to do everything, and the walk to the station, he reflected, was a long five minutes. He literally hurled himself into his clothes, and, disregarding the Bargee, who had entered the tent and seemed to wish to continue the discussion at the point where they had left off, shot off towards the gate nearest the station. He had exactly four minutes and twenty-five seconds in which to complete the journey, and he had just run a mile.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of option {{granting}} firms, {{some of which}} were investigated for option grant backdating, we develop a predictive model for such investigations and examine how the capital market responded as the backdating scandal unfolded. Firms that were investigated experienced significant stock price declines {{from the beginning of the}} Wall Street Journal's Perfect Payday series through the end of 2006. Firms predicted to have backdating problems, but not the subject of publicly revealed investigations, experienced stock price performance during the same period that was remarkably similar to that of firms with publicly revealed investigations. In contrast, firms not predicted to have backdating problems experienced <b>normal</b> <b>stock</b> price performance. Our results suggest that capital markets disciplined companies with suspicious option grant histories, often prior to, and irrespective of, any public revelation of an investigation into the matter.

40|$|The {{presence}} of viruses in apparently healthy animals has not infrequently complicated experimental procedures. Previous investigators have discovered various viruses in mice from different highly inbred laboratory stocks. Marchal (1) described a natural disease which occurred in stock mice and {{was caused by}} infectious ectromelia virus. Traub (2) isolated a virus from normal white mice and subsequently {{found it to be}} identical with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus described by Armstrong and Lillie (3). Theiler (4) observed spontaneously paralyzed mice in an otherwise <b>normal</b> <b>stock</b> and isolated the causal agent, mouse encephalomyelitis virus. Viruses capable of producing fatal pneumonia in mice have been found previously in normal mouse lungs by Dochez, Mills, and Mulliken (5) and Gordon, Freeman, and Clampit (6). During the fall of 1938 attempts were made to isolate viruses from nasopharyngeal washings obtained from patients with various acute non-influenzal diseases of the respiratory tract. In the course of these experiment...|$|R
