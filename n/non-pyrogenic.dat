40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{molecular}} properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dissolved black carbon (DBC) using analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC-MS). The sample set was comprised of ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) from North American headwater streams associated with Long Term Ecological Research network sites. Pyrolysis products for each UDOM sample were categorized as being sourced from <b>non-pyrogenic</b> sources and DBC. Major <b>non-pyrogenic</b> components of the headwater stream UDOM were comprised of phenolic compounds derived from lignin and chitin markers from microbial biomass, and their relative contributions indicated differences in organic matter dynamics of these ecosystems. The DBC pyrolyzates included benzene, PAHs and benzonitriles, which accounted for 12. 5 ± 4. 5 % of total quantified peak area (TPQA), and decreased in the order Alaskan boreal forest (19 %), Alaskan tundra (17 %), Appalachian deciduous forest (11 %), Colorado alpine tundra (9 %), Puerto Rican mountainous tropical rainforest (9 %) and Kansas tallgrass prairie (7 %).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with a}} brief {{overview}} of the quality requirements for sterile pharmaceutical product manufacture as per international regulatory requirements. The pharmaceutical companies are required to follow the quality management specifications as per different guidelines such as Indian GMP (Schedule M), WHO, US cGMP and MHRA. Parenteral products are intended to be <b>non-pyrogenic</b> too, additionally to the requirement to be sterile. Medicinal drug products that do not meet the requirement to be sterile, <b>non-pyrogenic</b> can otherwise cause severe harm to life, threatening health risk to patient. It is necessary to know the differences in the requirements of guidelines given by different international agencies. Knowledge of the differences in the requirements is important to guarantee the quality products and their supply in due time for the designated market. The main aim is to study the quality requirements for sterile pharmaceutical product manufacture and to list down the similarities and differences as per the international regulatory requirements. The aspects that are taken into consideration are environmental parameters, buildings and premises, personnel, sanitation, equipment and sterilization. These guidelines focus on the parameters to be stressed on while manufacturing sterile pharmaceutical product and when these guidelines were compared, certain similarities and differences were observed.

40|$|Resumen de la Comunicación presentada en el Goldschmidt 2013 Conference Abstracts. Biochar Interactions with Soil, Plant and Water – Processes and Fate, Florencia (Italia) 2013 Distinguishing {{pyrogenic}} and <b>non-pyrogenic</b> SOM components is {{a difficult}} task as non-selective pyrolysis products such as MAHs, PAHs and phenols can derive from multiple sources. However, black carbon (BC) may contribute significantly to the MAHs and PAHs in a given pyrolysate, especially if BC is more abundant than alternative sources. In this study, samples from a soil rich in pyrogenic material in NW Spain were subjected to K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and KMnO 4 oxidation and the residual SOM was NaOH-extracted and analyzed using analytical Py-GC-MS in order to study the susceptibility of different SOM fractions (fresh, degraded/microbial, aliphatic and specially BC) towards this oxidation agent. Besides solid-state 13 C CP MAS-NMR was also performed to support theses results. Non-oxidized samples following the same NaOH-extraction procedure were also analyzed. From Py-GC-MS, residual SOM after K 2 Cr 2 O 7 oxidation contained BC, N-containing BC (BN) and aliphatic structures whilst carbohydrate products and lignocellulose were completely oxidized. This was corroborated by a relatively intense resonance of aromatic C and some signal of alkyl C (supporting {{the presence of a}} <b>non-pyrogenic</b> fraction mainly consisting of aliphatic structures) in 13 C NMR spectra. Thus K 2 Cr 2 O 7 effectively concentrates MAHs, PAHs and BN derived from BC. For KMnO 4, both techniques indicated that this reagent promotes the oxidation of carbohydrate products, mostly from degraded/microbial SOM but slightly oxidized lignocellulose and aromatic structures (pyrogenic and nonpyrogenic) not providing a good assessment of the BC signal.

40|$|The {{intravenous}} injection of the PR 8 strain of influenza A virus, the Lee strain of influenza B, and the "B" strain of Newcastle disease virus produces fever in rabbits. This phenomenon {{has been studied}} in relation to certain in vitro properties of these viruses. Saline suspensions of virus prepared by centrifugation or elution from chicken erythrocytes produced fever. Fluids from {{which most of the}} virus particles had been removed were <b>non-pyrogenic.</b> Exposure to temperatures which destroyed the infectivity of the virus for chick embryos did not prevent fever. However, heating sufficient to destroy the hemagglutinin also rendered virus <b>non-pyrogenic.</b> The injection of erythrocytes onto which virus had been adsorbed produced fever. Heated virus adsorbed onto erythrocytes, which failed to elute, produced no elevation of temperature, although heated virus alone was pyrogenic. Neutralization of virus with specific immune serum prevented fever. Antipyrine was capable of abolishing the febrile response to virus. Certain differences between the febrile response in rabbits to the injection of viruses and that following bacterial pyrogens were noted. The period between injection and beginning of temperature rise is longer with virus than with bacterial pyrogens. Relatively low temperatures inactivate the fever-producing capacity of viruses, whereas bacterial pyrogens withstand prolonged autoclaving, and the neutralization of viral fever by specific immune serum contrasts sharply with the failure of antibody to affect the response to bacterial pyrogens. Certain previous observations on the lymphopenia produced in rabbits by the injection of influenzal viruses were confirmed. The capacity of virus preparations to induce fever in rabbits closely parallels their capacity to induce lymphopenia. It was concluded that the fever-producing property of influenzal viruses is closely associated with the capacity to agglutinate erythrocytes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{link between}} {{infection}} and hyperalgesia {{has been determined}} using mainly lipopolysaccharide, which is a bacterial antigen. The relationship between viral infection and hyperalgesia {{has yet to be}} fully characterized, with current models of virus-induced hyperalgesia being based on infections by specific neurotrophic viruses. Therefore, the aim of this series of studies was to develop a general model of virus-induced hyperalgesia by injecting a pyrogenic and <b>non-pyrogenic</b> dose of Poly I:C, a synthetic, double-stranded ribonucleotide that is similar to the double-stranded ribonucleotides produced by almost all viruses, into rats’ tails. To identify a pyrogenic and <b>non-pyrogenic</b> dose of Poly I:C, male Sprague Dawley rats were injected subcutaneously in the tail either with saline (n= 8) or 100 μg. kg- 1 (n= 8) or 1000 μg. kg- 1 (n= 8) Poly I:C. Only rats that received 1000 μg. kg- 1 Poly I:C developed fever. Subsequently, in a separate experiment, tail withdrawal latencies to noxious thermal (49 ° water) and mechanical stimuli (4 N blunt force) were recorded for six days after subcutaneous injection of 100 μg. kg- 1 or 1000 μg. kg- 1 Poly I:C or saline in male Sprague Dawley rats. I also took skin tissue samples from the site of injection to determine the histological changes that occur after Poly I:C injection. Thermal hyperalgesia was not elicited by Poly I:C injection. However, biphasic mechanical hyperalgesia developed in the animals receiving 100 μg. kg- 1 Poly I:C, and sustained mechanical hyperalgesia, that lasted for four days, was evident in animals injected with 1000 μg. kg- 1 Poly I:C. Mild sustained inflammation, at the injection site of both doses of Poly I:C, was present even after the hyperalgesia had subsided. This study provides evidence for a novel model of virus-induced hyperalgesia that is applicable to most cutaneous viral infections. More importantly, this model can be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie virus-induced pain...|$|E

To improve immunogenicity, the purified antigen was coupled to tetanus toxoid (TT) with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) as a spacer and 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide (EDAC) as a linker. The reaction mixture was passed through a Sepharose CL- 4 B column. The resulting conjugate was composed of TT and large-size alginate polymer at a ratio of about 3 : 1; it was non-toxic and <b>non-pyrogenic,</b> and elicited high titres of alginate-specific IgG. Antisera raised against the conjugate had high opsonic activity against the vaccine strain. The alginate conjugate was also able to protect mice against a lethal dose of mucoid P. aeruginosa. These data indicate that an alginate-based vaccine has significant potential to protect against chronic {{infection with}} mucoid P. aeruginosa in the CF host...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPC) are self {{setting and}} biocompatible bone substitute materials with potential applications in dentistry. However, its clinical use {{has been challenged}} by poor rheological properties. A novel formulation of CPC has been developed, which gives a fully injectable and cohesive paste. This work investigates the suitability of the new "fully injectable calcium phosphate cement" (FI-CPC) for dental applications. The cementing properties, material characteristics, and the rheological properties were tested using a battery of material characteristics methods. The biocompatibility was also evaluated as per ISO 7405. The setting time (20 min) and compressive strength (> 11 Mpa) of FI-CPC satisfy the clinical requirements. It underwent setting without any exothermic reaction, keeping good dimensional stability. The cement paste could be extruded through a 18 -gauge needle, easily and fully. It showed excellent cohesion when immersed in water. FI-CPC was seen to set into a micro-porous mass of hydroxyapatite, the mineral part of human dentin. It showed good attachment to dentin walls, when filled in tooth perforations. FI-CPC was found non-toxic, non-allergic, <b>non-pyrogenic,</b> and soft-tissue compatible. The study shows that FI-CPC provides a self setting bio-compatible paste with excellent rheological properties for surgical applications. The set cement provides good and stable sealing. The osteoconductive property is an added advantage. FI-CPC proves to be an ideal material for endodontic sealing/filling and periodontic repair...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of endogenous pyrogen by intact granulocytes obtained from acute peritoneal exudates is blocked by arsenite, iodoacetate, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and N-ethylmaleimide in concentrations of 2 x 10 – 4 M. When {{the concentration of}} these sulfhydryl-reactive enzyme inhibitors is increased to 2 x 10 – 2 M, only the iodoacetate inactivates the pyrogen molecule, whereas the arsenite, the p-chloromercuribenzoate, and the N-ethylmaleimide have no gross effect upon its thermogenic activity. Both diisopropyl fluorophosphate and dinitrofluorobenzene are even more potent inactivators of the pyrogen molecule than iodoacetate, although {{the action of the}} DFP cannot be blocked or reversed by known antagonists such as 2 -pyridine aldoxime methiodide and hydroxylamine. Proteolytic enzymes, potentially capable of degrading leucocytic pyrogen, are released from polymorphonuclear leucocytes, along with the pyrogen, when the cells are incubated in normal salt solution. These enzymes are readily activated by a sufficient concentration of glutathione (2 x 10 – 2 M). They are not present in preparations of partially purified leucocytic pyrogen from which much of the <b>non-pyrogenic</b> protein has been removed. Glutathione by itself, even at concentrations as high as 2 x 10 – 1 M, does not affect in the gross the thermogenic activity of the purified pyrogen. The implications of these findings in relation to both the production and the chemical characteristics of leucocytic pyrogen are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in the biosynthetic pathway for {{catecholamine}} synthesis. Stress triggers {{an increase in}} TH activity, resulting in increased release of catecholamines from both neurons and the adrenal medulla. In response to stress three phases of TH activation have been identified (acute, sustained and chronic) and each phase has a unique mechanism. The acute and chronic phases have been studied in vivo {{in a number of}} animal models, but to date the sustained phase has only been characterised in vitro. We aimed to investigate the effects of dual exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in neonatal rats on TH protein, TH phosphorylation at serine residues 19, 31 and 40 and TH activity in the adrenal gland over the sustained phase. Wistar rats were administered LPS (0. 05 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) or an equivolume of <b>non-pyrogenic</b> saline on days 3 and 5 postpartum. Adrenal glands were collected at 4, 24 and 48 h after the drug exposure on day 5. Neonatal LPS treatment resulted in increases in TH phosphorylation of Ser 40 at 4 and 24 h, TH phosphorylation of Ser 31 at 24 h, TH activity at 4 and 24 h and TH protein at 48 h. We therefore have provided evidence {{for the first time that}} TH phosphorylation at Ser 31 and Ser 40 occurs for up to 24 h in vivo and leads to TH activation independent of TH protein synthesis, suggesting that the sustained phase of TH activation occurs in vivo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnetic {{hyperthermia}} {{was reported}} to increase the survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma by 7 months. This promising result may potentially be further improved by using iron oxide nanoparticles, called magnetosomes, which are synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria, extracted from these bacteria, purified to remove most endotoxins and organic material, and then coated with poly-l-lysine to yield a stable and <b>non-pyrogenic</b> nanoparticle suspension. Due to their ferrimagnetic behavior, high crystallinity and chain arrangement, these magnetosomes coated with poly-l-lysine (M-PLL) are characterized by a higher heating power than their chemically synthesized counterparts currently used in clinical trials. M-PLL-enhanced antitumor efficacy was demonstrated by administering 500 – 700 μg in iron of M-PLL to intracranial U 87 -Luc tumors of 1. 5 mm 3 and by exposing mice to 27 magnetic sessions each lasting 30 min, during which an alternating magnetic field of 202 kHz and 27 mT was applied. Treatment conditions were adjusted to reach a typical hyperthermia temperature of 42 °C during the first magnetic session. In 100 % of treated mice, bioluminescence due to living glioblastoma cells fully disappeared 68 days following tumor cell implantation (D 68). These mice were all still alive at D 350. Histological analysis of their brain tissues revealed an absence of tumor cells, suggesting that they were fully cured. In comparison, antitumor efficacy was less pronounced in mice treated by the administration of IONP followed by 23 magnetic sessions, leading to full tumor bioluminescence disappearance in only 20 % of the treated mice...|$|E
40|$|Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi-caused infection, if not {{recognized}} and appropriately treated by antibiotics, {{may lead to}} chronic complications, thus stressing the need for protective vaccine development. The immune protection is mediated by phagocytic cells and by Borrelia-specific complement-activating antibodies, associated with the Th 1 immune response. Surface antigen OspC is involved in Borrelia spreading through the host body. Previously we reported that recombinant histidine tagged (His-tag) OspC (rOspC) could be attached onto liposome surfaces by metallochelation. Here we report that levels of OspC-specific antibodies vary substantially depending upon whether rOspC possesses an N' or C' terminal His-tag. This {{is the case in}} mice immunized: (a) with rOspC proteoliposomes containing adjuvants MPLA or <b>non-pyrogenic</b> MDP analogue MT 06; (b) with free rOspC and Montanide PET GEL A; (c) with free rOspC and alum; or (d) with adjuvant-free rOspC. Stronger responses are noted with all N'-terminal His-tag rOspC formulations. OspC-specific Th 1 -type antibodies predominate post-immunization with rOspC proteoliposomes formulated with MPLA or MT 06 adjuvants. Further analyses confirmed that the structural features of soluble N' and C' terminal His-tag rOspC and respective rOspC proteoliposomes are similar including their thermal stabilities at physiological temperatures. On the other hand, a change in the position of the rOspC His-tag from N' to C' terminal appears to affect substantially the immunogenicity of rOspC arguably due to steric hindrance of OspC epitopes by the C' terminal His-tag itself and not due to differences in overall conformations induced by changes in the His-tag position in rOspC variants...|$|E
