40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of the effects <b>of</b> <b>alternation</b> bias {{in the evaluation of}} quantified Boolean formula (QBF) solvers. Alternation bias in a set of QBFs in prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF) is caused by an overrepresentation of PCNFs with a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> quantifier <b>alternations.</b> Using the QBFEVAL' 16 benchmarks, we show empirically that the performance of solvers based on different solving paradigms substantially varies on classes of PCNFs defined by their <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternations.</b> Thus alternation bias might result in solver rankings that are biased with respect to solving paradigms that perform well on overrepresented instances. Our results motivate the development of methods for a balanced evaluation of orthogonal paradigms that perform well on underrepresented instances. This is necessary to showcase the broad range of existing solving paradigms for practical QBF applications and to help potential users to choose a good solver for their application.

A second {{cause of}} {{diminution}} in {{the force of}} the voltaic battery, consequent upon its own action, is that extraordinary state of the surfaces of the metals (969.) which was first described, I believe, by Ritter[A], to which he refers the powers of his secondary piles, and which has been so well experimented upon by Marianini, and also by A. De la Rive. If the apparatus, fig. 103. (1096.), be left in action for an hour or two, with the wire 3 in contact with the plate p, so as to allow a free passage for the current, then, though the contact be broken for ten or twelve minutes, still, upon its renewal, only a feeble current will pass, not at all equal in force to what might be expected. Further, if P^{1} and P^{2} be connected by a metal wire, a powerful momentary current will pass from P^{2} to P^{1} through the acid, and therefore in the reverse direction to that produced by the action of the zinc in the arrangement; and after this has happened, the general current can pass through the whole of the system as at first, but by its passage again restores the plates P^{2} and P^{1} into the former opposing condition. This, generally, is the fact described by Ritter, Marianini, and De la Rive. It has great opposing influence on the action of a pile, especially if the latter consist of but a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternations,</b> and has to pass its current through many interpositions. It varies with the solution in which the interposed plates are immersed, with the intensity of the current, the strength of the pile, the time of action, and especially with accidental discharges of the plates by inadvertent contacts or reversions of the plates during experiments, and must be carefully watched in every endeavour to trace the source, strength, and variations of the voltaic current. Its effect was avoided in the experiments already described (1036. &c.), by making contact between the plates P^{1} and P^{2} before the effect dependent upon the state of the solution in contact with the zinc plate was observed, and by other precautions.|$|E

Tarui’s proof is carefully dissected to obtain an interesting relationship between the running time of the constructed counting machine and the different parameters of the original ATM: the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternation</b> blocks, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> nondeterministic steps, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deterministic steps...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique {{for the resolution}} of alternating disjunctive/conjunctive boolean equation systems. The technique {{can be used to}} solve various verification problems on finite-state concurrent systems, by encoding the problems as boolean equation systems and determining their local solutions. The main contribution of this paper is that a recent resolution technique from [13] for disjunctive/conjunctive boolean equation systems is extended to the more general disjunctive/conjunctive forms with alternation. Our technique has the time complexity O(m+n 2), where m is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternation</b> free variables occurring in the equation system and n the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> alternating variables. We found that many µ-calculus formulas with alternating fixed points occurring in the literature can be encoded as boolean equation systems of disjunctive/conjunctive forms.
