40|$|Leaflet shape {{change in}} each heart was {{quantified}} by fitting (as described in Appendix C) a best-fit plane to all anterior leaflet markers for <b>each</b> <b>frame</b> (f) {{in the three}} consecutive beats studied. The distance (Z) from each anterior leaflet marker (m) to this plane in <b>each</b> <b>frame</b> Z(f,m) was then obtained. A systolic average, Zavg(m), was then obtained for each leaflet marker using all frames from mitral valve closing (MVC) to opening (MVO) for all three beats. For <b>each</b> <b>frame,</b> and <b>each</b> marker, the difference Z(f,m) -Zavg(m) was then computed and squared.

5000|$|Because {{interframe}} compression copies {{data from}} one frame to another, if the original frame is simply cut out (or lost in transmission), the following frames cannot be reconstructed properly. Some video formats, such as DV, compress <b>each</b> <b>frame</b> independently using intraframe compression. Making 'cuts' in intraframe-compressed video {{is almost as}} easy as editing uncompressed video: one finds the beginning and ending of <b>each</b> <b>frame,</b> and simply copies bit-for-bit <b>each</b> <b>frame</b> that one wants to keep, and discards the frames one doesn't want. Another difference between intraframe and interframe compression is that, with intraframe systems, <b>each</b> <b>frame</b> uses a similar amount of data. In most interframe systems, certain frames (such as [...] "I frames" [...] in MPEG-2) aren't allowed to copy data from other frames, so they require much more data than other frames nearby.|$|R

50|$|Something {{that makes}} nine-pin bowling {{different}} from ten-pin bowling {{is that the}} bowlers {{do not have to}} bowl in the same order in <b>each</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>Each</b> team can designate a bowler to “Captain” each game. This Captain has complete discretion in determining the bowling order in <b>each</b> <b>frame.</b> These decisions are made on-the-fly: If the remaining pins are on the left side, and there is a remaining bowler who is better than the rest on left side pins, the Captain will send that bowler. This gives the Captain the flexibility to help maximize the team’s score. However, each bowler must roll two balls in <b>each</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
