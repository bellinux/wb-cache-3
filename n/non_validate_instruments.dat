30|$|IVR {{reduces the}} need for clinicians to engage in {{administrative}} tasks and check that data is collected, although data ultimately has to be interpreted and managed by clinicians. IVR uses <b>validated</b> <b>instruments</b> but in other areas, such as the diagnostic process, clinicians are still needed. When using <b>validated</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{it is important that}} questions are asked according to the manual, i.e. that data is not biased by the interviewer. IVR manages closed-response alternatives, including multiple-response options, e.g. patient medication, but can also administer qualitative, open questions by using recordings. Like postal surveys, IVR has limited possibilities for additional follow-up questions as each question is pre-programmed, but both methods allow additional comments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to adapt and analyze the {{validity}} and reliability of the HR Competencies Scale among HR professionals in the Malaysian context. A questionnaire survey was carried out to acquire data from 154 HR professionals. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) showed a three-factor structure: Knowledge of Business, HR Functional Expertise and Managing Change. The instrument generates a high degree of confidence in the scale’s validity and reliability. This paper fulfils an identified need for the development of an empirically <b>validated</b> <b>instrument</b> to measure HR Competencies. This reliable and <b>validated</b> <b>instrument</b> enables and facilitates future studies in the HR competencies research stream.

30|$|Given the {{complexity}} {{associated with the}} assessment of bullying, {{and the lack of}} <b>validated</b> <b>instruments</b> to evaluate this construct, the use of IRT to investigate the construct validity of both scales of the QBO, define the adequate number of response categories, and verify item discriminating power and severity was an important contribution to the literature. A recent review of 25 Brazilian articles found that in most studies involving the assessment of bullying, this phenomenon is identified using measures developed by the researchers themselves or with unknown validity for the Brazilian populations. The authors concluded that the absence of <b>validated</b> <b>instruments</b> for this purpose is a significant methodological limitation (Alckmin-Carvalho, et al., 2014). The use of IRT to determine construct validity is useful to assess latent traits, such as anxiety level, stress, and quality of life, which correlate with different items in an assessment measure. A relationship is expected between the presence of a particular condition and certain latent traits (Andrade, et al., 2000; Sartes & Souza-Formigoni, 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Primary {{healthcare}} {{in developed}} countries is undergoing important reforms, and these require evaluation strategies to assess how well the population's expectations are being met. Although numerous instruments are available to evaluate primary healthcare (PHC) from the patient perspective, they do not all measure the same range of constructs. To analyze {{the extent to which}} important PHC attributes are covered in <b>validated</b> <b>instruments</b> measuring quality of care from the patient perspective. Method We systematically identified <b>validated</b> <b>instruments</b> from the literature and by consulting experts. Using a Delphi consensus-building process, Canadian PHC experts identified and operationally defined 24 important PHC attributes. One team member mapped instrument subscales to these operational definitions; this mapping was then independently validated by members of the research team and conflicts were resolved by the PHC experts. Results Of the 24 operational definitions, 13 were evaluated as being best measured by patients, 10 by providers, three by administrative databases and one by chart audits (some being best measured by more than one source). Our search retained 17 measurement tools containing 118 subscales. After eliminating redundancies, we mapped 13 unique measurement tools to the PHC attributes. Accessibility, relational continuity, interpersonal communication, management continuity, respectfulness and technical quality of clinical care were the attributes widely covered by available instruments. Advocacy, management of clinical information, comprehensiveness of services, cultural sensitivity, family-centred care, whole-person care and equity were poorly covered. Conclusions <b>Validated</b> <b>instruments</b> to evaluate PHC quality from the patient perspective leave many important attributes of PHC uncovered. A complete assessment of PHC quality will require adjusting existing tools and/or developing new instruments. </p...|$|R
