25|$|A partial {{meltdown}} {{was reported}} to be possible at unit 3. At 13:00 JST reactors 1 and 3 are vented to release overpressure and then re-filled with water and boric acid for cooling, and to inhibit further nuclear reactions. Unit 2 was possibly suffering a lower than <b>normal</b> <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> but was thought to be stable; although pressure inside the containment vessel was high. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency announced that it was rating the situation at unit 1 as level 4 (an accident with local consequences) on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.|$|E
500|$|The entire lake has {{an average}} depth of [...] {{and a maximum}} depth of [...] at a <b>normal</b> <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> The deepest part of the lake is at its north end, while the south half is {{comparatively}} shallow. Hart Lake not only gets the overflow from Crump Lake, but also receives {{a steady flow of}} fresh water from Honey Creek. [...] As a result, Hart Lake has the most stable water level within the Warner Lakes chain. [...] Any outflow during high water [...] drains into Anderson Lake, just north of Hart Lake.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{construction}} {{began in}} February 1938 and included the excavation of over [...] {{of earth and}} rock. Workers also constructed the first cofferdam {{on the east side}} of the river and left it in place until the arches were above the <b>normal</b> <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Once this was achieved, workers removed the east cofferdam and constructed another on the west side of the river to divert water from the location of the future power plant. On December 30, 1938, Massman began the first concrete pour. Pouring was conducting 24-hours a day for 20 months, totaling [...] A total of 23.9 million pounds of steel and iron were placed into the dam's structure to reinforce it. Major works on the dam were complete on March 21, 1940 and the lake was filled by the end of that year's summer. The dam's power plant, with four original hydroelectric generators, began commercial operation in 1941. The dam was finished in 26 months, ahead of schedule. Much of this was attributed to eastern Oklahoma having its 18 driest months on record during construction which alleviated obstacles from flooding. The federal government took control of the dam in November 1941 to aid in the World War II effort and returned it to the GRDA in 1946.|$|E

2500|$|Due to its {{proximity}} to the river Esk and its tributaries, flooding {{has long been a}} problem for some of the lower lying houses in the village. Marks carved into the side wall of the Methodist chapel show the heights of floods in the past. At the lowest level, the floods in November 2000 stand just short of the floods in July 1840. However, these were low compared to major flooding on 23 July 1930 when the Methodist chapel stood more than a metre under water, even though the chapel itself stands approximately [...] above the <b>normal</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> of the river. This same flood caused the collapse of bridges over the river at Glaisdale, Egton and Sleights, further down the valley.|$|E

2500|$|After resting {{for several}} hours at Fairfax Court House, Stuart moved on to Dranesville, Virginia, where Fitzhugh Lee's brigade rejoined him. Stuart then decided to cross the Potomac River that night at Rowser's Ford. Because of the higher than <b>normal</b> <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> the Confederate {{crossing}} was not completed until 3:00a.m. on June 28. From Union prisoners captured at the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal {{just north of the}} river, Stuart learned that Hooker had been at Poolesville, Maryland [...] to the west on the previous day and that the Army of the Potomac was headed north toward Frederick, Maryland. From this intelligence, Stuart realized he should attempt to join Ewell as soon as possible. Stuart nonetheless delayed his ride to capture a Union Army wagon train near Rockville, Maryland and to take additional prisoners, including a few fugitives from the 11th New York Cavalry. He proceeded another [...] to Brookeville, Maryland that day.|$|E
