25|$|The {{police are}} ineffective, {{primarily}} because of inadequate resources. Basic supplies such as vehicle fuel, radios, uniforms, handcuffs, batons, and badges are scarce. Patrols are sporadic, and emergency response time in <b>Niamey</b> can take 45 minutes. Police training is minimal, and only specialized police units had basic weapons-handling skills. Corruption remains pervasive. Citizens complain that security forces do not adequately police border regions. The gendarmerie is responsible for investigation of police abuse; however, impunity is often a problem.|$|E

25|$|On 1 August, Gadabeji, Niger {{suffered}} 35°C {{heat and}} drought. On 1 August, just under 12,000,000 people in Niger (approximately 80% of the nation's entire population) faced a food supply crisis {{and possibly even}} famine conditions. The Tillabéri region is 30km from the capital, <b>Niamey,</b> {{on the road to}} the Saharan town of Timbuktu. Unusually severe rainfall destroyed and then rotted the farmers' crops. Basic food stuffs like maize, millet and sorghum were running out in West Africa's Sahel. Both Chad and northern Nigeria have a similar, but less severe problem.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>Niamey's</b> {{population}} has grown steadily since independence, the droughts {{of the early}} 1970s and 1980s, along with the economic crisis of the early 1980s, have propelled an exodus of rural inhabitants to Niger's largest city. Under the military government of General Seyni Kountché, there were strict controls on residency, and the government would regularly round up and [...] "deport" [...] those without permits back to their villages. The growing freedoms of the late 1980s and 1990s, along with the Tuareg Rebellion of 1990s and famine in the 2000s, have reinforced the process of immigration, with large informal settlements appearing {{on the outskirts of}} the cities. Noticeable in the city's centre since the 1980s are groups of poor, young, or handicapped beggars.Within the richer or more trafficked neighbourhoods, these beggars have in fact formed a well-regulated hierarchical system in which beggars garner sadaka according to cultural and religious norms.|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of monocrystalline solar module towards dust accumulation and cloud cover is investigated from May to August 2015 for <b>Niamey’s</b> environment. Two solar modules {{with the same}} characteristics {{have been used to}} assess the impacts of the dust on the solar PV module. One of the modules is being cleaned every morning and the second one was used for monitoring the effect of dust accumulation onto the surface of the unclean module for May and June. Results show that dust accumulation has a great effect on decreasing the daily energy yield of the unclean module. But this effect is a long-term effect. For the cloud cover, the effect is immediate. It was estimated that exposing the module into the environment in 23 days in June 2015 has reduced the daily energy yield by 15. 29 %. This limitation makes solar PV an unreliable source of power for remote devices and thus strongly suggests the challenges of cleaning the module’s surface regularly...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Periportal {{fibrosis}} is {{the major}} pathological consequence of the Schistosoma mansoni infection. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy of serum markers and to construct an index to assess fibrosis. METHODS Patients (n= 116) with schistosomiasis were evaluated by ultrasound scan and measurements of serum levels of aminotransferases, γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, hyaluronic acid, cytokines and platelets. Ultrasound images were {{used to evaluate the}} fibrosis using <b>Niamey's</b> classification and identified 19 patients without periportal fibrosis (patterns A and B), 48 with mild to moderate fibrosis (C and D) and 49 with advanced fibrosis (E and F). RESULTS Using multivariate analysis, a model was created, which involved alkaline phosphatase and platelets and could separate patients with different patterns of fibrosis. This index showed a better performance in separating patients without fibrosis from with advanced periportal fibrosis. The biological index showed an area under the ROC curve of 1. 000. Using values below the lowest or above the highest cut-off point, {{the presence or absence of}} advanced fibrosis could be predicted in all patients. CONCLUSION The index constructed can be used to separate patients with different patterns of periportal fibrosis, specially to predict advanced fibrosis in schistosomiasis patients...|$|R
25|$|On Sunday 14 December 2008, a Canadian UN {{official}} was kidnapped while traveling {{on a highway}} just 40km north of <b>Niamey,</b> well away from any previous rebel attacks. The MNJ denied involvement, but a statement attributed to Ag Boula took responsibility for the kidnapping {{in the name of}} the FFR. Mohamed Awtchiki Kriska, on the other hand, denied that the FFR was responsible. Previous kidnappings acknowledged by the MNJ in the conflict—those of a Chinese mining executive in 2007, a Nigerien parliamentarian and Red Cross head, a Nigerien Prefect, and four Areva officials, all in 2008—were all quickly resolved.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 {{peace in}} Mali {{was seen as}} a model for a February civil society conference in <b>Niamey.</b> In March 2009 a {{dramatic}} split of much of the MNJ leadership resulted in the former MNJ head fleeing to Libya, who aided delivering Nigerien Armed Forces prisoners home. The new Nigerien Patriotic Front (FPN), which contained much of the MNJ's fighters and leadership, called for a negotiated peace. They, along with an earlier splinter, entered into four-party talks with the Nigerien government under Libyan auspices from March to June 2009. All sides pledged an immediate ceasefire in May 2009, while pursuing talks for a permanent peace and an amnesty for all former rebels.|$|E
25|$|Unrest in Niger {{following}} {{the publication of}} the post-attack issue of Charlie Hebdo resulted in ten deaths, dozens injured, and at least 45 churches were burned down. The Guardian reported seven churches burned in <b>Niamey</b> alone. Churches were also reported to be on fire in eastern Maradi and Goure. There were violent demonstrations in Karachi in Pakistan, where Asif Hassan, a photographer working for the Agence France-Presse, was seriously injured by a shot to the chest. In Algiers and Jordan, protesters clashed with police, and there were peaceful demonstrations in Khartoum, Sudan, Russia, Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania. In the week after the shooting, 54 anti-Muslim incidents were reported in France. These included 21 reports of shootings and grenade-throwing at mosques and other Islamic centres and 33 cases of threats and insults.|$|E

2500|$|While Kaka {{received}} the longest imprisonment for a journalist {{since the beginning}} of the rebellion, several other cases have come to the attention of the international media. French journalists Thomas Dandois and Pierre Creisson were detained in Agadez for a month in 2007 by Nigerien military forces before being released. The editor of <b>Niamey's</b> L'Evénement weekly was arrested on 30 July 2008 and charged with [...] "divulging a defence secret" [...] after reporting that an army officer had been linked to an arms cache that was discovered in the capital. The government press regulation body, the High Council for Communication (CSC), closed Niamey-based TV and radio station Dounia TV for one month in August 2008, and closed Sahara FM, the main radio station in Agadez, for an indefinite period on 22 April 2008 for broadcasting interviews with people who had claimed they were the victims of abuses by government troops.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{remains a}} serious risk to healthcare workers (HCWs) in endemic developing countries {{owing to the}} strong prevalence of HBV in the general and hospital populations, and to {{the high rate of}} occupational blood exposure. Routine HBV vaccination programs targeted to high-risk groups and especially to HCWs are generally considered as a key element of prevention strategies. However, the high rate of natural immunization among adults in such countries where most infections occur perinatally or during early childhood must be taken into account. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cross sectional study in 207 personnel of 4 occupational groups (medical, paramedical, cleaning staff, and administrative) in <b>Niamey's</b> National Hospital, Niger, in order to assess the prevalence of HBV markers, to evaluate susceptibility to HBV infection, and to identify personnel who might benefit from vaccination. The proportion of those who declared a history of occupational blood exposure ranged from 18. 9 % in the administrative staff to 46. 9 % in paramedical staff. Only 7. 2 % had a history of vaccination against HBV with at least 3 injections. Ninety two percent were anti-HBc positive. When we focused on 170 HCWs, only 12 (7. 1 %) showed no biological HBV contact. Twenty six were HBsAg positive (15, 3 %; 95 % confidence interval: 9. 9 %- 20. 7 %) of whom 8 (32 %) had a viral load > 2000 IU/ml. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The very small proportion of HCWs susceptible to HBV infection in our study and other studies suggests that in a global approach to prevent occupational infection by bloodborne pathogens, a universal hepatitis B vaccination of HCWs is not priority in these settings. The greatest impact on the risk will most likely be achieved by focusing efforts on primary prevention strategies to reduce occupational blood exposure. HBV screening in HCWs and treatment of those with chronic HBV infection should be however considered...|$|R
