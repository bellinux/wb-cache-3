25|$|Contemporary Persian {{literary}} criticism reached its maturity after Sadeq Hedayat, Ebrahim Golestan, Houshang Golshiri, Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub and Shahrokh Meskoob. Among these figures, Zarrinkoub held academic positions {{and had a}} reputation <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> the intelligentsia but also in academia. Besides his {{significant contribution to the}} maturity of Persian language and literature, Zarrinkoub boosted comparative literature and Persian {{literary criticism}}. Zarrinkoub's Serr e Ney is a critical and comparative analysis of Rumi's Masnavi. In turn, Shahrokh Meskoob worked on Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, using the principles of modern literary criticism.|$|E

The book’s original {{approach to the}} problems of definition of art, organic wholes, interpretation, popular art, and the ethics of taste brought him international fame as the book was translated into 14 languages and several editions were published. Shusterman’s position was further strengthened by three subsequent publications: Practicing Philosophy in 1997, Performing Live in 2000, and Surface and Depth in 2002; in which he continued the pragmatist tradition, raising significant interest, provoking numerous critiques and stimulating debates <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> professional philosophers, but in the areas of literary and cultural studies as well.|$|E

Alessandro Farnese was still very influential, and had adherents <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> the creatures of his grandfather Paul III.

25|$|Polyandry is {{believed}} to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources, as it {{is believed}} to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> poor families, but also the elite. For example, in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance (the disinheriting of most siblings, many of whom went on to become celibate monks and priests).|$|E
25|$|The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a {{literary}} genre {{in which a}} heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an angelic interpreter, and an emphasis on end-time events. Apocalypses were common from 300 BCE to 100 CE, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> Jews and Christians, but Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians. Daniel, the book's hero, is a representative apocalyptic seer, {{the recipient of the}} divine revelation. He refused to learn the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and thus surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge. The book is also an eschatology, meaning a divine revelation concerning the end of the present age, a moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom.|$|E

Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't make it that far, so practically every one got something for racing, {{even if it was}} just a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E

25|$|Barks's stories (whether humorous adventures or {{domestic}} comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises {{of everyday life}} with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster's Prince Valiant.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry is {{believed}} to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources. It {{is believed}} to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> peasant families but also among the elite families. For example, polyandry in the Himalayan mountains is related to the scarcity of land. The marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In contrast, very poor persons not owning land were less likely to practice polyandry in Buddhist Ladakh and Zanskar. In Europe, the splitting up of land was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance. For example, disinheriting most siblings where many of whom then became celibate monks and priests.|$|E
25|$|The {{policies}} of the Díaz government caused resentment <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>among</b> the Yaquis, but also throughout the country. One of the preludes to the Mexican Revolution was the 1906 Cananea miner's strike. Approximately 2,000 strikers sought negotiations with American mine owner William Greene, {{but he refused to}} meet with them. The strike quickly turned violent when the miners tried {{to take control of the}} mine and gunfire was exchanged. Greene requested help from federal troops, but when it was obvious they could not arrive in time, he appealed to the governments of Arizona and Sonora to allow Arizona volunteers to assist him. This increased the scale of the violence. When Mexican federal troops arrived two days later, they put everything to a brutal end, with the suspected leaders of the strike executed. The heavy-handed way in which Díaz had handled the strike made resentment against Diaz grow, with more strikes beginning in other areas.|$|E
