5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were {{repeated}} by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, so there was <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do {{in an attempt to}} make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
5000|$|An organic minute {{is defined}} as the natural state of which {{telecommunications}} relay calls are processed between caller and called parties through Communications Assistant (relay agent and video interpreter) that are in conversation mode; that is, <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> encourage unnecessary relay minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{private company}} {{received}} as much raw {{water from the}} asset holding company as it needed for free. While higher efficiency was an objective of the privatization, the private operator had <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> improve operating efficiency by reducing water losses because of the free availability of water.|$|R
30|$|The {{first part}} of the {{definition}} states that <b>no</b> bettor has <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> deviate in Step 2, even if the bookmakers did. The second part states that <b>no</b> bookmaker has <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> deviate in Step 1.|$|R
5|$|The crusaders' {{march through}} Anatolia was {{thereafter}} unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything {{he left behind}} in his army's flight. It {{was the middle of}} summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died. Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the Cilician Gates, Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the Euphrates; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by Thoros of Edessa, a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his Greek Orthodox religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated. Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the County of Edessa, the first of the crusader states.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that under sales tax, the seller has <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> disbelieve a purchaser who says {{it is not a}} final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive to deduct input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding an invoice quoting the VAT paid on the purchase, and indicating the VAT registration number of the supplier.|$|E
25|$|Some buyers award {{producers}} {{for having}} the lowest SCC {{but this does not}} also lead to an increased payment for the milk quality, so there is <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> strive for anything more than meeting the basic grade A SCC rating.|$|E
50|$|NCLB {{pressures}} {{schools to}} guarantee that nearly all students meet the minimum skill levels (set by each state) in reading, writing, and arithmetic—but requires nothing beyond these minima. It provides <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> improve student achievement beyond the bare minimum. Programs not essential for achieving mandated minimum skills are neglected or canceled by those districts.|$|R

30|$|BLE is {{the state}} where all players’ current {{cooperative}} degrees are above the pre-defined minimum bound (Γ). Therefore, the BLE is a strategy profile that approximately satisfies the condition of perfect equilibrium (Γ[*]=  1). In the BLE, players have <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> deviate given their beliefs {{about the consequences of}} deviating. These beliefs are consistent with the information obtained from the actual equilibrium play of all players.|$|R
25|$|Since these colonies {{were created}} {{with the intent}} to extract resources, colonial powers has <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> invest in {{institutions}} or infrastructure that did not support their immediate goals of exploitation. Therefore, they established authoritarian regimes in these colonies, which had no limits on state power.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have also}} {{questioned}} why Beale would have bothered writing three different ciphertexts (with {{at least two}} keys, if not ciphers) for what is essentially a single message in the first place, particularly {{if he wanted to}} ensure that the next of kin received their share (as it is, with the treasure described, there is <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> decode the third cipher).|$|E
25|$|The NMP scheme {{has been}} criticized {{on the grounds that}} it is undemocratic, and that unelected NMPs have <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> express the electorate's views in Parliament. It has also been claimed that the scheme {{reinforces}} the ruling People's Action Party's technocratic and elitist view of politics. On the other hand, it is said that NMPs have placed pressure on PAP MPs to be more competent in Parliament.|$|E
50|$|Workers {{from the}} above {{countries}} were required to register on the WRS scheme within a month of joining a new employer. However, there were <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> do this: registration took time and money, immigrants were able to work (illegally) without it, and no immigrant has ever been prosecuted for not having registered on the scheme. Consequently, immigration data from the WRS was indicative at best.|$|R

25|$|Laffer {{assumes that}} the {{government}} would collect no income tax at a 100% tax rate because there would be <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> earn income. However, in some theoretical models, the Laffer curve can slope continuously upwards all the way to 100%. Additionally, the Laffer curve depends on the assumption that tax revenue is used to provide a public good that is separable in utility and separate from labor supply, which may not be true in practice.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, it {{was argued}} by Chiam See Tong, the Leader of the Opposition, that since Singapore {{practices}} representative democracy, NMPs are useless {{to the people}} as, being unelected, they have <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> present their views to Parliament. In other words, one should not enjoy the privilege of representing views without bearing the responsibility of serving those whom one represents. The Opposition perceived the scheme as a plan {{to make it look}} unnecessary. A similar point has been made by an academic, Chua Beng Huat, who has argued that the NMP scheme co-opts more moderate dissenting voices and is thus an attempt to de-legitimize the need for more aggressive opposition.|$|E
25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E

40|$|We {{relax the}} {{standard}} assumption in the strategic trade policy literature that governments possess complete {{information about the}} economy. Assuming instead that governments must obtain information from firms, we examine firms' <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> disclose information to the governments in the Brander-Spencer setting. With quantity competition, we find firms disclosing both demand and cost information, thereby justifying the literature's omniscient-government assumption. With price competition, however, firms have <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> disclose demand or cost information, so governments remain uninformed. Further, with quantity competition and unknown demand, governments are caught in an informational prisoner's dilemma. ...|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{the problem}} of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to {{resources}} leads to <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve lose out compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of over-exploitation is not helped {{by the fact that the}} efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant that stocks were put under more pressure. All these factors contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} boom {{spurred on by}} the California Gold Rush that had brought on {{the era of the}} clipper ships had turned to bust. All the secrets of building lofty clippers had been discovered and there were too many of them in existence. The dropping freight rates now gave <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> build any more. The San Francisco market was so saturated that many a disgusted ship captain dumped unwanted cargo overboard in the bay before sailing on to other ports. The diary of Robert Underhill, which recorded his 1856 travels on the Sweepstakes, revealed that Westervelt was also traveling on this voyage to San Francisco and the Orient. Underhill's entries made clear that Westervelt recognized the economic situation facing the port of New York and was seeking other possible venues for the family business.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of papers in the {{economics}} literature suggest that carbon taxes should be preferred to carbon trading (Carbon Trust, 2009). Counter-arguments to this are usually based on the possible preference that politicians may have for emissions trading compared with taxes (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). One of these is that emission permits can be freely distributed to polluting industries, rather than the revenues going to the government. In comparison, industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from a carbon tax. It is therefore argued that with emissions trading, polluters {{have an incentive to}} cut emissions, but if they are exempted from a carbon tax, they have <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> cut emissions (Smith, 2008, pp.56–57). On the other hand, freely distributing emission permits could potentially lead to corrupt behaviour (World Bank, 2010, p.268).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the VA disability benefits program is [...] "countertherapeutic" [...] because it provides <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> overcome symptoms and problems caused by the disorder, and, in fact rewards veterans for staying sick, while other researchers take issue with this assertion. In a similar vein, a military scholar, who lost both legs during combat operations in Iraq, suggests that current VA disability benefits policy inculcates in veterans a lack of self-efficacy and fosters dependency.|$|R

25|$|Work on a {{successor}} for the venerable G3 rifle had been ongoing in Germany {{since the second}} half of the 1970s. These efforts resulted in the innovative 4.73mm G11 assault rifle (developed jointly by a group of companies led by H), that used caseless ammunition (designed by the Dynamit Nobel company). It had been predicted that this weapon would eventually replace the G3, therefore further development of H's series of firearms chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been halted. Heckler & Koch, having <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> pursue a new 5.56mm weapon system, was content with the export-oriented HK33 and G41 rifles. However, the G11 program came to an abrupt end when the Bundeswehr cancelled its procurement due to defence budget cuts after the unification of East and West Germany and H was acquired in 1991 by British Aerospace's Royal Ordnance division (known today as BAE Systems).|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Ryan Green, {{speaking}} for his team, {{commented that the}} game has only sold about 14,000 copies, based on Steam Spy data, and {{they have yet to}} recover their development funds for the game. Ryan noted that many Let's Play videos, gathering more than a million views, of That Dragon, Cancer had simply played through the game without commenting on it or providing viewers with links and information about the game, giving viewers <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> purchase the title once they had seen it in its entirety. Numinous Games used YouTube's ContentID system to flag and take down some of these videos, leading some players to complain and which Ryan admitted was not the best approach towards addressing the issue. Ryan felt that they would be satisfied if these viewers had left small tips on Numinous Games' website in lieu of purchasing the game, so that Numinous could continue to develop more titles.|$|E
25|$|It {{took him}} {{four years to}} reach the second highest jūryō {{division}} in March 1983, aged 19, {{the same time as}} fellow Tokachi district rival Ōnokuni entered the top division. By this time his stablemate Chiyonofuji had been promoted to yokozuna. Hokutoumi made his debut in the top makuuchi division in September 1983. In March 1986 at sekiwake rank he won his first yūshō or tournament title with a record of thirteen wins and two losses. Despite this impressive result he was not immediately promoted to the second highest ōzeki rank as he had not done particularly well in the previous two tournaments, only managing 30 wins in the most recent three tournaments when 33 is generally required. It also did not help his cause that there were already five ōzeki, leaving the Sumo Association with <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> loosen the promotion criteria. However, he carried on producing excellent results with an 11–4 in May, and then went 12–3 in July, securing his promotion for the September tournament. Futahaguro was promoted to yokozuna at the same time.|$|E
40|$|We compare {{cohabiting}} {{couples to}} roommates {{to see if}} couples specialize by allocating the time of one person to the labor market {{and the other to}} the home. Roommates are an interesting comparison group. Like couples, they live together. Unlike couples, they have <b>no</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> specialize. We study same-sex couples because, by definition, they are unable to specialize by gender. All couples, however, have <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> pool household resources. We find that, with respect to earnings, couples specialize and roommates do not. With respect to hours worked, however, same-sex couples are indistinguishable from male and female roommates. ...|$|R

Further, the equilibrium exhibits an informational prisoner's dilemma with demand uncertainty, but not with cost uncertainty.
