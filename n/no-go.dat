5|$|British {{journalist}} David Rose {{writes that}} by 1976 the Farm was already {{seen as a}} sink estate, and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements. Sir Kenneth Newman, Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1982 to 1987, regarded the estate as one of London's symbolic locations, or potential <b>no-go</b> areas, along with Railton Road in Brixton, All Saints Road in Notting Hill, the Notting Hill Carnival, and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden. The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticised the police for having adopted this attitude.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{began to}} re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Both were {{supported}} {{by the people of}} the Free Derry area. Meanwhile, relations between the British Army and the nationalist community, which were initially good, deteriorated. In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971, and in response, barricades went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan. This time, Free Derry was a <b>no-go</b> area, defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA. From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned the barricades, and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police.|$|E
25|$|Glodwick, an area south-central to Oldham {{town had}} become {{increasingly}} ethnically polarised. The area which is predominantly home {{to people of}} Pakistani origin had been for many years a <b>no-go</b> area for local white people for fear of possible attacks, a problem highlighted by a Today report on BBC radio. Although this label was challenged by community leaders as a purely minority view, this negative reputation still held {{at least five years}} after the original disturbances. Similarly, areas of predominantly and polarised white inhabited areas had the same perception of <b>no-go</b> to members of the Asian community. This was increasing tensions, and had been reported by the BBC North West Tonight programme, by social-affairs reporter Dave Guest.|$|E

Witnesses of the strike denied Hezbollah fighters were present near the compound at the time Israel shelled it.|$|E
25|$|On 28 March 2012 mayor Toshitsuna Watanabe of {{the town}} Okuma said during {{a meeting of the}} {{municipal}} assembly held at its temporary town office in Aizuwakamatsu that he will ask the whole town to be designated as <b>no-go</b> area, where it is unlikely that residents will be able to return in any foreseeable future, because he did not want the community {{of the town}} divided. Likewise the town Futaba considered refusing any re-designation of the evacuation zones in the town.|$|E
25|$|A peace {{agreement}} was reached in 2001, leading to a roadmap {{to the creation of}} an Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG). Yet Ona refused to play any part in the peace process, and, with a small minority of fighters, broke away from the BRA. Throughout the decade, he continued to resist overtures to participate in the new government, occupying an area around the mine which remained a <b>no-go</b> zone and declaring himself 'king' of Bougainville before dying of malaria in 2005. Elections for the first ABG were held in May and June 2005 with Joseph Kabui elected President.|$|E
25|$|Niger {{has had a}} {{tradition}} of lively press opposition, punctuated by bouts of government repression. From 1999 to 2007, the independent press, especially radio has flourished. With {{the advent of the}} Second Tuareg Rebellion in 2007, the government has begun to prosecute under emergency powers, those foreign and domestic press who are accused of contact with rebel leaders, and have expelled members of the foreign press from the country. The north, under a state of emergency, has become a <b>no-go</b> zone for foreign press, and the independent Radio Agadez in the north has been closed by the government.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} was {{preceded by}} weeks of intense resistance activity. Coordinated with the massive bombardments of the Transportation Plan {{and supported by the}} SOE and the OSS, partisans systematically sabotaged railway lines, destroyed bridges, cut German supply lines, and provided general intelligence to the allied forces. The constant harassment took its toll on the German troops. Large remote areas were <b>no-go</b> zones for them and free zones for the maquisards, so-called after the maquis shrubland that provided ideal terrain for guerrilla warfare. For instance, a large number of German units were required to clear the maquis du Vercors, which they eventually succeeded with, but this and numerous other actions behind German lines contributed to a much faster advance following the Provence landings than the Allied leadership had anticipated.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 2012 the {{evacuation}} {{orders for the}} villages Kawauchi and Tamura were lifted, on 15 April the people of Minamisoma were {{able to return to}} their homes. A ceremony was held for police and volunteers, who were to patrol the borders of the <b>no-go</b> areas. The checkpoints 20 kilometers from the reactors were moved to about 10 kilometers. Three new evacuation zones were planned by the government in areas within 11 villages and towns according to radiation levels. The small city of Minamisoma was divided into 3 zones, in the first people were free to go in and out, in the second access is limited, the third area all visiting is forbidden. Still scattered with ruins, and with no electricity and running water, the city was a rather uninhabitable place for a population formed by mostly elderly people. Schools and hospitals remained closed.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 2011 the Japanese {{government}} {{took up the}} plan to increase the 30 members of {{the staff at the}} Japanese embassy in Kiev, Ukraine to 36. For the first time two nuclear experts and three interpreters will be stationed here. In order to learn from the experience of this country with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. In this way Japan hoped to build on good relations between the two countries, also because growing numbers of Japanese officials were visiting Ukraine at that moment. The new staff was expected to gather information about handling a <b>no-go</b> zone, the removal of radioactive materials, and how to deal with internal exposure to radiation. People affected by the Chernobyl disaster would also be questioned. The embassy was equipped with dosimeters and protection outfits for field studies. The extra costs of the additional embassy staff was estimated at 200 million yen.|$|E
25|$|The SSRT test is similar, {{except that}} the 'stop' signal is {{presented}} after the 'go' signal. This small modification increases the difficulty of inhibiting the 'go' response, because the participant has typically already initiated the 'go' response {{by the time the}} 'stop' signal is presented. The participant is instructed to respond as fast as possible to the 'go' signal while maintaining the highest possible inhibition accuracy (on <b>no-go</b> trials). During the task, the time at which the 'stop' signal is presented (the stop signal delay or SSD) is dynamically adjusted to match the time after the 'go' signal at which the participant is just able/unable to inhibit their 'go' response. If the participant fails to inhibit their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly closer to the original 'go' signal, and if the participant successfully inhibits their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly ahead in time. The SSRT is thus measured as the average 'go' response time minus the average 'stop' signal presentation time (SSD).|$|E
25|$|The Tuareg Rebellion of 2007–2009 was an {{insurgency}} {{that began in}} February 2007 amongst elements of the Tuareg {{people living in the}} Sahara desert regions of northern Mali and Niger. It is {{one of a series of}} insurgencies by formerly nomadic Tuareg populations, which had last appeared in the mid-1990s, and date back at least to 1916. Populations dispersed to Algeria and Libya, as well as to the south of Niger and Mali in the 1990s returned only in the late 1990s. Former fighters were to be integrated into national militaries, but the process has been slow and caused increased resentment. Malian Tuaregs had conducted some raids in 2005–2006, which ended in a renewed peace agreement. Fighting in both nations was carried on largely in parallel, but not in concert. While fighting was mostly confined to guerrilla attacks and army counterattacks, large portions of the desert north of each nation were <b>no-go</b> zones for the military and civilians fled to regional capitals like Kidal Mali and Agadez Niger. Fighting was largely contained within Mali's Kidal Region and Niger's Agadez Region. Algeria helped negotiate an August 2008 Malian peace deal, which was broken by a rebel faction in December, crushed by the Malian military and wholescale defections of rebels to the government. Niger saw heavy fighting and disruption of Uranium production in the mountainous north, before a Libyan backed peace deal, aided by a factional split among the rebels, brought a negotiated ceasefire and amnesty in May 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{increasing}} {{violence in}} Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that internment without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland, and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of republicans and nationalists {{were arrested in}} dawn raids. [...] In Derry, residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests, and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere; nevertheless leading figures including Seán Keenan and Johnnie White were interned. [...] In response, barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence. [...] Unlike its predecessors, this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence, both Official and Provisional. [...] It was defended by armed paramilitaries—a <b>no-go</b> area, one in which British security forces were unable to operate.|$|E
500|$|The Revolution Will Not Be Televised {{claims that}} state {{television}} was [...] "the only channel to which [...] had access", {{but does not}} mention that during the violence he requisitioned [...] "all radio and TV frequencies" [...] to broadcast his two-hour address. Private television circumvented the rules allowing this action by splitting the screen, showing Chávez's address {{on one side and}} footage of the violence on the other. Chávez subsequently took television stations RCTV and Venevisión off the air. The film's assertion that VTV was taken over by opposition [...] "plotters" [...] is also disputed; according to X-Ray of a Lie and Gunson, staff left willingly. Gunson further alleges that footage of VTV's signal being cut—mid-interview with a government legislator—was fabricated. Bartley and ÓBriain say they witnessed ministers' being unable to broadcast and that the International Federation of Journalists corroborated their claim that opposition forces took over VTV. The film also presents footage of armored vehicles around the palace, which Gunson says were there {{at the request of the}} president, not the opposition. He also challenges the film for presenting Chávez's supporters as [...] "invariably poor, brown-skinned, and cheerful" [...] and the opposition as [...] "rich, white, racist, and violent". He says that the opposition protests were multiracial and that armed government supporters [...] "made the center of Caracas a <b>no-go</b> area". Bartley and ÓBriain cite several commentators who uphold the claim that Chávez's supporters [...] "were broadly poor and dark-skinned and the opposition broadly white and middle class", including Gunson himself in an April 2002 article in The Christian Science Monitor. Gunson does agree that the film was right to point out that the private media [...] "behaved disgracefully" [...] by [...] "systematically [...] viewpoint from print, radio, and TV" [...] during the period of the coup.|$|E

2500|$|The Rhodesian army {{continued}} its [...] "mobile counter-offensive" [...] strategy of holding key positions ("vital asset ground") while carrying out raids into the <b>no-go</b> areas and into neighbouring countries. While often extraordinarily successful in inflicting heavy guerrilla casualties, such raids also on occasion {{failed to achieve}} their objectives. In April 1979 special forces carried out a raid on Joshua Nkomo's residence in Lusaka (Zambia) with the stated intention of assassinating him. Nkomo and his family left hastily {{a few hours before}} the raid – having clearly been warned that the raid was coming.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s {{the first}} council houses {{were built in}} the city, many of them in the Raffles suburb {{to the west of the}} city. Initially Raffles {{contained}} the most sought after housing in the city by council tenants. In the 1990s it became infamous with high crime rates and impoverished living standards. A report from April 1994 in The Independent on Sunday branded the estate a <b>no-go</b> area. One resident was reported to have said [...] "If you've got a problem in Raffles, get a shotgun". The estate was redeveloped in 2004 by replacing some housing.|$|E

Jindal later confirmed his meaning [...] "I knew that by speaking the truth we were going to make people upset." [...] When later asked by CNN to provide specific examples, Jindal declined. He later added that some Muslim immigrants are trying to [...] "colonize" [...] cities in Europe and [...] "overtake the culture", and that it could happen next in the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|The Rhodesian army {{continued}} its [...] "mobile counter-offensive" [...] strategy of holding key positions ("vital asset ground") while carrying out raids into the <b>no-go</b> areas and into neighbouring countries.

Nkomo and his family left hastily {{a few hours before}} the raid – having clearly been warned that the raid was coming. Rumours of treachery circulated within Rhodesia. It was variously suggested that the army command had been penetrated by British MI6 or that people in the Rhodesian establishment were positioning themselves for life after independence. The loyalty of the country's Central Intelligence Organisation became suspect.|$|E
2500|$|IRA {{activity}} {{also increased}} across Northern Ireland with thirty British soldiers being {{killed in the}} remaining months of 1971, {{in contrast to the}} ten soldiers killed during the pre-internment period of the year. Both the Official IRA and Provisional IRA had established <b>no-go</b> areas for the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Derry through the use of barricades. By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place to prevent access to what was known as Free Derry, 16 of them impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles. IRA members openly mounted roadblocks in front of the media, and daily clashes took place between nationalist youths and the British Army at a spot known as [...] "aggro corner". Due to rioting and damage to shops caused by incendiary devices, an estimated total of [...] worth of damage had been done to local businesses.|$|E
2500|$|Greenpeace sent {{radiology}} {{experts to}} {{the villages of}} Iitate and Tsushima in the Fukushima Prefecture.

[...] An official of the NSA said that high radioactivity levels detected by the NGO could not be considered reliable, although some members of Greenpeace stressed that their numbers corresponded in other areas. [...] The New York Times called the reporting by Greenpeace (with a well-known anti-nuclear position) a [...] "guarded endorsement to the radiation data published by the Japanese government", due to the general correspondence between the numbers. [...] Members of Greenpeace stressed that there has been distrust of the official data, and that their contention was not the radiation levels, but the action that was taken.|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{supported}} Trump's Republican {{presidential nomination}} in the Daily Mail during December: [...] "I hear cries {{that he is}} a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, [...] the two of us shouting naked at the rain. It's because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice". Hopkins defended his remarks that all Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. Trump thanked Hopkins for her support, calling her a [...] "respected journalist", although the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson among others, rejected his comments that there are 'no go' areas of London for non-Muslims. Hopkins asserted that Britain is in part [...] "radicalised" [...] and [...] "it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious". When asked by BBC's Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil in a December 2015 interview to name the [...] "swathes" [...] of Britain that are <b>no-go</b> areas for non-Muslims, Hopkins replied that she couldn't for [...] "legal reasons". When Neil pointed out there could be no legal problems with identifying an area she continued to refuse, saying only “I know those places exist".|$|E
2500|$|Further media {{attention}} in January 2017, centered around {{an article published}} by the Evening Standard titled: “SOAS students 'scared to wear the star of David and speak Hebrew’” The Evening Standard article reported on how a “Jewish student Avrahum Sanger, 22, of Brent Cross, who is studying at SOAS University of London, has accused the University of anti-Semitism.” Mr Sanger described to the Evening Standard how a Jewish student was told by a fellow student: “The Jews should have chosen Uganda.” and that the ‘SOAS Palestine Society’ was attempting “to define anti-Semitism, telling Jews what {{they are allowed to}} find offensive.” by wanting to hold discussions on “Decoupling Judaism and Zionism in Palestine Advocacy.”” The Evening Standard also said “A more critical student feels a Left-wing strain of thinking is too dominant. “Any opinions that challenge the Left are always thoroughly challenged by a large number of students. This can be very alienating.”” The report finished with Mr Sanger suggesting how the university could solve their anti-Semitic issues “Sanger wants the university and union to address this stigma, alongside making the campus more “tolerant” to Jewish students. “SOAS isn’t yet a <b>no-go</b> zone for Jewish students,” he says. “But it’s becoming increasing difficult as one to study here.”” ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{assumptions}} rose to mythical {{status in}} the town during the forty-year period between the first Asian migration and the Oldham Riots. Many Asians believed that areas such as Sholver, Abbeyhills, Limeside, and Fitton Hill were <b>no-go</b> areas for them to approach, and that the council was racist holding back the socio-economic development of Asians. [...] This was verified in the Ritchie report, where numerous instances of zones marked with whites-only graffiti were reported. The report notes, however, that no institutional decree to such an effect was issued. Many people of the white community believed that more council tax money was spent to serve Asian needs such as mosque building in substitution for providing for white needs, although over the previous six years, the majority of regeneration grants have gone into white areas; Westwood and Glodwick received £16 million in 1995/96, whereas Hathershaw and Fitton Hill - predominantly white areas - received £53 million. This myth was tagged as wholly untrue in The Ritchie Report. Some minority sects of the Asian community believed {{that the police were}} behind the instigation of the Oldham Riots, and some in the white community believed that the flag of England was being removed by councillors in favour of celebrating Asian cultural identity.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 April 2001, a mugging {{and attack}} upon 76-year-old white World War II veteran Walter Chamberlain by three Asian youths was amongst {{the first major}} provocations {{which led to the}} riots. Mr. Chamberlain was {{approached}} as he walked to his home after watching a local amateur rugby league match. He was mugged and badly beaten, receiving fractured bones in the face amongst other injuries. His battered face appeared {{on the front of the}} Manchester Evening News, and the story spread to all the major national newspapers. In the Mail on Sunday, his story was told under the headline 'Whites beware'. In the Mirror, his face appeared under the headline [...] "Beaten for being white: OAP, 76, attacked in Asian <b>no-go</b> area". Media pundits began to speculate on the apparent transformation of young Asian males - from the stereotype of hard-working boys, who respected their parents, to the new stereotype of angry, violent thugs. An Asian male (a Mr. Fokrul Islam) was ultimately charged for the crime of racially aggravated grievous bodily harm on 1 October 2001, some time after the riots. Walter Chamberlain and his family in an attempt to try to calm tensions in the borough stated at the time that the mugging was just that, and not at all racially motivated."It was a violent assault on an elderly man", said Mr. Chamberlain's son Steven. [...] "As a family we don't think it was a race issue at all." [...] Since this story was attributed to fuelling further hatred in the local communities race crimes against all sections of society are no longer reported as such for fear of further trouble.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{violence}} between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel {{is the result of}} fighting over cocaine supplies from South America. On the supply side, the increased pressures on Sinaloa kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, whose operations in Colombia in 2012 prompted his organization to grab larger shares of cocaine from Peru and Ecuador, threatened the supply-lines of Los Zetas, and triggered tit-for-tat attacks among both cartels. The Sinaloa cartel and Los Zetas are [...] "regional and cultural opposites," [...] because the Sinaloa organization has been moving drugs north from the ranch country parts in Mexico into the U.S. for generations, while Los Zetas are newer arrivals from the more urban eastern coast. In addition, Los Zetas is a transient cartel without real territory or a secure stream of income, while the Sinaloa Cartel has a lucrative cocaine trade and the control of smuggling routes and territories. But the former are heavily armed, while the latter's enforcement arm is weaker. The Sinaloa cartel uses tit-for-tat attacks as a way of bringing down the newcomers; for Los Zetas, it is about maintaining their violent reputation – the organization's most valued asset. Moreover, Los Zetas pose a bigger insurgency threat to the Mexican government than the older cartels in the country because of the brutality of their attacks against the security forces, their disregard for civilians' lives, and their dangerous habits that go beyond the [...] "unspoken codes of older traffickers." [...] The violent reputation of Los Zetas has made northeastern Mexico a <b>no-go</b> zone for many. Los Zetas, unlike the other traditional drug cartels, act like urban guerrillas; a police chief in Mexico explained how the Zetas would make anonymous phone calls to get the police out in the streets, block the road where the police were, and then open fire from all sides. In addition, the goal of Los Zetas differs greatly from other drug trafficking organizations in Mexico. Other cartels focus primarily in drug producing and drug trafficking, while Los Zetas often move into urban areas to diversify their criminal agenda and carry out a number of crimes. Their presence represents a new model for organize crime, unseating many older cartels with their brutal violent tactics that destabilize Mexico.|$|E
60|$|If any lesson may {{be drawn}} from the tragical and too often disgustful history of witchcraft, it is not one of exultation at our {{superior}} enlightenment or shame at the shortcomings of the human intellect. It is rather one of charity and self-distrust. When we see what inhuman absurdities men in other respects wise and good have clung to as the corner-stone of their faith in immortality and a divine ordering of the world, may we not suspect that those who now maintain political or other doctrines which seem to us barbarous and unenlightened, may be, for all that, in the main as virtuous and clear-sighted as ourselves? While we maintain our own side with an honest ardor of conviction, let us not forget to allow for mortal incompetence in the other. And if there are men who regret the Good Old Times, without too clear a notion of what they were, they should at least be thankful that we are rid of that misguided energy of faith which justified conscience in making men unrelentingly cruel. Even Mr. Leckie softens a little at the thought of the many innocent and beautiful beliefs of which a growing scepticism has robbed us in the decay of supernaturalism. But we need not despair; for, after all, scepticism is first cousin of credulity, and we are not surprised to see the tough doubter Montaigne hanging up his offerings in the shrine of our Lady of Loreto. Scepticism commonly takes up the room left by defect of imagination, and is the very quality of mind most likely to seek for sensual proof of supersensual things. If one came from the dead, it could not believe; and yet it longs for such a witness, and will put up with a very dubious one. So long as night is left and the helplessness of dream, the wonderful will not cease from among men. While we are the solitary prisoners of darkness, the witch seats herself at the loom of thought, and weaves strange figures into the web that looks so familiar and ordinary in the dry light of every-day. Just as we are flattering ourselves that the old spirit of sorcery is laid, behold the tables are tipping and the floors drumming all over Christendom. The faculty of wonder is not defunct, but is only getting more and more emancipated from the unnatural service of terror, and restored to its proper function as a minister of delight. A higher mode of belief is the best exorciser, because it makes the spiritual at one with the actual world instead of hostile, or at best alien. It has been the grossly material interpretations of spiritual doctrine that have given occasion to the two extremes of superstition and unbelief. While the resurrection of the body has been insisted on, that resurrection from the body which is the privilege of all has been forgotten. Superstition in its baneful form was largely due to the enforcement by the Church of arguments that involved a petitio principii, for it is the miserable necessity of all false logic to accept of very ignoble allies. Fear became at length its chief expedient for the maintenance of its power; and as there is a beneficent necessity laid upon a majority of mankind to sustain and perpetuate the order of things they are born into, and to make all new ideas manfully prove their right, first, to be at all, and then to be heard, many even superior minds dreaded the tearing away of vicious accretions as dangerous to the whole edifice of religion and society. But if this old ghost be fading away in what we regard as the dawn of a better day, we may console ourselves by thinking that perhaps, after all, we are not so much wiser than our ancestors. The rappings, the trance mediums, the visions of hands without bodies, the sounding of musical instruments without visible fingers, the miraculous inscriptions on the naked flesh, the enlivenment of furniture,--we have invented none of them, they are all heirlooms. There is surely room for yet another schoolmaster, when a score of seers advertise themselves in Boston newspapers. And if the metaphysicians can never rest till they have taken their watch to pieces and have arrived at a happy positivism as to its structure, though at the risk of bringing it to a <b>no-go,</b> we may be sure that the majority will always take more satisfaction in seeing its hands mysteriously move on, even if they should err a little as to the precise time of day established by the astronomical observatories.|$|E
