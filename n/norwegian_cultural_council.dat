" 15 : 05, 2007 - 2012, a {{multimedia}} installation {{based on the}} commemorative ritual marking the exact moment of Josip Broz Tito’s death—May 4, 1980 at 15 : 05 (CET). The ritual’s choreography required that the entire population “freeze” in a standing position for one minute on the sound of ubiquitous air raid sirens. In this largest-coordinated performance in human history, the whole country of some twenty million people took part by responding accordingly to a single-tonal cue intonated by the country’s complete arsenal of air raid sirens. During their research visits to the six national broadcasting archives, Bull. Miletic discovered the scattered documentary reportages that witness the ritual’s iterations along the eight consecutive years (1980 - 1988). In the news footage, this extraordinary “social sculpture” becomes increasingly unreal as the “flying” cameras cover the event. In the installation, the individual video sequences are randomly re-assembled in real time by a computer program, forming an endless seamless video feed in situ. " Samarbeidspartner: Dragan Miletic.

This city symphony-inspired work {{features}} phantom rides {{filmed in}} Belgrade, Ljubljana, Podgorica, Sarajevo, Skopje, and Zagreb along the cities’ Main Streets named in Tito’s honor, such as Marshal Tito’s Street, Tito’s Road, etc. The work {{is inspired by}} Dziga Vertov’s legendary film The Man with the Movie Camera, in which the director through montage blends a number of Soviet cities into one cinematic metropolis. Unlike Vertov's film however, in which the shots from different cities are assembled linearly in a single projection, the image in The Third Way is formed by an overlay of six different projections coexisting on the screen in real time. The title of the piece refers to the political option largely considered as the only viable alternative to the two dominant post-WW 2 ideologies, where Yugoslavia’s interpretation of Marxism was manifested through a highly complicated system of self-management organized within a complex network of Basic Organizations of Associated Labour.
