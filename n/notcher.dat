50|$|A pattern <b>notcher</b> is {{a common}} tool used in patternmaking and sewing that creates a notch in a paper pattern. Notches are used to align pattern pieces. Notches in the paper are more useful than marks on the paper as they allow the marking tool to mark the fabric inside the pattern area.|$|E
5000|$|The 1541 {{does not}} have an index hole sensor, making it {{straightforward}} to use the reverse side of a disk by flipping it. A disk can be converted to a [...] "flippy disk" [...] by simply cutting/punching a notch on the left-hand side, causing the drive to recognize both sides as writable. This would effectively double the storage capacity. The notch can be made with scissors, a knife, hole punch, or a disk <b>notcher</b> tool that is specifically designed for this task. Most soft-sectored and all hard-sectored drives would have also required an extra cut-out for the index hole — a harder modification.|$|E
50|$|The Hungarian folklorist Gyula Sebestyén (1864-1946) {{writes that}} ancient {{boustrophedon}} writing resembles how the Hungarian rovás-sticks of old Hungarian writing {{were made by}} shepherds. The <b>notcher</b> holds the wooden stick in his left hand, cutting the letters {{with his right hand}} from right to left. When the first side is complete, he flips the stick over vertically and starts to notch the opposite side in the same manner. When unfolded horizontally (as {{in the case of the}} stone-cut boustrophedon inscriptions), the final result is writing which starts from right to left, and continues from left to right in the next row, with letters turned upside down. Sebestyén states that the ancient boustrophedon writings were copied from such wooden sticks with cut letters, applied for epigraphic inscriptions (not recognizing the real meaning of the original wooden type).|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} career as a singer and {{announcer}} for radio station WTAG in Worcester, Massachusetts in the early 1920s. Chester Gaylord's first recordings (in 1920) were saxophone solos for Thomas Edison, whom he had met. In 1923, he signed with Columbia records and made a number of vocal records for them. His popularity spread rapidly leading Brunswick Records (the second largest record company in the United States in the 1920s) to offer him an exclusive contract. He became one of the labels most prolific vocalists during the late 1920s. After the Warner Brothers bought out the Brunswick Record company in April 1930 a reorganization occurred and Chester Gaylord's contact was one of numerous artists whose contract was not renewed. Chester Gaylord continued to be popular on radio throughout the early 1930s until the introduction of swing music, in 1935, a type of music that was unsuitable to his style of singing. From 1929 to 1931, he was a featured vocalist on NBC radio on the Top <b>Notchers</b> Coca Cola Radio Program with Leonard Joy and his All String Orchestra.|$|R
5000|$|The flat-pattern {{method is}} where the entire pattern is drafted {{on a flat surface}} from measurements, using rulers, curves and straight-edges. A pattern maker would also use various tools such as a <b>notcher,</b> drill and awl to mark the pattern. Usually, flat {{patterning}} begins with the creation of a sloper or block pattern, a simple, fitted garment made to the wearer's measurements. For women, this will usually be a jewel-neck bodice and narrow skirt, and for men an upper sloper and a pants sloper. The final sloper pattern is usually made of cardboard or paperboard, without seam allowances or style details (thicker paper or cardboard allows repeated tracing and pattern development from the original sloper). Once the shape of the sloper has been refined by making a series of mock-up garments called toiles (UK) or muslins (US), the final sloper can be used in turn to create patterns for many styles of garments with varying necklines, sleeves, dart placements, and so on. The flat pattern drafting method is the most commonly used method in menswear; menswear rarely involves draping. There are many pattern making system available, but M. Muller & Sohn (...) is widely used for its accuracy and fit for different body figure.|$|E
40|$|In {{synchrotron}} machines, {{the beam}} extraction {{is accomplished by}} a combination of septa and kicker magnets which deflect the beam from an accelerator into another. Ideally the kicker field must rise/fall in between the beam bunches. However, in reality, an intentional beam-free time region (aka "notch") is created on the beam pulse to assure that the beam can be extracted with minimal losses. In the case of the Fermilab Booster, the notch is created in the ring near injection energy by the use of fast kickers which deposit the beam in a shielded collimation region within the accelerator tunnel. With increasing beam power it is desirable to create this notch at the lowest possible energy to minimize activation. The Fermilab Proton Improvement Plan (PIP) initiated an R&D project to build a laser system to create the notch within a linac beam pulse at 750 keV. This talk will describe the concept for the laser <b>notcher</b> and discuss our current status, commissioning results, and future plans. Comment: 5 p...|$|E
40|$|A fast {{vertical}} 1. 08 -m long kicker (<b>notcher)</b> {{located in}} the Fermilab Booster Long- 05 straight section is currently used to remove 3 out of 84 circulating bunches after injection to generate an abort gap. With the maximum magnetic field of 72. 5 Gauss, it removes only 87 % of the 3 -bunch intensity at 400 MeV, with 75 % loss on pole tips of the focusing Booster magnets, 11 % on the Long- 06 collimators, and 1 % {{in the rest of}} the ring. We propose to improve the notching efficiency and reduce beam loss in the Booster by using three horizontal kickers in the Long- 12 section. STRUCT calculations show that using horizontal notchers, one can remove up to 96 % of the 3 -bunch intensity at 400 - 700 MeV, directing 95 % of it to a new beam dump at the Long- 13 section. This fully decouples notching and collimation. The beam dump absorbs most of the impinging proton energy in its jaws. The latter are encapsulated into an appropriate radiation shielding that reduces impact on the machine components, personnel and environment to the tolerable levels. MARS simulations show that corresponding prompt and residual radiation levels can be reduced ten times compared to the current ones...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} orientation of occlusal plane by morphometric parameters of cranio-facial complex, to study the morphology of HIP-plane and correlation relations with cerebral and facial cranium measurements. Materials and Methods. The crania with mandibles were fixed in craniostat, and measurements were made using thickness and sliding calipers, vernier calipers of various designs. We took scaled photos of all crania using support stand, with equal approximation, in three views (coronal view, lateral view, skull base view). Digital material was computer processed. Results. We developed craniometric technique to analyze the morphology and topography of HIP plane (Hamulus–Incisive Papilla). Transverse facial size was found to be 1. 2 times less compared to the transverse cranial diameter, and transverse facial size between zy–zy (zygion) points — 2. 5 times larger than the distance between H (hamular <b>notcher)</b> points right and left. Facial n–gn (nasion–gnation) size was found to have medium correlation relationship with the altitude of HIP triangle. Anthropometric ipp (incisive papilla posterior) point appeared to be by 10 % more stable than ip (incisive papilla) point. Therefore, for HIP-plane determination we recommend using not incisive papiila (ip), but the point, which is 3 mm distal (ipp point) and located on distal bony edge of the incisive canal opening. The analysis of the lateral view of cranium showed the relations of occlusal plane of maxilla and HIP-plane to be characterized by strong positive correlation. The inclination angle of Camper’s plane to HIP did not exceed 6 °. HIP-plane appeared to be more stable to determine the orientation of maxillary occlusal plane position...|$|E
