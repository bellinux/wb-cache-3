25|$|As part of {{this review}} process, Durban has now changed its {{implementation}} of the free basic water policy: Households living in properties that are valued above a certain threshold now must prove that their income is below the poverty limit, {{in order to continue}} to receive free basic water. The reason for the change was that most of those benefiting from free basic water were <b>not</b> <b>poor.</b> They used less than amount of free basic water - 9 cubic meters per month in the case of Durban - {{for the simple reason that}} there were two or less residents in the household.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in India {{are low in}} both urban and rural areas. In urban areas they were set at the {{equivalent}} of about 0.10 per cubic meter in 2007 and recovered about 60% of operating and maintenance costs, with large differences between cities. Some cities such as Kolkata do not bill residential users at all. In rural areas the level of cost recovery often is even lower than in urban areas and was estimated at only 20% in rural Punjab. Subsidies were estimated at 1.1billion per year in the mid-1990s, accounting to 4% of all government subsidies in India. 70% of those benefiting from the subsidies are <b>not</b> <b>poor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Out of the 32 {{million people}} that {{received}} free basic water in 2005, almost half, or 15 million, were <b>not</b> <b>poor.</b> Furthermore, many poor in rural areas, who receive limited {{amounts of water}} for free through standpipes, do not benefit fully. Those without access to publicly provided water do not benefit at all from the program. The policy is more successful in wealthier municipalities, which {{have the ability to}} cross-subsidise water provision for the poor, than in poorer, often rural municipalities. This {{is one of the reasons}} why in 2009 the government announced it would review its implementation strategy for free basic water, possibly through registers of poor users.|$|E
25|$|The Greater New York City area {{received}} {{the brunt of}} the February Blizzard of 2006. All three of the airports in the New York City area (LaGuardia Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport) were closed during the record blizzard, {{for the first time since}} the September 11, 2001 attacks. Like the Blizzard of 1996, this winter storm does not meet the criteria to be called a blizzard, however. The winds were not strong enough, and visibility was <b>not</b> <b>poor</b> enough. Thundersnow, which is a rare occurrence in New York, occurred for about a 4-hour period in parts of Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Rockland and Westchester during the height of the storm early Sunday morning.|$|E
25|$|The son of Juho Kekkonen and Emilia Pylvänäinen, Kekkonen {{was born}} in Pielavesi, in the Savo region of Finland, and spent his {{childhood}} in Kainuu. His family were farmers (though <b>not</b> <b>poor</b> tenant farmers, as some of his supporters later claimed). His father was originally a farm-hand and forestry worker who rose to become a forestry manager and stock agent at Halla Ltd. Claims made that Kekkonen's family had lived in a rudimentary farmhouse with no chimney were later proved to be false—a photograph of Kekkonen's childhood home had been retouched to remove the chimney. His school years did not go smoothly. During the Finnish Civil War, Kekkonen fought for the White Guard (Kajaani chapter), fighting in the battles of Kuopio, Varkaus, Mouhu, and Vyborg, and taking part in mop-up operations, including leading a firing squad in Hamina. He later admitted to having killed a man in battle, but wrote in his memoirs that he was randomly selected by his company commander to follow a squad escorting ten prisoners, where the squad {{turned out to be}} a firing squad, and then to give the actual order to aim and fire.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1740s the Anglican {{church had}} about 70 parish priests around the colony.

2500|$|In 2010 Johannesburg water {{provided}} between 6 and 15 {{cubic meters}} of water per month for free, depending on the poverty level of residents. For those considered <b>not</b> <b>poor,</b> the tariff for the tranche between 6 and 10 cubic meters was R4.93 (US$0.73), for the tranche up to 15 cubic meters it was R7.31 (US$1.08) and so on until R14.94 (US$2.21) for a consumption exceeding 40 cubic meters per month. The bill for 10 cubic meters per month thus is R20.

It is noted that the series sometimes featured popular songs within certain episodes, though the versions by the artists who originally performed them were usually not used; instead they were commonly sung a cappella by Mark Linn-Baker and/or Bronson Pinchot's characters whenever the script called for Balki and/or Larry to sing within the episode.|$|E
