2500|$|Léger {{was born}} in Argentan, Orne, Lower Normandy, where his father raised cattle. Fernand Léger {{initially}} trained as an architect from 1897 to 1899, before moving in 1900 to Paris, where he supported himself as an architectural draftsman. After military service in Versailles, Yvelines, in 1902–1903, he enrolled at the School of Decorative Arts after his application to the École des Beaux-Arts was rejected. He nevertheless attended the Beaux-Arts as a <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>student,</b> spending {{what he described as}} [...] "three empty and useless years" [...] studying with Gérôme and others, while also studying at the Académie Julian. He began to work seriously as a painter only at the age of 25. At this point his work showed the influence of impressionism, as seen in Le Jardin de ma mère (My Mother's Garden) of 1905, one of the few paintings from this period that he did not later destroy. A new emphasis on drawing and geometry appeared in Léger's work after he saw the Cézanne retrospective at the Salon d'Automne in 1907.|$|E
40|$|Extended {{orientation}} courses {{continue to}} be introduced as curriculum offerings that assist students to persist in postsecondary institutions. Research on the outcomes of such courses in terms of student persistence is, however, not proceeding at the same pace. ^ The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the ideas of Tinto (1987) and Pascarella, Terenzini, and Wolfle (1986) and examine extended orientation as a contributing factor of persistence. ^ The sample of the study consisted of 155 students who were members of the 1987 freshmen class of the University of Connecticut, Storrs. Fifty-seven (57) of these students elected to enroll in an extended orientation course, the 2 ̆ 2 Freshmen Seminar: The Student and Higher Learning. 2 ̆ 2 ^ Two hypotheses were tested to determine if differences existed between freshman students who elected to enroll in the 2 ̆ 2 Freshman Seminar 2 ̆ 2 and those who did not. Whether or not persistence in college, and other variables, could predict group membership as an enrolled or <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>student</b> was also examined. ^ Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT) total scores, predicted grade point average (GPA), first-semester GPA, and second-semester GPA, sex, and rate of persistence were used as discriminating variables. Discriminant function analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, and descriptive statistics determined that SAT total score was the most powerful discriminating variable between the two groups at the 0. 01 level. The SAT means of the enrolled and non-enrolled students were nearly a standard deviation apart, with the mean of enrolled students similar to the mean of students who leave college early (Astin, 1982, 1975). The groups persisted at almost identical rates, however, (95...|$|E

Truancy {{and school}} alienation have been problematic for education since {{the establishment of}} schools and even before schooling became compulsory in 1877. With the advent of "Tomorrow's Schools" in 1989 pressure was applied to school Boards of Trustees to deal with truancy (Education Act, 1989, Part 111, Section 31. 3). School boards of trustees expressed concern as to the legitimacy of this role and further expressed their anxiety {{about the lack of}} resources schools had to call upon to deal with truancy problems. In 1996 the Ministry of Education established the Non-Enrolment Truancy Service (NETS) to work in the field, returning non-enrolled truants to education. The New Zealand House of Representatives "Inquiry into Children in Education At Risk Through Truancy and Behavioural Problems" (1995) conceded that truancy in New Zealand was wide spread throughout the country. Truancy tends to have the greatest affect upon students and families who are confronted with difficult economic, social, cultural and family challenges Therefore truancy is not just about education but is embedded in the social and economic fabric of society. This study aimed to examine the work, explore the beliefs and investigate the issues raised by Education Advisers whose task it was to return <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>students</b> to education. To enable this to be achieved a multi-case, multi-site case study approach was used incorporating the use of a national questionnaire and in-depth interviews with Education Advisers. The findings of the study revealed there was confusion about the role Education Advisers were expected to fulfil. Education Advisers who had previous experience in the education sector appeared to have advantages over their colleagues who had previously been in the non-education sector. The study highlighted the variety of strategies used by Education Advisers in their attempts to return students to education. However, Education Advisers reported there were barriers that impinged upon their work as they attempted to return students to education. These included school personnel, curriculum, students and their families, government agencies and bureaucracy. Education Advisers identified training and professional development as requiring consideration by NETS management, while the concept of supervision appeared problematic. Ultimately this study shows that truancy is not just an educational issue. Truancy is about social issues, socio-economics, culture and the educational environment. While the Non-Enrolment Truancy Service is successful in their endeavours to return <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>students</b> to education, to successfully retain <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>students</b> in education requires a well resourced collaborative, multi-agency approach to address the issues that contribute to truancy...|$|R
40|$|Leadership Policy and Organizations Department Capstone ProjectThe {{following}} research project was {{in response to}} a request by Lindsey Wilson College (LWC) for evidence-based data to inform two areas of the institution's strategic management plan. Institutional leaders are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of LWC's market position and the factors leading to high levels of first-year student departure. To meet this request, the project team conducted a mixed-methods approach using data from a variety of published and unpublished sources and administered surveys with LWC's admitted, <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>students</b> and enrolled freshmen students. Qualitative interviews with LWC's enrolled freshmen supplemented the study's quantitative data and elicited in-depth responses. A strategic marketing analysis examined LWC's market position beginning with the identification of LWC's top five competitor institutions. While LWC has primarily focused their competitive strategies on a private institution: Campbellsville University; four of Lindsey Wilson's top five competitors are public institutions. The highest percentage of Lindsey Wilson's admitted, <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>students</b> attended Western Kentucky University while Campbellsville University surfaced as the only competing private institution, attracting the third highest percentage of admitted, <b>non-enrolled</b> <b>students</b> among the top five competitor institutions. Analysis of LWC's market position was based on Kotler's (2005) customer-oriented marketing mix consisting of customer value, costs, convenience, and communications. Student perceptions were collected from LWC's admitted, non-enrolled and enrolled freshmen students using the Admitted Student Questionnaire (ASQ) and the Enrolled Student Questionnaire (ESQ) and were analyzed {{within the context of the}} institution's marketing mix. To enhance LWC's understanding of its market position, the project team used the marketing mix analysis to identify the institution's competitive marketing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. LWC's strengths lie in its ability to subsidize student attendance through institutional grants, the helpfulness of faculty and staff, and the institution's family-oriented environment. Institutional weaknesses include a high "sticker price" compared with public competitors, limited academic programs, and a lack of a definitive value proposition. Opportunities for LWC include potential for increased enrollment as a result of greater federal allocation for Pell Grants and the willingness of community organizations to form partnerships with the institution. Finally, threats lie in LWC's location in rural Adair County and the lower net cost of attendance at competing public institutions. The second part of the study focused on reducing first-year student departure. LWC's institutional leaders are concerned with the challenges associated with retaining a greater percentage of first-year students. In 2007 - 2008, LWC's first-year retention rate was 52. 6 %; well below the national first- to second-year retention rate of 67. 2 % for private, 4 -year open access institutions (America College Testing [ACT], 2008). According to the 2007 National Survey of Student Engagement report, LWC ranked nationally among the top 10 % of colleges with a "supportive campus environment" and received a high rating on the "level of academic challenge. " Given these favorable results, both of which were expected to impact student departure levels, institutional leaders are in a quandary as to factors that are adversely impacting student persistence levels. A cluster analysis identified LWC's peer institutions to create a comparative context in which to examine issues of student departure. The analysis produced nine national peer institutions, including nearby Campbellsville University and the University of the Cumberlands. LWC was then compared with these institutions on characteristics related to student departure. Despite LWC's encouraging increase in retention rates over the past three years, the college's retention rates remain lower than many of its peers. An in-depth analysis of first-year student departure was divided into first- and second- semester analyses. First-semester results revealed that students with higher family income, less social affiliation, unable to make independent decisions, and have minimal interaction with faculty are at greater risk of departure. The second- semester results revealed that a student's external environment, namely parental support, is directly related to student persistence. Academic integration, rather than social integration, is directly related to student persistence. Institutional integrity is linked to both social and academic integration, while commitment of the institution to student welfare directly affects social integration and subsequent commitment to the institution. In addition, living on campus and working while enrolled, negatively impacts subsequent commitment to the institution and social integration, respectively. From the analysis of student departure at LWC and an analysis of a national sample of open-admission institutions, the project team articulated structural limitations that LWC faces in reducing student departure. In its mission to educate academically underprepared students, the size of LWC's enrollment and its commitment to fostering a nurturing environment, creates an institutional challenge to retaining students. Despite these limitations, instructional expenditures have a positive effect on increasing student persistence. The project team made 21 recommendations including the expansion and differentiation of LWC's marketing strategy to a broader audience with an emphasis on the institution's value proposition. To improve first-year student departure, LWC must engage parents and families in the academic and social environment. Academic integration serves as a vital component to reducing first-year student departure at LWC and should become a focus of Freshman Seminar courses. Institutional leaders must ensure the alignment of the college's mission, values, policies, and procedures, while demonstrating an abiding concern for the growth and development of students. Despite the challenges LWC is faced with, the college is poised for a promising future. Department of Leadership Policy and OrganizationsPeabody College of Education and Human Developmen...|$|R
