40|$|In {{negligence}} law, unavoidable accident is {{the risk}} that remains when an actor has used due care. The counterpart of unavoidable accident is <b>negligent</b> <b>harm.</b> Negligence law makes parties immune for unavoidable accident even when they have used less than due care. Courts have developed a number of methods by which they sort accidents to unavoidable accident or to <b>negligent</b> <b>harm,</b> holding parties liable only for the latter. These sorting techniques are interesting {{in their own right}} and also provide a way of conceptualizing the relationship between specific negligence and res ipsa loquitur, which are two variants of the negligence rule. One judicial sorting technique reveals a paradox of negligence law. New safety technology often reduces the amount of unavoidable accident and simultaneously increases the expected number of compliance errors, or routine negligent lapses, that actors will make. Paradoxically, an actors use of new safety technology can make it more likely that a court will sort an accident to <b>negligent</b> <b>harm</b> as opposed to unavoidable accident. The article develops these theoretical ideas through a series of graphical illustrations analogous to those of traditional price theory. ...|$|E
40|$|Negligence {{causes the}} {{injury or death}} of the {{existing}} legal rules governing the time may be too difficult {{to ask the question}} whether the defendant is due to <b>negligent</b> <b>harm</b> others to justice. There is a possibility the victim or aggrieved heirs in case of accident does not want the case because there has been a continued peace with the perpetrator of the accident, or because the victim has received compensation from the perpetrator of the accident and felt he had enough and did not bother to prolong the case. 	The {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain data on the post mortem functions for the public prosecutor in the prosecution of criminal cases of negligence that caused the death of people. To obtain data on the constraints faced by the public prosecutor in the use of post mortem relating to the criminal case of negligence which caused the death of people. 	In writing this law, the data collected by the method of literature study and interviews. Literature study is research that is used to collect secondary data by reading and studying the materials that relate to the problems that have been studied. By studying books, literature and law. Interviews were conducted to support the data obtained from the study of literature. The data obtained from the study were analyzed qualitatively, the analysis undertaken to understand and assemble the data collected systematically, so as to obtain an idea of ??the problems studied. 	The function of a post mortem for the public prosecutor in the prosecution of cases of negligence that caused the death of that person, by post mortem attorney can determine whether there is a causal relationship between the death of the victim by the defendant, and a post mortem can be taken into consideration in deciding the case, but the judge and post mortem not to guide judges in deciding the case. Constraints faced by the public prosecutor in the use of post mortem relating to cases of negligence that caused the death of the victim is a person who sometimes refused or objected when the victim's body post mortem carried out, this led to the prosecution and judge the difficulty in determining the exact cause and effect of the death of the victim...|$|E

25|$|On 2 November, {{prosecutors}} {{charged the}} club's owners—Alin Anastasescu, Paul Gancea, and Costin Mincu—with negligent homicide and <b>negligent</b> bodily <b>harm,</b> and detained them after a 10-hour hearing. As of 5 November, 70 {{people have been}} heard {{so far in the}} Colectiv fire case. Many came on their own initiative to file a complaint and be a civil party. The former mayor of Sector 4, Cristian Popescu Piedone, is also being targeted in the case, being investigated for abuse of office and forgery concerning the authorization of Club Colectiv.

40|$|In {{a recent}} book, Neil Levy argues that {{culpable}} action – action {{for which we}} are morally responsible – is necessarily produced by states {{of which we are}} consciously aware. However, criminal defendants are routinely held responsible for criminal harm caused by states of which they are not conscious in Levy’s sense. In this chapter I argue that cases of <b>negligent</b> criminal <b>harm</b> indicate that Levy’s claim that moral responsibility requires synchronic conscious awareness of the moral significance of an act is too strict, and that tracing conditions cannot be successfully used to bolster Levy’s account. Instead, current legal practices indicate that criminal responsibility requires the capacity for diachronic agency and self-control, not synchronic conscious control...|$|R
50|$|Patrol Special Police {{clients and}} the public are {{protected}} from <b>negligent</b> or intentional <b>harm</b> because rules governing program rules require each beat owner to carry liability insurance that protects against potential negligence or injury by an officer. In addition, rules require each beat owner to carry worker's compensation insurance for employees. Each beat owner determines {{if he or she}} will fund a health and/or retirement plan for Assistant Patrol Special Police Officers.|$|R
40|$|Modest {{differences}} in conduct {{can lead to}} wildly different legal outcomes. A person deemed slightly <b>negligent</b> when <b>harming</b> another may owe millions of dollars. Had the person been just a bit more cautious, he would owe nothing. Similarly, when self-defense is deemed slightly negligent, a person may spend several years in prison. Had the person been just a bit more cautious, he would have no criminal liability at all. Though the law must draw difficult lines, the lines need not have such startling effects. We can adjust damage awards and the severity of prison sentences anywhere along a spectrum. A legal input and output have a 2 ̆ 2 smooth 2 ̆ 2 relationship when a gradual change to the input leads to a gradual change to the output. The prior examples are not smooth but 2 ̆ 2 bumpy 2 ̆ 2 : a gradual change to the input sometimes dramatically affects the output and sometimes has no effect at all. The law is full of these bumpy relationships that create hard-to-justify discontinuities. In this Essay, I discuss the relative advantages of smooth and bumpy legal relationships and explain how the choice of an input-output relationship differs from the choice between rules and standards. I argue that smooth relationships will often create less 2 ̆ 2 rounding error 2 ̆ 2 than bumpy relationships by more closely approximating our underlying moral norms...|$|R
40|$|The law {{under which}} {{government}} officials operate permits them to inflict injury on others, under prescribed circumstances, in established ways, and in carefully (and sometimes not so carefully) calibrated amounts. Indeed, the law goes further: it sometimes tells the official that {{a failure to}} injure-that is, to coerce compliance with a predetermined rule of conduct-is a dereliction of official duty. For although there may be interminable argument over the social goals that justify the state in using force, {{all but the most}} extreme libertarians concede some place to governmental, and therefore official, coercion. The legal system 2 ̆ 7 s permitting-or requiring-officially inflicted harms need not, however, be viewed as meaning that official harms have a peculiar legal position. At its most general level the law governing civil liability imposes an obligation to repair any <b>negligent</b> or intentional <b>harm</b> inflicted upon another. 1 This liability rule obtains unless the harmful action can be justified by appeal to special circumstances. 2 ̆ 7 When harmful action is authorized by the statutes, regulations, customs, and interpretations empowering and instructing officials, such authorization may be viewed as merely one form of justification. Neither the constable who enters blackacre pursuant to a valid warrant nor the buyer who enters pursuant to a contract of sale will be held liable for trespass...|$|R
40|$|In {{negligence}} law, {{the risks}} {{taken into account}} by courts when setting the standard of care are the same risks considered when imposing liability and awarding damages. I call this the 2 ̆ 2 alignment principle. 2 ̆ 2 One objective of this Article is to expose exceptions to the alignment principle, which I call 2 ̆ 2 misalignments. 2 ̆ 2 In cases of misalignment, the risks that are accounted for in setting the standard of care {{are different from the}} risks for which liability is imposed and damages are awarded. A second objective of this Article is to suggest modifications to the law when misalignments cannot be justified. The most important objective of this Article, however, is to offer a theory of how to evaluate and contend with misalignments. Five cases of misalignment are identified and discussed in the Article. The first case illustrates how courts set the standard of care independently of the victim 2 ̆ 7 s level of income, but award different amounts of damages to high- and low-income victims. The second case represents instances in which causation is inherently hard to prove. In such cases, courts set the standard of care according to the expected harm, but traditionally allow no compensation when the plaintiff suffers harm but cannot prove that it was caused by the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s negligence. In the third case, courts account for both risks increased and decreased by the injurer when setting the standard of care, but ignore the decreased risks when awarding damages. In the fourth case, courts set the standard of care by taking into account both ordinary and unusual risks, but often refuse to impose liability for harms that materialized from the ordinary risks. Finally, in the fifth case, courts set the standard of care by considering the risks the injurer created for others, but not the risks he created for himself, even though the <b>negligent</b> injurer bears <b>harms</b> that materialized from both the risks to others and the risks to self. In all five cases, the goals of tort law would be better served by removing misalignments and equally accounting for risks both in setting the standard of care and awarding damages...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Reason {{for this}} {{scientific}} work was {{the prosecution of}} a religious teacher from the Jewish Community of Berlin before the Local Court of Berlin- Tiergarten in 2008 for <b>negligent</b> actual bodily <b>harm,</b> after conducting a ritual Jewish circumcision. From medical point of view occurring complications are of major interest: bleeding, infection, meatal stenosis, local inflammation, injury to the penis and glans, secondary phimosis, scarring and urethral injury. Before the German “Law on the scope of custody during circumcision of a male child" came into force on December 28 th 2012, there was great legal uncertainty regarding the classification of ritual circumcisions of boys and their parents' ability to agree to such. This uncertainty was further increased by {{the judgment of the}} District Court of Cologne on May 7 th 2012, where parental consent for ritual circumcision of boys was counted inadmissible. Methods: From October 2010 to October 2012 "PubMed", The Cochrane Library and "Google Scholar" were searched for medical studies on complications in neonatal, infants` and childrens` circumcisions. For the legal aspect of the work judgments, legal monographs and commentaries were used. Supplementary interviews with Jewish and Muslim stakeholders and experts in the field of religion and freedom of religion were conducted. Results: Bleeding is the most common complication in neonates and infants, followed by infections and local complications or surgical incidents. Neonatal bleedings are rather mild in nature, whereas the other two predominantly require hospitalization or revision. Bleeding complications and surgical incidents in infants are mainly serious, local complications at this age are equally often severe and mild. However, {{it is not possible to}} make a general statement about the frequency of the occurrence of major and minor complications, especially since common definitions of complications are non-existent. From the legal point of view circumcision is a serious actual bodily harm within the meaning of §§ 223 section 1, 224 section 1 No. 2, 2 nd Var. StGB, which can only be justified by a valid parental consent. Conclusion: The neonatal period is to be considered the most favorable time for intervention for avoiding the feared complications. Parental proxy consent in legal custody seemed to be justified after the previous law, as this was not in breach of child welfare and the guardians thus acted within their discretionary. With the new German law in force since December 28 th 2012, the parental consent in ritual boy circumcisions as an expression of their personal care was officially allowed...|$|R
