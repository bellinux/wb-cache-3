40|$|Income cap or {{threshold}} systems rely on {{incentives that}} encourage physicians to limit medical expenditures, but {{little is known}} about how physicians respond to these incentives. Conceptually, the threshold system is to physicians what an income tax system is to taxpayers. We exploit this similarity to analyze the impact of a reform that changed what is included in the 'taxable' billings of physicians in Ontario, Canada. We find that for services that the reform turned from exempted to <b>non-exempted,</b> the reform had a strong, negative impact for physicians with billings above the minimum threshold and a negligible impact for physicians below the threshold. The reform had no impact on services that were <b>non-exempted</b> {{both before and after the}} reform.

40|$|Most-favored-nation treatment, i. e., nondiscrimination among trading partners, is a {{fundamental}} principle of the GATT WTO system. The WTO Agreement on Safeguards has thus been seen as encouraging use of a preferred form of contingent protection relative to antidumping and other inherently discriminatory measures. In practice, however, safeguard protection may also incorporate discriminatory elements. This paper focuses on three ways that policies conforming to the Agreement on Safeguards may nonetheless discriminate explicitly or implicitly among trading partners. First, {{the form of the}} safeguard policy matters: quantitative restrictions discriminate among foreign suppliers by preserving historical market shares more than a safeguard implemented as a tariff. Second, safeguard measures discriminate against faster-growing exporters and new entrants in import markets. Third, formal exemptions for partners in preferential trade agreements and for small developing-country suppliers allow these countries to gain market share at the expense of <b>non-exempted</b> exporters.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} overtime regulations on the hours worked and the hourly wages of Japanese white-collar employees. In Japan, managers with the title of section chief and higher are exempt from overtime regulations, like the white-collar exemption in the U. S. Recently in Japan, {{there has been a}} big discussion whether or not the range of white collar exemption currently allowed only to managers should be broadened to other employees. To estimate the impact of the possible change in the application of the white-collar exemption to other employees, this paper compares those who are exempt from overtime regulations with those who are not, using workers' longitudinal data from 2004 to 2008. We find that the impact of overtime regulations varies {{depending on the type of}} employees. Specifically, on average, the white collar exemption would increase hours worked for those with relatively lower income, those who work for wholesalers, retailers, restaurants and the lodging industry, and those who are not university graduates. On the other hand, the white collar exemption would decrease hours worked for employees with relatively higher annual income and university graduates. For those who work longer under the white-collar exemption, we find that their hourly wages are compensated with a higher base salary compared to that of <b>non-exempted,</b> which supports the concept of the fixed-job model. Regarding those who work shorter hours under the white-collar exemption, we find that it would be promotion rather than the white-collar exemption that would affect working hours. That is, they tend to work longer hours until they get promoted to manager, but once they achieve the promotion they work shorter hours, which is consistent with the tournament model. ...|$|R

To {{better understand the}} determinants and consequences of being exempted from the framework, we investigated the associations between exception reporting, patient characteristics and mortality. We also quantified the proportion of exempted patients that met quality targets for a tracer condition (diabetes). DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study, using individual patient data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. SETTING: 644 general practices, 2006 / 7 to 2011 / 12. PARTICIPANTS: Patients registered with study practices {{for at least one}} year over the study period, with at least one condition of interest (2 460 341 in total). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Exception reporting rates by reason (clinical contraindication, patient dissent); all-cause mortality in year following exemption. Analyses with logistic and Cox proportional-hazards regressions, respectively. RESULTS: The odds of being exempted increased with age, deprivation and multimorbidity. Men {{were more likely to be}} exempted but this was largely attributable to higher prevalence of conditions with high exemption rates. Modest associations remained, with women more likely to be exempted due to clinical contraindication (OR 0. 90, 99 % CI 0. 88 to 0. 92) and men more likely to be exempted due to informed dissent (OR 1. 08, 99 % CI 1. 06 to 1. 10). More deprived areas (both for practice location and patient residence) were non-linearly associated with higher exception rates, after controlling for comorbidities and other covariates, with stronger associations for clinical contraindication. Compared with patients with a single condition, odds ratios for patients with two, three, or four or more conditions were respectively 4. 28 (99 % CI 4. 18 to 4. 38), 16. 32 (99 % CI 15. 82 to 16. 83) and 68. 69 (99 % CI 66. 12 to 71. 37) for contraindication, and 2. 68 (99 % CI 2. 63 to 2. 74), 4. 02 (99 % CI 3. 91 to 4. 13) and 5. 17 (99 % CI 5. 00 to 5. 35) for informed dissent.

25|$|In many jurisdictions (including many American states), {{there is}} a general tax levied {{periodically}} on residents who own personal property (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household. Any otherwise <b>non-exempt</b> object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household. Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax. If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in that state as well.|$|E

A vehicle could suffer major damage after an MOT has been carried out, but the certificate would still be valid, and obtaining a new one is not required by law (some insurance companies may require a new test, but this is their practice, not law).

The {{question of whether}} they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate. People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them, so a flat-rate sales tax will tend to be regressive.

The most common type of bankruptcy is liquidation under chapter 7 of the Code, which applies to both individual and corporate debtors. In a chapter 7 case, an individual debtor's <b>non-exempt</b> assets are placed into a bankruptcy estate under the control of a court-appointed trustee for distribution to creditors, and the debtor usually receives a discharge of his or her remaining debts. Alternatively, an individual who earns regular income and whose income is less than a specified annual maximum may instead choose to file a chapter 13 case, under which the individual agrees to repay all or a portion of his or her debts under a repayment plan approved by the bankruptcy court.

2500|$|Although {{in theory}} all {{property}} of the debtor that is not excluded from the estate under the Bankruptcy Code becomes {{property of the}} estate (i.e., is automatically transferred from the debtor to the estate) {{at the time of}} commencement of a case, an individual debtor (not a partnership, corporation, etc.) may claim certain items of property as [...] "exempt" [...] and thereby keep those items (subject, however, to any valid liens or other encumbrances). An individual debtor may choose between a [...] "federal" [...] list of exemptions and the list of exemptions provided by the law of the state in which the debtor files the bankruptcy case unless the state in which the debtor files the bankruptcy case has enacted legislation prohibiting the debtor from choosing the exemptions on the federal list.
