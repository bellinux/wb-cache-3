5|$|Pain is {{experienced}} by 53 {{percent of all}} people diagnosed with malignant cancer, 59 percent of people receiving anticancer treatment, 64 percent of people with metastatic or advanced-stage disease, and 33 percent of people after completion of curative treatment. Evidence for prevalence of pain in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> cancer is scarce. One study found pain in 38 {{percent of people who}} were <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported that pain was an early symptom in 18–49 percent of cases. More than one third of people with cancer pain describe the pain as moderate or severe.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission {{does not mean the}} disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{electric}} field therapy is an FDA-approved therapy for <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> and recurrent glioblastoma. In 2015, initial {{results from a}} phase-three randomized clinical trial of alternating {{electric field}} therapy plus temozolomide in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> glioblastoma reported a three-month improvement in progression-free survival, and a five-month improvement in overall survival compared to temozolomide therapy alone, representing the first large trial in a decade to show a survival improvement in this setting. Despite these results, the efficacy of this approach remains controversial among medical experts.|$|E
25|$|Sequencing {{of virus}} from <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{patients}} is now routine {{in many countries}} for surveillance of drug resistance mutations, which has yielded large databases of sequence data in those areas.|$|E
25|$|After further {{work was}} done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S.Food and Drug Administration granted {{accelerated}} approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone {{for the treatment of}} <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> multiple myeloma patients.|$|E
25|$|Tremor (usually fine shaking; tremor of the outstretched fingers). In a small {{study of}} <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> hyperthyroid patients, tremor was {{observed}} in 76% of them. Some studies lay the cause for hyperthyroid tremor with a heightened beta-adrenergic state, others suggest an increased metabolism of dopamine.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has {{approved}} imatinib as first-line treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, both in adults and children. The drug is approved in multiple contexts of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, including after stem cell transplant, in blast crisis, and <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1998 {{thalidomide}} {{was approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> multiple myeloma (MM) under strict regulations. This has {{led to the development of}} a number of analogs with fewer side effects and increased potency which include lenalidomide, pomalidomide and apremilast, all of which are currently marketed and manufactured by Celgene.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines for {{treatment}} for specific clinical situations requires a good estimation of a person's long-term life expectancy. People {{can also use}} an 18-item questionnaire to learn whether they have good knowledge and understanding about their treatment options before they choose. Most {{of those who are}} <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> and made a treatment choice can not correctly answer over half of the questions.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{does not}} always work, and {{even when it is}} useful, it may not {{completely}} destroy the cancer. Patients frequently fail to understand its limitations. In one study of patients who had been <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with incurable, stage 4 cancer, more than two-thirds of patients with lung cancer and more than four-fifths of patients with colorectal cancer still believed that chemotherapy was likely to cure their cancer.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} treatments for CML, but {{the standard of}} care for <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> patients is imatinib (Gleevec) therapy. Compared to most anti-cancer drugs, it has relatively few side effects and can be taken orally at home. With this drug, more than 90% of patients {{will be able to}} keep the disease in check for at least five years, so that CML becomes a chronic, manageable condition.|$|E
25|$|As the {{incidence}} of SCLC has declined somewhat in the U.S. in recent decades, {{it is likely that}} c-SCLC has also decreased in incidence. Nevertheless, small cell carcinomas (including the c-SCLC variant) still comprise 15–20% of all lung cancers, with c-SCLC probably accounting for 4–6%. With 220,000 cases of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> lung cancer in the U.S. each year, it can be estimated that between 8,800 and 13,200 of these are c-SCLC.|$|E
25|$|Homophobia is {{stirred in}} fictional Llanview in early 1992 with new arrivals to town Reverend Andrew Carpenter (Wortham Krimmer), and Andrew's father and retired army general Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes). Sloan is <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with Hodgkin's {{lymphoma}} {{and had come}} to town {{to make peace with}} his son Andrew. Andrew then seeks out to make peace with his father about his gay brother, William, who dies of the HIV/AIDS virus off-screen and for whom Sloan is ashamed.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{non-invasive}} transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) {{is performed}} in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF, {{as well as}} if there is a major change in the patient's clinical state. This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify valvular heart disease (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke), left and right atrial size (which indicates likelihood that AF may become permanent), left ventricular size and function, peak right ventricular pressure (pulmonary hypertension), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensitivity), presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and pericardial disease.|$|E
25|$|The American Cancer Society {{estimates}} that in 2014, about 5,980 {{new cases of}} chronic myelogenous leukemia were diagnosed, and about 810 people died of the disease. This means that a little over 10% of all <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> leukemia cases will be chronic myelogenous leukemia. The average risk of a person getting this disease is 1 in 588. The disease {{is more common in}} men than women, and more common in whites than African-Americans. The average age at diagnosis is 64 years, and this disease is rarely seen in children.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{approach}} these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control seeks to reduce the heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2011 federal election, Layton led {{the party}} {{into the first}} month of the new session of Parliament, as well as {{attending}} the NDP Federal Convention in Vancouver. After Parliament rose for the summer, Layton announced on July 25, 2011 that he would be taking a temporary leave from his post to fight an unspecified, <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> cancer. He was hoping to return as leader of the NDP upon the resumption of the House of Commons on September 19, 2011. Layton recommended that NDP caucus chair Nycole Turmel serve as interim leader during his leave of absence.|$|E
25|$|The {{proportion}} of HIV cases {{that can be}} attributed to the result of homosexual relations varies according to geography. In Russia, among newly registered HIV cases in 2006 where the mode of transmission was known, about one half was due to heterosexual intercourse, and this proportion has been steadily increasing. Almost 60% of cases were attributed to unsafe sex between men. In the Caribbean, it is estimated that about 40% of reported HIV cases are the result of unsafe sex between men. About 53% of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> HIV infections in the United States, in 2005, were among men who have sex with men. The largest {{proportion of}} new HIV infection in Canada, in 2002, was accounted for by unprotected sex between men, whereas in Western Europe the highest proportion was accounted for by heterosexual intercourse.|$|E
25|$|A {{screening}} {{program a}} year later in 2012 {{found that more than}} a third (36%) of children in Fukushima Prefecture have abnormal growths in their thyroid glands. As of August 2013, there have been more than 40 children <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with thyroid cancer and other cancers in Fukushima prefecture as a whole. In 2015, the number of thyroid cancers or detections of developing thyroid cancers numbered 137. However, whether these incidences of cancer are elevated above the rate in un-contaminated areas and therefore were due to exposure to nuclear radiation is unknown at this stage. Data from the Chernobyl accident showed that an unmistakable rise in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986 only began after a cancer incubation period of 3–5 years; however, whether this data can be directly compared to the Fukushima nuclear disaster is yet to be determined.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} imatinib {{resistance and}} to increase responsiveness to TK inhibitors, four novel agents were later developed. The first, dasatinib, blocks several further oncogenic proteins, in addition to more potent inhibition of the BCR-ABL protein, and was initially approved in 2007 by the US FDA to treat CML in patients who were either resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. A second new TK inhibitor, nilotinib, was also approved by the FDA for the same indication. In 2010, nilotinib and dasatinib were also approved for first-line therapy, making three drugs in this class available for treatment of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> CML. In 2012, Radotinib joined the class of novel agents in the inhibition of the BCR-ABL protein and was approved in South Korea for patients resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. Bosutinib received US FDA and EU European Medicines Agency approval on September 4, 2012 and 27 March 2013 respectively {{for the treatment of}} adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance, or intolerance to prior therapy.|$|E

[...] On 11 December 2007, Pratchett posted online that he had been <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which had been responsible for the [...] "stroke". He had a rare form of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), [...] a disease in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel.|$|E

2500|$|Independently, ARIAD pharmaceuticals, {{adapting}} the chemical structures from first and second-generation TK inhibitors, {{arrived at a}} new pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor which showed (for the first time) [...] efficacy against T315I, {{as well as all}} other known mutations of the oncoprotein. The drug, ponatinib, gained FDA approval in December 2012 for treatment of patients with resistant or intolerant CML. Just as with second generation TK inhibitors, early approval is being sought to extend the use of ponatinib to <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> CML also.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} cases {{worldwide}} has significantly increased since the 1970s, a phenomenon partly attributed to the modern lifestyles. Breast cancer is strongly related to age with only 5% of all breast cancers occurring in women under 40 years old. There were more than 41,000 <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> cases of breast cancer registered in England in 2011, around 80% of these cases were in women age 50 or older [...] Based on U.S. statistics in 2015 there were 2.8 million women affected by breast cancer.|$|E
2500|$|MG affects 50 to 200 {{per million}} people. It is <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{in three to}} 30 per million people each year. Diagnosis is {{becoming}} more common due to increased awareness. It most commonly occurs in women {{under the age of}} 40 and in men over the age of 60. It is uncommon in children. With treatment, most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy. The word is from the Greek mys [...] "muscle" [...] and astheneia [...] "weakness", and the [...] "serious".|$|E
2500|$|Prognosis {{depends on}} the stage of the cancer. The chance of a {{survival}} rate is nearly 100% for women with microscopic forms of cervical cancer. [...] With treatment, the five-year relative survival rate for the earliest stage of invasive cervical cancer is 92%, and the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate is about 72%. These statistics may be improved when applied to women <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> bearing in mind that these outcomes may be partly based on the state of treatment five years ago when the women studied were first diagnosed.|$|E
2500|$|Information on the {{frequency}} of conversion disorder in the West is limited, {{in part due to}} the complexities of the diagnostic process. In neurology clinics, the reported prevalence of unexplained symptoms among new patients is very high (between 30 and 60%). However, diagnosis of conversion typically requires an additional psychiatric evaluation, and since few patients will see a psychiatrist it is unclear what proportion of the unexplained symptoms are actually due to conversion. [...] Large scale psychiatric registers in the US and Iceland found incidence rates of 22 and 11 <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Some estimates claim that in the general population, between 0.011% and 0.5% of the population have conversion disorder.|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2013, {{there have}} been more than 40 {{children}} <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with thyroid cancer and other cancers in Fukushima prefecture. 18 of these were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, but these cancers are not attributed to radiation from Fukushima, as similar patterns occurred before the accident in 2006 in Japan, with 1 in 100,000 children per year developing thyroid cancer in that year, that is, this is not higher than the pre-accident rate. While controversial scientist Christopher Busby disagrees, claiming the rate of thyroid cancer in Japan was 0.0 children per 100,000 in 2005, the Japan Cancer Surveillance Research Group showed a thyroid cancer rate of 1.3 per 100,000 children in 2005 based on official cancer cases. As a point of comparison, thyroid cancer incidence rates after the Chernobyl accident of 1986 did not begin to increase above the prior baseline value of about 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year until 1989 to 1991, 3 to 5 years after the accident in both the adolescent and children age groups. Therefore, data from Chernobyl suggests that an increase in thyroid cancer around Fukushima is not expected to begin to be seen until at least 3 to 5 years after the accident ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{persistent}} rumors suggesting otherwise, {{there is}} no clear association between water fluoridation and cancer or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for bone cancer and osteosarcoma. Series of research concluded that concentration of fluoride in water doesn't associate with osteosarcoma. The beliefs regarding association of fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma stem from a study of US National Toxicology program in 1990, which showed uncertain evidence of association of fluoride and osteosarcoma in male rats. But there is still no solid evidence of cancer-causing tendency of fluoride in mice. Fluoridation of water has been practiced around the world to improve citizens' dental health. It is also deemed as major health success. Fluoride concentration levels in water supplies are regulated, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates fluoride levels to not be greater than 4 milligrams per liter. Actually, water supplies already have natural occurring fluoride, but many communities chose to add more fluoride {{to the point that it}} can reduce tooth decay. Fluoride is also known for its ability to cause new bone formation. [...] Yet, further research shows no osteosarcoma risks from fluoridated water in humans. Most of the research involved counting number of osteosarcoma patients cases in particular areas which has difference concentrations of fluoride in drinking water. The statistic analysis of the data shows no significant difference in occurrences of osteosarcoma cases in different fluoridated regions. Another important research involved collecting bone samples from osteosarcoma patients to measure fluoride concentration and compare them to bone samples of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> malignant bone tumors. The result is that the median fluoride concentrations in bone samples of osteosarcoma patients and tumor controls are not significantly different. Not only fluoride concentration in bones, Fluoride exposures of osteosarcoma patients are also proven to be not significantly different from healthy people.|$|E
