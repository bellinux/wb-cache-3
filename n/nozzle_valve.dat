With {{a focus on}} diversification in the 1960s, such as the acquisition of Ohio Pattern Works & Foundry Company in 1961, came notable purchases of companies that {{continue to be a}} significant part of Dover Corporation today.

Duerr, invented the automatic shutoff fuel-dispensing <b>nozzle</b> <b>valve.</b> Today, the basic technology of Duerr's invention continues to exist in automatic shutoff nozzles, and OPW is still a part of Dover, specializing in the design and manufacture of commercial and retail-fueling solutions.|$|E
50|$|This type {{was made}} famous by the Super Soaker brand of water guns, {{actually}} first employed by the Cosmic Liquidator. In this device, a pump is used to push air into a partially water-filled reservoir. The reservoir is otherwise air-tight, but it has one valve to let the incoming air in from the pump {{as well as a}} manually controlled valve operated by the user, commonly activated by pulling on a trigger. As more air is pumped in, the air in the reservoir is compressed, increasing in pressure; the water is also pressurized by the now compressed air. Upon opening the <b>nozzle</b> <b>valve,</b> the pressurized water is pushed out through the nozzle as the air attempts to re-equilibrate with atmospheric pressure. This system allows pumping energy to be stored and used as needed. As well, unlike the methods noted above, this air pressure system allows production of a solid, continuous stream of water.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} detecting {{the failure of a}} thrust vector control nozzle, like those proposed on advanced concepts of air-to-air missiles (Figure 1), using a modified Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) algorithm with a Neyman-Pearson based Hypothesis Testing Algorithm (NPHTA). These nozzles are currently being researched as a means to allow stable flight control at high angles of attack. It is likely that the missile would tumble if a nozzle failed during a high angle of attack maneuver, which could produce catastrophic results if the nozzle failure occurred as the missile is separating from the aircraft. Our goal was to determine if the NPHTA version of the MMAE could detect a nozzle failure during the separation flyout maneuver, prior to any high angle of attack maneuvers. The specific failure modes that we examined were single failures of a <b>nozzle</b> <b>valve</b> that was stuck either open or closed. We found that under idea conditions the NPHTA MMAE could detect a <b>nozzle</b> <b>valve</b> failure within one clock cycle (0. 02 seconds) during this initial separation flyout and thus could test the nozzle valves prior to high angle of attack maneuvers...|$|E

The Raman technique was used to monitor local stress fields’ development as the composite is globally loaded in compression for two different composites with reinforcement volume fractions of 13 and 34 %.

40|$|The {{methods for}} {{analysis}} of angular acceleration of pressure and vibration signals {{presented in this paper}} have the advantage of non-contacting signal acquisition and of simple methods for signal processing and feature extraction. The analysis of angular acceleration provides a high sensitivity for the detection of a number of mechanical faults and of faults in the combustion process. It is well suited for the detection of misfiring. In this paper only global features defined over whole working cycles were used. By extracting features from sections of the working cycle a cylinder-specific recognition of misfunctions is feasible. Again statistical methods are well suited. The acceleration signal is a good starting point for the detection of malfunctions, but for the differentiation between several possible causes additional faultspecific methods have to be applied. A wide range of diagnostic methods is known and applied in automotive industry. Generally the exploitation of pressure and vibration signals for diagnostic purposes can be ameliorated. These signals are helpful e. g. in the recognition of faulty valve clearance, of valve leakage and of mechanical faults at injection <b>nozzles.</b> <b>Valve</b> leakage and faults at injection nozzles are factors which also influence the angular acceleration. Therefore methods for the recognition of these faults only were decribed. They have in common a processing strategy based on synchronization to the crankshaft's angular position.

The influence of this new biofabrication technology on biology of living cells, however, is still being evaluated.
