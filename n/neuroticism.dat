25|$|There are two higher-order {{factors that}} both {{taxonomies}} clearly share: extraversion and <b>neuroticism.</b> Both approaches broadly accept that extraversion {{is associated with}} sociability and positive affect, whereas <b>neuroticism</b> is associated with emotional instability and negative affect.|$|E
25|$|In {{multiple}} studies, <b>neuroticism</b> {{has been}} shown to have an equal, if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than extraversion. One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability (<b>neuroticism).</b> The results showed {{no significant difference between the}} happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, <b>neuroticism</b> appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well-being.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{interactions}} between extraversion, <b>neuroticism,</b> and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scale to assess subjective well-being. They found that extraversion only {{served as a}} predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with <b>neuroticism,</b> while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by conscientiousness and <b>neuroticism.</b> In addition {{to the importance of}} including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well-being changes whether extraversion emerges as a salient predictive factor.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, other {{researchers}} have raised concerns {{about the extent to}} which self-report EI measures correlate with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures have been said to converge because they both purport to measure personality traits. Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the Big Five that stand out as most related to self-report EI– <b>neuroticism</b> and extroversion. In particular, <b>neuroticism</b> has been said to relate to negative emotionality and anxiety. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on <b>neuroticism</b> are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have found that SWB {{constructs}} are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the five factor model. Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable. Specifically, <b>neuroticism</b> predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that <b>neuroticism,</b> extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). <b>Neuroticism</b> was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Though {{extraversion}} and <b>neuroticism</b> seem to {{have the}} largest effect on personal happiness, other Big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well-being. For example, one study showed that conscientiousness and agreeableness correlated about 0.20 with subjective well-being. While the effect of these traits was not as strong as extraversion or <b>neuroticism,</b> it is clear that they still have some impact on happiness outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Consumers' {{choices in}} music {{have been studied}} {{as they relate to}} the Big Five {{personality}} traits: openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, <b>neuroticism,</b> and conscientiousness. In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, <b>neuroticism,</b> and conscientiousness). Gender has been shown to influence preference, with men choosing music for primarily cognitive reasons and women for emotional reasons. Relationships with music preference have also been found with mood and nostalgic association.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, it was {{suggested}} that <b>neuroticism</b> has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by conscientiousness.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the three-factor {{approach}} theorizes that <b>neuroticism</b> is mediated by levels of arousal in the limbic system and that individual differences arise because of variable activation thresholds between people. Therefore, highly neurotic people {{when presented with}} minor stressors, will exceed this threshold, whereas people low in <b>neuroticism</b> will not exceed normal activation levels, even when presented with large stressors. By contrast, proponents of the five-factor approach assume a role of genetics and environment but offer no explicit causal explanation.|$|E
25|$|Big Five {{personality}} traits, ("the five-factor model"). Many psychologists currently {{believe that}} five factors are sufficient: <b>neuroticism,</b> extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.|$|E
25|$|Locus {{of control}} {{is one of}} the four {{dimensions}} of core self-evaluations – one's fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with <b>neuroticism,</b> self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997), and since has proven {{to have the ability to}} predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. In a follow-up study, Judge et al. (2002) argued the concepts of locus of control, <b>neuroticism,</b> self-efficacy and self-esteem measured the same, single factor.|$|E
25|$|A {{study has}} {{also found a}} {{positive}} correlation among healthy subjects between altanserin binding and the personality trait <b>neuroticism</b> {{as measured by the}} NEO PI-R personality questionnaire.|$|E
25|$|The {{personality}} hypothesis {{focused on}} the association between smoking and higher level of <b>neuroticism</b> and anxiety. This hypothesis proposed that anxiety as a symptom of schizophrenia may contribute to smoking.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Patrick and Charlotte Markey {{suggested}} that violent video games only caused aggressive feelings in {{individuals who had}} a preexisting disposition, such as high <b>neuroticism,</b> low agreeableness, or low conscientiousness.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that trauma during childhood increases the risk of developing psychosis. A meta-analysis showed that high <b>neuroticism</b> is an independent predictor of the development of psychotic symptoms and psychosis.|$|E
25|$|The two {{personality}} dimensions extraversion and <b>neuroticism</b> {{were described}} in his 1967 book Dimensions of Personality. It is {{common practice in}} personality psychology {{to refer to the}} dimensions by the first letters, E and N.|$|E
25|$|Being {{neurotic}} {{increases the}} risk of developing Alzheimer's, a type of dementia. <b>Neuroticism</b> is associated with increased brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in life, while conscientiousness has a protective effect by preventing brain atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{in later}} studies, {{researchers}} used assessment scales {{to test for}} categories such as self-esteem and life-goal orientation, which they had positively correlated with happiness. Participants’ responses to these scales suggested that <b>neuroticism</b> actually had a larger impact than extraversion in measures of well-being.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that people high in agreeableness are more emotionally {{responsive}} in social situations. This effect was measured on both self-report questionnaires and physiological measures, and offers evidence that extraversion and <b>neuroticism</b> {{are not the only}} Big Five personality factors that influence emotion. The effect was especially pronounced among women.|$|E
25|$|N - Neuroticism/Stability: <b>Neuroticism</b> or emotionality is {{characterized}} by high levels of negative affect such as depression and anxiety. <b>Neuroticism,</b> according to Eysenck's theory, is based on activation thresholds in the sympathetic nervous system or visceral brain. This {{is the part of}} the brain that is responsible for the fight-or-flight response in the face of danger. Activation can be measured by heart rate, blood pressure, cold hands, sweating and muscular tension (especially in the forehead). Neurotic people — who have low activation thresholds, and unable to inhibit or control their emotional reactions, experience negative affect (fight-or-flight) in the face of very minor stressors — are easily nervous or upset. Emotionally stable people — who have high activation thresholds and good emotional control, experience negative affect only in the face of very major stressors — are calm and collected under pressure.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{coping skills}} (e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, affective instability, and {{inability}} {{to focus on}} problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity. Temperament (e.g., <b>neuroticism)</b> and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) {{have been found to}} be risk factors for anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion and <b>Neuroticism</b> in the Big Five {{are very}} similar to Eysenck's traits of the same name. However, what he calls the trait of Psychoticism {{corresponds}} to two traits in the Big Five model: Conscientiousness and Agreeableness (Goldberg & Rosalack 1994). Eysenck's personality system did not address Openness to experience. He argued that his approach was a better description of personality.|$|E
25|$|Conscientiousness {{is one of}} {{the five}} major {{dimensions}} in the Big Five model (also called Five Factor Model) of personality, which also consists of extraversion, <b>neuroticism,</b> openness to experience, and agreeableness (OCEAN acronym). Two of many personality tests that assess these traits are Costa and McCrae's NEO PI-R and Goldberg's NEO-IPIP. According to these models, conscientiousness {{is considered to be a}} continuous dimension of personality, rather than a categorical 'type' of person.|$|E
25|$|Rather, {{according}} to {{professor of psychology}} Bernardo J. Carducci, introverts choose to avoid social situations because they derive no reward from them or may find surplus sensory input overwhelming, whereas shy people may fear such situations. Research using the statistical techniques of factor analysis and correlation have found shyness overlaps mildly with both introversion and <b>neuroticism</b> (i.e., negative emotionality). Low societal acceptance of shyness or introversion may reinforce a shy or introverted individual's low self-confidence.|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{appears to}} have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person calm down and focus. Prayer is also {{positively}} correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and <b>neuroticism</b> according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to <b>neuroticism</b> scores. Ladd and McIntosh (2008) suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the hands together in an almost fetal position, are suggestive of “social touch” actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased {{blood flow to the}} head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{pregnancy}} result, IVF treatment is usually stressful for patients. <b>Neuroticism</b> {{and the use}} of escapist coping strategies are associated with a higher degree of distress, while the presence social support has a relieving effect. A negative pregnancy test after IVF is associated with an increased risk for depression in women, but not with any increased risk of developing anxiety disorders. Pregnancy test results {{do not seem to be}} a risk factor for depression or anxiety among men.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the causes, however, psychoticism {{marks the}} two {{approaches}} apart, as the five factor model contains no such trait. Moreover, psychoticism, unlike {{any of the other}} factors in either approach, does not fit a normal distribution curve. Indeed, scores are rarely high, thus skewing a normal distribution. However, when they are high, there is considerable overlap with psychiatric conditions such as antisocial and schizoid personality disorders. Similarly, high scorers on <b>neuroticism</b> are more susceptible to sleep and psychosomatic disorders. Five factor approaches can also predict future mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|These {{results suggest}} that the four MBTI scales can be {{incorporated}} within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that the MBTI lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, has addressed that dimension). Emotional stability (or <b>neuroticism)</b> is a predictor of depression and anxiety disorders. These correlations refer to the second letter shown, i.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with extraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive correlations with agreeableness and openness, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Vicarious shame: {{refers to}} the {{experience}} of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to <b>neuroticism</b> and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper). The Dutch term for this feeling is 'plaatsvervangende schaamte', the German term is 'die Fremdscham' and in the Spanish language it is referred to as 'vergüenza ajena'.|$|E
25|$|The {{researchers}} also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning (Raven's matrices), which they interpreted as {{support for the}} personality trait view of EI (as opposed {{to a form of}} intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were positively related to some of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness) as well as inversely related to others (alexithymia, <b>neuroticism).</b> A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores. Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.|$|E
25|$|Hans Eysenck {{described}} extraversion-introversion as {{the degree}} to which a person is outgoing and interactive with other people. These behavioral differences are presumed to be the result of underlying differences in brain physiology. Eysenck combined cortical inhibition and excitation with the ascending reticular activation system (ARAS), a pathway located in the brainstem. Extraverts seek excitement and social activity in an effort to heighten their arousal level, whereas introverts tend to avoid social situations in an effort to keep such arousal to a minimum. Eysenck designated extraversion as one of three major traits in his P-E-N model of personality, which also includes psychoticism and <b>neuroticism.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that self-reported and Trait EI measures retain a fair amount of predictive validity for job performance after controlling Big Five traits and IQ. Newman, Joseph, and MacCann contend that the greater predictive validity of Trait EI measures is due to their inclusion of content related to achievement motivation, self efficacy, and self-rated performance. Meta-analytic evidence confirms that self-reported emotional intelligence predicting job performance is due to mixed EI and trait EI measures' tapping into self-efficacy and self-rated performance, in addition to the domains of <b>Neuroticism,</b> Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and IQ. As such, the predictive ability of mixed EI to job performance drops to nil when controlling for these factors.|$|E
25|$|Predictors of poor {{mental health}} after a trauma, such as mental health status {{prior to a}} trauma and {{individual}} characteristics, can help determine those who will be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Those that exhibit lower mental health prior to an earthquake {{will be more likely}} to experience negative life changes than positive life changes with regard to personal strength. Depressive symptoms before a disaster can predict higher chances of developing PTSD following a trauma. People who exhibit lower mental health prior to the trauma don't adapt as well following trauma, and show higher levels of PTSD. Personality traits, such as <b>neuroticism</b> and low self-control are associated with a lower sense of normalcy following an earthquake, however optimism is predictive of lower and less severe PTSD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Impulsivity is {{characterized}} by actions based on sudden desires, whims, or inclinations rather than careful thought. Individuals with substance abuse {{have higher levels of}} impulsivity, and individuals who use multiple drugs tend to be more impulsive. A number of studies using the Iowa gambling task as a measure for impulsive behavior found that drug using populations made more risky choices compared to healthy controls. There is a hypothesis that the loss of impulse control may be due to impaired inhibitory control resulting from drug induced changes that take place in the frontal cortex. The neurodevelopmental and hormonal changes that happen during adolescence may modulate impulse control that could possibly lead to the experimentation with drugs and may lead to the road of addiction. Impulsivity is thought to be a facet trait in the <b>neuroticism</b> personality domain (overindulgence/negative urgency) which is prospectively associated with the development of substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|The affective {{reactivity}} model {{states that}} {{the strength of a}} person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in affect. This model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of <b>neuroticism</b> and introversion. Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS reported higher levels of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS reported higher levels of positive affect. Also Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction.|$|E
25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to <b>neuroticism.</b> Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E
