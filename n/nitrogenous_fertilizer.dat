25|$|In the Punjab {{region of}} India and Pakistan, {{as well as}} North China, {{irrigation}} {{has been a major}} contributor to increased grain output. More widely over the last 40 years, a massive increase in fertilizer use together with the increased availability of semi-dwarf varieties in developing countries, has greatly increased yields per hectare. In developing countries, use of (mainly <b>nitrogenous)</b> <b>fertilizer</b> increased 25-fold in this period. However, farming systems rely on much more than fertilizer and breeding to improve productivity. A good illustration of this is Australian wheat growing in the southern winter cropping zone, where, despite low rainfall (300mm), wheat cropping is successful even with relatively little use of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> This is achieved by 'rotation cropping' (traditionally called the ley system) with leguminous pastures and, in the last decade, including a canola crop in the rotations has boosted wheat yields by a further 25%. In these low rainfall areas, better use of available soil-water (and better control of soil erosion) is achieved by retaining the stubble after harvesting and by minimizing tillage.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of certain versions of wheat genes has been important for crop yields. Apart from mutant versions of genes selected in antiquity during domestication, {{there has been}} more recent deliberate selection of alleles that affect growth characteristics. Genes for the 'dwarfing' trait, first used by Japanese wheat breeders to produce short-stalked wheat, have had a huge effect on wheat yields worldwide, and were major factors {{in the success of}} the Green Revolution in Mexico and Asia, an initiative led by Norman Borlaug. Dwarfing genes enable the carbon that is fixed in the plant during photosynthesis to be diverted towards seed production, and they also help prevent the problem of lodging. 'Lodging' occurs when an ear stalk falls over in the wind and rots on the ground, and heavy nitrogenous fertilization of wheat makes the grass grow taller and become more susceptible to this problem. By 1997, 81% of the developing world's wheat area was planted to semi-dwarf wheats, giving both increased yields and better response to <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{propagated}} {{entirely by}} seed. In the transitional zone of West Africa this crop is sown during the major rainy season between March and May. Here the soils {{are rich in}} organic matter with a high rainfall of 1,400mm distributed April–October. Propagation starts after the first couple heavy rainfalls of the season. Holes around 2cm deep and 1 m apart are planted with 3-4 seeds in each. A complete fertilizer should be applied before the propagation, with periodical application of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizer</b> to follow. [...] Growing methods contrast in the northern savannahs where conditions are more challenging with low fertility and organic matter. Rainfall in this zone is small at 800mm annually. Cucumeropsis mannii is more successful in this area as a mixed crop, specifically grown in the ridges of sorghum crops. In more challenged areas this crop should be spaced at least 3 m apart, greatly decreasing per-hectare production. After 6–8 months, around September–December the fruit are ready for harvest. The physical signs of ripe fruit include creamy colour and dried stems and leaves. Each plant averages at 2-5 fruits, each weighing 0.8-1.8kg and containing 90-400 seeds.|$|E

It is an ideal multicellular organism for the rapid toxicological screening of substances for mutagenicity. Boule gene was {{shown to be a}} key regulator of meiosis in Drosophila. Boule-deficient fruit flies are infertile and display meiotic arrest in the male germ cells. Investigation of the impact of some <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizers</b> on the expression of Drosophila boule gene had been performed. Newly hatched larvae were treated with the LC 25 and LC 50 of the three tested <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizers</b> Urea, Ammonium nitrate and Calcium nitrate. The study includes the isolation and molecular characterization of the Drosophila boule gene homolog to the human DAZ gene. Total RNA have been isolated from untreated and treated D. melanogaster adult male flies. Fragments of the boule gene were recovered with RT-PCR for sequencing. Treated and untreated Drosophila melanogaster boule gene express the same pattern of transcripts. The sequence of the boule fragments of the treated adult males with the LC 25 and LC 50 of the three tested <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizers</b> showed different types of mutations such as substitution, deletion and insertion mutations. These results indicate that the three <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizers</b> used posses mutagenic potentialities. The mutagenic activity is due to their Nitrogen (N) content.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} contributing factor for the improvement of crop yields, since last one and half decade. Though farmers are advised by the extension workers to use recommended dose of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> it is not adopted because of the physical outcome of fertilizer application. The excessive use of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilizers</b> has resulted in higher plant protection chemicals and has further resulted in increase in pest incidence, but also high cost structure in the production process. In order to examine different dimensions of economic aspects of selected inputs, a study was carried out in Tungabhadra project (TBP) area of Karnataka during the year 2010 - 11 for which multistage random sampling design was employed for a sample size of 90 farmers. The study revealed that the extent of application of insecticides increased from 5413 ml/g a. i/ha to 7338 ml/g a. i/ha, fungicides application from 805 ml/g a. i/ha to 1283 ml/g a. i/ha and weedicides from 4853 ml/g a. i/ha to 7625 ml/g a. i/ha from nitrogen level 1 (upto 50 % RD of nitrogen) to nitrogen level 3 (> 100 % RD of nitrogen), respectively. Thus, the total cost incurred towards plant protection chemicals ranged from ` 15886 /ha to ` 24442 / ha from nitrogen level 1 to 3, respectively in paddy cultivation.
