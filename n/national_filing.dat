40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that with the success of the European Patent Office (EPO), and {{in the context of a}} European Community (EC) which now has a single market, that national patenting in European countries is an anachronism. However, although <b>national</b> <b>filing</b> figures in EC countries have decreased in the past decade, whilst those in non-EC countries increased, this decline has apparently now levelled off. There is a continued demand for national patenting which should be met so that no company or individual is forced to use the European regional system where that is inappropriate. ...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{processing}} of international trademark application under the Madrid Agreement and the Protocol to this Agreement. The aim {{of the work is}} to evaluate the functionality and benefits of the Madrid system on the basis of an analysis of the international filing procedure (i. e. through the Madrid system), supported by a comparison with <b>national</b> <b>filing.</b> The work responds {{to the question of whether}} the Madrid system fulfills its purpose, i. e. whether it simplifies registration of trademarks abroad, whether the international filing is financially advantageous and time-savings, and what other benefits it brings. On the other hand, the author seeks to identify and point out the disandvantages and potential pitfalls of the system. The work thus provides to potential applicants all the necessary information to determine whether to use the international way of trademark registration and what to do for a successful registration...|$|E
40|$|Personal {{bankruptcies}} {{soared in}} the U. S. between 1994 and 1998. Nearly 1. 4 million U. S. households {{filed for bankruptcy}} protection in 1998, about a half million more than in 1995. One activity which can precipitate personal financial crises and has also experienced growth as dramatic as personal bankruptcies over the past decade is the volume of commercial gaming, especially casino gambling. This paper attempts to empirically determine whether casino gambling is associated with higher bankruptcy filing rates in and around counties where casinos have located. Our analysis predicts an 8 % decline in 1998 filing rates for casino and collar counties, and a 1. 4 % decline in filing rates nationwide if one were to eliminate casino gambling. We conclude that the proximity of casino gambling appears to be associated with higher bankruptcy rates, but the local impact is far more pronounced than the influence of casino gambling on <b>national</b> <b>filing</b> rates. Nationwide, the incidence and growth of casino gambling over the past decade does not explain much of the rise in bankruptcies during the period.

40|$|Personal {{bankruptcies}} {{soared in}} the United States between 1994 and 1998. One activity that can precipitate personal financial crises {{and that has}} also experienced dramatic growth is commercial gambling, especially casino gambling. This article builds a simple model of bankruptcy choice and empirically tests the model using unique county-level data on debt, income, household age, population density, and casino gambling as well as state measures of employment and marital stability, health insurance coverage, and garnishment restrictions. The authors find that the proximity of casino gambling appears {{to be associated with}} higher bankruptcy rates, but that the local impact is far more pronounced than the influence of casino gambling on the <b>national</b> <b>filing</b> rate. To quantify the magnitude of the impact, the analysis predicts over a 5 % decline in 1998 filing rates for counties surrounding a casino, and a 1 % decline in the nationwide filing rate if one were to eliminate casino gambling. Consequently, although casino gambling exerts important local effects, nationwide the incidence and growth of casino gambling does not explain much of the rise in bankruptcies during the past decade.
