Alyx contacts Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner, who have escaped the city, and is informed the Citadel's core is at risk of exploding at any moment. Kleiner states the explosion could {{be large enough to}} level the whole of City 17, and the only way for them to survive is to re-enter the Citadel and slow the core's progression toward meltdown. Eli reluctantly agrees when he sees <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2011, Electronic Arts {{announced}} that the online game servers would be shut down on January 11, 2011 for the Xbox 360 format of the game. The PC version of the game was shut down on December 31, 2010. Electronic Arts noted that their discontinuation {{of support for the}} game was partly because the licensing deal with New Line Cinema (holders of the Lord of the Rings license) had expired, which led them to <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option</b> than to shut down all online services for the game.|$|E
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders {{do not want to}} select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option.</b> For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E

The matchup of Virginia Tech and Cincinnati was out of character for the Sun Bowl, which traditionally matched the champion of the Border Conference with the best possible opponent. Hardin-Simmons University, champions of the Border Conference, declined a Sun Bowl bid, as did the second-place team, Texas Tech. With <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option,</b> a member of the Sun Bowl Committee—who happened to be an alumnus of Virginia Tech—suggested inviting the Hokies to play against Cincinnati, which had already accepted an invitation.|$|E

Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.|$|E
5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option</b> they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E

5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option,</b> he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1964, Epstein {{approached}} Harry {{to create}} a national music paper, so Harry coined the name Music Echo, and gradually merged Mersey Beat into it. Epstein had promised Harry full editorial control, but then hired a female press officer in London to write a fashion column and a D.J. to write a gossip column, without informing Harry of his intentions, leaving Harry with <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option</b> but to resign. The paper subsequently ran into financial problems, and Epstein had to merge it with another paper, becoming the Disc & Music Echo. When Harry and his wife moved to London in 1966, he was already contributing a column for the magazine Weekend and also for the teen magazines Marilyn and Valentine. He then became the feature writer, news editor and columnist for Record Mirror (using various pseudonyms such as 'Brenda Tarry' and 'David Berglas'), and wrote features for Music Now (under the name of Nick Blaine) for Record Retailer.|$|E

Subramaniam cares for his family a lot and excessively dotes upon his children. Santosh, the younger son, does not like this as he wants to be independent and free from his father’s guidance and control. But Santosh acts normally to avoid hurting his father. Santosh has in mind that both his career and wife should be of his choice only and not of his father. Subramaniam wants Santosh to assist him in managing the company but Santosh dreams of starting a new company on his own and does not prefer to work in his father’s company. Meanwhile, Subramaniam arranges Santosh’s wedding with Rajeshwari, daughter of his friend Ramamoorthy.

5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>option.</b> Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E
