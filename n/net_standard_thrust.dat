40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} the effect of engine installation parameters such as engine position, size and power setting on the performance of a typical 300 seater aircraft at cruise condition. Two engines with very-high by-pass ratio and with different fan diameters and specific thrusts are initially simulated in isolation to determine the thrust and drag forces for an isolated configuration. The two engines are then assessed in an engine-airframe configuration to determine the sensitivity of the overall installation penalty to the vertical and axial engine location. The breakdown of the interference force is investigated to determine the aerodynamic origins of beneficial or penalising forces. To complete the cruise study a range of engine power settings were considered to determine the installation penalty at different phases of cruise. This work concludes with the preliminary assessment of cruise fuel burn for two engines. For the baseline engine, across the range of installed positions the resultant thrust requirement varied by 1. 7 % of <b>standard</b> <b>net</b> <b>thrust.</b> The larger engine was less sensitive with a variation of 1. 3 %. For an assessment over a 10000 km cruise flight the overall effect of the lower specific thrust engine showed that the cycle benefits of – 5. 8 % in specific fuel consumption was supplemented by a relatively beneficial aerodynamic installation effect but offset by the additional weight to give a - 4. 8 % fuel burn reduction...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the 280ZX's L28 engine is less powerful than the L24 engine of the 1970 240Z; the difference is due to Nissan adopting the SAE <b>net</b> <b>standard</b> of power measurement, which resulted in lower power ratings than the earlier gross figures and added emissions. However, Nissan designers deliberately sacrificed raw acceleration for improved fuel economy in the 280ZX, so the early 1979 models rated at [...] actually had slower acceleration than the 240Z, largely due to increases in weight and emissions controls.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{entails the}} study of the pulsed-jet {{propulsion}} inspired by cephalopods in the frame of underwater bioinspired robotics. This propulsion routine involves a sequence of consecutive cycles of inflation and collapse of an elastic bladder, which, in the robotics artefact developed by the authors, is enabled by a cable-driven actuation of a deformable shell composed of rubber-like materials. In the present work an all-comprehensive formulation is derived by resorting to a coupled approach that comprises of a model of the structural dynamics of the cephalopod-like elastic bladder and a model of the pulsed-jet thrust production. The bladder, or mantle, is modelled by means of geometrically exact, axisymmetric, nonlinear shell theory, which yields an accurate estimation of the forces involved in driving the deformation of the structure in water. By coupling these results with those from a <b>standard</b> <b>thrust</b> model, the behaviour of the vehicle propelling itself in water is derived. The constitutive laws of the shell are also exploited as control laws with the scope of replicating the muscle activation routine observed in cephalopods. The model is employed to test various shapes, material properties and actuation routines of the mantle. The results are compared in terms of speed performance in order to identify suitable design guidelines. Altogether, the model is tested in more than 50 configurations, eventually providing useful insight for the development of more advanced vehicles and bringing evidence of its reliability in studying the dynamics of both man-made cephalopod-inspired robots and live specimens...|$|R
40|$|Pulse width {{modulated}} converters {{are becoming}} increasingly popular as their cost decreases and power rating increases. The new trend of smallscale power producers, often using renewable energy sources, has created new demands for delivery of energy to the grid. A major advantage of the pulse width modulated converter {{is the ability to}} control the output voltage at any point in the voltage period. This enables rapid response to load changes and non-linear loads. In addition it can shape the voltage in response to the output current to create an outward appearance of a source impedance. This is called a virtual impedance. This thesis presents a controller for a voltage controlled three phase pulse width modulated converter. This controller enables operation in standalone mode, in parallel with other converters in a microgrid, and in parallel with a strong main grid. A time varying virtual impedance is presented which mainly attenuates reactive currents. A method of investigating the overall impedance including the virtual impedance is presented.

To sustain future effectiveness {{it is essential to}} identify and evaluate novel insecticides suitable for nets. Mixtures of two insecticides with contrasting mode of action have the potential to kill resistant vectors and restore transmission control provided the formulation can withstand regular washing over the net’s life span. METHOD: The efficacy of a novel mixture LN, Interceptor® G 2, that combines the pyrrole chlorfenapyr and pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin was evaluated under controlled household conditions (experimental hut trial) and by laboratory bioassay against pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae in Benin before and after standardized washing. Comparison arms included <b>standard</b> alpha-cypermethrin LN, <b>nets</b> hand-treated with chlorfenapyr-only and untreated nets. RESULTS: The chlorfenapyr-alphacypermethrin LN demonstrated improved efficacy and wash resistance compared to a standard alpha-cypermethrin LN against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes (resistance ratio 207). In experimental hut trial alpha-cypermethrin LN killed only 20 % (95 % CI 15 – 26 %) of host-seeking An. gambiae whilst mixture LN killed 71 % (95 % CI 65 – 77 %). Mixture LN washed 20 times killed 65 % (95 % CI 58 – 71 %), and thus intensive washing reduced efficacy by only 6 % (95 % CI 1. 3 – 11 %). The chlorfenapyr net killed 76 % (95 % CI 70 – 81 %).
