A study conducted by Hesp (1982) indicates that depositional length isn’t correlated with the eroded depth but rather the blowout width. In other words, as the depositional lobe increases, the blowout width also increases by a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 in saucer blowouts and 1:4 in trough blowouts.|$|E
5000|$|Check dams have {{traditionally}} been implemented in two main environments: across channel bottoms and on hilly slopes. [...] Check dams are used primarily to control water velocity, conserve soil, and improve land. They are used when other flow-control practices, such as lining the channel or creating bioswales is impractical. Accordingly, they are commonly used in degrading temporary channels, in which permanent stabilization is impractical and infeasible in terms of resource allocation and funding due to the short life period. Or, they are used when construction delays and weather conditions prevent timely installation of other erosion control practices. This is typically seen during the construction process of large-scale permanent dams or erosion control. As such, check dams serve as temporary grade-control mechanisms along waterways until resolute stabilization is established or along permanent swales that need protection prior to installation of a <b>non-erodible</b> lining.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{found in}} coastal {{settings}} and arid margins, blowouts tend to form when wind erodes into patches of bare sand on stabilized vegetative dunes. Generally, blowouts don’t form on actively flowing dunes {{due to the}} fact that they need to be bound by some extent, such as plant roots. These depressions usually start on the higher parts of the stabilized dunes on the account that desiccation and disturbances are more considerable which allows for greater surface drag and sediment entrainment when sand is bare. Most of the time, exposures become quickly re-vegetative before they could become blowouts and expand; however, when the opportunities are given, wind erosion can lower the exposure surface and create a tunneling affect, which increases the wind speed. The depression may continue until it hits a <b>non-erodible</b> substrate or morphology limits it. The eroded substances climbs the steep slopes of the depression and become deposited on the downwind side of the blowout which can form a dune that covers vegetation and lead to a larger area of depression; a process that helps create parabolic dunes.|$|E
50|$|Studies on {{soil erosion}} suggest that {{increased}} rainfall amounts and intensities {{will lead to}} greater rates of soil erosion. Thus, if rainfall amounts and intensities increase {{in many parts of}} the world as expected, erosion will also increase, unless amelioration measures are taken. Soil erosion rates are expected to change in response to changes in climate for a variety of reasons. The most direct is the change in the erosive power of rainfall. Other reasons include: a) changes in plant canopy caused by shifts in plant biomass production associated with moisture regime; b) changes in litter cover on the ground caused by changes in both plant residue decomposition rates driven by temperature and moisture dependent soil microbial activity as well as plant biomass production rates; c) changes in soil moisture due to shifting precipitation regimes and evapo-transpiration rates, which changes infiltration and runoff ratios; d) soil erodibility changes due to decrease in soil organic matter concentrations in soils that lead to a soil structure that is more susceptible to erosion and increased runoff due to increased soil surface sealing and crusting; e) a shift of winter precipitation from non-erosive snow to erosive rainfall due to increasing winter temperatures; f) melting of permafrost, which induces an erodible soil state from a previously <b>non-erodible</b> one; and g) shifts in land use made necessary to accommodate new climatic regimes.|$|E
40|$|The bed of some rivers {{partially}} {{consists of}} <b>non-erodible</b> layers. These <b>non-erodible</b> layers may become obstacles for navigation during the low-water period. To improve navigation {{development in the}} future, one can consider {{the removal of the}} <b>non-erodible</b> layers. To predict the morphological consequences due to these works, knowledge about the effects of <b>non-erodible</b> layers on the bed level of the river is necessary. The present research was concentrated at the following two main subjects: Sediment transport travelling over <b>non-erodible</b> layers. Bed level variations upstream and downstream of the <b>non-erodible</b> layer. The latter subject is subdivided into the cases of a short and a long <b>non-erodible</b> layer. Aspects which were studied with respect to the description of sediment transport over <b>non-erodible</b> layers were: Incipient motion of sediment particles on a fixed bed. Bedforms on a <b>non-erodible</b> layer. Roughness of <b>non-erodible</b> layers, with or without the influence of bedforms. In the theories concerning the alluvial bed and the above mentioned subjects, it was pointed out were these theories are not valid in the case of <b>non-erodible</b> layers. Suggestions for adaptations of these theories are given. The most important adaptation is the introduction of a reduction function which defines che sediment transport reduction in comparison with the alluvial situation. Next analytical solutions for the bed level variations upstream and downstream of the <b>non-erodible</b> layer were derived using Laplace transforms. To do this, the basic equations were linearized and boundary conditions were derived. Relatively much attention was payed to the boundary conditions at the <b>non-erodible</b> layer. Suggestions were made of how the research results concerning sediment transport over <b>non-erodible</b> layers could be used in the determination of these boundary conditions. Finally the analytical solutions were compared with numerical results which were obtained from calculations with an adapted version of the computer program ODIRMO (version 3. 0). The calculations were made using data of the Mekong river (Thailand). The research led to the following results: Insight into the usefulness and shortcomings of the present sediment transport models of <b>non-erodible</b> layers is obtained. The analytical solutions of the bed level variations upstream and downstream the <b>non-erodible</b> layer agree well with the numerical results of ODIRMO. Now a computer program is available (ODIRMO, version 3. 0) which can simulate <b>non-erodible</b> layers in rivers using the adaptations in sediment transport and roughness modeis.

In this paper, we present an original approach for avoiding computation of non-physical bed levels, using an iterative procedure to correct the outward sediment fluxes. The procedure is shown to be computationally efficient while it achieves a high accuracy in terms of mass conservation.

40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} the world’s {{most serious}} {{environmental}} problems (Jankauskas et al, 2008). It can cause extensive losses of crop yields and cultivated and potentially productive soils (Fullen & Catt, 2004; Morgan, 1995; Skoien, 1995). Soils which are highly eroded are more easily subjected to a redundancy of productivity and are poor environments for root growth, due to a degraded structure and lower organic matter contents (Frye et al., 1982; Lindstrom et al., 1994). The mountains and highlands of East Africa are facing the problems of land degradation as well, mainly due to the human impact on the natural ecosystems (Ezaza, 1992). This is enhanced by the high population density. Also deforestation of new land even on steep slopes and over-exploitation of mountain resources, due to the high population density has led to high soil erosion rates (Ezaza, 1988). Because this area is characterized by a steep and rugged topography and most people rely on agriculture due to the fertile soils and favorable agroclimate, many farms suffer from serious soil erosion. The aim of this research was to determine the relation of soil physical properties (i. e. aggregate stability, soil texture, bulk density, porosity, infiltration rate and soil cohesion) and soil erosion rates of several hill slopes with sparse vegetation in the Lushoto district situated in the West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. To achieve this objective the soil physical properties of four highly erosive and four less erosive soils of hill slopes has been determined to find out which of the soil physical properties are contributing most to soil erosion. These hill slopes were approximately equal in amount of vegetation and slope angle. The MMF erosion model has been used to quantify the soil erosion for each hill slope where no erosion measurements are performed. The model has been validated on six other fields for which erosion measurements are performed by Wickama (2010). Aggregate stability was significantly higher for the <b>non-erodible</b> fields for both wet- and dryaggregates and is the most important soil physical property for erodibility of these fields. Difference between erodible and <b>non-erodible</b> fields for wet-aggregate stability is even more pronounced than the difference between these for dry-aggregate stability and shows that water is more important in eroding the soils than wind. Infiltration capacity values were equal higher for the erodible than <b>non-erodible</b> fields. This is contradicting with the aggregate stability values. Due to the installation of the double ring infiltrometer in the crust, which is formed by the disruption of aggregates, the crust is disturbed and infiltration can occur more easily than normally. Variation in profile depth and the occurrence of rubbers and plastics in the soils could have had a minor role in effecting the infiltration rates. Differences between soil texture for erodible and <b>non-erodible</b> fields are only apparent for the fine sand when both depth layer were taken together. For all eight research fields silt and clay content were such that the soils were not vulnerable to erosion with respect to soil texture. The eight fields of investigation, when compared for the erodible fields and <b>non-erodible</b> fields, were quite similar with respect to soil profiles. The erodible soils were somewhat more red and less yellow or brown. From this it can be concluded that on the erodible fields leaching of minerals has occurred leaving only iron and/or aluminium oxides in the soil. No differences occur with respect to soil cohesion and shear strength on the erodible and nonerodible fields. The same applies for bulk density and porosity. The MMF erosion model shows that the erodible and <b>non-erodible</b> fields are approximately equal in erosion rates in case of average rainfall, though when the ratio between rainfall and amount of rain days increases (rain intensity), which is predominantly the case when the amount of rainfall is above average, differences in the amount of erosion become clear: the erodible fields experience more erosion than the <b>non-erodible</b> fields. Protection of the fields to erosion is predominantly due to a high aggregate stability...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} via wind-tunnel experiments {{the role}} of the boundary conditions at the bed in the aeolian sand transport. We analyzed two different bed configurations: one with a sandy erodible bed and the other with a <b>non-erodible</b> bed. By using Particle Tracking Velocimetry technique (PTV), we characterized the saltation layer in both configurations and evidenced contrasting features. We show in particular that over an erodible bed the particle velocity in the saltation layer and the saltation length are almost invariant with the wind strength, whereas over a <b>non-erodible</b> bed these quantities vary significantly with the air friction speed. It results that the particle transport rate over an erodible bed does not exhibit a cubic dependence with the air friction speed, as predicted by Bagnold, but a quadratic one. This contrasts with saltation over nonerodible bed where the cubic Bagnold scaling holds.

40|$|Additional master thesis - To {{mitigate}} {{the effects of}} the hydropower dam development on the Mekong river system, research must be done on the effects of sediment catchment of these dams. With unknown amounts of sediment, stored in the banks and in local bars, all spread over this long bedrock channel, local sediment transports are hard to predict. Especially, in the case of implementation of a dam, the reduction in available sediment and so the sediment transport is difficult to determine. In this research different Delft 3 D input is tested to model the reduction in sediment transport. The various options were the local change of roughness, change of threshold for sediment reduction for sediment close to <b>non-erodible</b> layers, increasing the density (locally) of sediment, controlling the maximum erosion as percentage of the water depth and the local change of available sediment at the bed. This was all done using two different sediment transport formulations of Wilcock, both for sand-gravel mixtures. The best solution {{turned out to be the}} change of the threshold for sediment reduction for sediment close to <b>non-erodible</b> layers.

40|$|The {{dispersive}} and erodible {{nature of}} some loess soils on the Port Hills {{results in a}} variety of mass movement, surface and sub-surface erosion features. These features produce engineering problems for residential development, and chemical stabilisation techniques have been used to reduce and/or prevent further erosion by rendering the soils non-dispersive and non erodible. Field and laboratory investigations were undertaken to characterise the dispersive and erodible nature of Whaka Terrace subdivision loess, as well as to assess changes in chemistry and mineralogy of the chemically stabilised soils. Field investigation included engineering geological mapping, geophysical surveying, hand auger hole drilling and logging, and sampling. The application of 1 %, 2 %, and 4 % hydrated lime, quicklime, Portland cement, gypsum, and a mixture of hydrated lime and gypsum (on a 1 : 1 basis) was used to stabilise erodible loess-colluvium in the laboratory. Evaluation tests included permeability, pinhole erodibility, jar slaking, uniaxial swelling, crumb dispersion, unconfined compressive strength, undrained shear strength, and the determination of optimum moisture content, Atterberg limits and grainsize distribution. Soil chemistry was analysed using pH, soluble salts, organic content, cation exchange capacity and XRF, while XRD, SEM and EDAX were used to study soil mineralogy and fabric. Application of 1 and 2 % quicklime and hydrated lime produces a <b>non-erodible,</b> non-dispersive and durable material which resists slaking and swelling during saturation, and wetting and drying cycles. Application of Portland cement at higher concentration (2 and 4 %) produces similar results to that of hydrated lime and quicklime, while gypsum fails to produce a <b>non-erodible</b> and durable material. Furthermore, although the application of a mixed hydrated lime and gypsum stabiliser produces a non-dispersive and <b>non-erodible</b> material, it fails to produce a durable material and mixed stabiliser soils possess a high potential for swelling and slaking. The unconfined compressive strength and shear strength of all stabilised samples except gypsum increases by 2 - 3 times relative to the untreated samples. This increase in strength is related to the production of pozzolanic cementing agents (pozzolanic reaction) in the chemically stabilised samples. The presence of cementing agents also changes the strain deformation of treated samples by producing a more brittle material relative to the untreated samples...|$|E
40|$|Local scour {{downstream}} of {{sluice gates}} in erosive beds {{is one of}} the main concerns of hydraulic engineers because it can cause considerable damage to structures. Many researchers have conducted various studies to predict the maximum depth and length of scour holes and to develop new methods to control this phenomenon. In the methods that have recently been examined, embedded buried plates are used to control the scour in the erosive beds. In this study, using a physical model, the effect of buried plates in erosive beds on the depth of scour downstream of a hydraulic jump was studied. Several experiments were performed in which plates were buried at 50 ° and 90 ° angles at different distances from the apron in open channels with horizontal and reverse bed slopes. The results of experiments in which the scour profiles were drawn in dimensionless forms show that the angle and position of the plates are important to controlling and reducing scour depth. In fact, by reducing the angle of buried plates, the maximum depth of scour is also reduced. Also, comparison of the results of a single buried plate and double buried plates shows that using two buried plates at the distances of 30 and 45  cm from the <b>non-erodible</b> bed is more effective in reducing the scour depth.

A <b>non-erodible</b> rill was built in which roughness was reproduced in detail. In order to assess only the rill macroroughness, a flat channel with a similar micro-roughness to that in the rill replica was built. Rill and channel experiments were carried out at a slope of 8 degrees and at six discharges (8. 3 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the rill, and eight discharges (1. 6 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the channel. <b>Non-erodible</b> aggregates of three sizes (1 - 2, 3 - 5 and 5 - 10 mm) were released at the inlet of the rill/channel. The number of aggregates received at the outlet was registered. The number and position of the remaining aggregates along the rill/channel were also determined. The rill flow was a major sediment transport mechanism only during the formation of the rill, as during that period the power of the flow was great enough to overcome the influence of the macro-roughness of the rill bed. At lower discharges the transport capacity in the previously formed rill was significantly less than that in the flat channel under similar slope and discharge. This was determined to be due to local slowing of flow velocities at the exit of rill pools. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The loess {{deposits}} of the Port Hills, Canterbury, {{are subject to}} erosion by natural processes. Urban development of the Port Hills has encountered difficulties due to loess erosion, and in some instances, contributed to erosion. Lime stabilisation is one remedial method {{that can be used}} to reduce erosion problems. This necessitates investigation of the changes to soil properties and strength gains that occur to the loess with the addition of lime. An erodible loess colluvium, from a subdivision with a history of erosion problems, was stabilised with 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 % hydrated lime, and cured under various laboratory conditions. Pinhole erodibility, uniaxial swelling strain, Atterberg limits, grainsize analysis, Proctor compaction testing and a slaking test were used to determine the improvements to soil properties with the addition of lime. Unconfined compressive strength was tested to determine strength gains of lime stabilised soil. The addition of 1 % lime to the soil produced a <b>non-erodible,</b> non-dispersive material. Slaking and swelling were minimised with the addition of higher percent ages of lime (5 %- 7. 5 % respectively). The effective grainsize of the soil was increased on the addition of lime, and plasticity was increased with the addition of up to 5 % lime. Optimum moisture content increases, and dry density decreases with increasing amounts of lime. Strength gains of the lime stabilised loess, varied from 3 – 14 times the strength of the untreated soil depending on the curing method. Strength gains were greatest for air dried samples, although the untreated soil cured in the same manner had a higher dry strength than the lime stabilised soil. Strength gains are optimised at and above 7. 5 % lime with significant strength losses recorded between 2 % and 5 % lime. Strain deformation is reduced with the addition of lime, and the modulus of deformation is increased significantly indicating that lime stabilised loess acts as a brittle material on deformation. The addition of lime to loess in low percentages (1 %), has the effect of producing a <b>non-erodible,</b> non-dispersive material that resists erosion. However, it would appear that to achieve maximum strength of lime stabilised loess, 7. 5 % lime or more must be added to the soil...|$|E
40|$|Floods cause, even {{in modern}} {{countries}}, {{a lot of}} victims and damage every year. Generally, countries invest in prevention and protection, yet, also emergency response measures could be a (last) option. Regarding the latter, a distinction is made between preventive emergency measures (e. g. sand bags to raise the crest level of a flood defence) and curative emergency measures (e. g. measures to combat a breach in a flood defence). It can be stated that the knowledge about the closure of a dike breach and the implementation of emergency measures is not at the desired level. Besides, closing a breach is very difficult and it is rarely performed successfully. There {{is a need for}} research regarding emergency closure of dike breaches indicated by among others Dutch Water Boards. The problems of a dike breach can broadly be categorized in three fields: organizational problems, logistical problems and technical problems. This thesis focusses mainly on the technical problems, distinguishing breach characteristics and type of emergency measures. Therefore, in this thesis the research question is: What is the effectiveness and applicability of curative emergency measures, applied in developing breaches in a Dutch river or lake dike? To get {{a better understanding of the}} effect of emergency measures, simulations of developing breaches including emergency measures can be made with a numerical model. Simulations have several advantages. It allows identification of breach characteristics like duration and breach stages during closure attempts. Furthermore, it can be used to optimize closure strategies and measures and it can help flood managers to prepare for emergency situations. However, such a model is non-existent. Yet, XBeach is capable of simulating emergency measures as so-called <b>non-erodible</b> layers in developing breaches. With some modifications XBeach seems promising for simulating breach development with emergency measures. The modifications are based on XBeach’s limitations. First, emergency measures are implemented as <b>non-erodible</b> layers, these are however not adjustable in time. Running multiple simulations after each other representing the different closure phases, solves this problem. Second, the <b>non-erodible</b> layer is always stable. This means that the emergency measure can not move due to high flow velocities or scour during the simulation. This is the main limitation of XBeach for this research. To still be able to check the stability, separate calculations are done. Third, XBeach is not a 3 D model. Therefore, emergency measures where a 3 D effect (piping) plays an important role are not modelled. Fourth, XBeach is only capable of simulations with non-cohesive sand. To deal with this, a scaling from non-cohesive to cohesive timespans was made. For a breach closure in a sand dike, there is (likely too) little time. To estimate the time available in cohesive dikes, the timing is scaled to realistic proportions. Various curative measures exist. Simulated measures in this study in XBeach are a scaffold, Big Bags, a vessel and an emergency dike. The emergency dike seems to be the most promising measure. It makes use of the smaller flow velocities upstream of the breach. The breach dimensions stay smaller and the polder water level is lower. Point of attention is the static stability after the closure, with piping as the most important threat. Logistically seen, a complete closure with an emergency dike for a breach in a clay dike is plausible, using trucks to bring in Big Bags and helicopters to place them at the desired location.

40|$|A novel abuse deterrent, {{prolonged}} release tablet {{formulation of}} Hydrocodone for once-daily dosing has been developed, {{based on the}} novel proprietary Egalet® ADPREM technology. The tablet is an injection molded polymer system consisting of an erodible matrix in which the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), such as Hydrocodone, is dispersed. The matrix is partly covered with a water-impermeable, <b>non-erodible</b> shell which leaves both ends of the cylindrical tablet exposed to erosion by the gastrointestinal (GI) fluid. In vivo–in vitro correlation (IVIVC) was initiated and validated with three formulations. A good internal predictability was observed for the three formulations. How the changing conditions in the GI tract influenced in vivo performance of an erosion based product was discussed. The validated IVIVC could be used to optimize the tablet formulation and to obtain a desired profile. In addition, this technique could help to establish the dissolution limits in which a certainty of bioequivalence is calculated. Based on this validated level A IVIVC, dissolution can be used as surrogate of bioequivalence for development, but also scale up post approval changes...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simplified}} {{model for the}} displacement of a model dune in a constant viscous shear flow over a <b>non-erodible</b> soil. A simplified linear law with a threshold effect (in shear stress) and saturation is used to link the flux of sediments to the shear stress. The asymptotic framework of “Double Deck ” (large Reynolds number laminar flow theory) {{is used for the}} flow. This method allows the computation of boundary layer separation, and the flow may be further simplified with an analytical relation linking the dune shape to the skin friction. For a given shape, the asymptotic solutions give a good agreement with Navier Stokes computations. Examples of displacement of model dunes are presented. We then obtain a selfsimilar coupled problem, predicting that the velocity of the dune is proportional to m− 1 / 4. Computations indicate that there is no dune if the mass of the dune is too small, or if the saturation length is too large, or if the threshold is too small...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A novel {{methodology}} {{has been}} introduced to effectively coat intravascular stents with sirolimus-loaded polymeric microparticles. Methods: Dry powders of the microparticulate formulation, consisting of <b>non-erodible</b> polymers, were produced by a supercritical, aerosol, solvent extraction system (ASES). A design of experiment (DOE) approach {{was conducted on the}} independent variables, such as organic/CO 2 phase volume ratio, polymer weight and stirring-rate, while regression analysis was utilized to interpret the influence of all operational parameters on the dependent variable of particle size. The dry powders, so formed, entered an electric field created by corona charging and were sprayed on the earthed metal stent. Furthermore, the thermal stability of sirolimus was investigated to define the optimum conditions for fusion to the metal surfaces. Results: The electrostatic dry powder deposition technology (EDPDT) was used on the metal strut followed by fusion to produce uniform, reproducible and accurate coatings. The coated stents exhibited sustained release profiles over 25 days, similar to commercial products. EDPDT-coated stents displayed significant reduced platelet adhesion. Conclusions: EDPDT appeared to be a robust accurate and reproducible technology to coat eluting stents...|$|E
40|$|Alternate bars in {{straight}} alluvial channels are migrating or steady. The currently accepted {{view is that}} they are steady only if the width-to-depth ratio is at the value of resonance or if the bars are forced by a steady local perturbation. Experimental observations, however, seem to indicate that steady bars are also present in cases of migrating bars {{in the absence of a}} persistent perturbation. The companion paper by Mosselman (2009) provides a theoretical explanation. We review some experimental observations as well as long-term numerical tests using a 2 D depth-averaged morphological model of a straight channel with <b>non-erodible</b> banks. Small random variations in total discharge are imposed at the upstream boundary. Rapidly growing migrating bars are found to develop first, but slowly growing steady bars are found to evolve subsequently, starting either from upstream or from downstream. Since steady bars are seen as a prerequisite to explain meandering of alluvial rivers, our findings imply that neither resonant width-to-depth ratios nor steady local perturbations are necessary conditions for the onset of river meandering.

40|$|Deposition from particle-laden flows {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of the capacity and competence of the flow, but robust definitions of these terms have proved elusive. In this paper we provide a mathematical modelling framework within which erosion and deposition of polydisperse sediment, and thus flow capacity and competence, can be rigorously defined. This framework explicitly captures the coupling between the suspension and an active layer of sediment {{at the top of the}} bed, and is capable of describing both depositional and erosional flows over both erodible and <b>non-erodible</b> beds. Crucially, the capacity of a flow is shown to depend on the erosional and depositional history because these processes determine the composition of the active layer. This dependence is explored within models of bidisperse and polydisperse suspensions. It is further demonstrated that monodisperse representations of suspended sediment transport may severely underpredict actual flow capacity. The polydisperse model is validated against recent experimental studies of the evolution of suspended material in waning turbulent flows, and is used to demonstrate that loss of capacity is the principal driver of sediment deposition...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new two-layer model of Savage-Hutter type to study {{submarine}} avalanches. A layer composed of fluidized granular material is assumed to flow within an upper layer composed of an inviscid fluid (e. g. water). The model is derived {{in a system of}} local coordinates following a <b>non-erodible</b> bottom and takes into account its curvature. We prove that the model verifies an entropy inequality, preserves water at rest for a sediment layer and their solutions can be seen as particular solutions of incompressible Euler equations under hydrostatic assumptions. Buoyancy effects and the centripetal acceleration of the grain movement due to the curvature of the bottom are considered in the definition of the Coulomb term. We propose a two-step Roe type solver to discretize the presented model. It exactly preserves water at rest and no movement of the sediment layer, when its angle is smaller than the angle of repose, and up to second order all stationary solutions. Finally, some numerical tests are performed by simulating submarine and sub-aerial avalanches as well as the generated tsunami...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{is focused on the}} {{analysis}} of the mean wall friction velocity on a surface including roughness elements exposed to a turbulent boundary layer. These roughness elements represent <b>non-erodible</b> particles over an erodible surface of an agglomeration of granular material on industrial sites. A first study has proposed a formulation that describes the evolution of the friction velocity as a function of geometrical parameters and cover rate with different uniform roughness distributions. The present simulations deal with non-uniform distributions of particles with a random sampling of diameters, heights, positions and arrangements. The evolution (relative to geometrical parameters of the roughness elements) of the friction velocity for several non-uniform distributions of roughness elements was analysed by the equation proposed in the literature and compared to the results obtained with the numerical simulations. This comparison showed very good agreement. Thus, the formulation developed for uniform particles was found also to be valid for a larger spectrum of particles noted on industrial sites. The present work aims also to investigate in detail the fluid mechanics over several roughness particles. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
30|$|This surface, {{designed}} {{using an}} inexpensive technology, allows its appropriate application for medical devices intended for cardiovascular applications. Enhanced EPC adhesion on cardiovascular devices brings {{the opportunity of}} accelerated endothelialization, which consequently hinders thrombus formation [1]. One of the important prerequisites for a successful alloy used for cardiovascular medical devices, apart from attraction of EPCs, is deferring macrophages and inflammatory cells to reduce in-stent thrombosis and thrombosis. Anodized titanium surface, as a biocompatible and bioinert surface, is not associated with elicitation of untoward local and systemic inflammatory reactions [5]. Reported reduced macrophage density on anodized titanium surface by Rajyalakshmi et al. provides further evidence for its efficacy for cardiovascular devices [5]. Inflammatory reactions due to the interaction between medical device and the host tissue lead to long-term success failure. In this case, metal devices with impregnated polymeric material impose greater inflammatory burden [10]. As an example, enhanced inflammatory reactions, both locally and systemically, to the implanted stents lead to accelerated rate of stent thrombosis and restenosis [10]. This technique avoids application of <b>non-erodible</b> polymers for endovascular stents, and metal surface could be exposed directly to the blood flow. Parallel to more EPC adhesion, decreased platelet attachment to this surface makes this a desirable surface for endovascular applications.|$|E
40|$|Areas {{the most}} {{susceptible}} to wind erosion {{were chosen for}} the comparison of potential and real erodibility of soil by wind. All the areas {{are located in the}} Southern Moravia, the south-east of the Czech Republic. Ambulatory measurements of parameters required for wind erodibility determination were done during 2006 in three districts that are heavily endangered by wind erosion (districts of Breclav, Znojmo and Uherske Hradiste). Potential and real erodibility by wind was determined from wind velocity, soil humidity, content of clay and <b>non-erodible</b> soil particles. Potential soil loss does not go over the limit of the tolerable amount of soil loss 10 t. ha –  1. year –  1 at any studied area, even though all the three areas belong to the ones strongly susceptible to wind erosion. On the other hand, the tolerable soil loss for real erodibility 1. 4 g. m –  2 was exceeded at two regions. Non-objectivity in the erodibility evaluation of heavy clay soils follows out of the results, as so as evident necessity of new knowledge concerning the determination of wind erosion intensity, because to date used equations come out of presumption that the more clay particles soil contains, the less susceptible to wind erosion is, which is inaccurate...|$|E
40|$|The {{buccal mucosa}} has been {{investigated}} for local drug therapy and the systemic delivery of therapeutic peptides and other drugs that are subjected to first-pass metabolism or are unstable within {{the rest of the}} gastrointestinal tract. The mucosa of the oral cavity presents a formidable barrier to drug penetration, and one method of optimizing drug delivery is by the use of adhesive dosage forms and the mucosa has a rich blood supply and it is relatively permeable. The buccal mucosa is very suitable for a bioadhesion system because of a smooth and relatively immobile surface and accessibility. Therefore, drugs with a short biological half life, requiring a sustained released effect and exhibiting poor permeability, sensitivity to enzymatic degradation, or poor solubility may be good candidates to deliver via the oral cavity. To overcome the drawbacks of tablets flexible patches for use in the mouth have been developed. Erodible and <b>non-erodible</b> adhesive films have been used as bioadhesive films. These adhesive patches for oral mucosal delivery can be used to designed uni or bidirectional systems for buccal tissue absorption. The objective {{of this article is to}} review buccal drug delivery of patches (films) by discussing buccal mucosa and pathways of drug absorption and their formulations...|$|E

A field experiment was conducted in which values of z sub 0 and u* (wind friction speed) were measured over three arrays of <b>non-erodible</b> roughness elements on a dry lake bed. Wind profiles were measured by ten anemometers on a 15 m mast under thermally neutral atmospheric conditions. Values of z sub 0 increased from. 00014 m (dry lake bed only) to. 026 m with increasing roughness element density. The three roughness element arrays were simulated at 1 / 10 and 1 / 20 scale in an open-circuit atmospheric boundary-layer wind tunnel. Velocities were measured with a boundary-layer pitot-tube rake from the same relative position within the scale model arrays as the anemometers were relative to the field arrays. Each array at each scale was sampled three times at five freestream velocities. Average values of z sub 0 for each model array at each scale were compared with full-scale values of z sub 0 obtained in the field.

40|$|Biodegradable polymer {{has been}} the subject of {{interest}} for its use as a polymeric drug carrier material in dosage form design due to its appealing properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and relatively low production cost from abundant natural sources. The greatest advantage of these degradable polymers is that they are broken down into biologically acceptable molecules that are metabolized and removed from the body via normal metabolic pathways, for example, polylactides, polyglycolides, and their copolymers—the polymers will eventually break down to lactic acid and glycolic acid, enter the Kreb's cycle, and be further broken down into carbon dioxide and water and excreted through normal processes. Many biodegradable polymers are used as binder such as acacia, gelatin, whereas some used to coat tablets such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, povidone and sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose., and to thicken suspensions and in ophthalmic solution as a protective colloid,to stabilize emulsions and suspensions [...] Sustained-release dosage forms employ polymers as shells for microencapsulated drugs, as erodible and <b>non-erodible</b> matrices, as barrier membranes to regulate the release of drugs by diffusion. The biodegradable polymer used in medical devices and controlled-drug-release applications are sterilizable and capable of controlled stability or degradation in response to biological conditions. These all play a very crucial role in enhancing the bioavailability of drug. This review covers all the aspects of biodegradable polymers in enhancing bioavailability of the drug...|$|E
