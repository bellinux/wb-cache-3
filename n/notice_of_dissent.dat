He projected a biographical account <b>of</b> the <b>dissenting</b> congregations <b>of</b> London and the vicinity. For his projected work he obtained around three hundred subscribers. He published an instalment of The History and Antiquities <b>of</b> <b>Dissenting</b> Churches and Meeting Houses in London, Westminster, and Southwark: including the Lives of their Ministers in 1808, 2 vols. A third volume <b>of</b> his <b>Dissenting</b> Churches appeared in 1810; a fourth in 1814, with a preface (1 May 1814) showing his {{personal interest in}} the older types of nonconformity. According to Alexander Gordon in the Dictionary of National Biography, the later volumes of his work exhibit a softer attitude towards the free-thinkers <b>of</b> <b>dissent,</b> and his facts are given fairly. By 1818 {{he was ready to}} publish a fifth and completing volume, if five hundred subscribers could be obtained; but it never appeared.|$|R

25|$|Whistle-blowing is {{a subset}} <b>of</b> <b>dissent.</b> It {{involves}} the expression <b>of</b> <b>dissent</b> to external {{organizations such as}} media and political avenues that {{have the power to}} take corrective action. Kassing (2000) believes that the whistle-blowing process begins at the superior–subordinate relationship. If a superior response to an employee's effort to dissent is negative this may cause the employee to seek other avenues <b>of</b> <b>dissent.</b> In fact, evidence indicates that {{only as a last resort}} do the dissendents finally go public with their tales (Bennis, 2004, Kassing, 2000).|$|R

40|$|Historically, the {{politics}} <b>of</b> <b>dissent</b> {{has been associated}} with Presbyterian participation in the United Irish movement. This paper argues for a broader definition of {{the politics}} <b>of</b> <b>dissent</b> based on the two dominant theological traditions in Ulster Protestantism—Calvinism and evangelicalism. It explains how these theologies have been drawn on to challenge their own assumptions, creating a politics <b>of</b> <b>dissent</b> that promises to transcend sectarianism. It is argued that this has been the case in contexts as varied as the United Irish movement, the radical evangelical wing of the early twentieth century labour movement, and the radical evangelical wing of the contemporary civil society-based peace movement. It evaluates the significance and influence of the politics <b>of</b> <b>dissent</b> in each era, and examines the reasons why the United Irish and labour movements did not transcend sectarianism. It concludes with an analysis of the prospects for the peace movement to help transcend sectarianism...|$|R
