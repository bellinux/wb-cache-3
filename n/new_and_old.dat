5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the outside was made from a mixture of <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>old</b> bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|The prebendary of New Sleaford or Lafford had {{a seat in}} the Lincoln Cathedral; it is {{not known}} when it was established, but it was {{confirmed}} by the Pope in 1146 and 1163, and was in the patronage of the bishop. Sleaford's tithes paid to the prebendary were valued at £11 19s. 7d. (£11.98) in 1616. After the enclosure of Sleaford's fields, a farm at Holdingham Anna was allotted to the prebendary in place of the tithes. The Prebendal Court of Sleaford had jurisdiction over <b>New</b> <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford and Holdingham to grant administration and probate. The parishes of <b>New</b> <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford were in the peculiar jurisdiction of the predendary until 1846, when they became part of Aswardhurn and Lafford Rural Deanery. In 1866 they were placed in Aswardhurn and Lafford No. 2 Rural Deanery, from 1884 in the Lafford No. 2 Rural Deanery, the Lafford South Rural Deanery from 1910, and since 1968, the Lafford Rural Deanery.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} cuticle {{hydrocarbons}} {{has also been}} applied to the reproductive workers. In some colonies of the ponerine ant Platythyrea punctata, the presence of CHCs in new reproductive workers triggered aggressive behavior {{from the rest of}} the colony, often between <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>old</b> reproductive workers. Specifically, the old reproductive workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the antennae of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.|$|E

5|$|Before 1832, Quarrington {{was in the}} Lincolnshire {{parliamentary}} constituency, which encompassed all {{the county}} except for four boroughs. In the 1818 election, 49 of the 2,000 people living in <b>New</b> <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford and Quarrington qualified to vote. In 1832, the Reform Act widened the franchise and divided Lincolnshire. Quarrington was in the South Lincolnshire constituency that elected two members to parliament. The franchise was widened by the reforms so that roughly 15% (202) of males in Sleaford and Quarrington could vote in 1868. The constituency was abolished in 1885 and Quarrington was in the new North Kesteven constituency. It merged with the Grantham seat in 1918. In 1997, Quarrington was reorganised into Sleaford and North Hykeham.|$|E

5|$|For the {{following}} four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes, and poached the Bury manager Bert Head after persistence from chairman Arthur Wait in early 1966. Head had been with Bury less than a season. The new manager promoted from the youth team and transferred in players <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>old,</b> and delighted fans by re-signing Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968–69 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates {{at the beginning of}} the season, finished second behind Derby County who were managed by Brian Clough. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} medieval period, New Sleaford {{was in the}} Flaxwell Wapentake and Old Sleaford in the Ashwardhurn Wapentake. Sleaford Poor Law Union, overseen by a Board of Guardians, was {{established}} in 1836. A Local Board of Health was formed in 1851. Public health was reorganised by the Public Health Act 1872, which established Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts (USD or RSD); Sleaford USD covered <b>New</b> <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford, Holdingham and Quarrington, while the Sleaford RSD included all other parishes in the Poor Law Union. The Local Government Act 1894 converted the Board of Health and USD into the Sleaford Urban District Council and, in 1899, the town became the administrative base of Kesteven County Council. A rural district formed in 1894 was abolished in 1931. In 1973, Sleaford Urban District merged with the North and East Kesteven districts to form North Kesteven, a district of Lincolnshire; by statutory instrument, Sleaford civil parish became the urban district's successor, thus merging Quarrington, New Sleaford, Old Sleaford and Holdingham civil parishes.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>old</b> orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely looked at his diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E

Returning to Paris, Heliade continued to publish works on political and cultural issues, including an analysis of the European situation after the Peace Treaty of 1856 and an 1858 essay on the Bible. In 1859, he published his own translation of the Septuagint, under the name Biblia sacră ce cuprinde Noul şi Vechiul Testament ("The Holy Bible, Comprising the <b>New</b> <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Testament").|$|E

5|$|Laying of {{the track}} was {{performed}} by Wiebe, signaling was installed by Norsk Jernbanedrift, Structon Rail installed the overhead wire, and YIT installed the power supply and telecommunications systems. The tunnel has the NSI-63 relay-based signaling system, although it {{was scheduled to be}} replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015. The last six weeks before opening, the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>old</b> sections to be connected. This was the most hectic part of construction, as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg. The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100,000 man-hours.|$|E
5|$|Structural damage {{ranged from}} the {{superficial}} to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>old</b> portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a quarter mile (400 m).|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{taken during}} 1932 and 1933 {{proved that the}} skyway saved time on the <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>old</b> routes. Not only was the {{distance}} shortened by , but it took at least six minutes less to travel the new route during regular traffic. Trucks gained even more time, saving anywhere from five to eleven minutes. During times of previous traffic congestion on weekends on the old route, the viaduct saved around 25minutes or more from the elimination of traffic congestion. In addition, the new route {{did not have the}} much longer delays and traffic back-ups that were caused whenever the bridges on the old highway were opened. It was found that the skyway also diverted a good deal of traffic from other routes.|$|E

5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. <b>New</b> <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, turning on the right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E
