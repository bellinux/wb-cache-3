40|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of equal {{thermodynamic}} distance (ETD) has been pro-posed to minimize entropy production in a distillation process using a dia-batic column. ETD gives the optimal temperature profile to first-order in N− 1, where <b>N</b> is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays.</b> ETD however, does not in general give the true minimum for distillation columns with few trays. We therefore apply a fully numerical, multidimensional optimization routine to determine minimum entropy production. Since this method {{does not depend on}} an un-derlying theory we expect a true minimum to be revealed. We then compare the performance of ETD and numerical optimization by varying the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> and the purity requirements. Our results show surprisingly good agreement between the ETD results and the ones obtained numerically...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{industrial}} distillation column, the [...] {{required to achieve}} a given separation also depends upon the amount of reflux used.

40|$|Background: Total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) outcomes {{depend on}} accurate positioning of implants and {{restoration of the}} mechanical axis of the knee. Compared with standard techniques, patient-specific cutting guides are postulated to improve accuracy of bone resections, and therefore implant placement. Furthermore, patient-specific cutting guides are postulated to reduce operative time and increase efficiency by reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> used. Methods: This study evaluates these claims using the Visionaire (Smith & Nephew, Inc., Memphis, TN, USA) patient-specific system. The thickness of actual bone resections was compared with the predicted thickness (giving a resection ‘error’). Data were also obtained on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> used, skin-to-skin operating time and tourniquet time. Results: Forty-one TKRs were performed on 33 females (one bilateral) and seven males. Average resection errors were 0. 22 mm medially and 0. 05 mm laterally for the distal femur, 0. 99 mm medially and 0. 74 mm laterally for posterior femoral condyles, and 0. 55 mm medially and 0. 71 mm laterally for the proximal tibia. There {{were no significant differences}} in tourniquet time, skin-to-skin time or the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> used between the patient-specific and historical comparison groups. Conclusion: Patient-specific cutting guides make accurate resections. Operative and tourniquet times and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> used were no different to standard TKRs. Further investigation is needed to determine whether patient-specific cutting guides improve post-operative alignment and patient satisfaction.

25|$|Continuous {{distillation}} {{differs from}} batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run {{at a steady}} state for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays.</b> Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor–liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes {{a large amount of}} liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stages, thus requiring a taller column.|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the optimum}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> in a {{distillation}} column {{has been an}} important process optimization problem for over fifty years. Over the past decade this problem has been addressed successfully as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. But tools for solving MINLPs are not widespread, especially in connection with detailed simulation models. This paper therefore addresses the question: is there an accurate tray optimization formulation that can be solved using current nonlinear programming algorithms? In this study we obtained a positive answer by introducing a differentiable distribution function (DDF). In this formulation, all streams around a column, except the top and bottom products, are directed to all <b>of</b> the column <b>trays</b> using the DDF. As a result, the distributed flowrate of the entry or exit streams is directed to a specific tray based on the value of its DDF at that tray. This approach allows the placement of feeds, sidestreams and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> in the column to be continuous variables in the DDF and in the optimization problem it eliminates the need for integer variables. Instead, we formulate the tray optimization problem as an NLP using the original MESH model. In this approach it is critical to deal with trays that have no liquid or vapor flows. To describe this phenomenon properly in the optimization, complementary constraints are formulated and added to the NLP, by taking advantage of a smoothing algorithm developed by Gopal and Biegler for phase equilibrium. Also, since pressure in each tray has a substantial affect on distillation calculations, the pressure drops across each tray depend on the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trays</b> and a related smoothing function formulation is presented that removes the pressure drop on dry trays.

From the absorption rate point of view, primary or secondary amines are preferred. However, in case the costs of regeneration are also taken into account, tertiary amines are much more attractive. In order to combine the specific properties of tertiary and primary/secondary alkanolamines respectively, mixtures of both types of compounds are used. A well known example is the activated methyl-di-ethanol-amine (MDEA) -process in which MDEA is mixed with (small amounts) of piperazine.
