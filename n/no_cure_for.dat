5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> Alzheimer's disease; {{available}} treatments offer {{relatively small}} symptomatic benefit but remain palliative in nature. Current treatments {{can be divided}} into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> polio. The {{focus of}} modern {{treatment}} {{has been on}} providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include antibiotics to prevent infections in weakened muscles, analgesics for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet. Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, orthopedic surgery.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. <b>No</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> the common cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
50|$|There are <b>no</b> <b>cures</b> <b>for</b> FHS. Close {{monitoring}} {{of growth in}} the first few years is essential, as well as annual general health screening and tests listed below. An FHS diagnosis will affect the individual and those there to support them.|$|R
25|$|There is <b>no</b> known <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> MSA and {{management}} is primarily supportive.|$|R
50|$|There is <b>no</b> known <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> microcephaly. Treatment is {{symptomatic}} and supportive.|$|R
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. <b>No</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> the disorder at present.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> HD. Full-time care is {{required}} in the later stages of the disease. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy. Suicide {{is the cause of}} death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected.|$|E
50|$|There is <b>no</b> known <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> AD, {{although}} treatments {{may reduce}} the severity and frequency of flares.|$|R
5000|$|There is <b>no</b> known <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> this syndrome. Patients usually need {{ophthalmic}} {{surgery and}} may also need dental surgery ...|$|R
5|$|There is {{presently}} <b>no</b> known <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> rumination. Proton pump inhibitors and other medications {{have been used}} to little or no effect.|$|R
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons {{continue to be}} lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally {{for all individuals}} without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} {{can help}} control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 {{percent of cases}} can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|<b>No</b> <b>cure</b> is {{available}} <b>for</b> these genetically inherited disorders. Genetic counseling is required.|$|R
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>cure</b> is {{available}} <b>for</b> SLE {{but there are}} many treatments for the disease.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis of NPS {{can be made}} at birth, but {{is common}} for it to remain undiagnosed for several generations. While there is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> {{available}} <b>for</b> NPS, treatment is available and recommended.|$|R
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> HD, {{but there}} are {{treatments}} available to reduce the severity {{of some of its}} symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. An association between caffeine intake and earlier age of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, and tragic heroine of the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse that turns humans into fiends. Believing that there is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja {{and one of the}} DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E

25|$|There is <b>no</b> known <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> {{some types}} of dermatitis, with {{treatment}} aiming to control symptoms by reducing inflammation and relieving itching. Contact dermatitis is treated by avoiding what is causing it.|$|R
25|$|Because {{there are}} <b>no</b> known <b>cures</b> <b>for</b> many brain disorders, a high {{priority}} is given to research designed to improve the scientific understanding of healthy brain tissue {{to try to find}} new treatments.|$|R
50|$|Therapy for notalgia paresthetica is {{directed}} at controlling symptoms, as <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> exists <b>for</b> the condition. Available treatments include local anesthetics, topical capsaicin, topical corticosteroids, hydroxyzine, oxcarbazepine, palmitoylethanolamide and gabapentin. Paravertebral nerve block and botulinum toxin injections may also be helpful.|$|R
25|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> Ménière's disease but medications, diet, {{physical}} therapy and counseling, and some surgical approaches {{can be used}} to manage it.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015 {{there was}} <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> BSE; {{some of the}} {{symptoms}} like twitching can be managed but otherwise treatment is palliative care.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> spinocerebellar ataxia, {{which is}} {{currently}} {{considered to be a}} progressive and irreversible disease, although not all types cause equally severe disability.|$|E
