5|$|Aristotle's {{work was}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, {{as well as}} in Europe during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear <b>narrative</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of his previous directorial venture Kites (2010), the director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later developed to the script of Barfi!. The film script that Basu wrote alternated between two time periods, and he retained the nonlinear <b>narrative</b> <b>structure.</b> He said that the script required a 30-year time span for the characters' love to grow and thus set {{the backdrop of the}} film in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Memento premiered on September 5, 2000, at the Venice International Film Festival and was {{released}} in European theaters starting in October. It became a blockbuster success, being acclaimed by critics who praised its nonlinear <b>narrative</b> <b>structure</b> and motifs of memory, perception, grief, and self-deception, and earning $39.7 million over a $9 million budget. It received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. The film was subsequently ranked {{one of the best}} films of the 2000s by several critics and media outlets.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to compare the narrative discourse of children with specific-language impairment (SLI) and children with normal language development (NL). Their personal narratives were analyzed for length, number and com-plexity of <b>narrative</b> <b>structures.</b> The categories described by Glenn and Stein (1980) were used to identify <b>narrative</b> <b>structures.</b> Differences between the groups were not obtained for length of narrative. The children with SLI produced fewer <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> and less complex ones than their peers with NL. They did not produce <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> in which aims, motiva-tions, and consequences occurred as frequently as did the children with NL. Clinical considerations are discussed.

In this paper we pursue the analysis of <b>narrative</b> <b>structures.</b> The qualitative research starts by theoretical and epistemological accounts and it brings forward a content analysis technique which improves the value of interpretative components in research process. This {{point of view is}} instantiated here: the research is conducted by means of narrative interviews and it involved 34 participants prisoners in prisons Regina Coeli and Rebibbia. The objective was to reconstruct <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> of accounts gathered in a non inquisitive context: more specifically, our interest was aimed to verify the possible presence of <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> underlying these accounts.

5|$|The Room is a 2003 American {{independent}} romantic drama film starring, written, directed, {{and produced}} by Tommy Wiseau. The film is primarily {{centered on a}} melodramatic love triangle among an amiable banker named Johnny (Wiseau), his deceptive fiancée Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his conflicted best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). A {{significant portion of the}} film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are unresolved due to the film's inconsistent <b>narrative</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>narrative</b> <b>structure</b> is {{alluded to}} in Legea minții, {{which is about}} {{discovering}} one's true calling. The plot follows its protagonist, a scholarly priest {{by the name of}} Andrei Pascu, as he finds himself in his work as a missionary of religion and cultural nationalism, despite being set back by poverty and revisited by his worldly past. Similar themes are developed elsewhere. In Popa Man, a lapsed priest and smuggler is suddenly confronted with the consequences of his actions, and destroys himself with drink. In Stana, named after its female protagonist, a war invalid is a passive witness to his wife's moral decay. When he dies, his wooden leg serves as a haunting reminder of his virtues, driving Stana to despair.|$|E
5|$|Josef von Sternberg was {{directing}} in Hollywood at {{the same}} time. Films of his such as Shanghai Express (1932) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent Underworld (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932) demonstrated {{that there was an}} audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered films noir, perhaps none had a greater effect {{on the development of the}} genre than Citizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover <b>narrative</b> <b>structure</b> are echoed in dozens of classic films noir.|$|E

5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's <b>narrative</b> <b>structure.</b> However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

40|$|In our {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} world, wildlife films play a significant role. Wildlife films help us to see new places and learn about animals in remote locations, that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to do. Yet wildlife films have throughout history been criticized, mainly for the ambivalent relationship between science and storytelling. While the films give us a scientific impression and {{say something about the}} “reality”, they clearly have the intension to amuse, capture and entertain their audience. In doing this, the wildlife film shapes characters, plays dramatic music and creates narratives with beginnings and ends. In this essay I study the <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> in five chosen parts of the BBC production Life (2009). I attempt to show how the parts can be seen through the narrative scheme that Labov and Waletzky introduce in 1967. The results are leading to a discussion about {{the way in which the}} <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> affects the science in the film parts. Mainly through the narrative need of spectacular points and breach from normality, and the way in which <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> contribute to anthropomorphism. My intension is to show how the <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> are working in order to better, as a viewer, determine what´s fact and what´s fiction...|$|R

25|$|Tulving has seminally defined {{three key}} {{properties}} of episodic memory recollection.

Autonoetic consciousness refers to {{a special kind of}} consciousness that accompanies the act of remembering which enables an individual {{to be aware of the}} self in a subjective time.

40|$|Stream of {{consciousness}} novels employ {{a variety of}} narrative techniques to depict the flow {{of consciousness}}. This article examines <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> underlying the subjective frame created by a sole character/narrator in two French New Novels, Michel Butor's La Modification and Claude Simon's La Route des Flandres. There is a dynamic relationship between form and content. Conventional narrative syntax in Butor's work reflects the evaluative and associative processes of the mind attempting to resolve an emotional conflict. In Simon's work, <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> mirror the complex embedding of four main fables as the narrative process attempts to depict the uncontrolled thought patterns evoked in a half-asleep state. The rational and the illusory functions of the mental process that differentiate these novels are reflected {{not only in the}} <b>narrative</b> <b>structures</b> but also in their global form, theme and conception of the role of language in a work of art...|$|R
