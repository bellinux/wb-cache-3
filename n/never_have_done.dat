25|$|Contemporary critics accused Le Jeune {{of violating}} {{some of the}} rules of good melodic writing and counterpoint, for example using the melodic {{interval}} of the major sixth (something Palestrina would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done),</b> and frequently crossing voices; some of these compositional devices were to become features of the Baroque style, premonitions of which were beginning to appear even in France {{towards the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E

500|$|Publicly, Hammerstein {{accepted}} {{blame for}} himself and Rodgers, and stated that had the musical been produced by anyone else, [...] "we'd say that these are producers we wouldn't {{like to work with}} again". According to Cy Feuer, Hammerstein privately blamed him and Martin, telling them, [...] "We believed your pitch and we went and did something we were never cut out to do and we should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it.|$|E

500|$|A casting {{director}} for the James Bond film The Living Daylights persuaded Bathurst to audition for Bond. Bathurst believes that his [...] "ludicrous audition" [...] was only [...] "an arm-twisting exercise" [...] because the producers wanted to pressure Timothy Dalton to take the role by telling him they were still auditioning other actors. Bathurst noted [...] "I could <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it – Bond actors are always very different from me".|$|E
500|$|Maxwell {{also cited}} his {{grandmother}} and other West Indian women he knows as the inspiration behind his romantic notions. Music journalists inferred that {{the album was}} inspired by or based on an unsuccessful affair in Maxwell's life. Maxwell said in an interview, [...] "I'm so innately romantic and always have been, and I went through this particular romantic experience and based my album on that". The album's liner notes have a dedication from Maxwell to his [...] "musze", stating [...] "I could <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> this without you".|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{has stated}} that the song she most regrets {{recording}} is [...] "Material Girl" [...] and if she had known that the label would be attached to her for decades, she would probably <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. After making the video, Madonna said she {{never wanted to be}} compared to Monroe, despite posing like her and recreating many of Monroe's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably in a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated a certain type of liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage. In 1993, a conference was held at the University of California at Santa Barbara, with the subject as Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl? The conference pondered on the duality of Madonna as both of them and deduced that the question of Madonna's feminism is not easy to decide. Some of the feminists left the conference, citing that they {{had not been able to}} make up their minds.|$|E

Jackman read the script and agreed {{to be a part}} of the film. [...] "He called me back I think 24 hours later and said, 'Yeah I wanna do this,' which I think is, quite frankly, {{incredibly}} ballsy.

2500|$|Most actors {{had contact}} before filming with the {{individuals}} {{they were to}} portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: [...] "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down {{a vast number of}} characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." [...] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.|$|E
2500|$|Kirwan's first {{recorded}} {{work with the}} band was his contribution to Green's huge instrumental hit single [...] "Albatross". Green later stated that, [...] "I would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> [...] "Albatross" [...] if it wasn't for Danny. I would never have had a number one hit record." [...] The B-side of the single was Kirwan's first published tune, the instrumental [...] "Jigsaw Puzzle Blues". This was an old clarinet piece, written by Joe Venuti and Adrian Rollini, and recorded by the Joe Venuti / Eddie Lang Blue Five in 1933. Kirwan had adapted the piece for himself and Green to play on guitar, but Green remembered, [...] "I couldn't do it properly... My style wasn't all that satisfactory to Danny, but his style wasn't all that satisfactory to me." [...] So Kirwan played all the guitar parts himself.|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stanley Donen, {{brought to}} Hollywood by Kelly {{to be his}} {{assistant}} choreographer, received co-director credit for On the Town. According to Kelly: [...] "...when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one {{to work with the}} cameraman on the timing..without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney and Jeanne Coyne I could <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> these things. When we came to do On the Town, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators." [...] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the [...] "Day in New York" [...] routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} month of the season, Schmeichel was shown a {{seemingly}} needless red card in the 79th minute of Leicester's away game to Nottingham Forest on 20 August 2011 after receiving two yellow cards for [...] "unsporting conduct". He received the first card for moving the ball from the penalty spot as Forest's Lewis McGugan was about to take a kick, then received his second for throwing the ball away after the spot kick was successfully converted. After the match, Schmeichel apologized, claiming his back was turned to the referee so did not know he had received the first of the yellow cards. [...] "I didn't know I had been booked as I had my back to the ref otherwise I would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that," [...] he said on his personal Twitter page. Despite this, Schmeichel's performances for Leicester quickly began earning him plaudits, with his then manager Sven-Göran Eriksson comparing him with England number 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart, and teammate and former England international Paul Konchesky describing him as [...] "one of the best [...] he has ever played with". [...] A short-distant reaction save against Portsmouth in November 2011, in particular, earnt Schmeichel praise and was described by Portsmouth manager Michael Appleton as [...] "one of the best saves I have seen in a very long time". and by Leicester manager Nigel Pearson as [...] "a world-class, outstanding save and was very important at that point of the game".|$|E
