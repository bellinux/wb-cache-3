40|$|Accreditation {{has gained}} {{worldwide}} attention {{as an effective}} quality evaluation and management tool. Accreditation {{has been defined as}} a system of external peer review for determining compliance with a set of standards. Accreditation standards are written to reflect current practice and expectations for the specific functions the nurses perform. Accreditation systems provided better quality results in nursing care; positive changes in leadership, commitment and support, use of data, staff involvement, and quality management; impact or effectiveness of health sector accreditation. Accreditation has recently gained great importance in Egypt, but <b>nursing</b> <b>departments</b> still lack accreditation standards and criteria. Hence, the present study aims to develop and validate a set of relevant, feasible, and reliable standards that needs for accrediting <b>nursing</b> <b>departments</b> at Mansoura University Hospital. The study subjects includes a jury group includes 12 academic staff from Faculty of Nursing and 10 nurse managers from Mansoura University Hospital. All head nurses (n= 46) works in all inpatient departments at Mansoura University Hospital were included in the study. Three tools were used for data collection, namely; a validity form, interview questionnaire sheet, and an audit form. The study findings indicated that the proposed accreditation standards for <b>nursing</b> <b>departments</b> at Mansoura University Hospital are valid. A most proposed accreditation standard was met in less than a half of the cases. It is recommended that the developed accreditation standards could be used in Mansoura University Hospital...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{management}} competencies of head and <b>department</b> <b>nurses</b> in Moravian hospitals. There are cited papers from Czech authors in the theoretical part which deal with health care, {{and the work}} of nurses. The research is based on a questionnaire sent to the hospitals in Znojmo, Třebíč and the Faculty hospital of St. Anna in Brno. Totally, the average response rate was 63, 6 [*]%, covering 886 <b>nurses,</b> 124 <b>department</b> <b>nurses</b> and 29 head nurses – 1039 in total. In terms of nurses’ edu­ca­tion the high school-leaving exam is most common; in average about 80 [*]% of all nurses. And this is the same for head and <b>department</b> <b>nurses,</b> where there will be a requirement for a university degree in future especially for the position head nurse. This research shows that informal relationships predominate in hospitals. This is based on the democratic managerial style of <b>department</b> and head <b>nurses.</b> They predominantly obtained knowledge from human resource management in their working practice and previous occupation, (65, 9 [*]% respondents). <b>Nurses</b> and especially <b>department</b> <b>nurses</b> (66, 7 [*]%) don’t want to manage people but don’t want to reach higher positions (I think this is what you mean) and don’t reach position of their subordinate. <b>Department</b> <b>nurses</b> but head nurses would like to participate in management and human resource management courses. According to the results of this questionnaire research (evaluation of nurses and self evaluation of <b>department</b> <b>nurses</b> and head nurses as well) management competencies are on good level in analysed hospitals. By testing de­pen­den­ce of chosen variables was found middle strong dependence between valuables: working position by <b>department</b> and head <b>nurses</b> and their preferences of communicative relationships.

40|$|Abstract Background Within the {{healthcare}} system, nurses {{have the ability}} to influence their patients' smoking habits through counselling. Therefore, it is of great importance to appropriately train health professionals on smoking cessation strategies with the aim to help them provide advice to their patients. In light of the above, the objective {{of this study was to}} assess the association between Greek nursing students' beliefs towards tobacco control/smoking cessation and the professional training received. Methods During February 2009, we conducted a cross sectional national survey among all 3 rd year nursing students of the two university based <b>nursing</b> <b>departments</b> in Greece (University of Athens, University of the Peloponnese). The Global Health Professional Student Survey (GHPSS) questionnaire was applied and following written informed consent 73 % provided a completed questionnaire (n = 192 / 263 enrolled students). Results Overall, 33 % were current active smokers, while 74 % reported ever to experiment smoking. In regards to their beliefs towards tobacco control policies, non smokers were more positive in regards to banning smoking in restaurants (94 % vs. 61 %, p Conclusions Resources should be invested in improving the quality of undergraduate education in <b>nursing</b> <b>departments</b> in Greece with respect to tobacco control and smoking cessation. </p...|$|R

Students are also given a survey to assess their satisfaction with the program and effectiveness of the different courses and the program overall at the end of the last semester (exit survey). First time NCLEX licensure exam passing rates among ABSN are also used to determine the effectiveness of the program in meeting its SLO???s. Students are also given surveys to evaluate their satisfaction and learning in clinical and laboratory courses. Additionally, faculty teaching effectiveness, alumni, and employers satisfaction, retention and timely graduation rates are assessed. Actual student outcomes data are evaluated in relation to expected student outcomes to identify potential areas for program improvement. Course data are trended over time and any significant decrease in mean scores for a course initiates an examination of the potential causes. Failure to meet the benchmark also triggers a review of the course. Finally, this year, all SLOs were revised, reducing the number from 8 to 18...|$|R
