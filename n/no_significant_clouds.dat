40|$|Models of Jupiter's {{formation}} and structure predict that its atmosphere is enriched in oxygen, {{relative to the}} Sun, and that consequently water clouds should be present globally near the 5 -bar pressure level. Past attempts to confirm these predictions have led to contradictory results; in particular, the Galileo probe revealed a very dry atmosphere at the entry site, with <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>clouds</b> at depths exceeding the 2 -bar level. Although the entry site {{was known to be}} relatively cloud-free, the contrast between the observed local dryness and the expected global wetness was surprising. Here we analyse near-infrared (around 5 microm) observations of Jupiter, a spectral region that can reveal the water vapour abundance and vertical cloud structure in the troposphere. We find that humid and extremely dry regions exist in close proximity, and that some humid regions are spatially correlated with bright convective clouds extending from the deep water clouds to the visible atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} hot spot observations in the Jovian North Equatorial Belt obtained with the near-infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS) instrument on the Galileo spacecraft. The data were acquired during the closest approach sequences between June 1996 and April 1997. We focus on the spectral window between 4. 5 and 5. 2 [Jim determining the cloud opacity above 2 bar, the water vapor relative humidity, and the ammonia abundance between 4 and 8 bar. We find a linear relationship between the cloud opacity and the continuum level of the spectrum. For a given radiance level of an individual spectrum, significant variations in the water vapor relative humidity are seen. However, no clear evidence for {{a relationship between the}} cloud opacity and the water relative humidity is seen. A cloud structure similar to that measured by the Galileo entry probe, with <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>cloud</b> opacity below 2 bar, is adequate. The air in the hot spots is found to be overall dry, consistent with the probe measurements. None of the considered spectra show water vapor relative humidities exceeding 10 %. Significant spatial variations of the water vapor relative humidity are found, and the distribution over the observed hot spot regions is complex. Because of a low sensitivity of the NIMS spectra to ammonia, uncertainties in the derived ammonia abundance are much higher than for water. There is, however, a possible trend in all the observed hot spots toward more ammonia inside than outside the hot spots at the sounded pressure levels.

5000|$|In April 2008, Professor Terry Sloan of Lancaster University {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Environmental Research Letters titled [...] "Testing the proposed causal link between cosmic rays and cloud cover", which found <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> link between <b>cloud</b> cover and cosmic ray intensity in the last 20 years. Svensmark responded by saying [...] "Terry Sloan has simply failed to understand how cosmic rays work on clouds". Dr. Giles Harrison of Reading University, describes the work as important [...] "as it provides an upper limit on the cosmic ray-cloud effect in global satellite cloud data". Harrison studied the effect of cosmic rays in the UK. [...] He states: [...] "Although the statistically significant non-linear cosmic ray effect is small, {{it will have a}} considerably larger aggregate effect on longer timescale (e.g. century) climate variations when day-to-day variability averages out". Brian H. Brown (2008) of Sheffield University further found a statistically significant (p<0.05) short term 3% association between Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and low level clouds over 22 years with a 15-hour delay. Long-term changes in cloud cover (> 3 months)and GCR gave correlations of p=0.06.|$|R

40|$|Instruments on the Galileo probe {{measured}} composition, cloud properties, thermal structure, winds, radiative energy balance, {{and electrical}} {{properties of the}} Jovian atmosphere. As expected the probe results confirm some expectations about Jupiter's atmosphere, refute others, and raise new questions which still remain unanswered. This talk will concentrate on those aspects of the probe observations which either raised new questions or remain unresolved. The Galileo probe observations of composition and clouds provided {{some of the biggest}} surprises of the mission. Helium abundance measured by the probe differed significantly from the remote sensing derivations from Voyager. Discrepancy between the Voyager helium abundance determinations for Jupiter and the Galileo probe value have now led to a considerably increased helium determination for Saturn. Global abundance of N in the form of ammonia was observed to be super-solar by approximately the same factor as carbon, in contrast to expectations that C/N would be significantly larger than solar. This has implications for the formation and evolution of Jupiter. The cloud structure was not what was generally anticipated, even though most previous remote sensing results below the uppermost cloud referred to 5 micron hot spots, local regions with reduced cloud opacity. The Galileo probe descended in one of these hot spots. Only a tenuous, presumed ammomium hydrosulfide, cloud was detected, and <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> water <b>cloud</b> or super-solar water abundance was measured. The mixing ratios as a function of depth for the condensibles ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water, exhibited no apparent correlation with either condensation levels or with each other, an observation that is still a puzzle, although there are now dynamical models of hot spots which show promise in being able to explain such behavior. Probe tracked zonal winds show that wind magnitude increases with depth to pressures of about 4 bars, with the winds extending to at least as deep as the probe made measurements, 22 bars. Models of hot spot dynamics raise the possibility that the variation with depth of the probe measured zonal winds between 0. 4 and 4 bars reflect the dynamics of the hot spot rather than the global wind pattern. Galileo upper atmosphere measurements established that there is a sharp temperature rise with altitude between about 350 and 800 km above the 1 bar pressure level, with the upper atmosphere reaching temperatures near 900 K. The energy sources for this upper atmosphere heating are not clearly established, but various mechanisms have been proposed. These and other aspects of the Galileo probe data will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|A trispectral {{combination}} of observations at 8 -, 11 -, and 12 -micron bands is suggested for detecting cloud and cloud {{properties in the}} infrared. Atmospheric ice and water vapor absorption peak in opposite halves of the window region so that positive 8 -minus- 11 -micron brightness temperature differences indicate cloud, while near-zero or negative differences indicate clear regions. The absorption coefficient for water increases more between 11 and 12 microns than between 8 and 11 microns, while for ice, the reverse is true. Cloud phases is determined by a scatter diagram of 8 -minus- 11 -micron versus 11 -minus- 12 -micron brightness temperature differences; ice cloud shows a slope greater than 1 and water cloud less than 1. The trispectral brightness temperature method was tested upon high-resolution interferometer data resulting in clear-cloud and cloud-phase delineation. Simulations using differing 8 -micron bandwidths revealed <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> degradation of <b>cloud</b> property detection. Thus, the 8 -micron bandwidth for future satellites can be selected based on the requirements of other applications, such as surface characterization studies. Application of the technique to current polar-orbiting High-Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) -Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) datasets is constrained by the nonuniformity of the cloud scenes sensed within the large HIRS field of view. Analysis of MAS (MODIS Airborne Simulator) high-spatial resolution (500 m) data with all three 8 -, 11 -, and 12 -micron bands revealed sharp delineation of differing cloud and background scenes, from which a simple automated threshold technique was developed. Cloud phase, clear-sky, and qualitative differences in cloud emissivity and cloud height were identified on a case study segment from 24 November 1991, consistent with the scene. More rigorous techniques would allow further cloud parameter clarification. The opportunities for global cloud delineation with the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) appear excellent.
