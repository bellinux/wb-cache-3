40|$|A {{spatially}} explicit coupled hydrodynamic-mass {{transport model}} system {{was used to}} simulate dispersal of particulate organic matter from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming in central <b>Norway.</b> <b>Model</b> setups of 32 m horizontal resolution were run for periods of up to 650 days for 3 sites of different oceanographic characteristics: one fjord location, one medium-exposed location influenced by fjord water, and one coastal location. Records on feed used for each cage at each location were converted to feces released based on a published mass balance model. The results from the simulations were compared with scores from corresponding mandatory benthic surveys (MOM-B) of the sediment layer beneath the farms. The correspondence between simulated and measured thickness of the sediment layer was good, and improved with the inclusion of resuspension processes. At all sites the distribution of organic matter in the bottom layer was non-homogeneous, with significant temporal variation and transport and settling of matter up to at least 0. 5 km away {{from one of the}} farms. Our results indicate that the monitoring practice used in Norway until now, with a few sediment grab samples taken mainly within the fish farm, may not adequately determine the areal impacts of all salmon farming operations. The patchy distribution of organic matter and the correspondence between simulation and survey results is attributed to the use of full 3 D current fields of a high spatiotemporal resolution and a good model for resuspension processes that some previous model studies have failed to properly account for...|$|E
40|$|The antigen-induced {{inflammatory}} {{response in the}} Brown Norway rat is a model commonly {{used to assess the}} impact of novel compounds on airway eosinophilia. A detailed functional, cellular and molecular characterization of this model has not yet been performed within a single study. This information together with the temporal changes in this phenomenon should be known before this model can be used, with confidence, to elucidate the mechanisms of action of novel anti-inflammatory drugs. Antigen challenge caused an accumulation of eosinophils in lung tissue 24 h after challenge. Accumulation of CD 2 + T cells was not apparent until after 72 h. Interestingly, mRNA for the Th 2 type cytokines interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5 and IL- 13 and eotaxin were elevated in lung tissue after challenge and the expression of IL- 13 and eotaxin protein increased at around 8 – 12 h. The temporal changes in both the biomarker production and the functional responses are important factors to consider in protocol design prior to initiating a compound screening program. A neutralising antibody (R 73) against αβ-TCR caused a significant reduction in T cell numbers accompanied by a significant suppression of eosinophil accumulation. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was not apparent in this specific Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>model</b> in sensitized animals after a single or multiple challenges although eosinophil influx was seen in the same animals. In conclusion, this is a convenient pre-clinical model (incorporating the measurement of biomarkers and functional responses) for screening novel small molecule inhibitors and/or biotherapeutics targeted against T cell/eosinophil infiltration/activation...|$|E

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} (OA) {{describes a}} change in the ocean's carbonate chemistry. Whereas its chemical processes are largely understood, the biological and socioeconomic consequences particularly in relation to fisheries are less known. Norway is a major fishing nation worldwide and is potentially affected by OA. To improve the understanding of the socioeconomic consequences of OA, we conducted a risk assessment among the Norwegian counties using a modified version of a risk assessment framework introduced in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's "Special Report: Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation," which considers risk to be the sum of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Our results show that about 13 of 19 counties are likely to experience moderate to high risk from OA. We highlight that the success of integrated risk assessments highly depends on the availability of detailed environmental, economic, and societal data. In the case of <b>Norway,</b> <b>modeling</b> data regarding the progress of OA, improved information on potential biological impacts on a larger number of species, and statistical data on social variables are required. We conclude that although still in its infancy, integrated risk assessments are important prerequisites for any form of interdisciplinary research on OA and the development of successful response strategies.

40|$|Abstract. A {{key feature}} of POPs (Persistent Organic Pollu-tants) is their {{potential}} for long-range atmospheric transport.

We also present four years (2004 – 2007) of new atmospheric measurement data for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) obtained at Birkenes, an EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) site in southern <b>Norway.</b> The <b>model</b> overestimates measured PCB- 28 and γ-HCH concentrations by factors of 2 and 8, re-spectively, which is most likely because the emissions used as input to the model are overestimated.
