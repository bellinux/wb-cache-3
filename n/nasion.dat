25|$|The nasofrontal angle, {{between the}} frontal bone and the <b>nasion</b> usually is 120 degrees; the nasofrontal angle is more acute {{in the male}} face than in the female face. The nasofacial angle, {{the slope of the}} nose {{relative}} to the plane of the face, is approximately 30–40 degrees. The nasolabial angle, the slope between the columella and the philtrum, is approximately 90–95 degrees in the male face, and approximately 100–105 degrees in the female face. Therefore, when observing the nose in profile, the normal show of the columella (the height of the visible nasal aperture) is 2mm; and the dorsum should be rectilinear (straight). When observed from below (worm’s-eye view), the alar base configures an isosceles triangle, with its apex at the infra-tip lobule, immediately beneath the tip of the nose. The facially proportionate projection of the nasal tip (the distance of the nose’s tip from the face) is determined with the Goode Method, wherein the projection of the nasal tip should be 55–60 per cent of the distance between the <b>nasion</b> (nasofrontal junction) and the tip-defining point. A columellar double break might be present, marking the transition between the intermediate crus of the lower-lateral cartilage and the medial crus.|$|E
25|$|The Goode Method {{determines the}} {{extension}} of the nose from the facial surface by comprehending the distance from the alar groove to the tip of the nose, and then relating that measurement (of nasal-tip projection) to the length of the nasal dorsum. The nasal projection measurement is obtained by delineating a right triangle with lines parting from the <b>nasion</b> (nasofrontal juncture) to the alar–facial–groove. Then, a second, perpendicular delineation, that traverses the tip-defining point, establishes the ratio of projection of the nasal tip; hence, the range of 0.55:1 to 0.60:1, is the ideal nasal-tip-to-nasal-length projection.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} nasal defects and deformities divides the nose into six (6) anatomic subunits: (i) the dorsum, (ii) the sidewalls (paired), (iii) the hemilobules (paired), (iv) the soft triangles (paired), (v) the alae (paired), and (vi) the columella. Surgical correction and reconstruction comprehend the entire anatomic subunit {{affected by the}} defect (wound) or deformity, thus, the entire subunit is corrected, especially when the resection (cutting) of the defect encompasses more than 50 per cent of the subunit. Aesthetically, the nose—from the <b>nasion</b> (the midpoint of the nasofrontal junction) to the columella-labial junction—ideally occupies one-third of the vertical dimension of the person’s face; and, from ala to ala, it ideally should occupy one-fifth of the horizontal dimension of the person's face.|$|E

50|$|Landmark points can {{be joined}} by lines to form axes, vectors, angles, and planes (a line between 2 points can define a plane by projection). For example, the sella (S) and the <b>nasion</b> (N) {{together}} form the sella-nasion line (SN or S-N). A prime symbol (′) usually indicates the point on the skin's surface that corresponds to a given bony landmark (for example, <b>nasion</b> (N) versus skin <b>nasion</b> (N′).|$|E
5000|$|Cecil C. Steiner {{developed}} Steiner Analysis in 1953. He used S-N {{plane as}} his reference line {{in comparison to}} FH plane due to difficulty in identifying the orbitale and porion. Some of the drawbacks of Steiner's analysis includes its reliability on the point <b>nasion.</b> <b>Nasion</b> as a point is known not to be stable due to its growth early in life. Therefore, a posteriorly positioned <b>nasion</b> will increase ANB and more anterior positioned <b>nasion</b> can decrease ANB. In addition, short S-N plane or stepper S-N plane {{can also lead to}} greater numbers of SNA, SNB and ANB which may not reflex the true position of the jaws compare to the cranial base. In addition, clockwise rotation of both jaws can increase ANB and counter-clockwise rotation of jaws can decrease ANB.|$|E

50|$|The glabella, in humans, is {{the skin}} between the eyebrows {{and above the}} nose. It also refers to the {{underlying}} bone which is slightly depressed, and joins the two superciliary ridges. It is a cephalometric landmark that is just superior to the <b>nasion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>nasion</b> {{is applied}} {{to the middle of the}} frontonasal suture. From the center of the notch the nasal process {{projects}} downward and forward beneath the nasal bones and frontal processes of the maxillæ, and supports the bridge of the nose.|$|E
50|$|In some {{individuals}} the suture can persist (totally or partly) into adulthood, {{and in these}} cases it {{is referred to as}} a persistent metopic suture. The suture can either bisect the frontal bone and run from <b>nasion</b> to bregma or persist as a partial metopic suture (see image of frontal bone) (where part of the suture survives and is connected to either bregma or <b>nasion)</b> or as an isolated metopic fissure. Persistent frontal sutures are of no clinical significance, although they can be mistaken for cranial fractures. As persistent frontal sutures are visible in radiographs, they can be useful for the forensic identification of human skeletal remains. Persistent frontal sutures {{should not be confused with}} supranasal sutures (a small zig-zag shaped suture located at and/or immediately superior to the glabella).|$|E

50|$|Two {{anatomical}} landmarks {{are used}} for the essential positioning of the EEG electrodes: first, the <b>nasion</b> which is the distinctly depressed area between the eyes, just above {{the bridge of the}} nose; second, the inion, which is the lowest point of the skull {{from the back of the}} head and is normally indicated by a prominent bump.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nasion</b> (nā′zē än′) is the {{intersection}} of the frontal bone and two nasal bones of the human skull. Its manifestation on the visible surface of the face is a distinctly depressed area directly between the eyes, just superior to the bridge of the nose. It is a cephalometric landmark that is just inferior to the glabella.|$|E

50|$|Kocher's {{point is}} a common entry point for an {{intraventricular}} catheter to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the cerebral ventricles. It is located 2-3 centimeters lateral to the midline (at approximately the mid-pupillary line) and approximately 11 cm posterior to the <b>nasion.</b> It {{is important to be}} at least 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture to avoid the primary motor cortex.|$|E
50|$|SNA and SNB is {{important}} to determine what type of intervention (on maxilla, mandible or both) is appropriate. These angles, however are influenced also by the vertical height of the face and a possible abnormal positioning of <b>nasion.</b> By using a comparative set of angles and distances, measurements {{can be related to}} one another and to normative values to determine variations in a patient’s facial structure.|$|E
