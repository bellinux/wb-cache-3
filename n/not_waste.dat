5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does <b>not</b> <b>waste</b> time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did <b>not</b> <b>waste</b> precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, {{after the}} Moodring album, {{she ended up}} in a year-long {{litigation}} with management. In late 2005, Harrison made a transition within the Universal system from Interscope to Universal Motown. In 2007 her fourth studio album Liberation was accidentally released in Japan when the release date changed. At the time, she was with Motown/Universal; her lawyer advised that she <b>not</b> <b>waste</b> time and money taking the issue to court, so Harrison decided to go independent instead. Japan loved the Liberation album so much, that a company by the named Manhattan Recordings located there approached her about doing business with them. In 2008, Harrison released her first independent album, titled Sugar & Spice, in Japan, a year after her split with Motown.|$|E

25|$|The first {{appearance}} of an Arsacid on the Armenian throne came about in 12 when the Parthian King Vonones I was exiled from Parthia {{due to his}} pro-Roman policies and Occidental manners. Vonones I briefly acquired the Armenian throne with Roman consent, but Artabanus III demanded his deposition, and as Emperor Augustus {{did not wish to}} begin a war with the Parthians he deposed Vonones I and sent him to Syria. Artabanus III did <b>not</b> <b>waste</b> time after the deposition of Vonones I; he installed his son Orodes on the Armenian throne. Emperor Tiberius had no intention of giving up the buffer states of the Eastern frontier and sent his nephew and heir Germanicus to the East.

25|$|The United States Navy sent a {{battleship}} {{group to}} Scapa Flow {{to join with}} the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to Queenstown, Ireland, and submarines to help guard convoys. Several regiments of U.S. Marines were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted American units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and <b>not</b> <b>waste</b> scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. General John J. Pershing, American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commander, refused to break up American units {{to be used as}} filler material. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The Harlem Hellfighters fought as part of the French 16th Division, and earned a unit Croix de Guerre for their actions at Château-Thierry, Belleau Wood, and Sechault. AEF doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by British Empire and French commanders due to the large loss of life that resulted.|$|E

500|$|The chance {{expected}} by Saavedra came in May 1810, when two British ships came {{with news of}} the peninsular war.
