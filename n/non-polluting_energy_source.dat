40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} by water splitting is a holy grail of science, being one {{route to a}} non-fossil fuel and a potential source of clean energy. It is essential to use a <b>non-polluting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> to drive the reaction and {{one way is to}} utilise sunlight energy, combined with a way to overcome the kinetic limitations of the reaction. The production of hydrogen by the photocatalytic cleavage of water can overcome these energetic hurdles. This area of science is briefly reviewed here, focussing on two routes, namely i) the use of sacrificial agents such as alcohols to act as oxygen scavengers and liberate hydrogen only and ii) by direct water splitting to produce both hydrogen and oxygen. The factors which are important in determining the characteristics of effective photocatalytic water splitting systems are elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Brazilian {{program for}} {{biodiesel}} use highlights {{the production of}} biodiesel from castor seeds. Biodiesel is a <b>non-polluting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> {{that has the potential}} to promote prosperity by creating jobs in poor regions of Brazil. However, the infrastructure, logistics, and proper facilities are lacking. A variety of approaches to optimizing the biodiesel supply chain have been proposed. The goal is to minimize the grain storage and transportation costs. This paper presents a comparison between a two-stage model and a multistage (three-stage) stochastic model to optimize the biodiesel supply chain. The comparison between these formulations shows that the flexibility gain provided by the multistage model results in a lower total logistic cost. The optimum for the three-stage model was 7, 700, 019 (BRL), compared to 8, 628, 002 (BRL) for the two-stage model, representing a savings of 927, 983 (BRL). We highlight that this model offers a real solution for castor supply chain design (considering uncertainty) in the Brazilian semiarid region, which is a poorer region of the country, thus making cost reduction mandatory...|$|E

In particular, solar energy is progressing as a potential inexhaustible and <b>non-polluting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> to suffice our ever-increasing energy requirements. However, the solar panels which are the fundamental solar-energy conversion components are fixed at a certain angle and are not able to track the sunlight direction with diurnal and seasonal changes. This limits the area of exposure of sunlight on solar panels and efficiency of the solar tracking system involving solar panels. We have developed a solar tracking system using a combination of micro-controller, stepper motor and light dependent resistors (LDR’s) with the primary aim of improving the power efficiency of the solar panels. The main component of this tracker is AT 89 S 52 micro-controller which is programmed to detect the sunlight with the help of LDRs and then actuate the stepper motor to position the solar panel in such a way so that it gets the maximum sunlight. Thus this system can achieve maximum illumination and can reduce the cost of electricity generation by requiring minimum number of solar panels with proper orientation with the sunlight.

In this paper, a test and characterization protocol of PV modules is presented. It consists of an outdoor computer controlled test bench using a LabVIEW graphical interface.

INTRODUCTION Industrial development and technological progress in several areas such as communication and transport is accompanied by enormous energy needs. Much of this energy is produced from fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas coal or nuclear. However, fossil energy production is highly polluting because it generates emissions of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste product requires very expensive treatments [1]. Renewable energies in general and solar photovoltaic (PV) in particular are therefore a good alternative to ensure sustainability in the global energy production with environmental protection because it is a renewable and a <b>non-polluting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> A solar PV source has long been limited to autonomous un-grid-connected applications in remote rural sites as desert lands or mountains or for nomad applications. But in the last decades, solar PV has entered into settlements with the Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) and technology of photovoltaic grid-connected systems. This has significantly increased the demand for PV modules and thus made this highly profitable market. Consequently, this phenomenon drived by the emergence of new applications of PV panels and systems, their large diffusion and a decrease of their price, has led to a large growth of the number of actors in this field, namely researchers, manufacturers and distributors.

In the present study, the conversion process is carried out in supercritical water (SCW), thus improving significantly the energy balance by eliminating the need for drying the biomass. The SCW dissolution, hydrolysis and oxidation of pure substances in a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) have been studied previously and unique results concerning the homogeneous dissolution of naphthalene, cellulose and glucose were acquired. The current investigation was performed for samples representing real biomass (winery residues) rather than pure substances.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanism of}} nuclear reactions at low energies caused by spatial extension of electron is considered. Nuclear reactions {{of this type}} represent intra-electronic processes, more precisely, the processes occurring inside the area of basic localization of electron. Distinctive characteristics of these processes are defined by interaction of the own field produced by electrically charged matter of electron with free nuclei. Heavy nucleus, appearing inside the area of basic localization of electron, is inevitably deformed because of interaction of protons with the adjoining layers of electronic cloud, which may cause nuclear fission. If there occur "inside" electron two or greater number of light nuclei, an attractive force appears between the nuclei which may result in the fusion of nuclei. The intra-electronic mechanism of nuclear reactions is of a universal character. For its realization {{it is necessary to}} have merely a sufficiently intensive stream of free electrons, i. e. heavy electric current, and as long as sufficiently great number of free nuclei. This mechanism may operate only at small energies of translational motion of the centers of mass of nuclei and electron. Because of the existence of simple mechanism of nuclear reactions at low energies, nuclear reactor turns out to be an atomic delayed-action bomb which may blow up by virtue of casual reasons, as it has taken place, apparently, in Chernobyl.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decade, wind energy {{has taken an}} {{increasingly}} important place {{in the field of}} electric energy generation. This kind of <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> is developed due to the global growing of electricity demand and the trend towards renewable and <b>non-polluting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> in the world [1]. Indeed, in wind energy conversion system (WECS), the maximum wind power could be extracted when the tip-speed-ratio of the turbine is maintained at its optimum value for different wind speed patterns [2]. Thus, it is necessary to develop more advanced control strategies for WECS. To this end, several control methods have been designed and implemented for wind energy generation such as, vector control which is based on voltage and flux oriented vector using the d-q rotating frame to decouple the active and reactive power, [3, 4]. In fact, this strategy is sensible to parameters variations of the system such as resistance and inductance variations. To overcome this problem, direct torque control (DTC) has been introduced by [5, 6] to directly control generator torque and stator flux using a predefined lookup table based on the estimation of the stator flux and electromagnetic torque. Direct power control (DPC) proposed in [7], has used the same concept of the DTC method. DPC control strategy is based on decoupling and direct control of reactive and active power [8]. In fact, the non-linear behaviors of mechanical and electrical parts of WECS as well as variations of electromechanical parameters represent crucial problems [9]. In addition, wind turbine (WT) works under high wind speed variations, which makes its control a serious challenge [10]. As result, several nonlinear control techniques have been developed in the literature for WT, such as fuzzy logic [11], neural networks [12], and high-order sliding mode control [13].|$|R
