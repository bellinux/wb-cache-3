50|$|Examples of {{mismatched}} bases {{include a}} G/T or A/C pairing (see DNA repair). Mismatches are commonly due to tautomerization of bases during DNA replication. The damage is repaired by {{recognition of the}} deformity caused by the mismatch, determining the template and <b>non-template</b> <b>strand,</b> and excising the wrongly incorporated base {{and replacing it with}} the correct nucleotide. The removal process involves more than just the mismatched nucleotide itself. A few or up to thousands of base pairs of the newly synthesized DNA strand can be removed.|$|E

40|$|In human {{mitochondria}} {{the transcription}} machinery generates the RNA primers needed for initiation of DNA replication. A critical {{feature of the}} leading-strand origin of mitochondrial DNA replication is a CG-rich element denoted conserved sequence block II (CSB II). During transcription of CSB II, a G-quadruplex structure forms in the nascent RNA, which stimulates transcription termination and primer formation. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the newly synthesized primers form a stable and persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, a R-loop, near the leading-strand origin of DNA replication. We here demonstrate that the unusual behavior of the RNA primer is explained by the formation of a stable G-quadruplex structure, involving the CSB II region in both the nascent RNA and the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand.</b> Based on our data, we suggest that G-quadruplex formation between nascent RNA and the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand</b> may be a regulated event, which decides the fate of RNA primers and ultimately the rate of initiation of DNA synthesis in human mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{promoter}} {{recognition site}} on the σ 70 initiation factor is shielded from interaction with DNA unless σ 70 is bound to the core component of RNA polymerase (RNAP). It is shown that interaction of σ 70 with the isolated β′ subunit of Escherichia coli RNAP is sufficient to induce unshielding of the DNA binding site. Using UV-induced DNA-protein cross-linking we demonstrate that free β′ stimulates specific cross-links between region 2 of the σ 70 polypeptide and a fragment of the <b>non-template</b> promoter <b>strand</b> containing the TATAAT sequence. Thus the σβ′ subassembly of RNAP can assume a functionally competent conformation independently of {{the bulk of the}} RNAP core...|$|R
50|$|CRISPRi can sterically repress {{transcription}} in {{two ways}} - by blocking transcriptional initiation or elongation. This is accomplished by designing sgRNA complementary to the promoter or exonic sequences, respectively. The level of transcriptional repression for exonic sequences is strand-specific. sgRNA complementary to the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> more strongly represses transcription compared to sgRNA complementary to the template strand. One hypothesis to explain this effect is from the activity of helicase, which unwinds the RNA:DNA heteroduplex ahead of RNA pol II when the sgRNA is complementary to exons of the template strand. In prokaryotes, this steric inhibition can repress transcription of the target gene by almost 99.9%. Whereas in human cells, up to 90% repression was observed.|$|E
50|$|One {{strand of}} the DNA, the {{template}} strand (or noncoding strand), {{is used as}} a template for RNA synthesis.

50|$|The {{open and}} closed conformations {{refer to the}} state of the DNA and whether the {{template}} strand has been separated from the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> within the PIC. The place at which the DNA opens to form the bubble lies above a tunnel that is lined by the B-core, B-linker and B-reader as well as parts of RNA polymerase II. The B linker is found directly aligned with {{the point at which the}} DNA opens and in the open complex it is found between the two DNA strands, suggesting that it has a role in promoter melting, but it does not have a role in the catalytic RNA synthesis. Although TFIIB keeps a similar structure in both conformations some of the intramolecular interactions between the core and the B reader are disrupted upon DNA opening.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFormaldehyde {{cross-linking}} {{was used}} in a kinetic analysis of RNA polymerase-lacUV 5 promoter interactions in open complexes (RP(o)). RP(o) quenched from 37 degrees C to 14 degrees C isomerised to a closed, competitor resistant, complex (RP(LT)). We observed that contacts of the beta' and sigma subunits with the positions - 3, - 5 of the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand</b> disappeared very quickly during the first 30 seconds after the temperature downshift. The re-annealing of the DNA downstream of the transcription start site {{takes place in the}} same time scale. However re-annealing of the upstream part of the transcription bubble was slower and completed within five minutes. The results support a two-step model of promoter melting and suggest that conformational changes in the RNA polymerase occur concurrently with the melting around the transcription start site...|$|R
40|$|U 6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) {{functions}} {{as a component of}} the spliceosome and is required to splice eukaryotic pre-mRNAs. Although the other spliceosomal snRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II, U 6 snRNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase III. The genes that code for U 6 snRNA have promoters that are completely gene-external, that is, in the 5 '-flanking DNA. These promoters contain a TATA box, as well as a required upstream proximal sequence element (PSE) that is unique to snRNA genes. The PSE is recognized by a multi-subunit transcription factor SNAPc, whereas the TATA sequence is bound by the general transcription factor TFIIIB, which is responsible for assembling an RNA polymerase III initiation complex. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, TFIIIB is composed of three distinct subunits that assemble on the U 6 promoter: TBP, Bdp 1 and Brf 1. [On tRNA and 5 S rRNA promoters in fruit flies, TRF 1 (TBP-related factor 1) is employed in place of TBP. ] At the present time, the overall structures of TFIIIB and particularly the Brf 1 and Bdp 1 subunits are not well known. To better understand the mode of fruit fly TFIIIB binding to DNA, I have used site-specific protein-DNA photo-cross-linking. I introduced photo-cross-linker at every second phosphate position in the DNA backbone on both the template and <b>non-template</b> <b>strands</b> within and surrounding the fly U 6 TATA box. I have in this manner mapped the locations where each of the TFIIIB subunits lies in close proximity to the DNA. Brf 1 cross-links strongly to the DNA within and upstream of the TATA box, whereas Bdp 1 cross-links strongly both upstream and downstream but not within the TATA sequence. The data indicate that Bdp 1 lies on the DNA in close proximity to two subunits of DmSNAPc. Bdp 1 may therefore play a primary role in the recruitment of TFIIIB to the U 6 promoter through interactions with DmSNAPc...|$|R
40|$|The RNA Pol II {{transcription}} complex pauses just downstream of the promoter {{in a significant}} fraction of human genes. The local features of genomic structure that contribute to pausing have not been defined. Here, we show that genes that pause are more G-rich within the region flanking the transcription start site (TSS) than RefSeq genes or non-paused genes. We show that enrichment of binding motifs for common transcription factors, such as SP 1, may account for G-richness upstream but not downstream of the TSS. We further show that pausing correlates {{with the presence of}} a GrIn 1 element, an element bearing one or more G 4 motifs at the 5 ′-end of the first intron, on the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand.</b> These results suggest potential roles for dynamic G 4 DNA and G 4 RNA structures in cis-regulation of pausing, and thus genome-wide regulation of gene expression, in human cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{transcription}} initiation, the bacterial RNA polymerase binds double-stranded (ds) promoter DNA and subsequently effects strand separation of 12 to 14 base pairs (bp), including the start site of transcription, to form the so-called “open complex” (also referred to as RPo). This complex is competent to initiate RNA synthesis. Here we will review the role of σ 70 and its homologs in the strand separation process, and evidence that strand separation is initiated at the − 11 A (the A of the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> that is 11 bp upstream from the transcription start site) of the promoter. By using the fluorescent adenine analog, 2 -aminopurine, it was demonstrated that the − 11 A on the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> flips out of the DNA helix and into a hydrophobic pocket where it stacks with tyrosine 430 of σ 70. Open complexes are remarkably stable, even though in vivo, and under most experimental conditions in vitro, dsDNA is much more stable than its strand-separated form. Subsequent structural studies of other researchers have confirmed that in the open complex the − 11 A has flipped into a hydrophobic pocket of σ 70. It was also revealed that RPo was stabilized by three additional bases of the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> being flipped out of the helix and into hydrophobic pockets, further preventing re-annealing of the two complementary DNA strands...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecognition of the - 10 {{promoter}} consensus element {{by region}} 2 of the bacterial RNA polymerase sigma subunit {{is a key}} step in transcription initiation. sigma also functions as an elongation factor, inducing transcription pausing by interacting with transcribed DNA <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> sequences {{that are similar to}} the - 10 element sequence. Here, we show that the region 1. 2 of Escherichia coli sigma 70, whose function was heretofore unknown, is strictly required for efficient recognition of the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> of - 10 -like pause-inducing DNA sequence by sigma region 2, and for sigma-dependent promoter-proximal pausing. Recognition of the fork-junction promoter DNA by RNA polymerase holoenzyme also requires sigma region 1. 2 and thus resembles the pause-inducing sequence recognition. Our results, together with available structural data, support a model where sigma region 1. 2 acts as a core RNA polymerase-dependent allosteric switch that modulates non-template DNA strand recognition by sigma region 2 during transcription initiation and elongation...|$|E

With this photo-responsive promoter, on-off switching of transcription by light irradiation was achieved. This strategy was also effective for the photo-regulation of SP 6 -RNA polymerase...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin class {{switching}} is mediated by recombination between switch sequences located immediately upstream of the immunoglobulin constant heavy chain genes. Targeting of recombination to particular switch sequences is associated temporally with transcription through these regions. We recently have provided evidence for inducible and stable RNA–DNA hybrid formation at switch sequences in the mouse genome that are mechanistically important for {{class switching}} in vivo. Here, we define in vitro the precise {{configuration of the}} DNA and RNA strands within this hybrid structure at the Sμ, Sγ 3 and Sγ 2 b mouse switch sequences. We find that the G–rich (<b>non-template)</b> DNA <b>strand</b> of each switch sequence is hypersensitive to probes throughout much of its length, while the C–rich (template) DNA strand is essentially resistant. These results demonstrate formation of an R–loop, whereby the G–rich RNA strand forms a stable heteroduplex with its C–rich DNA strand counterpart, and the G–rich DNA strand exists primarily in a single-stranded state. We propose that the organized structure of the R–loop is essential for targeting the class switch recombination machinery to these sequences...|$|R
40|$|RfaH is a {{bacterial}} elongation factor that increases expression of distal genes in several long, horizontally acquired operons. RfaH is recruited to the transcription complex during RNA chain elongation through specific interactions with a DNA element called ops. Following recruitment, RfaH remains bound to RNA polymerase (RNAP) and {{acts as an}} antiterminator by reducing RNAP pausing and termination at some factor-independent and Rho-dependent signals. RfaH consists of two domains connected by a flexible linker. The N-terminal RfaH domain (RfaHN) recognizes the ops element, binds to the RNAP and reduces pausing and termination in vitro. Functional analysis of single substitutions in this domain reported here suggests that three separate RfaHN regions mediate these functions. We propose that a polar patch {{on one side of}} RfaHN interacts with the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand</b> during recruitment, whereas a hydrophobic surface {{on the opposite side of}} RfaHN remains bound to the β′ subunit clamp helices domain throughout transcription of the entire operon. The third region is apparently dispensable for RfaH binding to the transcription complex but is required for the antitermination modification of RNAP...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} analysis {{was carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of ribonucleotide substitution at various locations within the promoter element for T 7 RNA polymerase. Ribonucleotides could be introduced at most positions without significantly decreasing transcription efficiency. A critical window of residues that were intolerant of RNA substitution was defined for both the <b>non-template</b> and template <b>strands</b> of the promoter. These residues are involved in important contacts with the AT-rich recognition loop, specificity loop, and P-intercalating hairpin of the polymerase. These results highlight the malleability of T 7 RNA polymerase in recognizing its promoter element and suggest that promoters with altered backbone conformations may be used in molecular biology applications that employ T 7 RNA polymerase for in vitro transcription...|$|R
40|$|Topoisomerase I (TOP 1) -mediated DNA damage {{induced by}} {{camptothecin}} (CPT) {{in the presence}} of active transcription has been studied using purified calf thymus TOP 1 and T 7 RNA polymerase. CPT-stabilized TOP 1 cleavable complexes located on the template strand within the transcribed region were found to be converted into irreversible strand breaks by the elongating RNA polymerase. By contrast, CPT-stabilized TOP 1 cleavable complexes located on the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> within the transcribed region was unaffected by the elongating RNA polymerase. Previous studies have demonstrated that the elongating T 7 RNA polymerase is arrested by TOP 1 cleavable complexes located on the template but not the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> [Bendixen et al., (1990) Biochemistry, 29, 5613 - 5619]. Together, these results suggest a model in which collision between the TOP 1 -cleavable complexes located on the template strand and the elongating RNA polymerase results in transcription arrest and conversion of TOP 1 cleavable complexes into 'irreversible' strand breaks. The implication of the transcription collision model in DNA damage and repair, as well as cell killing, is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Formation of the stable, strand separated, ‘open’ complex between RNA {{polymerase}} and a promoter involves DNA melting {{of approximately}} 14 base pairs. The likely nucleation site is the highly conserved − 11 A {{base in the}} <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> of the − 10 promoter region. Amino acid residues Y 430 and W 433 on the σ 70 subunit of the RNA polymerase participate in the strand separation. The roles of − 11 A and of the Y 430 and W 433 were addressed by employing synthetic consensus promoters containing base analog and other substitutions at − 11 in the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand,</b> and σ 70 variants bearing amino acid substitutions at positions 430 and 433. Substitutions for − 11 A and for Y 430 and W 433 in σ 70 have small or no effects on formation of the initial RNA polymerase-promoter complex, but exert their effects on subsequent steps {{on the way to}} formation of the open complex. As substitutions for Y 430 and W 433 also affect open complex formation on promoter DNA lacking the − 11 A base, it is concluded that these amino acid residues have other (or additional) roles, not involving the − 11 A. The effects of the substitutions at − 11 A of the promoter and Y 430 and W 433 of σ 70 are cumulative...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundaries}} of R-loops are well-documented at immunoglobulin heavy chain loci in mammalian B cells. Within primary B cells or B cell lines, the up-stream {{boundaries of}} R-loops typically begin {{early in the}} repetitive portion of the switch regions. Most R-loops terminate within the switch repetitive zone, but the remainder can extend a few hundred base pairs further, where G-density on the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand</b> gradually drops to the genome average. Whether the G-density determines how far the R-loops extend is an important question. We previously studied the role of G-clusters in initiating R-loop for-mation, {{but we did not}} examine the role of G-density in permitting the elongation of the R-loop, after it had initiated. Here, we vary the G-density of differ-ent portions of the switch region in a murine B cell line. We find that both class switch recombination (CSR) and R-loop formation decrease significantly when the overall G-density is reduced from 46 % to 29 %. Short 50 bp insertions with low G-density within switch regions do not appear to affect either CSR or R-loop elongation, whereas a longer (150 bp) in-sertion impairs both. These results demonstrate that G-density is an important determinant of the length over which mammalian genomic R-loops extend...|$|R
40|$|The RNA {{polymerase}} II (Pol II) is a eukaryotic {{enzyme that}} catalyzes {{the synthesis of}} the messenger RNA using a DNA template. Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains elusive whether the "secondary channel" is the only route for NTP to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the "main channel" could be an alternative. On this regard, crystallographic structures of Pol II have been extremely useful to understand the structural basis of transcription, however, the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the full transcription bubble (TB) is still unknown. Since diffusion routes of the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate through the main channel might overlap with the TB region, gaining structural information of the full TB is critical for a complete understanding of Pol II transcription process. In this study, we have built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations together with structural analysis {{to shed light on}} NTP entry pathways. Interestingly, we found that although both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on MD simulations with NTP loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the NTP through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand.</b> Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{transcription}} elongation and repair of UV－damage is coupled. In eukaryotes，stalled RNA pol II recruits several repair proteins to from a complex containing RNA pol II，TFIIH，and the repair proteins．In prokaryotes，stalled RNAP recruits Mfd protein．Mfd has a domain homologous to the domain in UvrB which recognizes a wide range of structurally diverse lesions in addition to a domain for interaction with RNAP．Mfd binds to the DNA segment immediately upstream of the stalled RNAP and pushes it towards downstream by using the energy of ATP-hydrolysis to dissociate it from DNA，and speculated to recruit UvrA to perform the repair similar to the global nuclear excision repair. These mechanisms provide the concept on the triggering DNA repair rather than that on transcriptional regulation． 　　Although RNAP tends to stall at all kinds of UV-damages，the efficiency of stallat at a UV-damage has not been measured．Therefore，it is possible that inhibition of transcription is carried out by a mechanism other than the stall of RNAP．The stall could be overcome by a read-through of the damaged base by misincorporation， slippage，Jump，and switching the template strand．These considerations indicate the mechanism of coulpling of UV-damages and initiation，because initiation generally has the largest dynamic range of transcriptional regulation．Irrespective of the efforts to find specific factors triggering the inhibition in initiation，such factors have not been found yet, suggesting an alternative possibility that the triggering function has been already installed in RNAP． 　　Transcription initiation is biochemically separated into several steps．RNAP in the form of holoenzyme binds to a promoter and then DNA duplex in the complex is partially unwound to expose the template strand of DNA by mostly unknown mechanism. The resultant complex is called open complex and this complex was once considered to be homogeneous．However，it is now known to involve two or more conformations which have different catalytic properties，forming branched pathway mechanism. One branch leads to produce the full-length transcripts（productive pathway），While another leads to produce only short transcripts iteratively synthesized by“moribund complex”which is defined as a complex that produces only abortive but no full-length transcripts（non-productive pathway）. On some promoters， moribund complex is converted into dead-end complex which still maintains transcript but lacks elongation activity．Accumulation of dead-end complex cause less stoichiometric synthesis of the full-length products in a single-round transcription assay. 　　To examine the potential coupling and its mechanism，I have studied on the relationship between transcription initiation and UV-damage by using purified reconstitution system of E. coli．This well-characterized system allows me to consider the relationship between the structure and the function．The system is composed of RNAP holoenzyme，a promoter DNA，and four NTPs as substrates．I selected the T 7 A 1 promoter because little moribund and dead-end complexes are accumulating on this promoter，simplifying the analysis of the branched pathway. By irradiating the promoter DNA with UV light，UV damages are generated at adjacent pyrimidine bases in the promoter region. If the generated damages are up stream from the transcription start site，such damages are nothing to do with elongation pause and thus their effect on transcription must be limited to the effect on initiation． 　　In this study, UV-irradiation of the template DNA was found to enhance abortive initiation and to induce dead-end complex，namely enhancing the nonproductive pathway．The positions of UV-damage in the template DNA in moribund and dead-end complex was compared with those in the binary complex that contains productive complex．The pyrimidine dimers at several sites in the upstream from the transcription start site，but not all，were enriched in the moribund and dead-end complexes．indicating that these UV-damaged pyrimidine bases induce these complexes. These positions of the damages are on both template and <b>non-template</b> <b>strands.</b> The induction by the damaged pyrimidine residues are confirmed by the transcription on DNA fragments which contain single UV-damageds in the upstream region．Furthermore，I found that adjacent pyrimidine bases are conserved atone or more positions of those identified on T 7 A 1 promoter among the majority of the E．coli promoters，suggesting that these positions would be UV-sensor motif in promoters．<br /...|$|R
40|$|DNA-directed RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) {{is highly}} conserved among {{eukaryotic}} organisms and plays {{a fundamental role in}} cellular life, specifically gene transcription. This process is universal {{and is at}} the core of gene regulation; therefore, understanding its molecular details will provide essential clues that could potentially lead to pharmacological manipulation of gene expression. In this work we reveal, for the first time, the nature of interactions between Pol II and a complete nucleic acid scaffold. The upstream double helix lies over a wedge-shaped loop from Rpb 2 (862 - 874) that engages the minor groove, providing part of the structural framework for DNA tracking during elongation. Rudder and fork loop- 1 residues insert in between the DNA/RNA hybrid and <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> at the upstream end of the bubble, suggesting a direct role in coordinating annealing of DNA strands. At the downstream end, interactions between the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand,</b> Rpb 1 (1103 - 1112) and Rpb 2 (501 - 510) support an open fork. These Rpb 1 residues form a rigid domain with the trigger loop (TL), stabilizing its off, non-catalytic state, indicating that “on/off” conformational transitions, where the TL moves in close proximity to the matched nucleotide for catalysis, may be linked to interactions with the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand.</b> To further examine the role, structurally, of the trigger loop and bridge helix during translocation and catalysis, we characterized the gain of function T 834 P variant of Pol II. Structural studies of T 834 P in the presence of a matched nucleotide revealed the complete TL in the on-state, a conformation only observed previously in two low resolution datasets. Our preliminary analysis suggests that kinking of the bridge helix potentially shifts equilibrium into the post-translocation state during the nucleotide addition cycle, which would prolong interactions of the trigger loop with the matched nucleotide in the insertion site. Elucidation of these structures was achieved through the use of X-ray free electron laser sources, which extended the resolution to 3. 3 Å. Methodologies, like serial femtosecond crystallography and transmission electron microscopy, to aid in structural studies of highly relevant, and challenging protein targets, including multi-protein complexes of the transcriptional machinery are also discussed...|$|E

Zipping of pyrene moieties in an easily denaturing duplex gave formation of a strong excimer band at 480 nm upon excitation at 343 nm in the steady-state fluorescence spectra. The excimer band disappeared upon addition of a similar short dsDNA, but remained when adding a 128 mer dsDNA containing the same sequence. When P was inserted into 2 ′-OMe-RNA strands, the duplex with zipping P was found to be more stable (42. 0 °C) than duplexes with the complementary ssDNAs (31. 5 and 19. 5 °C). The excimer band observed in the ds 2 ′-OMe-RNA with zipping P had marginal changes upon addition of both 8 and 128 mer dsDNA. Synthesized oligonucleotides were tested in a transcriptional inhibition assay for targeting of the open complex formed by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase with the lac UV- 5 promoter using the above mentioned 128 mer dsDNA. Inhibition of transcription was observed for 8 mer DNAs possessing pyrene intercalators and designed to target both template and <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strands</b> within the open complex. The observed inhibition was partly a result of unspecific binding of the modified DNAs to the RNA polymerase. Furthermore, the addition of 8 mer DNA with three bulged insertions of P designed to be complementary to the template strand at the + 36 to + 43 position downstream of the transcription start resulted in a specific halt of transcription producing a truncated RNA transcript. This is to our knowledge the first report of an RNA elongation stop mediated by a small DNA sequence possessing intercalators.

40|$|R-loops are {{transient}} intermediates {{that are}} formed during the transcription and consist of an RNA-DNA hybrid that is formed between the nascent RNA strand and the template DNA strand and a displaced <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand.</b> Formation of R-loops {{have been detected}} in organisms from bacteria to humans. If R-loops form more frequently, they impact transcription affecting genome stability, genome integrity and cause a number of diseases. Recently, genome instability caused due to stable RNA-DNA hybrid in R-loop was shown to predominantly associate with expansion of trinucleotide repeats, leading to many incurable neurological and neuromuscular genetic disorders like Myotonic dystrophy 1, Fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, Friedreich’s ataxia, Spinocerebellar ataxias etc. Till date, the structural information about RNA-DNA hybrids formed by trinucleotide repeat expansions (TREs) are unknown to elucidate the mechanism behind RNA-DNA hybrid in instigating TREs. In this context, we aim here to study the structures of RNA-DNA hybrids consisting of trinucleotide repeats such as dGAA-rUUC, rGAA-dTTC, rCAG-dCTG, rCUG-dCAG, rCGG-dCCG and rCCG-dCGG by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique. It’s noteworthy that trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (TREDs) can also be treated at mRNA level, wherein, a short complimentary DNA oligonucleotide is targeted against the mRNA that {{is followed by the}} cleavage of the mRNA strand by RNase H 1 enzyme. Thus, to understand the efficacy of RNase H 1 against TRE containing RNA-DNA hybrid, the interaction of TRE containing RNADNA hybrid with RNase H 1 is also probed. Such scenario comes into picture during replication, wherein a transient RNA-DNA hybrid is formed and subsequently, the RNA strand is cleaved by RNase H 1. Thus, this investigation is expected to shed light on structural properties of TRE containing RNA-DNA hybrids as well as its complex with RNase H 1 to understand the TRE mechanism at replication and transcription levels and their treatment. The study on structure and dynamics of RNA-DNA hybrids consisting of various TREs suggest that these hybrids have both A & B characteristics irrespectively of sequence. The study on HsRNase H 1 complexed with TREs containing RNA-DNA hybrids suggest that the protein follow the same cleavage mechanism for all the hybrids irrespective of sequence and thus, antisense strategy can be utilized to treat TREDs at RNA level...|$|R
40|$|Mitotic genome {{instability}} {{can occur}} during the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which arise from endogenous and exogenous sources. Studying {{the mechanisms of}} DNA repair in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that Homologous Recombination (HR) is a vital repair mechanism for DSBs. HR {{can result in a}} crossover event, in which the broken molecule reciprocally exchanges information with a homologous repair template. The current model of double-strand break repair (DSBR) also allows for a tract of information to non-reciprocally transfer from the template molecule to the broken molecule. These “gene conversion” events can vary in size and can occur in conjunction with a crossover event or in isolation. The frequency and size of gene conversions in isolation and gene conversions associated with crossing over {{has been a source of}} debate due to the variation in systems used to detect gene conversions and the context in which the gene conversions are measured. In Chapter 2, I use an unbiased system that measures the frequency and size of gene conversion events, as well as the association of gene conversion events with crossing over between homologs in diploid yeast. We show mitotic gene conversions occur at a rate of 1. 3 x 10 - 6 per cell division, are either large (median 54. 0 kb) or small (median 6. 4 kb), and are associated with crossing over 43 % of the time. DSBs can arise from endogenous cellular processes such as replication and transcription. Two important RNA/DNA hybrids are involved in replication and transcription: R-loops, which form when an RNA transcript base pairs with the DNA template and displaces the <b>non-template</b> DNA <b>strand,</b> and ribonucleotides embedded into DNA (rNMPs), which arise when replicative polymerase errors insert ribonucleotide instead of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. RNaseH 1 (encoded by RNH 1) and RNaseH 2 (whose catalytic subunit is encoded by RNH 201) both recognize and degrade the RNA in within R-loops while RNaseH 2 alone recognizes, nicks, and initiates removal of rNMPs embedded into DNA. Due to their redundant abilities to act on RNA:DNA hybrids, aberrant removal of rNMPs from DNA has been thought to lead to genome instability in an rnh 201 Δ background. 	In Chapter 3, I characterize (1) non-selective genome-wide homologous recombination events and (2) crossing over on chromosome IV in mutants defective in RNaseH 1, RNaseH 2, or RNaseH 1 and RNaseH 2. Using a mutant DNA polymerase that incorporates 4 -fold fewer rNMPs than wild type, I demonstrate that the primary recombinogenic lesion in the RNaseH 2 -defective genome is not rNMPs, but rather R-loops. This work suggests different in-vivo roles for RNaseH 1 and RNaseH 2 in resolving R-loops in yeast and is consistent with R-loops, not rNMPs, being the the likely source of pathology in Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome patients defective in RNaseH 2.

40|$|The {{active center}} clefts of RNA {{polymerase}} (RNAP) from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) and of yeast RNAP II are nearly identical, including four protruding loops, the lid, rudder, fork 1 and fork 2. Here {{we present a}} structure–function analysis of recombinant Pfu RNAP variants lacking these cleft loops, and analyze the function of each loop {{at different stages of}} the transcription cycle. All cleft loops except fork 1 were required for promoter-directed transcription and efficient elongation. Unprimed de novo transcription required fork 2, the lid was necessary for primed initial transcription. Analysis of templates containing a pre-melted bubble showed that rewinding of upstream DNA drives RNA separation from the template. During elongation, downstream DNA strand separation required template strand binding to an invariant arginine in switch 2, and apparently interaction of an invariant arginine in fork 2 with the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of 4 '-N(2 -aminoethyl) aminomethyl- 4, 5 ', 8 -trimethylpsoralen-modified oligonucleoside methylphosphonates with synthetic ds-DNA containing a T 7 RNA polymerase promoter was studied. The oligomers effectively crosslinked with either coding or noncoding ss-DNA when irradiated at 365 nm, {{but not with}} ds-DNA. The extent of the crosslinking reaction, which was complete within 16 min: (a) reached its maximum at an oligomer concentration of 3 microM; (b) remained constant below the Tm of the duplex and then rapidly decreased; and (c) appeared to depend upon the sequence surrounding the psoralen crosslinking site. An oligomer crosslinked to the template strand inhibited transcription by T 7 RNA polymerase whereas an oligomer crosslinked to the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> had only a small inhibitory effect. Oligomers did not crosslink to ds-DNA undergoing transcription nor did they inhibit the transcription reaction...|$|E
40|$|Long non-coding natural {{antisense}} transcripts (NATs) are {{widespread in}} eukaryotic species. Although recent {{studies indicate that}} long NATs are engaged in the regulation of gene expression, the precise functional roles {{of the vast majority}} of them are unknown. Here we report that a long NAT (Mm-antiNos 1 RNA) complementary to mRNA encoding the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (Nos 1) is expressed in the mouse brain and is transcribed from the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> of the Nos 1 locus. Nos 1 produces nitric oxide (NO), a major signaling molecule in the CNS implicated in many important functions including neuronal differentiation and memory formation. We show that the newly discovered NAT negatively regulates Nos 1 gene expression. Moreover, our quantitative studies of the temporal expression profiles of Mm-antiNos 1 RNA in the mouse brain during embryonic development and postnatal life indicate that it may be involved in the regulation of NO-dependent neurogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Bidirectional {{transcription}} footprinting {{has been}} used to probe the platination of DNA by cisplatin, and to examine the modulation of these interactions by (a) cyclisation of the non-reactive amino group by either ethyl or propyl groups, and (b) the further addition of a pendant intercalator (9 -amino acridine) linked by either phenylethyl or phenylpentyl groups. Intrastrand crosslinking was detected for all derivatives at all 5 '-GG and 5 '-AG sequences on the template strand, but the same sites did not result in transcriptional blockages when on the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand.</b> There was little effect of cyclysation of the amino groups, but the further addition of an intercalator resulted in three responses: a time-dependent increase of the blocked transcript by one and three nucleotides; a reduction of the sequence selectivity of platination; a decrease of apparent interstrand crosslinking for these derivatives with a pendant intercalator tethered to the amino moiety of cisplatin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTime-resolved laser UV {{irradiation}} {{and controlled}} proteolysis {{have been used}} to study the sequential recognition of the lac UV 5 promoter by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. Local rearrangements in the DNA, the appearance of intimate protein-DNA contacts, and structural changes within the sigma subunit together provide specific signatures that define major species populated during this process. At 22 degreesC, a first closed complex is characterised by a transient conformational change in the sigma subunit and by a distortion in the - 35 region. Subsequently, direct contacts at - 34 and at positions - 8, - 5 and - 3 on the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> appear prior to DNA strand separation. The contact in the - 35 consensus region involves only the sigma subunit. This intermediate possesses different structural parameters from that formed by quenching open complexes from 37 degreesC to 14 degreesC. Sigma thus appears as the principal partner acting during promoter recognition, a strongly coupled process involving two major intermediates only...|$|E
40|$|CRISPRi, an adapted CRISPR-Cas 9 system, is {{proposed}} {{to act as}} a strand-specific roadblock to repress transcription in eukaryotic cells using guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target catalytically inactive Cas 9 (dCas 9) and offers an alternative to genetic interventions for studying pervasive antisense transcription. Here, we successfully use click chemistry to construct DNA templates for sgRNA expression and show, rather than acting simply as a roadblock, sgRNA/dCas 9 binding creates an environment that is permissive for transcription initiation/termination, thus generating novel sense and antisense transcripts. At HMS 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sgRNA/dCas 9 targeting to the <b>non-template</b> <b>strand</b> for antisense transcription results in antisense transcription termination, premature termination of a proportion of sense transcripts and initiation of a novel antisense transcript downstream of the sgRNA/dCas 9 -binding site. This redefinition of the transcriptional landscape by CRISPRi demonstrates that it is not strand-specific and highlights the controls and locus understanding required to properly interpret results from CRISPRi interventions...|$|E
