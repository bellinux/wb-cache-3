5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly</b> should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
25|$|Several {{aviation}} {{incidents and}} accidents have occurred in which the control surfaces of the aircraft became disabled, often due to failure of hydraulic systems or the flight control system. Other incidents have occurred where controls were <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly</b> prior to take-off, either due to maintenance or pilot error, and controls can become inoperative from extreme weather conditions. Aircraft are not designed to be flown in such circumstances, however {{a small number of}} pilots have had some success in flying and landing aircraft with disabled controls.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Sarkozy, Juppé {{spoke of a}} [...] "happy identity" [...] and {{emphasized the importance of}} integration as opposed to assimilation. He supported drawing up a common list of [...] "safe countries" [...] to differentiate refugees from economic migrants, setting a [...] "quota" [...] on immigrants as necessary, and to stop providing foreign aid to countries refusing to comply with their obligation to accept deported citizens. He questioned Sarkozy's proposals on Schengen and instead merely acknowledged that it was <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly,</b> but concurred with him in exempting the acquisition of French nationality by foreigners at the age of 18 if previously convicted. Juppé also demanded transparency on the funding of places of worship, civic training for imams, and, unlike Sarkozy, favored allowing women to wear the Muslim headscarf at universities. On economic issues, he proposed to end the 35-hour workweek, abolish the wealth tax, reduce corporate taxation, and set the retirement age at 65. He also pledged to slash in half the number of parliamentarians, renegotiate Schengen, and increase defense spending in absolute terms by at least €7 billion by 2022.|$|E
25|$|In early March 2017, it was {{reported}} that Götze had been suffering from a metabolic disorder. The health condition was later found out to be myopathy, a muscular disorder which affects the fibres in the muscles, meaning they do <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{the removal}} of tissue fluid does <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly,</b> {{and there is a}} build-up. This can cause swelling, often around the feet and ankles, which is {{generally}} known as edema. The position of swelling is due to the effects of gravity.|$|R
50|$|Monoblock LNBs for 19.2° {{east and}} 13° east {{have been widely}} {{available}} for several years (indeed, the DiSEqC switching system was originally designed for just this setup). However, these do <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> for Astra 23.5°E and Astra19.2°E because these satellites are at a different angular separation.|$|R
50|$|When these {{channels}} are <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly,</b> or are absent from their usual domains, several issues can result.|$|E
50|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with iodine deficiency, or with other forms of congenital hypothyroidism, such as thyroid dyshormonogenesis, where the thyroid is present but <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hepatic or renal diseases: The blood {{concentrations}} {{of drugs that}} are metabolized in the liver and / or eliminated by the kidneys may be altered if either of these organs is <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly.</b> If {{this is the case}} an increase in blood concentration is normally seen.|$|E
50|$|Although the new DAQ HF/DF {{system worked}} well in shore-based testing and was {{theoretically}} sound, it did <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> when installed on ships, giving false positives and ambiguous location readings. Goldstein was tasked {{to devise a}} solution to this problem for both Navy and Coast Guard vessels.|$|R
5000|$|The CCD has {{state of}} the art push button {{accessible}} doors for wheelchair accessible entry {{to the front of the}} building. As of early April 2017 they have been reported to <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> in that they do not open far enough to allow a wheelchair to enter or exit.|$|R
5000|$|Voltage drop {{analysis}} - Also {{known as}} IR-drop analysis, this check verifies if {{the power grid}} {{is strong enough to}} ensure that the voltage representing the binary high value never dips lower than a set margin (below which the circuit will <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> or reliably) due to the combined switching of millions of transistors.|$|R
50|$|One aspect {{that has}} been {{mentioned}} by reviewers are the number of bugs or glitches in the game. Examples of this are scoring runs after being caught out and high fly balls <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly.</b> The game suffered in its reviews due to this with critics praising the gameplay but lamenting {{the sheer number of}} bugs that should have been solved before release.|$|E
50|$|As a {{subfield}} in artificial intelligence, Diagnosis {{is concerned}} with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behaviour of a system is correct. If the system is <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly,</b> the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing. The computation is based on observations, which provide information on the current behaviour.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of using an RSL is a faster reserve parachute deployment compared with using emergency handles alone; after a cut-away, the RSL will usually activate before the reserve deployment ripcord is pulled. However, proper emergency procedures require the reserve ripcord {{to be pulled}} {{in the event that}} the RSL is disconnected or <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly.</b> An RSL also offers protection in the event a jumper cuts-away but does not (or can not) reach for the reserve deployment handle.|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of {{software}} inspection the defects which are found are categorized in two categories: major and minor defects (often many more categories are used). The defects which are statements or declarations that are incorrect, or even missing information can be classified as major defects: the software will <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> when these defects are not being solved.|$|R
50|$|When the GNE epimerase kinase does <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> in {{the human}} body thereby {{reducing}} the available ManNAc, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that treatment with ManNAc could assist with improving health benefits. The therapeutic potential for ManNAc is currently being assessed in several diseases in which therapy could benefit from its ability to enhance the biosynthesis of sialic acid.|$|R
50|$|Arenobufagin {{works like}} Cardiac glycosides. It {{inhibits}} the sodium-potassium pump because it stabalises the E2-P transition state, {{in which the}} pump is inactive. Second membrane trasnoperter NCX is responsible for 3Na/Ca transport, if the Na-K-Pump does <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> the Ca concentration inside the cell will rise and this will cause heart failure.However, in experiments concerning the anti-cancer effects of arenobufagin in mice, no negative effects where found.|$|R
50|$|On 23 March 2010, James Williamson died whilst {{competing}} in the Absa Cape Epic, a 722 km eight-day race in South Africa. After {{competing in}} the first two stages and being in 18th place in the field of 1200, he died in his hotel room prior to the third stage. His death was due to an undiagnosed heart condition; an autopsy found that one of the chambers of his heart was <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly,</b> which led to the enlargement of one of the ventricles in his heart.|$|E

50|$|If the {{connecting}} adjacent epithelial {{cells of the}} skin are <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly,</b> layers of the skin can pull apart and allow abnormal movements of fluid within the skin, resulting in blisters and other tissue damage. Blistering diseases such as Pemphigus vulgaris and Pemphigus foliaceus are autoimmune diseases in which auto-antibodies target the proteins desmoglein 3 and desmoglein 1 respectively. The symptoms of the diseases are caused by the subsequent disruption to the desmosome-keratin filament complex leading to a breakdown in cell adhesion. Similar outbreaks occur with Hailey-Hailey disease, though the cause is not autoimmune, but, rather genetic. A haploinsufficiency of the ATP2C1 gene located on chromosome 3, which encodes the protein hSPCA1, causes malformation of the desmosomes.|$|E
5000|$|This figure {{contains}} three repeated E-flats {{followed by}} a broken tonic triad. In measure six, there is an added B-flat creating a seventh-chord on C. The seventh of the tonic C minor triad does <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> in a typical harmonic progression; it is actually treated as a consonant note. These types of harmonies {{as well as the}} heavily syncopated rhythms are characteristics “commonly used in blues and jazz.” ...|$|R
25|$|Helmets {{also have}} a {{spring-loaded}} exhaust valve which allows excess air to leave the helmet. The spring force is adjustable by the diver to prevent the suit from deflating completely or over-inflating and the diver being floated uncontrollably to the surface. Some helmets have an extra manual exhaust valve known as a spit-cock. This allows the diver to vent excess air when {{he is in a}} position where the main exhaust can <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly.</b>|$|R
25|$|MUTYH encodes DNA {{repair enzyme}} MYH glycosylase. During normal {{cellular}} activities, guanine sometimes becomes altered by oxygen, which causes it to pair with adenine instead of cytosine. MYH glycosylase fixes these mistakes by base excision repair, such that mutations do not accumulate in the DNA {{and lead to}} tumor formation. When MYH glycosylase does <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly,</b> DNA errors may accrue to initiate tumorigenesis with a clinical presentation {{similar to that in}} patients with APC mutations.|$|R
5000|$|The American pilots have voiced their regret many times. The {{history of}} the 398th Bombardment Group based at RAF Nuthampstead, which carried out the raid, {{indicates}} the attack was an accident. The radar navigational equipment on the aircraft was <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly</b> and high winds en route produced a dead reckoning navigational error of some 70 miles. This caused the formation to arrive over the supposed [...] "target", which {{was believed to be}} Dresden, at the time bombing commenced. Prague was mostly obscured by broken clouds, with occasional glimpses of the Vltava river. Additionally, Prague and Dresden looked similar from the air, with rivers running through both cities. The bombing was carried out as a [...] "blind attack" [...] using radar.|$|E
5000|$|I Can't Sing! began rehearsals on 6 January, with previews commencing on 5 March 2014, at the London Palladium, London, before {{holding its}} {{official}} opening gala night on 26 March. The production {{had been scheduled}} to begin previews on 27 February, however the opening two previews were cancelled due to technical issues with the show's set. Following the initial cancellations, the production had to cancel a further preview performance, due to a key mechanism within the set <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly.</b> Problems continued into previews, with early performances intervals lasting 50 mins, due to set changeovers between acts taking longer than expected and one preview getting cancelled at the interval due to electrical problems. A typical London performance ran two hours and 30 minutes, including one interval of 20 mins.|$|E
50|$|An event may {{indicate}} that something is <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly,</b> leading to an incident being logged. Events may also indicate normal activity, or a need for routine intervention such as changing a tape.Event management depends on monitoring, but it is different. Event management generates and detects notifications, while monitoring checks the status of components even when no events are occurring.Events may be detected by a CI sending a message, or by a management tool polling the CI. After an event has been detected it may lead to an Incident, Problem or Change, or it may simply be logged in case the information is needed.Response to an event may be automated or may require manual intervention. If actions are needed then a trigger, such as an SMS message or an incident being automatically logged, can alert support staff.|$|E

5000|$|Within the {{24-hour clock}} system used for {{official}} and technical purposes {{throughout most of}} the world, there is a time that could be called [...] "13 o'clock". However, the 24-hour system only came into widespread use in the 20th century, and most analogue clocks (including virtually all chiming or striking clocks) still work on the 12-hour system. A striking clock rings a bell once for each hour of the time. One ring is 1 o'clock, two rings is 2 o'clock, three rings is 3 o'clock, four rings is 4 o'clock, etc. Traditional clocks that strike a bell only mark 12 hours. After the twelfth hour with the twelve rings of the bell then the next hour should be with one ring only, indicating 1 o'clock. Accordingly, with very rare exceptions, when a clock rings thirteen times it is indicating an impossible time and that the clock is <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly.</b> A children's riddle asks [...] "What time is it when the clock strikes thirteen?" [...] The answer is [...] "Time to get a new clock!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The main {{theme music}} {{used for the}} ride is a soundtrack known as [...] "Song Of The Elders" [...] by Rhythmos.This music is played very loudly in the ride station, and at some points during the ride.It can {{be noted that the}} Valhalla music sounds {{different}} in each place around the ride - in the ride station it sounds raucous and loud whereas in some places throughout the ride is comes across as more distant and mysterious - probably to do with the positioning of the speakers.The theme music used to be patchy throughout the ride, this was improved somewhat during the 2011/2012 refurbishment however since then the audio system has deteriorated {{to the point where it}} is [...] "botched." [...] As a result, several of the sound effects are <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>correctly,</b> whilst others are inaudible due to being too quiet.For the first two years of operation Valhalla had different theme music - the old piece can still be heard on the first lifthill. This is very hard to believe when riding it today because the current theme music adds a lot to the overall experience.|$|E
25|$|Any p–n junction, if illuminated, is {{potentially}} a photodiode. Semiconductor {{devices such as}} diodes, transistors and ICs contain p–n junctions, and will <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly</b> if they are illuminated by unwanted electromagnetic radiation (light) of wavelength suitable to produce a photocurrent; this is avoided by encapsulating devices in opaque housings. If these housings are not completely opaque to high-energy radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays), diodes, transistors and ICs can malfunction due to induced photo-currents. Background radiation from the packaging is also significant. Radiation hardening mitigates these effects.|$|R

50|$|Degeneration {{occurs at}} the {{cellular}} level and in certain subtypes results in cellular death. Cellular death or dysfunction causes a break or faulty signal {{in the line of}} communication from the central nervous system to target muscles in the body. When there is impaired communication or a lack of communication entirely, the muscles in the body do <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>correctly.</b> Muscle control complications can be observed in multiple balance, speech, and motor or movement impairment symptoms. ADCA is divided into three types and further subdivided into subtypes known as SCAs (spinocerebellar ataxias).|$|R
