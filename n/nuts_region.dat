40|$|We present further {{analysis}} of an anisotropic, non-singular early universe model {{that leads to}} the viable cosmology presented in Dechant et al (2009 Phys. Rev. D 79, 043524). Although this model (the Dechant–Lasenby–Hobson (DLH) model) contains scalar field matter, it is reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in that it has biaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a dimensionality reduction at a quasi-regular singularity that one can identify with the Big Bang. We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate transformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal time for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the Big Bang, the coordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping from DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We present explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a scalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible in terms of elliptic integrals; this periodicity is broken in a natural manner as a scalar field is gradually introduced to recover the original DLH model. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT coordinates recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub region, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two <b>NUT</b> <b>regions</b> known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the complete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the <b>NUT</b> <b>regions</b> correspond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of the well-known 'pathologies' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the traditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the physically more meaningful DLH coordinates. In particular, the 'open-to-closed-to-open' transition and the Taub and <b>NUT</b> <b>regions</b> of the (Lorentzian) Taub-NUT model are replaced by a closed pancaking universe with spacelike homogeneous sections at all times...|$|R

40|$|Coliphage [lambda] gene {{expression}} is regulated temporally by systems of termination and antitermination of transcription. The [lambda]-encoded N protein (pN) acting with host factors (Nus) at sites (nut) located downstream from early promoters {{is the first}} of these systems to operate during phage development. We report observations on some of the components of this complex system that, in part, address the way in which these elements interact to render RNA polymerase termination-resistant. (1) The isolation of a conditionally lethal cold-sensitive nusA mutation demonstrates that NusA is essential for bacterial growth. (2) The effect on [lambda] growth in a host in which the Salmonella NusA protein is overproduced suggests that NusA is essential for N-mediated antitermination in phage [lambda].

40|$|The RNA {{sequences}} boxA, boxB and boxC {{constitute the}} <b>nut</b> <b>regions</b> of phage j. They nucleate {{the formation of}} a termination-resistant RNA polymerase complex on the j chromosome. The complex includes E. coli proteins NusA, NusB, NusG and NusE, and the j N protein. A complex that includes the Nus proteins and other factors forms at the rrn leader. Whereas RNA-binding by NusB and NusE has been described in quantitative terms, the interaction of NusA with these RNA sequences is less defined. Isotropic as well as anisotropic fluorescence equilibrium titrations show that NusA binds only the nut spacer sequence between boxA and boxB. Thus, nutR boxA 5 -spacer, nutR boxA 16 -spacer and nutR boxA 69 -spacer retain NusA binding, whereas a spacer mutation eliminates complex formation. The affinity of NusA for nutL is 50 % higher than for nutR. In contrast, rrn boxA, which includes an additional U residue, binds NusA in the absence of spacer. The Kd values obtained for rrn boxA and rrn boxA-spacer are 19 -fold and 8 -fold lower, respectively, than those for nutR boxA-spacer. These differences may explain why j requires an additional protein, j N, to suppress termination. Knowledge of the different affinities now describes the assembly of the antitermination complex in quantitative terms...|$|R

The lambda sequences required for termination {{had previously been}} shown to overlap the nut sites, which are essential for transcription antitermination during normal lambda growth. To further specify the Nun target and to determine its relation to the nut sites, we constructed deletion and base substitution mutations of the lambda nutL region and measured Nun-dependent reduction of {{the expression of a}} downstream reporter gene. The shortest construct that retained full Nun responsiveness was a 42 -bp segment that included both boxA and boxB, sequences that have been implicated in lambda antitermination. Deletion of boxA reduced Nun termination, and deletion of both sequences eliminated Nun termination. Base substitutions in boxA and the proximal portion of boxB impaired Nun termination, while base substitutions between boxA and boxB, in the distal portion of boxB, and immediately downstream from boxB had no appreciable effect. The termination defect of all of the base substitution mutations was relieved by increasing the level of Nun protein; in contrast, the deletions and a multiple-base substitution did not regain full Nun responsiveness at elevated Nun concentrations. We also asked if these mutant <b>nut</b> <b>regions</b> retained their ability to interact with N, the lambda-encoded antitermination protein. A qualitative assay showed that mutations within boxA or boxB reduced interaction, while mutations outside boxA and boxB did not.
