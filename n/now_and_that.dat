In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|Jan urges Pam {{to take a}} {{corporate}} training program in graphic design in New York City when Pam reveals {{that she wants to}} be a graphic designer, but Roy quashes the idea. Jim rebukes Pam for listening to Roy when he is clearly wrong and acting selfish, which creates tension between them. Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her life <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> they do not even make her dream house in Scranton. She then breaks down and cries in front of the camera. As the day comes to a close, Michael leaves the warehouse in complete disarray.|$|E

Siegel traveled to New York to meet in person with Harry Donenfeld (co-owner of Detective Comics) to re-negotiate the deal. Donenfeld told Siegel that Detective fully owned Superman <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he could replace Siegel and Shuster with another writer and artist. Donenfeld instead offered the pair an extended contract with relatively generous pay.|$|E

25|$|In the field, Hook {{says that}} he doesn't {{want to become a}} Dark One, that he's weak, unlike Merlin and Emma, and that he'll succumb to the {{darkness}} again if she does that. Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he’s happy just to know that she has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Ten started as {{instrumental}} compositions that Vedder added lyrics to after he joined the band. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "All I really believe in is this fucking moment, like right <b>now.</b> <b>And</b> <b>that,</b> actually, is what the whole album talks about." [...] Vedder's lyrics for Ten deal with subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. The album also tackles social concerns such as homelessness ("Even Flow") {{and the use of}} psychiatric hospitals ("Why Go"). The song [...] "Jeremy" [...] and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.|$|E
500|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that {{billions of years ago}} Venus's atmosphere was much more like Earth's than it is <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface, but after a period of 600 million to several billion years, a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water, which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere. Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any Earthlike life that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the [...] upper cloud layers of Venus, [...] up from the surface, where the temperature ranges between [...] but the environment is acidic.|$|E

500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I like {{to think of it as}} good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak <b>Now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Westley {{bought a}} {{controlling}} interest in Farnborough Town and appointed himself as manager. He managed {{the club to}} a 12th-place finish {{in his first season}} in charge, but enjoyed success in the Isthmian Cup; winning the competition in 2000. The following season, Westley guided the club to more success, winning the Isthmian League Premier Division; securing 31 victories out of a possible 42 and amassing a total of 99 points. Westley overhauled the squad shortly after the club's promotion to the Football Conference – something which he now states as a [...] "huge regret". At this point, he also tried to arrange a merger with Kingstonian – citing the club's [...] "Football League rated ground" [...] as the reasoning behind his proposed idea, although it never happened due to [...] "fans resistance". [...] During the 2001–02 season, the club consolidated their position in the first tier of non–league football; with Westley guiding the club to a 7th-place finish in the league. The following season was to be a memorable campaign for Westley, reaching the Third Round of the FA Cup after a 3–0 victory at Southport, where they faced Football League competition in the form of Darlington at Feethams. Westley guided the side to a 3–2 win over Darlington, and the club were rewarded with a Fourth Round tie at home to Arsenal. The tie, however, was controversially moved to Highbury – because the tie stood to make around £600,000 in gate receipts from playing at Highbury, whereas playing at Cherrywood Road would only have generated the club an estimated £50,000. Westley left the club after the sell-out 'home' tie at Highbury, which they lost 5–1. Shortly after his resignation, he became manager at Football Conference rivals Stevenage in January 2003, signing a three-year contract. Westley confirmed he would be leaving his shareholding in Farnborough to other existing shareholders, and would also be withdrawing his financial backing at the club. On moving to Stevenage, Westley said [...] "I've enjoyed my time at Farnborough, but I feel that I need to move on <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> I need to concentrate on football management, which is where my ambitions lie". He went on to state that Stevenage's [...] "long-term potential" [...] was another key factor behind the move.|$|E
