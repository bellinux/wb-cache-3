5|$|Ulrich {{provided}} {{a statement to}} the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and <b>Napster</b> was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to <b>Napster</b> for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, <b>Napster</b> agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. On June 3, 2002, <b>Napster</b> filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of <b>Napster</b> to Bertelsmann and forced <b>Napster</b> to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.|$|E
5|$|Metallica {{earned a}} growing fan {{base in the}} {{underground}} music community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums. The band's third album, Master of Puppets (1986), was described {{as one of the}} heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums, and its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. In 2000, Metallica joined with other artists who filed a lawsuit against <b>Napster</b> for sharing the band's copyright-protected material without consent; a settlement was reached and <b>Napster</b> became a pay-to-use service. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} transport, {{they are}} {{surprised}} when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but <b>Napster</b> is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get {{the car to the}} target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop the part of the road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with <b>Napster</b> helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, Aydar was an {{individual}} contributor to <b>Napster's</b> engineering team. Eventually, {{he moved into}} a management role as <b>Napster's</b> senior director of technology, where {{he was responsible for}} managing the development of <b>Napster's</b> [...] legal service.|$|R

2500|$|Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit found that, [...] "Regardless of {{the number}} of <b>Napster's</b> {{infringing}} versus noninfringing uses", the question could be resolved on the basis of whether [...] "Napster knew or had reason to know of its users' infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{album was}} self-released on August 18, 2008, {{exclusively}} through the album's website. It was made available there free for streaming and for purchase as a download of DRM-free MP3s. The duo released the album from other online digitalmusic services starting the following month, including 7digital, AmazonMP3, eMusic, the iTunesStore, <b>Napster,</b> and the ZuneMarketplace. No recordlabel {{was involved in}} releasing the digitalformat and independentdistributors were allowed to handle the physical product, which was released on November 25 as an enhancedCD and a deluxe-packaged CD in a tin.|$|E
5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of <b>Napster</b> in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which <b>Napster</b> could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E
5|$|St. Anger was {{released}} on June 5, 2003. It was originally scheduled for June 10, but due to Metallica's previous battle with <b>Napster,</b> and fear {{that it would be}} released illegally onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks, the band pushed the release date ahead by five days. A special edition of the album {{was released}} with a bonus DVD, featuring live, in-the-studio rehearsals of all of the St. Anger tracks. First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world. In 2004, Metallica won the award for Best Metal Performance, for the title track.|$|E
50|$|Madster (initially called Aimster) {{appeared}} in <b>Napster's</b> wake in August 2000 and {{was intended to}} be a P2P file sharing service. It was shut down in December 2002 {{as a result of a}} lawsuit by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit found that, [...] "Regardless of {{the number}} of <b>Napster's</b> {{infringing}} versus noninfringing uses", the question could be resolved on the basis of whether [...] "Napster knew or had reason to know of its users' infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights." ...|$|R
5000|$|First, she briefly {{observed}} that plaintiffs could show that [...] "Napster users {{are engaged in}} direct infringement." [...] Judge Patel then turned to <b>Napster's</b> two arguments for why such third-party infringement was not illegal: fair use and substantial noninfringing use (the [...] "staple article of commerce" [...] doctrine from Sony v. Universal).|$|R
5|$|Steve becomes {{paranoid}} that Charlie will {{steal the}} gold, {{and starts to}} launder it faster, but he is forced to kill Yevhen when he reveals {{his knowledge of the}} Venice heist. Yevhen's death infuriates Mashkov, his cousin and a leading member of an Ukrainian crime family. Mashkov connects the murder to Charlie through Skinny Pete. Further uneased, Steve makes plans to transport the gold to Mexico City by a private plane from Los Angeles International Airport after transporting it there in an armored car. <b>Napster</b> overhears of this, and Charlie and his gang make a new plan to steal the gold en route to the airport by hijacking the city's traffic control system to force the armored car to a planned spot where they will execute the heist.|$|E
5|$|At Union Station, {{the cars}} are loaded onto a train car {{with the help of}} Wrench. Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while <b>Napster</b> buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants {{to spend the rest of}} his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Cook was {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} become the CEO and controlling partner for the International Academy of Music Arts and Sciences (IAMAS Corporation). Years earlier, the company merged with its daughter company, The American Musical Academy of Arts Association, which proved profitable as there was an upswing in demand for Christian-based music and distribution opportunities. This was profitable as IAMAS was able to use its history in the entertainment industry as a door to help boost other smaller companies into existence. In 2004, the entertainment industry took a huge hit with the incoming markets of <b>Napster,</b> iTunes, and Amazon.com. IAMAS, no longer able to compete, decided to sell off only its American division and retain its overseas holdings. Since IAMAS Corporation had handled Cook's contracts since 1980, Cook offered to buy the company for an undisclosed amount. His offer was accepted and he officially filed for corporation status on November 24, 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Kroogi founder Miro Sarbaev {{has had an}} {{exciting}} career {{at the intersection of}} music and technology. During the collapse of the Soviet Union (1985-1990), he worked as a freelance journalist for major newspapers and news agencies in Russia. In 1990 he co-founded IMA Press, a Russian news agency and opened an IMA office in the USA where he also began consulting for technology companies. In 1999, Miro was hired by <b>Napster’s</b> Shawn Fanning to manage <b>Napster’s</b> database group. In 2002, he joined Fanning’s Snocap, where he served as director of engineering and built Snocap’s music licensing engine. He founded Kroogi in 2007 and launched the community in November, 2008. [...] Miro resides in San Francisco and Moscow, and commutes frequently between the two locations. He holds a M.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Moscow Power Engineering University.|$|R
50|$|Streamwaves was {{an online}} music service founded by Jeff Tribble in 1999. Founded during file sharing service <b>Napster's</b> legal troubles, Streamwaves {{was the first}} company to license major label masters for a {{subscription}} service, and the first company to launch a subscription service with major label content in 2002. In 2005 Streamwaves {{became part of the}} Rhapsody Music Service owned by Real Networks.|$|R

5|$|The Get Up Kids toured relentlessly {{for almost}} three years in {{promotion}} of the record. As well as touring Europe, Japan, and Australia, they shared bills with acts such as Green Day, The Anniversary, Koufax, Hot Rod Circuit, Jebediah, Weezer and Ozma. Their 2000 tour with The Anniversary and Koufax was sponsored by <b>Napster.</b> Their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth. Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand {{by the time the}} band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform. To capitalize on anticipation for the band's next album, Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation Eudora in 2001. Eudora consisted of alternate takes, covers, and B-sides since the band's formation. Likewise, Doghouse released a re-mastered edition of Four Minute Mile and a compilation entitled The EPs: Woodson and Red Letter Day, combining the two Doghouse-owned EPs on one compact disc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Napster</b> {{music store}} offers a subscription-based {{approach}} to DRM alongside permanent purchases. Users of the subscription service can download and stream an unlimited amount of music transcoded to Windows Media Audio (WMA) while subscribed to the service. But when the subscription period lapses, all the downloaded music is unplayable until the user renews {{his or her}} subscription. <b>Napster</b> also charges users who wish to use the music on their portable device an additional $5 per month. In addition, <b>Napster</b> gives users the option of paying an additional $0.99 per track to burn it to CD or for the song to never expire. Music bought through <b>Napster</b> can be played on players carrying the Microsoft PlaysForSure logo (which, notably, do not include iPods or even Microsoft's own Zune). As of June 2009, <b>Napster</b> is offering DRM free MP3 music, which can be played on iPhones and iPods.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{the court}} found that the owners of <b>Napster</b> could control the {{infringing}} behavior of users, and therefore had a duty to do so. The Ninth Circuit affirmed this analysis, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in proving that <b>Napster</b> did not have a valid fair use defense.|$|E
40|$|In {{the decade}} since <b>Napster’s</b> launch, selling {{recorded}} music {{has become as}} much of an art as making the music itself.

40|$|Music {{collections}} comprise one of {{the most}} popular categories of multimedia content, and the collections to be searched are huge. <b>Napster’s</b> collection contains about 1. 5 million songs. A single iPod can hold as many as 10, 000 songs. Such collections are typically indexed and searched by title, composer, and performer. While this allows for basic storage and retrieval of music documents, people often wish to access and use their music collections in ways that require access to the musically salien...|$|R
2500|$|The professors further {{argued that}} the overbroad nature of the {{injunction}} threatened the development and deployment of any future peer-to-peer file-sharing network on the Internet because it insisted on a restructuring that defeated peer-to-peer technology itself. They also {{argued that the}} finding of contributory liability was erroneous because of <b>Napster's</b> significant non-infringing uses and because not all unauthorized uses within the system were infringement. They concluded, [...] "If Plaintiffs want copyright law extended to allow the suppression of new technologies, they must make their case to Congress." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Napster</b> {{appealed to}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.|$|E

25|$|A Records, Inc. v. <b>Napster,</b> Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001) was a {{landmark}} intellectual property {{case in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the ruling of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, holding that defendant, peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing service <b>Napster,</b> could be held liable for contributory infringement and vicarious infringement of the plaintiffs' copyrights. This was the first major case to address the application of copyright laws to peer-to-peer file-sharing.|$|E
50|$|While {{working at}} Founders Fund, Parker {{had been looking}} {{to invest in a}} company that could further <b>Napster’s</b> music sharing mission legally. In 2009 a friend showed him Spotify, a Swedish {{streaming}} music service, and Parker sent an email to Spotify’s founder Daniel Ek. The pair traded emails, and in 2010 Parker invested US$15 million in Spotify. Parker, who currently serves on Spotify’s board, negotiated with Warner and Universal on Spotify's behalf, and in July 2011, Spotify announced its U.S. launch. At Facebook’s f8 conference that year, Parker announced a partnership between Facebook and Spotify, which allowed users to share their Spotify playlists on their Facebook profiles.|$|R
5000|$|Don Ignacio, in {{a review}} of The Age of Plastic, gave the song an A+, and {{considered}} the song to be a highlight of the album.

[...] <b>Napster's</b> Nicholas Baker said of [...] "The Plastic Age" [...] as one of the songs from the album that Trevor Horn's [...] "considerable songwriting prowess" [...] was evident in.

25|$|<b>Napster</b> {{was started}} in 1999 by Shawn Fanning, then an 18-year-old {{freshman}} computer science student at Northeastern University. It provided a platform for users to access and download compressed digital music files, specifically MP3s, from other users' machines. Unlike many peer-to-peer services, however, <b>Napster</b> included a central server that indexed connected users and files available on their machines, creating a searchable list of music available across Napster's network. Napster's ease of use compared to other peer-to-peer services quickly made it a popular service for music enthusiasts to find and download digital song files for free.|$|E

40|$|Most {{of modern}} identities emerge from {{mediated}} interactions {{in public and}} virtual spaces. There are no acknowledged authorities to watch over organizational identities and grant them legitimacy. These identities are renegotiated in real and virtual communities, often carry a permanent label 'under construction' and can be violently contested in public space. Garrulous behaviour stimulated by interactive media and by the forthcoming Evernet allows for a gradual build-up of individual and social response to the visual overkill in media-regulated societies. Voicing the images over, we mobilize for action, dismantle institutional structures and generally speaking mix gate-keeping with data-dating, thus contributing to the overall change of world's cultural climate - one of bricks, clicks and flicks.
