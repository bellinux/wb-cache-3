40|$|Global and {{regional}} dust storms on Mars {{have been observed}} from Earth-based telescopes, Mars orbiters, and surface rovers and landers. Dust storms can be global {{and regional}}. Dust is material that is suspended into the atmosphere by winds and has a particle size of 1 - 3 micrometer. Planetary scientist refer to loose <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials</b> at the surface as "soil. " The term ''soil'' is used here to denote any loose, <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> that can be distinguished from rocks, bedrock, or strongly cohesive sediments.

40|$|In Snake Pit massive sulfide {{fragments}} and friable, <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> recovered during ODP Leg 106, isocubanite and pyrite are generally the predominant phases, followed by marcasite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite. Detailed analyses of paragenetic relations of minerals indicate that isocubanite first precipitated together with pyrrhotite. With decreasing temperature, chalcopyrite and sphalerite precipitated, {{and at the}} latest stage colloform sphalerite-pyrite (or colloform marcasite) formed. Isocubanite usually has exsolution lamellae of chalcopyrite and less commonly of pyrrhotite. The average bulk chemical composition of the friable, <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> indicates that it is rich in copper, reflecting the dominance of isocubanite in the specimens, and is characterized by high Co, low Pb, and Ag contents. Sulfur isotope ratios are very uniform, ranging in d 34 S from + 1. 2 to + 2. 8 per mil.

Although computer programs are available for GSHP installers to calculate optimal lengths and configurations of ground-coupling geothermal systems, uncertainties exist for input parameters that must first be determined for these models. Input parameters include earth temperatures and {{thermal properties}} of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials.</b> Furthermore, thermal conductivity of sediments varies significantly depending on texture and moisture content, highlighting the need to characterize various <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials</b> under varying soil moisture regimes. Regolith texture data can be, and often are, collected for particular installations, and are then used to estimate thermal properties for system design.

Water production from karezes with a typical gentle slope (1  m km− 1) over 1  km length suggests a decrease in water-table elevation of 1  m will result in no kariz water discharge unless the kariz tunnel is deepened. Deepening of the tunnel is likely constrained by engineering principles of tunnel stability in <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R

40|$|Beef cattle feedlots contain <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials</b> (loose manure pack) that {{accumulate}} {{during a}} feeding cycle. The effects of varying amounts of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials</b> on runoff nutrient losses {{are not well}} understood. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) compare runoff nutrient losses from feedlot surfaces containing varying amounts of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials,</b> (2) determine if differences in runoff nutrient losses exist among rainfall simulation runs, (3) relate runoff nutrient losses to selected feedlot soil characteristics, and (4) identify the effects of varying runoff rate on nutrient loss rates from feedlot surfaces. This study was conducted on 0. 75 m wide by 2 m long (2. 47 ft wide by 6. 58 ft long) plots containing 0, 6. 7, 13. 5, or 26. 9 kg m− 2 (0, 1. 37, 2. 77, or 5. 51 lb ft− 2) of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials.</b> Simulated rainfall was applied during three 30 -minute events that were separated by 24 -hour intervals. Inflow was added at the top of all plots during selected tests {{to examine the effects of}} varying flow rate on nutrient loss rates. No significant differences in the measured water quality parameters were found among the surfaces containing varying amounts of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials.</b> Measurements of dissolved phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, total phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, chloride, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and erosion consistently decreased during the three rainfall simulation runs. Runoff losses of ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N), total nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were all correlated to easily obtained soil EC measurements. All measured water quality parameters were significantly influenced by runoff rate. Thus, runoff rate, and not the amount of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials</b> on the feedlot surface, significantly influenced nutrient losses in runoff...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{published}} work {{was concerned with}} coarse <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> with water as the working fluid. Petroleum reservoirs consist of consolidated rocks. In this study, authors carried out experiments on consolidated porous media with an organic (Soltrol- 130) fluid to match real field reservoir rock/fluid system. Use of consolidated samples also avoids the errors due to solids movement associated with unconsolidated samples. Organic fluid was chosen to observe the pre-Darcy effect without the polar interaction effects associated with aqua based fluids.|$|R
50|$|Driven wells may be {{very simply}} created in <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> with a well hole structure, which {{consists}} of a hardened drive point and a screen (perforated pipe). The point is simply hammered into the ground, usually with a tripod and driver, with pipe sections added as needed. A driver is a weighted pipe that slides over the pipe being driven and is repeatedly dropped on it. When groundwater is encountered, the well is washed of sediment and a pump installed.|$|R
50|$|This {{island is}} {{composed}} mostly of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> such as glacial till, marine clay, and sand.

The Ice Age materials are overlain by Holocene (Recent) era deposits; their features include sand dunes. Bedrock is exposed only at the eastern end around Mace Point. Most of Savary's soils are sandy, with brown podzolic and podzol profile development.|$|R
40|$|Beef cattle feedlots contain <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> that accumulates within feedlot pens {{during a}} feeding cycle. Runoff from feedlot {{surfaces}} is diverted into settling basins. The storage {{capacity of the}} settling basins will be substantially reduced if large quantities of solid material are transported in runoff from the feedlot surfaces. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the hydraulic conditions that will not move <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> located within feedlots in order to minimize sediment transport. Selected sizes and a composite sample of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> were placed within 0. 75 m wide by 4. 0 m long metal frames. Flow was then introduced at the top of the frames in successive increments. The discharge rate and flow velocity necessary to cause movement of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> was measured. Hydraulic measurements were used to determine the ratio of critical flow depth to particle diameter, critical flow rate, critical flow velocity, critical shear velocity, critical Reynolds number, critical shear stress, critical dimensionless shear stress, and critical boundary Reynolds number. Measurements of these parameters for the composite material were 0. 556, 0. 499 L s- 1, 0. 0787 m s- 1, 0. 0643 m s- 1, 695, 4. 12 Pa, 0. 0436, and 1040, respectively. Darcy-Weisbach roughness coefficients were calculated for each particle size class and the composite sample at varying flow rates.

30|$|The {{gradient}} on {{the horizontal}} tunnel of the kariz is 1 : 500 – 1 : 1500 (English 1968; Amin et al. 1983; Favre and Kamal 2004) and {{is less than}} the gradient of the land surface (Banks and Soldal 2002). Favre and Kamal (2004) have stated that 1 : 1000 is the maximum gradient: higher gradients result in erosion of the tunnel structure by water flowing in the kariz. Higher gradients can probably be maintained in cemented alluvium, whereas lower gradients are required in <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aquifers are {{typically}} composed of semi-porous rock or <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> whose pore space has {{been filled with}} water. In the relatively rare cases of confined aquifers, an impermeable geologic layer (i.e. clay or calcrete) encloses an aquifer, isolating the water within, sometimes for millennia. More commonly, fossil water is found in arid or semi-arid regions where the climate was significantly more humid in recent geologic history. In some semi-arid regions, the majority of precipitation evaporates before it can infiltrate and result in any significant aquifer recharge.|$|R

40|$|Beef cattle feedlots contain <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> that accumulates on the feedlot surface {{during a}} feeding cycle. This study was {{conducted}} to measure the effects of varying diameters of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> and varying flow rates on nutrient concentrations in runoff. <b>Unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> with an average diameter of 4. 76, 9. 53, 19. 1, or 47. 5 mm and a composite sample with a 15. 2 mm mean diameter were placed within 0. 75 m wide × 4. 0 m long plot areas. Flow was then introduced {{at the top of the}} plots in successive increments, and runoff samples for water quality analyses were obtained. Particle diameter significantly influenced runoff concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (DP), particulate phosphorus (PP), total phosphorus (TP), NH 4 -N, and solids transport. Concentrations of DP, PP, TP, and NH 4 -N for the composite material were 1. 90, 1. 28, 3. 18, and 3. 81 mg L- 1, respectively, and solids transport was 19. 8 g min- 1. Runoff rate significantly affected concentrations of DP, PP, TP, NH 4 -N, and solids transport for each of the particle size classes except the 4. 76 mm diameter material. For the composite material, concentrations of DP, PP, TP, and NH 4 -N decreased from 4. 30 to 0. 34 mg L- 1, from 5. 52 to 0. 41 mg L- 1, from 9. 82 to 0. 75 mg L- 1, and from 25. 8 to 0. 49 mg L- 1, respectively, as runoff rate increased from 0. 02 to 1. 10 L s- 1.
