The video is set in <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure,</b> as it opens with Minogue and Fletcher in a blue cadillac at a gas station, with Minogue staring inside the gas station while Fletcher sits in the car after being released from jail. Several scenes feature Minogue and Fletcher in different outfits in different areas, driving and running around a hotel. There are scenes with Minogue and Fletcher fighting, being happy and playing around in there hotel room.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Nolan's {{psychological}} crime film Memento (2000) {{contains a}} distinguished depiction of anterograde amnesia, {{in that the}} character Leonard Shelby is trying to identify and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife, and does so through a system of writing crucial details related to the search on his body and on the blank spaces of Polaroid photographs. Mental health experts have described Memento {{as one of the}} most accurate depictions of amnesia in film history, an accuracy that was enhanced by the film's fragmented, <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure</b> that mimics the protagonist's memory problems.|$|E
25|$|American actress Reese Witherspoon's film {{production}} company and 20th Century Fox bought the screen rights to Gone Girl, {{for which they}} paid US$1.5 million. The novel's author Gillian Flynn was engaged to write the screenplay. Witherspoon produced the film version along with Leslie Dixon, Bruna Papandrea, and Ceán Chaffin. Witherspoon {{was drawn to the}} script because of its strong female character and its use of multiple perspectives and <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure.</b> In May 2013, it was announced that David Fincher was brought on as director, with Ben Affleck cast as Nick and Rosamund Pike in the role of Amy. New Regency and Fox agreed to co-finance the film. The film was released October 3, 2014.|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} {{pattern matching}} paradigm {{is that of}} seeking occurrences of one string in another, where both strings are drawn from an alphabet set Σ. In the parameterized pattern matching model, a consistent renaming of symbols from Σ is allowed in a match. The parameterized matching paradigm has proven useful in problems in software engineering, computer vision, and other applications. In classical pattern matching, both the text and pattern are strings. Applications such as searching in xml or searching in hypertext require searching strings in <b>non-linear</b> <b>structures</b> such as trees or graphs. There has been work {{in the literature on}} exact and approximate parameterized matching, as well as work on exact and approximate string matching on <b>non-linear</b> <b>structures.</b> In this paper we explore parameterized matching in <b>non-linear</b> <b>structures.</b> We prove that exact parameterized matching on trees can be computed in linear time for alphabets in an O(n) -size integer range, and in time O(n log m) in general, where n is the tree size and m the pattern length. These bounds are optimal in the comparison model. We also show that exact parameterized matching on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is N P-complete. ...|$|R

500|$|Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Hossein Amini {{adapted the}} novel for the screen. He {{felt it was}} a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the {{adaptation}} challenging. He felt the <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure</b> made it [...] "a very tricky structure" [...] for a feature film.|$|E

In a rare film review, filmmaker Erich von Stroheim criticized the film's story and <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure,</b> but praised the technical style and performances, and wrote [...] "Whatever the truth may be about it, Citizen Kane is a great picture and {{will go down in}} screen history.

2500|$|... "Trilogy of Error" [...] {{was written}} by Matt Selman and was {{directed}} by Mike B. Anderson {{as part of the}} twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–2001). Selman was inspired by the 1999 comedy thriller film Go. Before pitching it, he devised the whole plot in order to prove that it could be done. The episode was originally called [...] "Go, Simpson Go" [...] in an allusion to the 1998 German crime thriller film Run Lola Run. Due to the <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure</b> of the episode, the writing staff found it difficult to write jokes for the episode, because [...] "every thing would affect the story".|$|E
2500|$|García Márquez confessed: [...] "My most {{important}} problem was destroying {{the line of}} demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic." [...] Isabel Allende was the first Latin American woman writer recognized outside the continent. Her most well-known novel, The House of the Spirits, is arguably similar to García Márquez's style of magical realist writing. Another notable novelist is Laura Esquivel, whose Like Water for Chocolate {{tells the story of}} the domestic life of women living on the margins of their families and society. The novel's protagonist, Tita, is kept from happiness and marriage by her mother. [...] "Her unrequited love and ostracism from the family lead her to harness her extraordinary powers of imbuing her emotions to the food she makes. In turn, people who eat her food enact her emotions for her. For example, after eating a wedding cake Tita made while suffering from a forbidden love, the guests all suffer from a wave of longing. The Mexican Juan Rulfo pioneered the exposition through a <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure</b> with his short novel Pedro Páramo that tells the story of Comala both as a lively town in times of the eponymous Pedro Páramo and as a ghost town through the eyes of his son Juan Preciado who returns to Comala to fulfil a promise to his dead mother.|$|E
40|$|Many {{real world}} {{datasets}} subsume a linear or <b>non-linear</b> low-rank <b>structure</b> {{in a very}} low-dimensional space. Unfortunately, one often has very little or no information about the geometry of the space, resulting in a highly under-determined recovery problem. Under certain circumstances, state-of-the-art algorithms provide an exact recovery for linear low-rank structures but {{at the expense of}} highly inscalable algorithms which use nuclear norm. However, the case of <b>non-linear</b> <b>structures</b> remains unresolved. We revisit the problem of low-rank recovery from a totally different perspective, involving graphs which encode pairwise similarity between the data samples and features. Surprisingly, our analysis confirms {{that it is possible to}} recover many approximate linear and <b>non-linear</b> low-rank <b>structures</b> with recovery guarantees with a set of highly scalable and efficient algorithms. We call such data matrices as Low-Rank matrices on graphs and show that many real world datasets satisfy this assumption approximately due to underlying stationarity. Our detailed theoretical and experimental analysis unveils the power of the simple, yet very novel recovery framework Fast Robust PCA on Graphs...|$|R

Steven Bogos of The Escapist positively referred to {{the game as}} [...] "Banjo-Threeie", calling it [...] "a nostalgic ride through time, bringing the collect-a-thons from the N64 era into the modern age". James Kozanitis of Game Revolution felt that Yooka-Laylee improved on the gameplay and structure of classic titles, in particular the relevance and importance of the collectables. Chris Carter of Destructoid praised the expansive levels and the colorful design, while noting instances of what he felt were [...] "a creeping sense of budgetary concerns" [...] due to the varying quality between them. While Carter himself was favorable towards the game, he concluded that due to the throwback designs, {{it would not be}} for everyone. Marty Sliva of IGN called Yooka-Laylee [...] "a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it". Sliva noted different aspects of the game that felt authentic to games from the 90s, praising the level design, soundtrack and characters while also criticizing how the game controlled at certain points and stated it was [...] "not 1998 anymore" [...] regarding frustrating camera movement. Kallie Plagge of GameSpot similarly praised certain aspects such as the collectibles and <b>non-linear</b> <b>structure</b> while also criticizing the uncooperative camera. Plagge conversely was critical of what she felt was convoluted level design and outdated gameplay. Shortly after Yooka-Laylees release, Playtonic announced a free update to the game that will attempt to address criticism of the in-game camera and make other improvements.|$|E
