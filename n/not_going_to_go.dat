25|$|Driver {{support was}} lacking {{due to the}} {{increased}} programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line {{all the way through}} Windows 2000. Programmers complained that it was too hard to write drivers for NT, and hardware developers were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the trouble of developing drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, more expensive machines.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{came into}} Week 15 of the NFL season still undefeated, and this week's game {{featured}} the Colts playing the San Diego Chargers at home. San Diego started {{the game with}} 4 scores in the first 3 quarters of the game, before the Colts could even score. By the time the Colts finally put some points on the scoreboard, they were down 16–0 to the Chargers. Marty Schottenheimer and the Chargers {{were in the middle}} of a playoff hunt, and they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down easy. But after San Diego jumped out to a 16-point lead, the Colts came back in the third quarter with three scores of their own, to put them up by one point at the beginning of the fourth quarter, 17–16. However, they were not able to score the rest of the game, and the Chargers scored twice in the fourth quarter, once on a field goal and another on an 83-yard touchdown run by RB Michael Turner. The loss to the Chargers was the first loss of the season for the Colts, but the last team to go 13–0, the 1998 Denver Broncos, lost their 14th and 15th games, before winning their last game of the season, and they went on to win Super Bowl XXXIII. The Colts had history in their favor, but Peyton Manning did not want to lose any more games during the 2005 season.|$|E

500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after {{the women in the}} audience, I'm going to attack the men.

[...] Unlike the later case of Thomas Becket, St-Calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops. Most of the bishops and barons that judged the case seem to have felt that the appeal to Rome was made to avoid having to answer an accusation that St-Calais knew was true. The final judgement was only reached after the king lost his temper and exclaimed: [...] "Believe me, bishop, you're not going back to Durham, and your men aren't going to stay at Durham, and you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> free, until you release the castle." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Blood Drive" [...] {{within a week}} of its original release. In the first 85-second clip, Dwight assures his office-mates that the blood taken in the bloodmobile will not be used in any [...] "ritualistic ways". Later, while giving blood himself, he asks the hospital employee, [...] "How do I know it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into a person who will later come back to kill me?" [...] The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party. Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage-woman whom her kids now consider their real mother instead of herself, and Dwight said he believes his soulmate, [...] "probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai, {{or at the very least}} she lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes-Barre corridor." [...] In the final 90-second clip, Dwight shows off his bobblehead doll collection to a woman, Creed tries unsuccessfully to pick up Lynne, and Dwight gets rid of an attractive male visitor who Michael fears could be competition. Dwight tells him the party is cancelled [...] "due to a death in the elevator".|$|E

[...] The extant De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, or Of the Unjust Persecution of the Bishop William I, details the trial of St-Calais before the king. This work is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial; some have doubted its authenticity, however, claiming St-Calais would not have been as knowledgeable in canon law as the work portrays him. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of the canon law, the False Decretals, which still survives.|$|E

500|$|During the season, Scott {{played in}} 12 of 13games, {{including}} 11starts, and recorded 1,133rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In {{the first game}} of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott [...] "dominated early" [...] against 23rd-ranked California with 19carries for 87yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland take a quick lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23carries but gained only 39yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> very far. I thought he had a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team... I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play... I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' He patted me on the butt. 'Just get me the ball.'" ...|$|E
