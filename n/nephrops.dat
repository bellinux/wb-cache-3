25|$|Symbiotic {{animals of}} the genus Symbion, {{the only member of}} the phylum Cycliophora, live {{exclusively}} on lobster gills and mouthparts. Different species of Symbion have been found on the three commercially important lobsters of the North Atlantic Ocean – <b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus, Homarus gammarus, and Homarus americanus.|$|E
25|$|Fishery {{data for}} the Atlantic sawtail {{catshark}} is inadequate as it is still recorded as G. melastomus by observers. This species is caught incidentally on deepwater longlines and bottom trawls targeting other species, including wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), conger eel (Conger conger), Norway lobster (<b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus), and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus). Most landed sharks are discarded and likely suffer high mortality due to damage sustained during capture; the larger specimens are marketed for human consumption. Given the small extent of its range and the ubiquitous heavy fishing pressure within, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this shark as Near Threatened.|$|E
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for <b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus, the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E
500|$|M.challengeri is a {{significant}} prey item for ling, {{as well as being}} an important fishery species for human consumption; trawlers catch around [...] per year under the limitations of New Zealand's Quota Management System. The species was first collected by the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876, but only described as separate from related species by Heinrich Balss in 1914. Although originally classified in the genus <b>Nephrops,</b> it was moved in 1972 to a new genus, Metanephrops, along with most other species then classified in <b>Nephrops.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} {{transferred}} to a new genus, Metanephrops (along with every other extant species then in <b>Nephrops,</b> except its type species, <b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus) by Richard Jenkins of the University of Adelaide in 1972. Jenkins placed M.challengeri among the [...] "thomsoni group" [...] within the genus Metanephrops, alongside M.thomsoni, M.sibogae, M.boschmai and M.sinensis. Jenkins inferred that this group of species had originated off northern Australia or in Indonesia, and that M.challengeri had reached New Zealand in the late Tertiary and displaced M.motunauensis, which formerly lived there. More recently, findings from molecular phylogenetics suggest that M.challengeri has a basal position in the genus, possibly linked to M.neptunus, and that the genus may have originated at high latitudes in the South Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Metanephrops challengeri {{was first}} {{described}} by Heinrich Balss in 1914, {{under the name}} <b>Nephrops</b> challengeri. Two specimens had been collected on the Challenger expedition from benthic Globigerina ooze {{at a depth of}} , on the Challenger Plateau in the Tasman Sea (...) [...] They had been included by Charles Spence Bate in his report on the crustaceans collected by the Challenger expedition, but were not separated from [...] "Nephrops thomsoni" [...] (now Metanephrops thomsoni), which was described by Spence Bate as a new species. Balss recognised that Spence Bate's N.thomsoni covered two species and, restricting the name M.thomsoni to the species containing the type specimens designated by Spence Bate (from the Philippines), created a new species for the species from New Zealand. Balss chose the two specimens seen by Spence Bate to be the type specimens of his new species, <b>Nephrops</b> challengeri. Both were females, and they have been deposited at the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E
500|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of little {{economic}} value, the blackmouth catshark is caught incidentally {{in large numbers}} by commercial bottom trawl and longline fisheries. In particular, it {{is among the most}} commonly bycaught sharks in trawls targeting deepwater lobsters and shrimps (<b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus, , Aristeus antennatus, and Aristaeomorpha folicea), operating off Portugal and in the Mediterranean. Most captured sharks are discarded, probably with heavy mortality. Some fisheries, such as those off Portugal and Italy, retain and utilize a small subset of the largest individuals for human consumption fresh or dried and salted, and for leather; the fishing fleet of Viareggio, Tuscany reported landing [...] in 2005. In the northeastern Atlantic, this shark is being increasingly targeted by fishers following the decline of other deepwater shark species.|$|E
500|$|Metanephrops challengeri reaches sexual {{maturity}} {{at the age}} of 3–4 years, and may live up to 15 years in total. Females produce very large eggs in small numbers; they are typically around [...] in diameter, and are blue in colour. The larvae hatch at the zoea stage (equivalent to the third zoea of the Northern Hemisphere species <b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus). The zoea larvae are [...] long, and possess all the appendages of the cephalothorax, including the pereiopods, which are used for swimming, but no pleopods (appendages of the abdomen). This larval stage lasts less than four days, before the young moult into the post-larval stage. The post-larva swims using its pleopods. The post-larva later moults into the adult form. Larvae are rarely seen in the wild, confirming that the development to the bottom-dwelling post-larva is rapid.|$|E

2500|$|Lobsters {{have long}} bodies with muscular tails, {{and live in}} crevices or burrows on the sea floor. Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, {{including}} the first pair, which are usually {{much larger than the}} others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate. Commercially important species include two species of Homarus (which looks more like the stereotypical lobster) from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi (which looks more like a shrimp, or a [...] "mini lobster") – the Northern Hemisphere genus <b>Nephrops</b> and the Southern Hemisphere genus Metanephrops. Although several other groups of crustaceans have the word [...] "lobster" [...] in their names, the unqualified term [...] "lobster" [...] generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family Nephropidae. Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters, which have no claws (chelae), or to squat lobsters. The closest living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and the three families of freshwater crayfish.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus is {{the host}} {{to a number of}} parasites and symbionts. A number of sessile organisms attach to the {{exoskeleton}} of N. norvegicus, including the barnacle Balanus crenatus and the foraminiferan Cyclogyra, but overall <b>Nephrops</b> suffers fewer infestations of such epibionts than other decapod crustaceans do. In December 1995, the commensal Symbion pandora was discovered attached to the mouthparts of <b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus, and was found to be the first member of a new phylum, Cycliophora, a finding described by Simon Conway Morris as [...] "the zoological highlight of the decade". S. pandora has been found in many populations of N. norvegicus, both in the north Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea. Individuals may be found on most segments of the lobster's mouthparts, but are generally concentrated on the central parts of the larger mouthparts, from the mandible to the third maxilliped.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus, known {{variously}} as the Norway lobster, Dublin Bay prawn, [...] (compare langostino) or scampi, is a slim, orange-pink lobster which {{grows up}} to 25 cm long, and is [...] "the most important commercial crustacean in Europe".
