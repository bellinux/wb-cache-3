500|$|Godsmack headlined {{the fourth}} annual Mayhem Festival {{alongside}} Disturbed. The band entered the studio in January 2012 to mix a live album plus record several covers {{for an upcoming}} release. The band then went on tour in the spring with Staind. Godsmack has completed work on an EP of cover songs. Godsmack released their new live album Live & Inspired on May 15, 2012. The set included a bonus EP of cover tracks. In January 2013, Erna announced a short solo tour through America. In February, Sully {{said in an interview}} that Godsmack would take a break during 2013. [...] "We are going to take some time away <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> just ran for two years" [...] he said in an interview with Loudwire.|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Sundlof, {{director}} of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, says [...] "Melamine is not very toxic as a chemical, so we're wondering why {{we are seeing the}} kinds of serious conditions, especially the kidney failure, that we're seeing in cats and dogs... We are focusing on the melamine right <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> believe that, even if melamine is not the causative agent, it is somehow associated with the causative agent, so it serves as a marker". Even at the highest observed concentrations found in wheat gluten, the melamine exposure is much smaller than the rat and mouse doses for which effects were seen. Instead, the FDA has suggested a second contaminant may be responsible for the ill effects and melamine, as the most easily identifiable contaminant, may serve as a biomarker, or indicator, for contaminated wheat gluten.|$|E

2500|$|Scientist Isaac Newton saw God as the masterful creator whose {{existence}} {{could not}} be denied {{in the face of}} the grandeur of all creation. Nevertheless, he rejected polymath Leibniz' thesis that God would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator. In Query 31 of the Opticks, Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:St. Thomas believed that the existence of God is self-evident in itself, but not to us. [...] "Therefore I say that this proposition, [...] "God exists", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject.... <b>Now</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature—namely, by effects." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 189, {{after the}} warlord Dong Zhuo {{seized control of}} the Han central {{government}} and held the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage, Zhang Cheng wanted to gather like-minded people to rise up against Dong Zhuo's tyranny and overthrow him. At the time, Zhang Zhao (張昭), another younger brother of Zhang Fan and Zhang Cheng, was also serving as a Consultant (議郎) under the Han government. Zhang Zhao came from Chang'an to meet Zhang Cheng and tell him, [...] "We can't defeat Dong Zhuo <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> aren't as powerful as him. Besides, it'll take {{time for us to}} set your plan into motion. We'll need to draft civilians into military service, train them to be soldiers, gain support from the political elites, and so on. It's impossible to achieve all these at the moment. Dong Zhuo won't last long because he lacks legitimacy and relies solely on military power. Why don't we find someone to take shelter under, pledge allegiance to him, and wait for an opportunity to take action, and fulfil our ambitions." [...] Zhang Cheng agreed with his brother. He then resigned from government service, returned home, gathered his family members and moved to Yang Province.|$|E

"Whatever he was, or {{whatever}} he is," [...] interposed Harold, [...] "we must restrain ourselves just <b>now,</b> Disco, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> cannot punish {{him as he}} deserves, however much we may wish to, {{and he seems to}} have armed men enough to put us and our entertainers completely in his power.

50|$|The {{letter of}} the Corinthian believers to which the apostle alludes here, and in which it appears they put divers {{questions}} to him, hath long been lost, a circumstance to be much regretted; for had it been preserved, it would doubtless have illustrated many passages of the two epistles to the Corinthians, which are <b>now</b> obscure <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are ignorant of the matters to which the apostle alludes in these passages.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, my dear,' {{returned}} Mrs Boffin, {{giving her}} a squeeze, 'it's kind of you to find that reason out, and I hope {{it may have been}} so, and indeed to a certain extent I believe it was so, but I am afraid not to the whole extent.

To this Mrs. Mountjoy unwillingly yielded, and then Harry also took his departure.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I joined Pancho Brown I used {{to study}} the {{accounts}} and congratulate myself when I saw our credits going up," [...] Austin remarked with a smile. [...] "To feel I could write a cheque for a good sum was something very new. <b>Now</b> I'm bothered <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have money at the bank.

Not right to think too hard of poor fellows who, as I say, very kind and gentle at heart and most loving in family relation, except to old women whom they eat also, so that they no get bored with too long life." ...|$|E
50|$|One of Powyss most {{important}} works, his Autobiography (1934), which describes his first 60 years. While he {{sets out to}} be totally frank about himself, and especially his sexual peculiarities and perversions, he largely excludes any substantial discussion {{of the women in}} his life. The reason for this is <b>now</b> much clearer <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> know that it was written while he was still married to Margaret, though he was living in a permanent relationship with Phyllis Playter.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Love My Life" [...] {{was written}} by Lukas Bellesini, Jayson DeZuzio, Wolfgang Gartner, Mason [...] "MdL" [...] Levy, Mike Posner and Solo Tohi. Group member Paul [...] "Paulie" [...] Merciadez said, [...] "When we first heard it, we thought straightaway, 'this {{describes}} me'! We love our life, the way things are, {{what we do and}} the friends we have around us.

[...] The song was released physically on 3 April 2015 as the sixth single from Justice Crew's debut studio album Live by the Words. The physical release features a Matt Watkins remix of [...] "I Love My Life".|$|R
5000|$|Two {{weeks before}} the Swedish arrest warrant for Assange was dropped, one of his lawyers, Per Samuelson, reiterated his {{opposition}} to it saying [...] "With the Supreme Court's own reasoning, his detention should <b>now</b> be rescinded <b>because</b> <b>we</b> can <b>now</b> prove that the U.S. is hunting Julian Assange." [...] This followed public statements made by American President Donald Trump, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions as to the appropriateness of charging Assange in the U.S. with crimes related to WikiLeaks.|$|R
60|$|We {{met with}} some bad weather after this, which blew us off to sea, {{the wind blowing}} very hard at the south-east; {{but it was not}} so great a wind as to endanger us, though we lost sight of one another more in this storm than we had done in all our voyage. However, we were none of us in any great concern for it <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> had agreed before, that if we should lose one another, we should make the best of our way to the island of Juan Fernandez; and this we {{observed}} now so directly, that both of us shaping our course for the island, as soon as the storm abated, came in sight of one another long before we came thither, which proved very agreeable to us all.|$|E
60|$|Since I {{finished}} my last letter, on February the 21st, I {{have found no}} time to sit down to write until <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have passed {{through a period of}} ceaseless struggle and emotion, and I have been seeing so many things that I could not pause to record anything. It has been as if a painter prepared himself to paint some portrait, but was so fascinated by the beauty of his model that he could not turn his eyes from her face to the canvas; only that the spectacles which have held me have not always been beautiful. Now the great event is over, the long and bloody conflict around Ladysmith has been gloriously decided, and I take a few days' leisure on the good ship Maine, where everyone is busy getting well, to think about it all and set down some things on paper.|$|E
60|$|The boatswain, a blunt, surly, bold fellow, {{as soon as}} {{he heard}} of it, Very well, says he, so we are all come back into Captain Positive's blind {{proposal}} (for so he called me); why this is the same that everybody rejected at the Canaries; and <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are driven hither by contrary winds, those winds must be a reason why we must undertake a preposterous, ridiculous voyage, that never any sailor would have proposed, and that man never went before. What, does the captain think that we cannot find our way to the coast of America again, and because we have met with cross winds, we must never meet with fair ones? I warrant him, let us but go up the height of St. Helena, we will soon reach the Rio de la Plata and Port St. Julian again, and get into the South Seas too, as others have done before us.|$|E
2500|$|One element Gerson Saines {{was sure}} about from the {{beginning}} was {{that she wanted to}} work with HBO, in part because of her longstanding relationship with the network through her work as an agent. [...] "But I also knew that by going that route, more people will see it," [...] she said. [...] "When you're trying to make a movie like this, it's very rare that it reaches a wide audience." [...] HBO was equally intrigued by the story, and Gerson Saines credits past and present HBO executives with keeping the project alive until it could be properly realized. [...] "I made a commitment to Temple that I {{was going to make it}} and make it right...I never pushed to get it made until <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> got it right." ...|$|R
500|$|... {{with the}} present frightfully low prices of iron and steel rails it is utterly {{impossible}} for us to advance wages at all...

I assure you when prices will warrant it we shall be very glad to pay wages in proportion.|$|R
