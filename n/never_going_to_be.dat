5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{successful}}, {{not because of}} you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal}} with so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation.

50|$|Dumbarton's third {{successive}} {{season in}} Division 1 {{was more important}} than usual, due to the re-construction of the league format for the following season. In 1975-76 there would be 3 divisions of 10-14-14, and so a repeat of the previous season's 10th place would put them in the 'Premier' league. However inconsistent results throughout meant that this objective <b>was</b> <b>never</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> achieved and in the end Dumbarton settled for 14th place.|$|R

25|$|Lancashire Lightning eased to a {{comfortable}} win against Northamptonshire Steelbacks to go {{third in the}} table, two points behind leaders Middlesex Crusaders. Northamptonshire won the toss and batted, but 215 for 7 was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enough on a fine Old Trafford pitch, where Lancashire's Mal Loye smashed 94 not out with ten fours and three sixes.

25|$|In early 2011, Vinnie Paz {{announced}} on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn {{is due to}} be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla.

5000|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter also {{highlighted}} {{the difficulty in}} translating Shanges poetic play to film. He commented: [...] "No, it <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easy, but someone needed to put creative sweat into this one, to reach for cinematic solutions to the theatrical challenge. All Perry does is force conventional plots and characters—utter cliches without lives or souls—into the fabric of Shanges literary work. The hackneyed melodramas get him from one poem to the next but run roughshod over the collective sense of who these women are." [...] Honeycutt acknowledged the talents of the films actresses, highlighting performances by Phylicia Rashad, Anika Noni Rose, and Kimberly Elise.|$|R
25|$|The second {{match was}} a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a large score, {{finishing}} on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but less {{than they would have}} wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enough, however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|England's first {{match against}} the unified Germany since 1938 was a {{friendly}} in 1991 at Wembley, which the Germans won 1–0. Five years later, at the 1996 European Championships, England played a unified German {{team for the}} first time in a competitive fixture, when they met in the semi-finals. Like the 1966 World Cup, the tournament was being held in England, and the semi-final was played at Wembley Stadium. England's fans and team were confident, particularly after wins in the group stage over Scotland (2–0) and the Netherlands (4–1) and their first ever penalty shoot-out victory, over Spain, in the quarter-finals. So vivid were the memories of 1966 for England fans that a media clamour ensued for England to wear red jerseys, instead of the unfamiliar-looking grey away kit that had been launched earlier that year (as England had not submitted details of any red kit to UEFA before the tournament, this was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> permitted, and England did wear grey).|$|E
500|$|Haim {{subsequently}} toured Europe {{throughout the}} remainder of 2013, recruiting touring keyboardist Tommy King, as well as performing as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on November 23 with host Josh Hutcherson. The group performed [...] "The Wire" [...] and [...] "Don't Save Me" [...] and Este considered this performance particularly poignant {{as a high school}} drama teacher had once told her [...] "You're <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on Saturday Night Live."

5000|$|In 2014, Matt Damon {{revealed}} to Bryer {{that he would}} be [...] "open" [...] to reprising the role of Jason Bourne.Damon talked about stardom, his upbringing and how meeting childhood friend Ben Affleck changed their lives. He spoke about the battles they had to overcome to make Good Will Hunting and how he felt when he won his Oscar. He also discussed why he chooses to keep his family out of the spotlight and how he copes with fame: [...] "It kind of happens overnight and you're aware that the world is exactly {{the same as it was}} yesterday … It's a very surreal experience because you know intellectually that the world is the same, it's just <b>never</b> ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{has been}} treated both as a war novel and an anti-war novel. In her 2004 {{interview}} with critic Rob Nixon, Barker describes her conceptualisation of that boundary: [...] It's not an antiwar book in the very simple sense that I was afraid it might seem at the beginning. Not that it isn't an antiwar book: it is. But you can't set up things like the Somme or Passchendaele and use them as an Aunt Sally, because nobody thinks the Somme and Passchendaele were a good idea. So in a sense what we appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arguing about <b>is</b> <b>never</b> ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what they characters are actually arguing about, which is a much deeper question of honor, I think. [...] "Honor" [...] is another old-fashioned word like [...] "heroism," [...] but it's very much a key word in the book.|$|R
5000|$|Giuliani also {{expressed}} {{doubt that the}} federal government can completely stop illegal immigration. Giuliani said that the Immigration and Naturalization Service [...] "do nothing with those names but terrorize people." [...] In 1996 he said that the new anti-illegal immigration law, as well as the Welfare Reform Act, were [...] "inherently unfair." [...] In 1996, Giuliani said, [...] "I believe the anti-immigration movement in America is one of our most serious public problems." [...] In the same year he said, [...] "We're <b>never,</b> ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> totally control immigration in a country that is as large as ours."

500|$|Independence for East Timor, or even limited {{regional}} autonomy, was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed under Suharto's New Order. Notwithstanding Indonesian {{public opinion}} in the 1990s occasionally showing begrudging appreciation of the Timorese position, it was widely feared that an independent East Timor would destabilise Indonesian unity. The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, however, caused tremendous upheaval in Indonesia and led to Suharto's resignation in May 1998, ending his thirty-year presidency. Prabowo, by then {{in command of the}} powerful Indonesian Strategic Reserve, went into exile in Jordan and military operations in East Timor were costing the bankrupt Indonesian government a million dollars a day. The subsequent [...] "reformasi" [...] period of relative political openness and transition, included unprecedented debate about Indonesia's relationship with East Timor.|$|E
500|$|In January 1900, Southern Cross returned, {{picked up}} the shore party and, {{following}} the route which Ross had taken 60years previously, sailed southward to the Great Ice Barrier, which they discovered had retreated some [...] south {{since the days of}} Ross. A party consisting of Borchgrevink, William Colbeck and a Sami named Per Savio landed with sledges and dogs. This party ascended the Barrier and made the first sledge journey on the barrier surface; on 16 February 1900 they extended the Farthest South record to 78°50'S. On its return to England later in 1900, Borchgrevink's expedition was received without enthusiasm, despite its new southern record. Historian David Crane commented that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his contribution to Antarctic knowledge might have been better received, but [...] "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously".|$|E
5000|$|Concerning {{the sheer}} number of creatures <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{designed}} and made for the film, AFX Studio's David LeRoy Anderson estimated that [...] "close to a thousand" [...] people were turned into one of around 60 different monster types. The task necessitated renting a much larger facility to use as a workspace, as a crew of around 60 people were recruited. The producers told them to commence work on December 15, 2008, ahead of the official January 1, 2009 start date. They only completed the work by the March 9, 2009 production date because, as Anderson stated [...] "We had nearly seventy people at peak, but in effect we had a hundred and forty people, because everybody had at least two jobs...it was crazy, but people had an incredible time...none of us <b>are</b> ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> forget it, and we're <b>never</b> all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the same room again." ...|$|R

He excels at creatively forging links between archaeology and the exact sciences and he has revolutionized many of these fields. … Finkelstein has {{had an impact on}} radically revising the history of Israel in the 10th and 9th centuries BCE. He has transformed the study of history and archaeology in Israeli universities, moving from a ‘monumental’ to a ‘systemic’ study of the archaeological evidence. He has taken what was becoming a rather staid and conservative discipline, with everyone in general agreement as to interpretation of excavation results, and has turned things upside down. … The study of these periods <b>is</b> <b>never</b> again <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what it once was. … Israel Finkelstein has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> creative, generating scholarship no less than discussion, launching ideas and stimulating debates, fearlessly but with imagination and grace." ...|$|R

It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody." [...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious and a little more important." ...|$|E
500|$|Welch {{emphasizes}} {{music from}} a previous era as her major influence. [...] She said that [...] "by and large I listen {{to people who are}} dead. I'm really of the tried-and-true school. I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant." [...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family.

[...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour.

Daley, however, noted that [...] "unlike their ’98 hit, this sleeper isn’t {{likely to make}} a major dent in your Most Played list — while it seems to have the right ingredients, strong vocals, and an empowering message, it suffers from watered-down couplets about Facebook and Macbooks and a beat that isn’t quite catchy enough." [...] She also compared it to Beyoncé's [...] "Irreplaceable", commenting that the duet is a new version [...] "with two leads and more juvenile lyrics." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator considered it a [...] "snappy R tune", and said that it's [...] "nice to see these two ladies finally getting along!"

5000|$|... "Afraid of the Dark" [...] {{was written}} by Leanne Macomber, with {{production}} by Joel Ford and mastering by Josh Bonati. It is a synthpop song running for four minutes and 24 seconds. A writer for Fact felt its overall style was taken from songs in the soundtrack of the 2011 film Drive. Writers have analyzed airy synths, bright brash Europop-influenced New Order-esque synth stabs, a driving arpreggiated Kavinsky-style bass and a bouncing four-on-the-floor minimal disco drum beat. These accompany Macomber's [...] "glossy" [...] vocals. According to Polari Magazines Andrew Darley, the lyrics discuss [...] "someone, broken by love, who is building up strength to protect themselves in future."

However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over.

[...] Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode {{was similar to the}} earlier [...] "Per Manum" [...] and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining [...] "the point of all this is only to emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, the familiarity of the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix is <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same again".

I didn't want to force the issue, either, because I'm very pleased with Crossed and don't want to dilute it with a sequel that I hadn't the ideas to sustain.That said, it's pretty obvious that what you have with Crossed is a ready-made fictional world with {{a good deal of}} potential for further development, and the Crossed themselves seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong enough villains to maintain an audience. So when William suggested other people doing more I said I wasn't averse to it, so long as a) I thought the creative teams <b>were</b> up <b>to</b> scratch, and b) my own story and characters would be left alone. Which means no sequel, no more Stan, Cindy, Thomas or Kitrick (or Horsecock, Face or Stump, come to that)- just fresh stories set in the same world.As for David, who better? I think you'll see right from his first episode that he knows exactly what he's doing with the Crossed.|$|R
