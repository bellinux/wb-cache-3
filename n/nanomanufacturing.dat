50|$|Tolerance is the {{permissible}} limit or {{limits of}} variation in dimensions, properties, or conditions without significantly affecting functioning of equipment or a process. Tolerances are specified to allow reasonable leeway for imperfections and inherent variability without compromising performance. In nanotechnology the systems have dimensions {{in the range of}} nanometers. Defining tolerances at nanoscale with suitable calibration standards for traceability is difficult for different <b>nanomanufacturing</b> methods.

5000|$|The NNI {{has defined}} {{nanotechnology}} very broadly, {{to include a}} wide range of tiny structures, including those created by large and imprecise tools. However, <b>nanomanufacturing</b> is not defined in the NNI's recent report, Instrumentation and Metrology for Nanotechnology. In contrast, another [...] "priority area," [...] nanofabrication, is defined as [...] "the ability to fabricate, by directed or self-assembly methods, functional structures or devices at the atomic or molecular level" [...] (p. 67). <b>Nanomanufacturing</b> appears to be the near-term, industrial-scale manufacture of nanotechnology-based objects, with emphasis on low cost and reliability. Many professional societies have formed Nanotechnology technical groups. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers, for example, has formed a <b>Nanomanufacturing</b> Technical Group to both inform members of the developing technologies and to address the organizational and IP (intellectual property) legal issues that must be addressed for broader commercialization.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturing in the {{mesoscale}} can {{be accomplished}} by scaling down macroscale manufacturing processes or scaling up <b>nanomanufacturing</b> processes. Macroscale techniques like mill and lathe machining have been successful used to create features in the range of 25 µm. Meso Machine tools (mMTs), for example miniaturized milling machine, is a expansion of using traditional macroscale techniques to manufacture mesoscale products. With the limitation of self-excited vibration of machine tools and fatigue, microassembly and micro- and mesoscale milling are created to improve the maximum stiffness and dynamic operation of the milling process, which improves the overall performance of manufacturing. The development of mMTs has revealed many challenges that are specific to machining at the small scales. These challenges stem from the large influence of grain size at small scales and the necessity of extremely small tolerances for both the machine tools and the measuring tools.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} such {{technology}} is the Nanoscale Offset Printing System (NanoOps) which was developed {{by researchers at the}} Center of High-rate <b>Nanomanufacturing</b> (CHN) in Northeastern University. The NanoOps is a form of directed assembly which is faster and more economic than traditional 3D printing of nanosystems. Ahmed Busnaina, who was the head lead of the project and featured in the film From Lab to Fab: Pioneers in Nano-manufacturing describes the system as a printing press. An etched template with nano wires is dipped in a solution with nano particles which acts as the ink for the press. The nanoparticles adhere to the template when electricity is applied to the solution. The template with the attached nano particles can then be taken out of the solution and pressed onto any material of choice. According to Busnaina, the whole process only costs 1% of conventional manufacturing and can reduce manufacturing time from days to minutes.|$|E
