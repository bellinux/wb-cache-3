40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{establish}} the agreement between two recommended definitions of airflow obstruction in symptomatic adults referred for spirometry by their general practitioner, and investigate how rates of airflow obstruction change when pre-bronchodilator instead of post-bronchodilator spirometry is performed. The diagnostic spirometric results of 14, 056 adults with respiratory obstruction were analysed. Differences in interpretation between a fixed 0. 70 forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) /forced vital capacity (FVC) cut-off point and a sex- and age-specific lower limit of <b>normal</b> <b>cut-off</b> point for this ratio were investigated. Of the subjects, 53 % were female and 69 % were current or ex-smokers. The mean post-bronchodilator FEV(1) /FVC was 0. 73 in males and 0. 78 in females. The sensitivity of the fixed relative to the lower limit of <b>normal</b> <b>cut-off</b> point definition was 97. 9 %, with a specificity of 91. 2 %, positive predictive value of 72. 0 % and negative predictive value of 99. 5 %. For the subgroup of current or ex-smokers aged > or = 50 yrs, these values were 100, 82. 0, 69. 2 and 100 %, respectively. The proportion of false positive diagnoses using the fixed cut-off point increased with age. The positive predictive value of pre-bronchodilator airflow obstruction was 74. 7 % among current or ex-smokers aged > or = 50 yrs. The current clinical guideline-recommended fixed 0. 70 forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity cut-off point leads to substantial overdiagnosis of obstruction in middle-aged and elderly patients in primary care.

Methods: A community based sample of 222 subjects was examined. Psychiatric diagnoses were formulated using the International Composite Diagnostic Interview Simplified (CIDIS), according to DSM-IV criteria. All subjects underwent a complete thyroid evaluation including physical examination, thyroid echography and measure of serum free T 4 (FT 4), free T 3 (FT 3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (anti-TPO).

Our purpose was developing of simple, inexpensive, high throughput technique based on the quantitative determination of TREC and KREC molecules by real-time PCR, and its validation in a group of children with a verified diagnosis of SCID and X-linked agammaglobulinemia. In this study, we developed and validated multiplex real-time PCR for the TREC’s and KREC’s quantitative analysis. We have shown that linear range of Ct changes depending on the concentrations of targets with a correlation coefficient R 2 not worse than 0. 98 was observed at concentrations from 109 to 5 × 104 copies per ml. The lowest amount of targets reliably detected in a reaction volume was 10 TREC’s copies, 5 KREC ‘s copies and 5 copies of internal control (IL 17 RA). We determined the age-depended reference values of TRECs and KRECs in whole blood in 29 boys and 27 girls with normal immunological parameters.

40|$|Mild {{forms of}} {{hypothyroidism}} – subclinical hypothyroidism – {{have recently been}} discussed as being {{a risk factor for}} the development of overt thyroid dysfunction and for a number of clinical disorders. The diagnosis critically depends on the definition of the upper normal limit of serum TSH as, by definition, free thyroxine serum concentrations are <b>normal.</b> <b>Cut-off</b> levels of 4 – 5 mU TSH/l have been conven-tionally used to diagnose an elevated TSH serum concentration. Recent data from large population studies have suggested a much lower TSH cut-off with an upper limit of 2 – 2. 5 mU/l but application of strict criteria for inclusion of subjects from the general population studies aiming at assessing TSH reference intervals (no personal or family history of thyroid disease, no thyroid antibodies and a normal thyroid on ultrasonography) did not result in an unequivocal upper limit of normal TSH at 2. 0 – 2. 5 mU/l. When summarizing the available evidence for lowered upper TSH cut-off values and their potential therapeutic implications there is presently insufficient justification to lower the upper normal limit of TSH and, for practical purposes, it is still recommended to maintain the TSH reference interval of 0. 4 – 4. 0 mU/l.

However, assessment of the iron status has proven to be difficult, especially in children living in areas with high infection pressure (including malaria). Aims and Methods: Biochemical iron markers were compared to bone marrow iron findings in 381 Malawian children with severe anaemia. Results: Soluble transferrin receptor/log ferritin (TfR-F index), using a cut-off of 5. 6, best predicted bone marrow iron stores deficiency (sensitivity 74 %, specificity 73 %, accuracy 73 %). In order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin or sTfR as a stand-alone marker, the <b>normal</b> <b>cut-off</b> value needed to be increased by 810 % and 83 % respectively. Mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), using a cut-off of 32. 1 g/dl, had a sensitivity of 67 % and specificity of 64 % for detecting iron stores deficiency. Conclusion: TfR-F index incorporated the high sensitivity of sTfR, a proxy for cellular iron need, and the high specificity of ferritin, a proxy for iron stores.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Non-communicable {{diseases}} {{have emerged}} as a predominant cause of deaths for women worldwide. Earlier post-menopausal women {{were thought to be}} at higher risk for chronic degenerative diseases, as protective effect of oestrogen is lost after menopause. Whereas in the last decade, alarming trends for these diseases are seen among women in their child bearing age. Hence the aim {{of the study was to}} assess non-invasive risk factors of noncommunicable diseases among adult females with a focus on menopause. For this purpose, 408 females were screened and after excluding cases of peri-menopause, under-nutrition, pregnancy and hysterectomy, based on consent detailed non-invasive risk analysis was performed on 131 female subjects. The results revealed that the prevalence of selfreported history of hypertension and diabetes was around 21 % and 11 % respectively. About 75 % of the subjects were overweight or obese according to Asia Pacific Classification. Post-menopausal women had significantly high prevalence of high body fat per cent (OR 6. 52, 95 %CI 1. 32 - 62. 3) and high blood pressure (OR 4. 4 95 %CI 2. 1 - 9. 3). Mean waist circumference, waist hip ratio, waist stature ratio, body fat and systolic blood pressure were above the <b>normal</b> <b>cut-offs</b> depicting presence of risks in both the groups. A trend of high per capita consumption of oil, salt and sugar at household level was seen. The frequency of practice of regular health check-up and awareness regarding selfbreast examination was very low among the subjects.

This study was performed in 166 patients {{to examine the effects}} of cut-off values determined in three ways. Model 1 assigned patients to one of three equal groups (low, medium, high) based on fibrinolytic measurements made at diagnosis, Model 2 divided patients into low/high groups using median values, and Model 3 grouped according to the parameter being above/below normal range. In model 1, raised plasma fibrinogen, D-dimer and soluble fibrin were positively associated with poorer survival. In model 2, tissue plasminogen activator antigen was additionally related to poorer prognosis. Model 3 identified seven parameters as significantly related to survival, two not identified by the other models becoming significant [plasmin–antiplasmin, tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) antigen]. Using multivariate analysis, plasma fibrinogen level was the most uniformly significant parameter. Relative risk estimates indicated that raised plasma fibrinogen, soluble fibrin and D-dimer were associated with increased risk of death.

Cardiac TnI concentrations were determined in basal conditions, {{at the end}} of the procedure, and after 8, 12, and 24 hours. Single-/dual-chamber devices were implanted in 31 of 39 patients.

All patients presented normal cTnI at 24 -hour assay. In conclusion, pacemaker implantation is associated with increases of cTnI levels in up to 37 % of patients. This can affect the specificity of cTnI assessment for ruling out ACS, especially within 12 hours after the procedure. These data deserve consideration in a contemporary setting, in which troponin has gathered a pivotal role in the diagnosis and therapy of ACS, and in particular clinical presentations in which electrocardiogram loses its diagnostic capabilities (due to paced rhythms) and symptoms may be lacking or confusing...|$|E

40|$|The {{decision}} to place sealants {{is a difficult}} one, {{and it has been}} suggested that in a low risk population it may be efficient to wait until caries is detected in the fissure. An invasive sealant technique with fissure preparation may then be indicated. The diagnostic method used in the indication of such a procedure should accurately detect both dentine caries and sound fissures: high sensitivity for dentine caries (at D 3 threshold) with high specificity for enamel caries (at D 1 threshold), The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic performance of selected diagnostic methods at <b>normal</b> <b>cut-offs</b> for traditional dentine caries detection and at reduced cut-offs in relation to the desired performance mentioned above, and to assess whether fissure opening allows for accurate visual detection of dentinal caries, Data were obtained from 230 occlusal sites of 101 extracted human molar teeth, Diagnostic methods used on the entire sample were: visual inspection, electrical conductance measurements and laser fluorescence measurements. The sample was then divided into two groups, Group 1 was subjected to visual inspection after application of a dye. Group 2 was subjected to visual inspection after fissure opening only, and after subsequent dye application. Validation was performed by histological investigation. The results with cut-offs normally used in dentine caries detection were roughly in accordance with the literature, except for laser fluorescence, The sensitivity of visual inspection for dentinal caries (D 3) was 17 % before and 70 % after fissure opening. Using reduced cut-offs, a 100 % sensitivity (D 3) was achieved with 2 methods, but this also resulted in 63 or 87 % false positive diagnoses of sound surfaces. Visual inspection and electrical methods both showed a moderate to high sensitivity (D 3) with a higher than 50 % specificity (D 1). It was concluded that visual inspection and electrical methods at reduced cutoffs may aid the indication of invasive sealant treatment. The visual detection of dentinal caries is substantially increased, but not perfect after fissure opening. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG. Basel...|$|R

This cross-sectional study involved 16, 025 samples for sickle cell disease screening in the province of Alicante, Spain, which has a high immigration rate. The primary variable was hemoglobin A, and the secondary variables were gender, gestational age (preterm and full term) and maternal origin (Spain, the rest of Europe, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia). Percentiles of normality (1 and 99) were obtained by origin, gender and gestational age using quantile regression models and bootstrap samples.

The aim of our study was to identify outcomes in patients newly diagnosed with airflow obstruction (AO) based on a diagnostic work-up conducted as part of a population-based cross-sectional study in North-Western Russia.

The cut-off value of 2.69 %/min/m 2 rightly identified all but one patient with postoperative liver failure. In contrary, CT volumetry based cut-off values failed to identify two cases and in case of BSA corrected volumes even three cases. Furthermore, for hepatobiliary scintigraphy, one cut-off value sufficed for both compromised and <b>normal</b> livers, whereas <b>cut-off</b> values for CT volumetry varied.|$|R
40|$|Raised serum total {{cholesterol}} (TC) is an accepted {{risk factor for}} both coronary and peripheral vascular disease and three landmark trials have shown the benefit of lowering TC using statins. Vascular surgeons tend to measure TC, but {{little is known about}} how they manage hypercholesterolaemia or whether they believe treatment will be of benefit. A questionnaire was sent to listed members of the Vascular Surgical Society of Great Britain and Ireland seeking responses to a range of questions on the measurement and management of raised TC. In all, 374 questionnaires were sent out. The response rate was 67 %. Over 90 % of respondents said they measured TC and considered a level below 5. 5 mmol/l as <b>normal.</b> The <b>cut-off</b> for initiating drug therapy, referral to a dietician or to a lipid specialist varied from 5. 5 to 7. 5 mmol/l. Most (62 %) believed that lowering TC improved coronary mortality, but fewer (26 %) that it prevented worsening of claudication. Although most vascular surgeons check for raised TC, the level at which treatment begins and the form it takes varies; in many cases being at odds with recommendations. Few surgeons are convinced of the benefits of lowering TC for claudication and nearly one-fifth do not believe it improves coronary mortality...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether bicycle riding alters total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) serum concentrations in healthy older men. Methods: 129 male participants, {{ranging in age}} from 50 to 71 years (mean 55 years), rode in a recreational group bicycle ride of between 55 and 160 kilometers. Blood samples for tPSA analysis were drawn within 60 minutes before starting, and within 5 minutes after completing the ride. The pre-cycling and post-cycling tPSA values were log transformed for normality and compared using paired t-tests. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between changes in tPSA with age and distance cycled. Results: Bicycle riding caused tPSA to increase by an average of 9. 5 % (95 % CI = 6. 1 – 12. 9; p, 0. 001) or 0. 23 ng/ml. The number of participants with an elevated tPSA (using the standard PSA <b>normal</b> range <b>cut-off</b> of 4. 0 ng/ml) increased from two pre-cycle to six post-cycle (or from five to eight when using age-based normal ranges). Univariate linear regression analysis revealed that the change in tPSA was positively correlated with age and the distance cycled. Conclusions: Cycling causes an average 9. 5 % increase in tPSA, in healthy male cyclists $ 50 years old, when measured within 5 minutes post cycling. We considered the increase clinically significant as the number of participants with an elevated PSA, according to established cut-offs, increased post-ride. Based on the research published to date, the author...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{insights}} {{provide support}} {{for the treatment of}} cancer during pregnancy, a coincidence that poses both mother and fetus at risk. Our aim was to critically review studies on the physiologic variations during pregnancy, the most common tumor markers used in diagnosis and follow-up of gynecological cancers. Methods We conducted a systematic review of six tumor markers during normal pregnancy: carbohydrate antigen (CA) 15 - 3 (breast cancer); squamous cell carcinoma antigen (cervical cancer); and CA 125, anti-Müllerian hormone, inhibin B and lactate dehydrogenase (ovarian cancer). Results For CA 15 - 3, 3. 3 % to 20. 0 % of all measurements were above the cut-off (maximum 56 U/mL in the third trimester). Squamous cell carcinoma antigen values were above cut-off in 3. 1 % and 10. 5 % of the measurements (maximum 4. 3 µg/L in the third trimester). Up to 35 % of CA 125 levels were above cut-off: levels were highest in the first trimester, with a maximum value up to 550 U/mL. Inhibin B, anti-Müllerian hormone and lactate dehydrogenase levels were not elevated in maternal serum during normal pregnancy. Conclusion During normal pregnancy, tumor markers including CA 15. 3, squamous cell carcinoma antigen and CA 125 can be elevated; inhibin B, anti-Müllerian hormone and lactate dehydrogenase levels remain below <b>normal</b> <b>cut-off</b> values. Knowledge of physiological variations during pregnancy can be clinically important when managing gynecological cancers in pregnant patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Others have {{described}} {{a relationship between}} hemoglobin A levels and gestational age, gender and ethnicity. However, {{studies are needed to}} determine <b>normal</b> <b>cut-off</b> points considering these factors. To address this issue we designed a study to determine the percentiles of normality of neonatal hemoglobin A levels taking these factors into account. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 16, 025 samples for sickle cell disease screening in the province of Alicante, Spain, which has a high immigration rate. The primary variable was hemoglobin A, and the secondary variables were gender, gestational age (preterm and full term) and maternal origin (Spain, the rest of Europe, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia). Percentiles of normality (1 and 99) were obtained by origin, gender and gestational age using quantile regression models and bootstrap samples. The association between these percentiles of normality and altered levels (≥ 1 %) of hemoglobin E was analyzed. We obtained the percentiles of normality (1 and 99) for each maternal origin, gender and gestational age. Results: Of a total of 88 possible E carriers, 65 had above-normal hemoglobin A levels (74 %). The levels of normality for hemoglobin A varied greatly according to the maternal origin and gestational age. Conclusion: With the levels of normality that we established it is possible to discard samples with unrecorded blood transfusions. Our methodology could be applied to other diseases in the neonatal screening...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{promyelocytic leukemia}} (APL) is {{characterized}} cytogenetically by t(15; 17) (q 22;q 21) and its molecular consequence, fusion of PML and RARalpha genes. The detection of this genetic marker confirms {{the diagnosis and}} allows monitoring of the leukemic clone during treatment, which has prognostic value. Cytogenetics fails in some cases due {{to the absence of}} metaphases in cultures or their bad morphology. Southern blot and PCR methods require trained personnel and adequate equipment. FISH method allows the identification of chromosomic rearrangements in 24 to 48 h and is simple to set up in a cytogenetics laboratory. Aim: To evaluate the FISH method to detect PML/RARalpha fusion, compared to cytogenetic analysis. Patients and methods: Fifteen bone marrow specimens from APL patients with previous cytogenetic analysis were studied, using a commercial probe to detect PML/RARalpha fusion. Results: We obtained a <b>normal</b> <b>cut-off</b> value of 9. 1 %. Specificity and sensibility were 100 %. Six positive cytogenetic cases at diagnosis were FISH positive. Six negative cytogenetic cases, one APL at diagnosis and five normal controls were FISH negative. One case in remission, that was negative by cytogenetics, was positive near the cut-off value by FISH. Two other cases in remission, not conclusive by cytogenetics, were negative by FISH. Conclusions: FISH is a reliable, rapid and relatively low cost method that can be used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetics (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 737 - 44...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{examine the}} {{potential}} value of previously identified biomarkers using proteomics in early screening for preeclampsia (PE). Methods. 24 blood samples from women who subsequently developed PE and 48 from uncomplicated pregnancies were obtained at 11 – 13 weeks and analysed after delivery. Cystatin-C, sVCAM- 1, and Pappalysin- 1 were quantified by ELISA. Maternal characteristics and medical history were recorded. Results. Median values of Cystatin-C, sVCAM- 1, and Pappalysin- 1 in the PE group {{as compared to}} controls were 909. 1 [*]gEq/mL versus 480. 0 [*]gEq/mL, P=. 000, 832. 0 [*]gEq/mL versus 738. 8 [*]gEq/mL, P=. 024, and 234. 4 [*]gEq/mL versus 74. 9 [*]gEq/mL, P=. 064, respectively. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC, standard error (SE)) for predicting PE were Cystatin-C: 0. 90 (SE 0. 04), VCAM- 1 : 0. 66 (SE 0. 074), and Pappalysin- 1 : 0. 63 (SE 0. 083). To discriminate between cases at risk for PE and <b>normal</b> controls, <b>cut-off</b> values of 546. 8 [*]gEq/mL for Cystatin-C, 1059. 5 [*]gEq/mL for sVCAM- 1, and 220. 8 [*]gEq/mL for Pappalysin- 1 were chosen, providing sensitivity of 91 %, 41 %, and 54 % and specificity of 85 %, 100 %, and 95 %, respectively. Conclusions. sVCAM- 1 and Pappalysin- 1 do not improve early screening for PE. Cystatin-C, however, seems {{to be associated with}} subsequent PE development, but larger studies are necessary to validate these findings...|$|R
5000|$|During {{this brief}} interval, {{the lack of}} {{electrical}} grounding caused a substantial current to flow through an electrical relay {{which was supposed to}} trigger <b>normal</b> engine <b>cut-off</b> at the end of powered flight. This relay tripped, causing the Redstone to shut off its engine and send a [...] "normal cut-off" [...] signal to the capsule. Under normal circumstances, when the capsule received this signal during a flight, it would do two things: it would jettison its escape rocket, which was no longer of any use, and after the escape rocket had flown clear, fire the explosive bolts holding it to the booster for separation. In the case of MR-1, the capsule did jettison the escape rocket as it was designed to, but the separation sequence did not occur. The capsule was designed to suspend this separation until the vehicle's acceleration had almost ceased, so that the capsule would not be hit by a still-accelerating launch vehicle. This would happen when the capsule's acceleration sensors detected an acceleration approaching 0 g, which it would normally experience after the Redstone had shut down and was entering free fall. However, in MR-1, the Redstone was not in free fall but rather sitting supported on the ground. Thus the capsule sensors detected the effect of their own supported weight, which they read as a constant [...] "acceleration" [...] of 1 g. Because of this apparent acceleration, capsule separation was disabled.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Identification of {{patients}} {{at risk of}} a complicated course after liver resection is crucial for adapting post-opera-tive care. In the present study, we investigated the diagnostic value of the plasma levels of various cytokines obtained imme-diately after surgery. IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 8, monokine induced by interferon-γ (MIG), monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and interferon-inducible protein- 10 (IP- 10) concentrations were measured in 26 patients after liver resection using a cytometric bead assay and were correlated with liver function, resectate weight, surgery duration, ischemia/reperfusion, hospitalization time and occurrence of complications. Patients with post-surgical complications showed distinctive patterns of IL- 6 and IL- 8 as early as minutes to hours after surgery. In addition, although pre-operative bilirubin in most patients remained within the <b>normal</b> range, a <b>cut-off</b> of 1 mg/dl separated the patients into groups with different profiles of IL- 6, IL- 8, and MCP- 1 secretion and different likelihoods of experiencing post-operative complications (bilirubin level...|$|R
