30|$|The same {{considerations}} {{apply in}} case of microbiological contamination, which is less critical {{in case of}} “cassette” systems, due to their single-use characteristics. Moreover, some commercially available kits are sterile. In case of non-disposable system, bioburden is the method of choice to validate cleaning procedures. Typically, three preparation runs are performed using the same conditions set for normal routine preparations, but without using radioactivity and avoiding final sterilization (e.g. in case the RP solution has to be sterilized by filtration, filter {{is not included in}} the preparations dedicated to bioburden testing). As ionizing radiations, depending on the amount and radiation pattern of the starting radionuclide, {{may play a role in}} keeping the microbial populations low, the lack of radioactivity during the simulation of the preparation procedure may be considered as a worst case scenario. The three simulated preparation runs yield solutions, which are then analysed following routine procedures for bioburden test. Typical acceptance criteria is 10 Colony Forming Unit (CFU) / 100  ml (<b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>guidance</b> on manufacture of the finished dosage).|$|E

40|$|In this MiniReview, {{the main}} {{modifications}} {{made during the}} revision of the current <b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>Guidance</b> on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence are reviewed and justified. Several new features {{have been added to}} this guideline, as well as changes aimed at improving the clarity of the guidance provided. The first issue to be addressed was to limit the scope of the guideline to bioequivalence studies for immediate release dosage forms with systemic action. Therefore, the guideline refers to bioequivalence alone. Moreover, the new definition of Generic Medicinal Product has been incorporated. Clearer guidance covering more specific cases is now given on sections such as: fed/fasting conditions, use of metabolite data, enantiomers and strength {{to be used in the}} bioequivalence study. Steady-state design is now restricted and other designs, such as parallel group design, replicate design and two-stage design, are now incorporated in a more explicit form. New practical guidance on Highly Variable Drug Products and Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs has been incorporated. The possibility for a biowaiver based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification System is now more explicit for Class I drugs and can be extended to Class III drugs under restricted conditions. We are aware that the initial goal of providing a very specific and clear guidance on these issues has not been entirely achieved, mainly because it is almost impossible to cover all individual cases and predict every possible situation that may arise. Demonstration of bioequivalence will still require in many instances a case by case approach...|$|E

30|$|Validation is {{the action}} of proving that any procedure, process, equipment, material, {{activity}} or system actually leads to the expected results, with the aim to contribute to guarantee {{the quality of a}} (radio) pharmaceutical. The concept of qualification is very similar to that of validation, but while the former is more general and relies on a broad range of activities, the latter is more “practical” and indicates the actions and operations aimed to demonstrate that a system / equipment is properly installed, works correctly and leads to the expected results. Qualification may be considered as a part of validation. General Principles on Validation and Qualification are outlined in different important reference documents, the most important and relevant of which, for professionals operating within the European Union, is the Annex 15 (EU) of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines, that apply to the manufacturing of medicinal products aimed to obtain a Marketing Authorization, and in general to those who are requested to comply with GMP. Annex 15 has been recently revised, and most recent version came into operation on 1 st October 2015. Other useful guidelines have been released by Institutions such as World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (FDA Guidance for industry), or even by instrumentation suppliers (Agilent et al. 2017), the latter being usually addressed to specific proprietary technology, while the former are typically conceived as general guidance principles for industry. Although principles described in the above documents are generally applicable to any process, equipment, system or facility, their practical implementation in the preparation and quality controls of radiopharmaceuticals may require adaptations that meet the peculiar nature of the RPs themselves and of the equipment used for their preparation. Another important issue related to the validation concept is the validation of analytical methods, whose general principles are outlined in ICH Q(2) R 1 – <b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>Guidance</b> on validation of analytical procedures: text and methodology (ICH guideline), which define the type of analytical methods to be validated and set parameters of concern and acceptance criteria to be considered. The same considerations stated above apply: ICH guidelines are very general and capable to embrace a broad range of analytical procedures, including those procedures specifically developed for the quality control of radiopharmaceuticals; however, the intrinsic nature of radioactivity, which decreases with time following the decay law, and the physical characteristics of the detection of radioactivity, prompt for specific validation protocols. Only a brief, general description of the principles of validation of analytical methods will be given in this text; indeed, due to the complexity and variety of the involved procedures, instrumentation, etc., they will be the subject of a separate, dedicated guidance document.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{important}} {{progress in}} understanding the molecular factors underlying the development of cancer and the improvement in response rates with new drugs, long-term survival is still disappointing for most common solid tumours. This might be because {{very little of the}} modest gain for patients {{is the result of the}} new compounds discovered and marketed recently. An assessment of the regulatory agencies' performance may suggest improvements. The present analysis summarizes and evaluates the type of studies and end points used by the EMEA to approve new anticancer drugs, and discusses the application of current regulations. This report is based on the information available on the EMEA web site. We identified current regulatory requirements for anticancer drugs promulgated by the agency and retrieved them in the relevant directory; information about empirical evidence supporting the approval of drugs for solid cancers through the centralised procedure were retrieved from the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). We surveyed documents for drug applications and later extensions from January 1995, when EMEA was set up, to December 2004. We identified 14 anticancer drugs for 27 different indications (14 new applications and 13 extensions). Overall, 48 clinical studies were used as the basis for approval; randomised comparative (clinical) trial (RCT) and Response Rate were the study design and end points most frequently adopted (respectively, 25 out of 48 and 30 out of 48). In 13 cases, the EPAR explicitly reported differences between arms in terms of survival: the range was 0 – 3. 7 months, and the mean and median differences were 1. 5 and 1. 2 months. The majority of studies (13 out of 27, 48 %) involved the evaluation of complete and/or partial tumour responses, with regard to the end points supporting the 27 indications. Despite the recommendations of the current EMEA guidance documents, new anticancer agents are still often approved on the basis of small single arm trials that do not allow any assessment of an ‘acceptable and extensively documented toxicity profile' and of end points such as response rate, time to progression or progression-free survival which at best can be considered indicators of anticancer activity and are not ‘justified surrogate markers for clinical benefit'. Anticipating an earlier than ideal point along the drug approval path and the use of not fully validated surrogate end points in nonrandomised trials looks like a dangerous shortcut that might jeopardise consumers' health, leading to unsafe and ineffective drugs being marketed and prescribed. The present <b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>Guidance</b> for new anticancer agents needs revising.

40|$|An {{alarming}} {{decline of}} vulture populations (up to 95 %) in Pakistan {{in the late}} 1990 ’s has recently been attributed {{to the use of}} the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac in cattle. Several species are now threatened with extinction, a tragedy that demonstrates that an environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicines is legitimate. The fate and behaviour of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been studied incidentally since the second half of the 20 th century. The possible effect of residues on the quality of the environment was a concern that had been recognised since shortly after medicines were actually found in the environment towards the end of the 1960 s. About a decade or two later, these concerns about pollution and effects had reached the regulatory agenda and were addressed in the European legislation on veterinary medicines. Notably from 1994 onwards, when the EU Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) initiated the drafting of a guidance document for the risk assessment of veterinary medicines, an increasing number of publications on use, emission, fate, occurrence, effect, and risk of pharmaceuticals has been published. In this thesis, the representation of the environment in the risk model and the consequences of the choices regarding variables and relationships in the natural system were addressed in light of existing legislation and policy on environmental quality. Where possible, empirical validation of individual exposure models was performed, demonstrating the accuracy of the model for a specified use. I have outlined and discussed several technical and conceptual flaws in the use of risk assessment in the registration process. The formalisation of the protection goals by the <b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>Guidance</b> has no legal status, the guidance does not contain all European environmental quality criteria and includes a soil exposure trigger for the full risk assessment that was not well founded. Particularly the variability in possible outcomes for the soil exposure trigger is troublesome, since it gives the impression that science may produce information that will not lead to better judgement. Screening level exposure models are not always protective and lack standardised scenarios for uniform assessment. Risk mitigation measures are not validated, and give a false impression that the risk to the environment is reduced to acceptable levels. Products that pose a threat to environmental quality at or after use may now be registered and be used. Authorities responsible for water and land quality cannot infer from the registration of a veterinary medicine that the use complies with the quality standards set by environmental legislation. This legislation now obliges these authorities to regulate and enforce product use and slurry use on a case by case basis through permits. All of the shortcomings identified undermine, to a greater or to a lesser extent, the legitimacy of the registration process and the use of scientific opinions. Policy makers, regulators, and scientists should engage in a reconnaissance of regulatory goals, assessment scales, model approaches, and uncertainty and variability of data associated with the assessment. Only then, a risk model (with or without triggers) can be applicable to the situation of interest and provide a solid framework for making risk-benefit decisions to the satisfaction of producers, decision-makers and consumers.

30|$|Summing up PEC/PNECs is {{mentioned}} in the Technical <b>Notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>Guidance</b> as one option for biocide product assessment (ECB, 2008). However, {{it should be pointed}} out that eq. 8 is fundamentally different from CA (eq. 4), as the PNECs from the various compounds might be based on data from completely different endpoints and species. Hence eq. 8 violates one of the fundamental assumptions of CA. Consequently, the use of PEC/PNEC sums has recently been advised against in the preliminary opinion on mixture toxicity assessment as put forward by the EU scientific committees[28]. However, it can be proven that eq. 8 provides a conservative approximation of CA[22]. Furthermore, it is a major advantage of the PEC/PNEC sum (eq. 8) that it can be applied even if different amounts of data are available for the different compounds in the product, for example when an extended data set including chronic ecotoxicity data is at hand for the active ingredient, but only base-set data are available for the other substances of concern. For a more detailed discussion on the use of PEC/PNEC sums see[22].|$|R
50|$|The EU {{regulatory}} framework for biocides has for years been defined by the Directive 98/8/EC, {{also known as the}} Biocidal Products Directive (BPD). The BPD was revoked by the Biocidal Products Regulation 528/2012 (BPR), which entered into force on 17 July 2012 with the application date of September 1, 2013. Several Technical <b>Notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>Guidance</b> (TNsG) have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the BPR and to assure a common understanding of its obligations. According to the EU legislation, biocidal products need authorisation to be placed or to remain on the market. Competent Authorities of the EU member states are responsible for assessing and approving the active substances contained in the biocides. The BPR follows some of the principles set previously under the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restrictions of Chemicals) and the coordination of the risk assessment process for both REACH and BPR are mandated to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which assures the harmonization and integration of risk characterization methodologies between the two regulations.|$|R

40|$|Following {{the entry}} into force of the Directive 98 / 8 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council {{concerning}} the placing of biocidal products on the market, all active substances in the European market have to be reviewed to ensure that under normal conditions of use {{they can be used}} without unacceptable risk for people, animals or the environment. Thus, in the frame of the review process, the risk assessment of each active substance plays a fundamental role and providing technical guidance to the assessments that must be performed ensures a correct and uniform implementation of the Directive for the different Member States. According to Annex VI of Directive 98 / 8 /EC the risk assessment shall cover the proposed normal use of the biocidal product together with a ‘realistic worst case scenario’. The aim of this Emission Scenario Document (ESD) is to set up methods for the estimation of the emission of disinfectants, used for the disinfection of vehicles used for animal transport, for veterinary hygiene and in hatcheries. 	 The present ESD is intended to be used by Member States as a basis for assessing applications submitted with a view to include existing active substances used in PT 3 in Annex I or IA of Directive 98 / 8 /EC or for assessing applications for product authorisation. It can be a useful tool also for Industry, when assessing requirements for a submission.
