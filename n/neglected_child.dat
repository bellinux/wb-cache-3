25|$|In all children, {{maternal}} care {{is one of}} {{the significant}} influences for hippocampal development, providing the foundation for stable and individualized learning and memory. However, {{this is not the case}} for those who have experienced child neglect. Researchers determined that through environmental enrichment, a <b>neglected</b> <b>child</b> can partially receive the same hippocampal development and stability, albeit not at the same level as that of the presence of a parent or guardian. The results were comparable to those of child intervention programs, rendering environmental enrichment a useful method for dealing with child neglect.|$|E
500|$|The plot {{revolves}} around a dysfunctional family, comprising a father, a mother, their daughter and the father's mother. The story begins with two lovers, whose relationship is running dry. They decide {{to have a}} child, which the woman believes may save their relationship ("Between Love and Fire"). The birth of a baby girl destroys in the mother her hopes for a brilliant professional career and smothers her passion. On the other hand, the newborn child causes in the father a stiffening of his feelings and the refusal to compromise his career for a [...] "spoilt brat" [...] ("Sins of Idealism"). The girl, perceived in the family as an unwanted burden, tries {{to adapt to the}} psychological abuse she receives, but she is the object of frequent quarrels and grows sad and depressed ("Beautiful Emptiness"). She searches for quietness and strength in her inner fantasy world, and friendship and love on the internet, becoming ever more detached from the real world and eccentric in the eyes of her schoolmates and parents ("Eccentric", [...] "Digital Deceit", [...] "Through Square Eyes"). The line of pain that connects the child to her parents appears indestructible and the situation gets worse when the father thinks of leaving ("Blind Pain", [...] "Two Sides"). The intervention of the girl's grandmother reveals that the father was himself a <b>neglected</b> <b>child</b> and a victim of his family ("Victim of Choices"). The father's anger is a reaction to his abuse as a child and this realization seems to soften the girl's pain, bringing her out of her defensive shell ("Reflections"). In conclusion, the grown-up daughter, now a mother herself, faces the same dilemmas of her parents and is bound to repeat her parents' mistakes, closing the invisible circle that endures from one generation to another ("Life's Vortex").|$|E
2500|$|S. J. Suryaah's thriller Vaali, which portrayed him in dual {{roles for}} the first time {{opposite}} Simran, became one of his biggest hits during that time. The film told the story of a deaf and mute brother setting his eyes on his younger brother's wife, with Ajith's portrayal of the two brothers winning him his first of many awards for Filmfare's Best Actor. Furthermore, Ajith's portrayal of the brothers was also praised, with critics claiming that the film was an [...] "instant classic", with Ajith showing that he is a [...] "talented actor". The two following supporting roles in the drama films Anandha Poongatre and Nee Varuvai Ena also brought Ajith plaudits for his portrayals. His final film before the new millennium was Amarkalam, directed by Saran and featuring Shalini, whom he married shortly after the film. Amarkalam told the story of a <b>neglected</b> <b>child</b> who grew up and failed to show feelings of love or affection, becoming a gangster in the process, with Ajith's depiction of his rogue character appreciated by critics.|$|E

40|$|This study (a) {{assessed}} whether <b>child</b> <b>neglect</b> {{is associated}} with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative symptoms in the preschool period and (b) examined the role of quality of mother–child affective communication {{in the development of}} trauma-related symptoms among <b>neglected</b> <b>children.</b> Participants were 33 neglected and 72 non-neglected preschoolers (mean age 60 months). <b>Neglected</b> <b>children</b> were recruited from the <b>Child</b> Protection Agencies. <b>Neglected</b> and non-neglected <b>children</b> victims of other form of abuse were excluded from the study. Trauma symptoms were evaluated through mother and preschool teacher reports. Quality of mother–child affective communication was assessed in a lab visit during an unstructured task. Accord-ing to teachers, <b>neglected</b> <b>children</b> displayed more PTSD and dissociative symptoms than non-neglected children. Quality of mother–child communication was lower in neglected dyads.

60|$|As I saw {{into the}} desolation of my father's heart, I felt a {{movement}} of deep pity towards him, which {{was the beginning of}} a new affection--an affection that grew and strengthened in spite of the strange bitterness with which he regarded me in the first month or two after my brother's death. If it had not been for the softening influence of my compassion for him--the first deep compassion I had ever felt--I should have been stung by the perception that my father transferred the inheritance of an eldest son to me with a mortified sense that fate had compelled him to the unwelcome course of caring for me as an important being. It was only in spite of himself that he began to think of me with anxious regard. There is hardly any <b>neglected</b> <b>child</b> for whom death has made vacant a more favoured place, who will not understand what I mean.|$|E

It was the old lesson, of the Eternal and Universal Father, who has not left Himself without witness in that He gives us all rain from Heaven, &c., and of our ingratitude, and His love; of His coming down to point out the way of life, and of His Death and Rising again; of another world, Resurrection, and Judgment. All interrupted, now and then, by exclamations of surprise, laughter, or by some one beginning to talk about something that jarred sadly on one's ear, and yet was but natural. But I do hope that a week may pass not unprofitably. In one sense, I shall no doubt be glad when it is over; but I think that it may, by God's great goodness, be a preparation for something more to come.|$|E

For the moment she forgot the majesty of Mrs Chick, and, patting Florence hastily on the cheek, turned aside and suffered the tears to gush from her eyes, without waiting for a lead from that wise matron.|$|E
40|$|<b>Child</b> <b>neglect</b> is a parent's {{failure to}} respond to his child's {{fundamental}} needs. In this context, language development is particularly vulnerable as it depends on frequent and sensitive parent-child interactions. After having established the prevalence of language delays among <b>neglected</b> <b>children,</b> this study aims to compare dimensions of parent-child interactions in neglectful and non-neglectful dyads and to identify interactional dimensions associated with the language skills of <b>neglected</b> <b>children.</b> Fifteen <b>neglected</b> and 61 nonneglected children aged 3. 5 years and their parents participated in the study. Results show that <b>neglected</b> <b>children</b> present significant delays in all language measures. Neglectful parents displayed less responsiveness and less positive affect toward their child than nonneglectful parents. Clinical and research implications conclude this paper...|$|R

All her affection was centred on the strong and manly son, of {{whom she was}} proud, while the sickly pining girl, who would hardly find a mate of her own rank, and who had not even dowry enough for a convent, was such a shame and burthen to her as to be almost a distasteful object. But perversely, as it seemed to her, the only daughter was the darling of both father and brother, who were ready {{to do anything to}} gratify the girl's sick fancies, and hailed with delight her pleasure in her new attendant. Old Ursel was at first rather envious and contemptuous of the childish, fragile stranger, but her gentleness disarmed the old woman; and, when it was plain that the young lady's sufferings were greatly lessened by tender care, dislike gave way to attachment, and there was little more murmuring at the menial services that were needed by the two maidens, even when Ermentrude's feeble fancies, or Christina's views of dainty propriety, rendered them more onerous than before.
