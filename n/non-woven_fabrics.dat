30|$|This study {{carried out}} on the three {{different}} varieties of banana fiber to give insights about comparative analysis of <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> Shrimanti fibre nonwoven fabric is stronger than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi fibre nonwoven fabric for both the P.L. and C.L. structure. Banana fibre, C.L. nonwoven fabric shows superior tensile properties as compared to P.L. nonwoven fabric. P.L. Mahalaxmi banana nonwoven fabric and C.L. Graint Naine banana nonwoven fabric gives higher elongation% for machine and cross direction. Increased air permeability of C.L.

Graint Naine <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed higher air permeability than Shrimanti and Mahalaxmi P.L. <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> Shrimanti C.L. (60 : 40) banana/polypropylene <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed higher air permeability than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi C.L. <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> Bursting strength of P.L. nonwoven fabric is higher, both in the machine as well as in cross direction than C.L. nonwoven fabric for three varieties of banana fibres. Shrimanti banana <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed higher bursting strength for P.L. and C.L. structure than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi P.L. and C.L. structure.

5000|$|The cloth {{component}} is most commonly a cotton gauze textile, but the grade and quality can vary greatly. Typical gauze specifications are in weaves of between 29 (commodity) to 44 or more (commercial/professional) yarns per square inch, with the cloth weights, wiping properties and overall cost varying accordingly. Gauze may be bleached and scoured (like medical quality) or unbleached quality that contains more contaminants. A standard {{size of the}} cotton gauze varieties is 18 in. &times; 36 in. in North America (other standards are found in other countries, such as 50 cm &times; 80 cm).

50|$|Given the town’s central location, many {{markets were}} held in Kusel even {{as far back as}} the Middle Ages, {{although}} these often had to put up with stiff competition from other traditional markets in other nearby places. The town’s economic life in the late 18th century was characterized by many small craftsmen’s workshops. There were wool and linen weavers, doublet and hose knitters, clothmakers and hatters as well as walking mills and gristmills, tanneries and several breweries. At the same time, dealers travelling overland from the town did a brisk trade with these products. In the age of industrialization, few of these craftsmen managed to expand their workshops or to switch to new, effective production methods. Thus, many small craft businesses had to cease work, and production was soon concentrated in a few bigger companies. Establishing themselves as such were a few businesses in textile manufacturing. In 1857, the Fink Brothers (their name is actually German for “Finch”) opened a cloth factory on Trierer Straße that had what were then state-of-the-art looms. This factory burnt down in 1865 and was never restored. Besides the Fink Brothers’ factory, two other great textile mills set up shop in Kusel, the Zöllner plant and the Ehrenspeck plant. At the former, it was mostly durable material that was made, for work clothes, such as tirtey (“midweight woollen fabric in twill weave, with a combination of carded woollen yarns in the weft and cotton yarns in the warp. Mostly used for work trousers.”) and buckskin cloth (not leather, but rather a “thick, smooth cotton or woollen fabric”). In 1885 the Zöllner plant, too, burnt down, but unlike the Fink Brothers’ factory, it rose from the ashes and in the years before the First World War, it even underwent an important expansion. It ﬂourished until about 1930, when the Great Depression set in. It was then taken over by Karl Hermann and run until 1958 as the Westpfälzische Tuchfabrik (“West Palatine Cloth Factory”). The Ehrenspeck plant arose from a craft business. It was built on Trierer Straße in 1867. Here, ﬁne knitted wares were made, but this plant, too, burnt down, in 1928. Later, in a portion of the plant, vigogne spinning was temporarily done (this fabric is made of natural, sometimes along with artiﬁcial, ﬁbres in imitation of vicuña wool). Moving into the factory after the Second World War was the Tuchfabrik Kahnes, which specializes in making synthetic <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> About 1960, the factory was moved to Haschbacher Straße. The Kahnes Cloth Factory is the only such factory that is still in business in Kusel. Besides the textile works, there were the Schleip nail factory and the Christian Gilcher machine factory in Kusel, both of which are now gone. From the several small breweries originally in town, two grew into major businesses, Koch and Emrich. Koch merged in 1972 with the Bayerische Brauerei in Kaiserslautern, and afterwards was closed. After the building was torn down, a great vacant lot was left, which later saw only minor building (an underground parking garage and the Café Rothenturm). The Emrich Brewery continued as a private brewing company until 1998, when it, too, was closed. A major production business in Kusel today is the high-speed printing machine factory, a subsidiary of Albert in Frankenthal. A computer industry production facility has also located in Kusel, the ﬁrm Owen Electronics, as has an important software business, Transware, inpremises formerly occupied by the cloth factory. The town’s economic life is otherwise represented foremost by supermarkets and retail businesses, which are housed in an industrial park beside Bundesstraße 420 between Kusel and Rammelsbach.|$|E

30|$|Global {{trend towards}} {{sustainable}} developments have brought natural, renewable biodegradable raw material into the focus, {{but due to}} lack of technical knowhow, {{only a small fraction of}} these non-conventional fibres are harvested and utilized. In this study we have developed parallel laid 100 % banana nonwoven fabric and cross laid banana/polypropylene (60 : 40) nonwoven fabric. Three varieties of banana fibers namely Mahalaxmi, Shrimanti and Graint Naine were used for needle punched <b>non-woven</b> <b>fabric</b> preparations. Analysis of physical properties is carried out in machine direction and cross direction. This paper concludes that cross laid nonwoven fabric show superior tensile properties as compared to parallel laid nonwoven fabric. Shrimanti fibre nonwoven fabric is stronger than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi fibre nonwoven fabric for both the parallel laid and cross laid structure. Parallel laid Mahalaxmi banana nonwoven fabric and cross laid Graint Naine banana nonwoven fabric gives higher elongation% for machine and cross direction.
