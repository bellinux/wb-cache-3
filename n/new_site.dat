5|$|After the {{accidental}} release, another radiological survey was performed, {{and the state}} government concluded that PermaGrain needed to be relocated. The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a <b>new</b> <b>site</b> for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the <b>new</b> <b>site,</b> the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E

In 1948, Bradbury submitted a proposal to the Atomic Energy Commission for a new $107 million facility on the South Mesa, linked to the town by a new bridge over the canyon.|$|E

5|$|The club's dilemma was acute: the FA {{no longer}} {{approved}} of large crowds at The Nest, {{but the new}} season was just weeks away. About half a mile south of The Nest, they found a <b>new</b> <b>site,</b> the Boulton Paul Sports Ground in Carrow Road, which belonged to J. & J. Colman.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} site of {{the town}} was to the south, in an area still known as Oldchurch.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown clear, {{predictable}} successional trends in habitat characteristics and community structure in tubeworm aggregations at 3 similar hydrocarbon-seep sites on the central upper Louisiana slope of the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, we examine these trends in quantitative community collections from 7 additional hydrocarbon-seep sites widely distributed in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The relative proportions and sizes of Lamellibrachia luymesi and Seepiophila jonesi in tubeworm aggregations were similar at <b>new</b> and central <b>sites,</b> though S. jonesi dominated some collections from <b>new</b> <b>sites,</b> a situation not previously observed at central sites. In general, sulfide declined with increasing aggregation age (average size of tubeworms), {{but there was more}} variability in this trend at the <b>new</b> <b>sites.</b> Tubeworm-associated community composition was similar at <b>new</b> and central <b>sites,</b> with only a few rare species collected at the <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> for the first time. The most significant differences in the communities at <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> were the lower relative abundance of various gastropod species, and the absence of gastropods from collections made at the Viosca Knoll site. This community type was largely restricted to young aggregations at <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> that were more isolated from other tubeworm aggregations and consisted of higher proportions of S. jonesi. As succession proceeds from young to old aggregations, many of the previously described processes were apparent at the <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> including a reduction in biomass and a shift in trophic structure from endemic primary consumers to non-endemic higher order predators. Regardless of community composition in young aggregations, succession converges on similar late-stage community types...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a <b>new</b> <b>site</b> in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

The <b>new</b> <b>site</b> {{was less than}} ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe.

A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A <b>new</b> <b>site</b> was constructed 30 miles to the east in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century several {{attempts}} were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings's public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings's grave, but each attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a <b>new</b> <b>site</b> at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{reconstruction}} {{methods were}} applied to electron micrographs of Streptococcus faecium to study the initiation of cell wall growth sites during a nutritional shift experiment. Upon lowering the mass doubling time from 76 to 33 min {{by the addition of}} excess glutamate, the formation of new cell wall growth sites accelerated above the old steady-state rate {{at about the same time}} (10 to 15 min) as did mass, RNA, protein, cell numbers, and autolytic capacity but considerably before DNA (30 min) and peptidoglycan (20 min) synthesis did. During the shift, the average range of cell volumes over which <b>new</b> wall growth <b>sites</b> were introduced did not change significantly. However, upon the shift there was an increase in the frequency of cells having <b>new</b> <b>sites,</b> which was due to the faster-growing cells initiating more <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> in peripheral locations before division. After a transition period, the number of <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> per milliliter of culture increased at a rate that paralleled that of the culture mass. These findings support a model in which <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> are introduced when cells grow to a relatively constant, growth rate-independent size, while the rate at which sites form and grow increases with the growth rate. In this model, chromosome synthesis does not regulate the formation of <b>new</b> <b>sites</b> of cell wall growth, but existing sites cannot be completed until rounds of chromosome synthesis are completed...|$|R
