5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Keli {{was first}} noted as a depression, to the {{northeast}} of the New Zealand territory of Tokelau during June 7, 1997. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system moved towards the south-west and gradually developed further, with the United States Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC) issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system during June 9.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, the JTWC {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about 1145km (710mi) {{to the northwest}} of Suva, Fiji. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further {{in an area of}} low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, the system started to move towards the south-southeast.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji. It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{at the start}} of December 1992, as a shallow tropical depression {{in the vicinity of the}} island nation Tuvalu. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the Fijian Islands during December 10. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system moved through the Fijian Islands, before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13. The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|A small, westward moving area of {{thunderstorm}} activity {{become the}} 17th cyclone of the season. Turning southwest between an upper-level high over Baja California {{and a low}} near the southern coast of Mexico, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Pauline. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> the cyclone turned west, and then west-northwest. Slowly strengthening despite underneath warm waters, Pauline attained hurricane intensity on September 7. Subsequently, Pauline turned towards the south. After peaking in intensity as a moderate Category 1 hurricane, the system crossed into the CPHC's area of responsibility.|$|R

5|$|On December 30, TCWC Nadi {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed about 860km (535mi), to the northeast of Pago Pago in American Samoa. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system moved towards the south-southeast and gradually developed further, before the NPMOC designated the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P. During January 1, TCWC Nadi {{reported that}} the depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it William as it passed near the Cook Island of Autitaki. During the next day William subsequently slowly accelerated as it passed near too or over several other Cook Islands and intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone. Early on January 3, TCWC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak 10-minute wind speeds of 110km/h (70mph) as it passed near or over the French Polynesian islands of Maria and Rimatara.|$|E

Nevertheless, they entered the fixture with better results than Oxford, who had lost six of their seven matches. Woods proved one of the deciding factors, claiming eleven wickets in the match, of which seven were bowled, and two were in combination with wicket-keeper Gregor MacGregor. Cambridge opening batsman Henry Mordaunt scored 127 in the match, and they secured an innings victory, requiring just two of the three allocated days.|$|R
5|$|After {{an attack}} across the Ilebbe Creek by the 2/13th Infantry Battalion, which cost the Australians 80casualties on 1 October, the Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw. On 2 October, the town {{fell to the}} Australians and the Japanese {{abandoned}} the Kakakog Ridge amidst heavy Australian air and artillery attacks. Once the 20th Brigade was established in Finschhafen, it linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion. This unit had cleared the coastal area {{in the south of}} the peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. Meanwhile, the Japanese that had been around Finschhafen withdrew back into the mountains around Sattelberg. Allied air operations from the airfield at Finschhafen commenced on 4 October. The following day, the 2/17th Infantry Battalion was sent to Kumawa to follow up the retreating Japanese forces, and for the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> minor clashes resulted before it established itself at Jivevaneng again on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|Hours before {{striking}} the Philippines on November4, both agencies reported Thelma {{to have reached}} its peak intensity. The JTWC estimated the storm to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) while the JMA estimated ten-minute sustained winds at 75km/h (45mph). Additionally, its barometric pressure reached 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg). Thelma soon made landfall in Samar before weakening to a minimal tropical storm. Maintaining gale-force winds, the system eventually passed over Palawan Island on November6 before moving over the South China Sea. Despite being back over water, strong wind shear prevented re-intensification and caused Thelma to weaken to a tropical depression by November7. Now moving westward, the depression eventually made its final landfall over the Mekong River Delta in Southern Vietnam on November8. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system weakened into an {{area of low pressure}} as it moved westwards, before it moved into the Andaman Sea during November 10.

Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate Helderenberg. The next day, 40 cavalry and 400foot soldiers, under the command of Lord Grey and Wade, moved on to the nearby town of Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia. The skirmish ended with the retreat of Grey and the cavalry followed by Wade with the foot soldiers. Many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth's army. Following this confrontation, Lord Albermarle led a royalist force from Exeter towards the forces of the Duke of Somerset, who were approaching Lyme Regis from the opposite direction.|$|E

Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system intensified further and developed an eye feature as it erratically moved towards Fiji. Sina subsequently peaked in intensity during November 26, before the system passed through the Fijian Islands over the next two days as it started to gradually weaken. Sina subsequently passed just to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga during November 29, before it passed about 160km (100mi) to the south of Niue and near the Southern Cook Islands during the next day. The system subsequently rapidly weakened and became an extratropical cyclone during December 1, before they were absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50°S on December 4.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Wasa–Arthur was {{the first}} major {{tropical}} cyclone to affect French Polynesia and Tahiti since the 1982–83 season.

Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system gradually developed further, before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Wasa during December 5. The system gradually strengthened further and acquired hurricane-force winds on December 6, as it performed a small clockwise loop. After completing the loop, Wasa moved southwards before it peaked in intensity during December 8, with sustained wind speeds of 165km/h (105mph). Over the next few days the system started to weaken as it passed through the French Polynesian Society Islands, and became the first major tropical cyclone to affect French Polynesia since 1983.|$|E
5|$|The remnant trough {{proceeded}} northwestward {{into the}} Bahamas, where the NHC assessed a high chance of redevelopment based on relenting upper wind shear. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> it moved over the Bahamas and proceeded east of southern Florida. Late on August6, the trough {{developed a new}} center of circulation and regenerated into a weak tropical depression by 1800UTC near Grand Bahama. Emily briefly reattained tropical storm strength six hours later, although it once again dissipated to a remnant low the next day owing to increasing wind shear. The low took on an accelerated east-northeastward motion, bypassing Bermuda before heading eastward over the open Atlantic. It briefly retained a broad area of gale-force winds with deep convection, which prompted the NHC to remonitor the system. The combination of strong wind shear and its rapid forward speed inhibited significant development, and the remnant dissipated around 1200UTC on August11, about 980mi (1,565km) west of the Azores.|$|E

The next day cyclone Gene started to temporarily weaken again by becoming a category two cyclone with winds speeds of 95km/h (60mph 10 min). This came as cyclone Gene approached 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility, {{to the south of}} 25°S the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand, monitors tropical cyclones, south of 25°S. As Gene crossed in to TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, Cyclone Gene started to re-intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120km/h (105mph 10 min) however this re-intensification only lasted for 12 hours before Gene began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day. Gene slowly weakened over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> as it moved towards the south east. The JTWC then issued its final warning on February 6 as Cyclone Gene was finishing its extratropical transition, and had also become fully embedded within the baroclinic zone.

Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> the depression continued to move southeast towards Fiji and gradually developed further. On December 15, the NPMOC initiated advisories on the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P, while it was located about 110km (70mi) to the northeast of Labasa, Fiji. Later that day, the NPMOC reported that the system had become a tropical storm and reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 65km/h (40mph), as it affected several Fijian islands including Vanua Levu and Thikombia. During December 16, the cyclone continued to move towards the southeast and started to affect Tonga before the NPMOC issued their final warning on the system as it had weakened into a tropical depression. During the next day, the depression moved into TCWC Wellingtons area of responsibility and was subsequently declared extratropical.|$|E

Six hours later, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had peaked as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 165km/h (105mph). Later on March 27, Severe Tropical Cyclone Beti made landfall on the Grande Terre island of New Caledonia near its peak intensity and quickly weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone. During the next day, Beti moved towards the southeast {{under the influence of}} the trough, reemerging into the Coral Sea as a weakening tropical cyclone that had started to transition into an extratropical cyclone.

5|$|During {{the advance}} on Finschhafen, a company from the 2/17th Battalion, {{which had been}} tasked with {{securing}} the beachhead and the flank, {{had been sent to}} Sattelberg but had been unable to occupy it due to the strength of the Japanese force already there. As captured orders had revealed Japanese plans to breakthrough to the coast, it was decided to place the company into a blocking position east of Sattelberg along the coast road around Jivevaneng. In this position, from 25 September onwards they were subjected to a number of attacks as they attempted to deflect attacks by the Japanese 3rd Battalion, 80th Infantry Regiment, which were aimed at breaking through to Heldsbach Plantation, directly south of the beachhead at Siki Cove. On 30 September the 2/17th were replaced by a company from the 2/43rd Battalion, and over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> a whole battalion of Japanese surrounded the position and attacked it eight times. Four attempts by the Australians to relieve the company failed, before an attack on Kumawa by the 2/17th Battalion on 5 October cut the Japanese supply lines and provoked a strong counterattack, which subsequently drew pressure off the beleaguered company, and enabled it to be relieved on 7 October. As the threat of Japanese counterattack grew, the 24th Brigade landed at Langemak Bay on 10 October to reinforce the 20th Brigade. The following day, Wootten was able to establish his divisional headquarters at Finschhafen, and preparations began for the Australians to attack the Japanese force around Sattelberg.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} day the system moved north-westwards and {{gradually}} developed further, before the JMA reported that the system had developed into a tropical storm and named it Bavi during March 11. Later that day as the system's low level circulation centre continued to consolidated and deep convection wrapped into it, the JTWC initiated advisories and designated the system as 03W. The system subsequently continued to gradually intensify as it moved westwards, around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge of high pressure located to the northwest of the system. During March 14, the system peaked as a tropical storm with the JMA reporting 10-minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph), while the JTWC reported 1-minute sustained winds of 95km/h (60mph). By this time the system was approaching the Mariana islands and had started to weaken, with system's low level circulation becoming partially exposed and displaced from the atmospheric convection. As a result of this the system's low level circulation passed over Guam during March 15, while convection associated with the system passed over the Northern Mariana islands. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> the system moved westwards and continued to weaken, before it weakened into a tropical depression during March 17, as it moved into the Philippine area of responsibility where it was named Betty by PAGASA. The JTWC stopped monitoring Bavi during March 19, after the system had weakened into a tropical disturbance, however, the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression, until it dissipated within the Philippines, during March 21.|$|E
