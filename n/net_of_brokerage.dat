40|$|We {{make use}} of a large sample of transaction-level {{institutional}} trading data to test an extended version of Brennan and Hughes' (1991) information production theory of stock splits. We compare brokerage commissions paid by institutional investors before and after a split, assess the private information held by them, and relate the informativeness of their trading to brokerage commissions paid. We show that institutions make abnormal profits <b>net</b> <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> commissions by trading in splitting stocks. We also show that the information asymmetry faced by firms goes down after stock splits. Overall, our empirical results support the information production theory.

40|$|Multiple {{informed}} {{traders and}} noise traders pay fees to trade through multiple brokers. Brokers may trade with their {{customers in the}} same transaction (simultaneous dual trading) or trade after their customers in a separate transaction (consecutive dual trading). Brokers' expected profits from fees and trading, <b>net</b> <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> costs, are zero and so brokers are indifferent between simultaneous and consecutive dual trading. Market depth and price informativeness are higher with consecutive dual trading, compared to both simultaneous dual trading and the no-dual-trading benchmark. If the number of brokers exceeds the number of informed traders, then both noise traders and informed traders prefer consecutive dual trading. If the number of brokers {{is less than the}} number of informed traders, however, net informed profits and net uninformed losses may be higher with simultaneous dual trading in markets with many brokers; net informed profits and net uninformed losses are higher with consecutive dual trading in markets with relatively few brokers. We use our model to study order flow internalization by broker-dealers. Finally, we interpret brokers as "follow-on traders" whose trading is derived from the order flows of preceding traders. With this broader definition, we (1) explain certain puzzling empirical results related to the effect of insider trading on non-insider trading volume and market liquidity; and (2) discuss large block sales conducted off the exchange floor by insiders to avoid "follow-on" trading.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the effects <b>of</b> real estate <b>brokerage</b> services provided to sellers, other than MLS listings, on {{the terms and}} timing of home sales. It is not obvious that sellers benefit from those services. On the one hand, brokers offer potentially useful knowledge and expertise. On the other hand, because {{the relationship between the}} homeowner and the broker resembles a classical principal-agent problem, the broker may not deploy services in ways that promote the seller’s interests. Yet as long as valuable MLS listings are bundled with brokerage services, homeowners may use brokers even if the agency costs exceed the benefits of brokers’ knowledge and expertise. Thus, quantification <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> value <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> services other than MLS listings bears directly on the recent policy debate over the desirability unbundling of MLS listings. We estimate the effect of a seller’s decision to use a broker on list prices, selling prices, and speed of sale for a real estate market with an unusual and critical characteristic: it has a single open-access listing service that is used by essentially all sellers, regardless of whether they employ brokers. Our central finding is that, when listings are not tied to brokerage services, a seller’s use of a broker reduces the selling price of the typical home by 5. 9 to 7. 7 percent, which indicates that agency costs exceed the advantages of brokers’ knowledge and expertise by a wide margin. ...|$|R

40|$|ArticleGould and Fernandez (1989) {{developed}} a widely used operationalization <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> for one-mode networks. The basic idea <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> {{is that the}} central actor or ‘broker’ benefits from spanning the gap (or structural hole) between two disconnected parties. However, {{it is not always}} advantageous to limit the systems studied to only one mode. We develop an operationalization <b>of</b> two-mode <b>brokerage</b> in which we can classify the structures according to the heterogeneity of the types of actors involved. We apply this conception to water policy networks in the San Joaquin–Sacramento River Delta in California where two-mode networks represent organizations participating in multiple policy institutions. The potential benefits <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> are high in these types of fragmented systems where multiple institutions and organizations are involved with policy decisions. Of particular interest is the role of collaborative partnership institutions, which are hypothesized to broker the most heterogeneous structures. We use our two-mode version <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> to construct a scale <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> from most homogeneous to most heterogeneous. This scale lets us categorize both the role of these collaborative partnerships as well as the nature <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> in the system overall.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the functioning of}} the market for brokerage services for residential real estate. The central issue addressed is whether the manner in which brokerage services have traditionally been provided and priced is consistent with efficiency. In approaching this question, the paper first describes the activities usually associated with the brokerage function and develops criteria for the efficient provision <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> services. After the structural characterisitcs and pricing practices <b>of</b> the <b>brokerage</b> industry are analyzed, a model <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> firm competition is developed. The principal finding is that the traditional absence of price competition among brokers may have led to an inefficiently large commitment of resources to the brokerage industry, supported by excessive rates for consumers <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> services. These results stem from the way that competitive pressures emerge when price competition is largely suppressed. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R

Using a subnetwork consisting of a broker and its two partners as the unit of analysis, we postulate that the brokerage position disappears either when the two partners develop ties or when the ties between the broker and the partners dissolve. We predict that the patterns of interactions in which this subnetwork is embedded exert multilevel influences on the disappearance, and that embedded structures promoting persistence constrain brokerage advantages.

40|$|This {{research}} focusses on {{the influence}} of institutions on organizational performance via network structure. Two meta-hypotheses are tested: (1) institutions influence network structures and (2) network structures influence organizational performance. By applying the idea of institutions and organizations to the Open Source (OS) community, it is expected that restrictiveness of licenses influence the network structure of OS projects, and network structure influences process- and outcome-based performance of OS projects. Empirical analyses are performed using the SourceForge database, a compilation of more than 30, 000 active OS projects. The theories of Burt (2000, 2005) and Coleman (1990) are used in explaining the influence <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> and closure as indicators of network structure. Findings show that restrictiveness of licenses is a negative predictor of both levels <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> and closure. Furthermore, levels <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> predict higher levels of both process-based and outcome-based performance. Levels of closure show no distinct pattern in explaining performance of OS projects. Higher levels of process-based performance are an indicator of higher overall performance outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} {{on the impact of}} electronic trading on brokerage commissions by investigating a sample period that covers the period of transition from floor to electronic trading on the Sydney Futures Exchange. After controlling for liquidity, volatility and broker identity, the introduction of electronic trading remains to be associated with lower brokerage commissions relative to floor markets. The study also provides new evidence on brokerage commissions in futures markets finding that commission fees charged on futures trades average 0. 002 % of transaction value. This is up to 120 times smaller than the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> fees charged in stock markets, and considerably lower than the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> fees assumed for futures markets in previous research. Consistent with existing studies based on stock markets, commissions charged per contract decrease with order size reflecting economies of scale in the provision <b>of</b> <b>brokerage</b> services in futures markets. Commission rates are positively related to bid-ask spreads and price volatility, which proxy for the probability of execution error costs and execution difficulty, respectively. Finally, the identity of the broker is found to be a significant determinant of commissions reflecting different pricing schedules across brokers. 15 page(s...|$|R

The question of whether domestic investors have better information than foreign investors is increasingly controversial. There are arguments that support both sides of the issue. One argument is that domestic investors have an advantage because information does not have to travel over physical, linguistic, or cultural distances. Conversely, foreign investors may have an information advantage because they have a significant amount of investment experience and expertise. Formal empirical evidence on this issue is also mixed.
