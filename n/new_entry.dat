5|$|First {{hinted at}} in December 1999, Resident Evil 4 {{underwent}} a long development {{time during which}} four proposed versions of the game were discarded. Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him to create a <b>new</b> <b>entry</b> in the Resident Evil series. Nevertheless, {{it was decided to}} start development over again. The game was intended to be a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but a PlayStation 2 version was announced before the game was released for the GameCube. Resident Evil 4 was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and in downsized versions for iOS, Zeebo, and Android (exclusive to Samsung devices outside of Japan).|$|E

From the outset, {{they had decided to}} set the <b>new</b> <b>entry</b> in the land of Skyrim, incorporating dragons into the main theme of the game. Full development begun following the release of Fallout 3 in 2008; the developers considered Skyrim a spiritual successor to both Fallout 3 and previous The Elder Scrolls games. The game was developed by a team of roughly 100 people composed of new talent {{as well as of the}} series' veterans. The production was supervised by Todd Howard, who was the director of several titles released by Bethesda Softworks.|$|E

5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a <b>new</b> <b>entry</b> in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title {{was developed by}} Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E
40|$|Using establishment-level data in Japan, {{we examine}} the effects of <b>new</b> {{business}} <b>entries</b> on the probability of incumbents exiting the market. In particular, we estimate how the effects vary {{depending on the size of}} both the entrants and incumbents, which has not been explored in the literature. We find that while <b>new</b> business <b>entries</b> increase the probability that incumbents will exit, the effect differs significantly across sectors and depends on entrant and incumbent size. Although small establishments are the most likely to be driven out by <b>new</b> <b>entries</b> in all sectors, large incumbents are not always the most competitive, and, in the case of the tradable services sector, medium-sized establishments are the least likely to be affected by <b>new</b> <b>entries.</b> Moreover, our simple regression analysis shows a positive relationship between entry rates and employment growth in a region. <b>New</b> <b>entries</b> may promote resource reallocation and stimulate regional economies, possibly resulting in regional employment growth...|$|R

5|$|Nier was {{the last}} game that Cavia made; the company was absorbed into its parent company, AQ Interactive, in July 2010. In March 2011, there were plans made between Yoko and Takuya Iwasaki, one of the {{original}} producers for Drakengard, to develop a port of Nier for the PlayStation Vita at Iwasaki's company Orca. The port would have incorporated material from both versions of the game. When Orca was chosen to help develop Dragon Quest X, the project was shelved. A number of key staff from Niers development, including director Yoko and Okabe, would later reunite to work on a <b>new</b> <b>entry</b> (Drakengard 3) in the Drakengard series from which Nier was spun off. A sequel titled , developed by Square Enix and PlatinumGames for the PlayStation 4, was released in Japan on February 23, in North America on March 7 and worldwide on March 10, 2017. The PC version of Nier: Automata was released on March 17, 2017. Yoko, Saito and Okabe returned to their previous roles. Other staff members include producer Atsushi Inaba and artist Akihiko Yoshida.|$|E
5|$|The game's story follows Neku {{over the}} course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with {{partners}} Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died or how he arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners, he starts to understand the rules of the Game. After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to the living, and she promises to meet Neku at the statue of Hachiko. He also recovers his entry fee, which was his memories, except for the events leading up to his death. However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his <b>new</b> <b>entry</b> fee for the second week. During the second week he recalls small details of his death; eventually, he recognizes that he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from an explosion created by Minamimoto.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} {{title in}} the series, Fire Emblem Awakening, was planned {{to be the last}} in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a <b>new</b> <b>entry.</b> Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of Awakening returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed Awakening assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, Fates was given the working title Fire Emblem 3DS II. The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{the brainchild}} of Square Enix {{producer}} Masaru Oyamada, who had {{made a name for himself}} within the company working in its mobile division on mobile ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana. Speaking with series producer Koichi Ishii, Oyamada said that he could create an original mobile title that would be a legitimate entry in the series. Instead of a social or card-based game, which were the most prevalent genres in mobile gaming at the time, Oyamada wanted to create an action role-playing game that was accessible to a large number of casual gamers, something which would worry him throughout its production. The main staff were made up of Oyamada, director Masato Yagi, and art director Hiroyuki Suzuki. Hiroyuki had previously only worked on the Final Fantasy series. After the initial release of Rise of Mana, Yagi was responsible for the main scenario alongside Oyamada and post-launch content producer Naofumi Takuma. Oyamada also initially tried to bring Chaos Rings producer Takehiro Ando on board, but Ando would have nothing to do with the project. Development began in July 2012. The game was constructed using the Unity engine. In addition to staff from Square Enix, main development was done by Japanese developer Goshow, and its server security and technical assistance was handled by Fixer. The protagonists and some NPCs were designed by Japanese artist Taiki, while another artist Ryota Murayama handled NPC and monster designs. The game's key art was created by in-house designer Dairaku Masahiko: he was brought in after regular Mana key art illustrator Hiroo Isono died in 2013. Masahiko was asked by Oyamada to create something similar to Isono's previous artwork in creating a representation of pointillism. The game's title was indicative of the title's nature as a <b>new</b> <b>entry</b> in the Mana series; other than a small card-battle mobile game in 2013, Circle of Mana, Rise was the first Mana title since Heroes of Mana in 2007.|$|E
