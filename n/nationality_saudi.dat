Healthcare providers have a duty of a care to deliver holistic and culturally specific health care to their patients. As a consequence of 'duty of care' obligations, healthcare providers must facilitate culturally congruent care for patients of diverse cultural backgrounds. For the Saudi family considerable cultural clashes may arise when Saudi patients are hospitalized and receive care from healthcare professionals who do not understand Islamic principles and Saudi cultural beliefs and values. The healthcare workforce in Saudi Arabia is a unique multicultural workforce that is mix of Saudi and significant other <b>nationalities.</b> <b>Saudi</b> nurses for example represent only 36. 3 % of the workforce in the different health sectors.

40|$|The word {{menopause}} {{means the}} end of ovulation at about 45 - 50 years of age. There is {{a decline in the}} ability of the ovaries to respond to gonadotropic hormone from the pituitary. This leads to cessation of the ovulation and therefore cessation of menstrual cycle. As a result of this many changes may appear and go on for a variable length of time and cover a complex of symptoms and bodily changes. This study was carried out to investigate the common signs and symptoms experienced by women during menopause and to find out if there is any socio-cultural factors that affect the changes occurring during the menopause years. A sample of 400 women representing four Arab <b>nationalities,</b> <b>Saudi,</b> Egyptian, Lebanese and Palestine, each woman was interviewed for the following: Biosocial and Obstetric data, women’s knowledge about menopause and disorders experienced during menopause. The results show {{that the majority of the}} sample were housewives, married and having from five to ten pregnancies, and there were significant differences (p< 0. 05) between nationality and a variety of symptoms and disorders experienced by the four Arab groups, Saudi, Egyptian, Lebanese and Palestinian women. Saudi women experienced hot flushes, night sweat, arthritic disorders, headache, and insomnia most, while decline in sexual interest & weight gain were more common among Egyptian women and weight gain was also common in Palestinian women. Vaginal changes in color of skin were found to be more among Lebanese women. As regards the association of education to the prevalence of symptoms the study found that women lower level of education experienced more symptoms than those of higher education. These differences are statistically significant (p< 0. 05). The study shows that 30 % of the university graduates had complete knowledge about menopause compared to 10 % of the housewives but in general the whole sample tended to have low level of knowledge about menopause. It was found that occupation had no significant relation. The result of this study indicated the importance of information related to menopausal changes.

All the children were of <b>Saudi</b> <b>nationality</b> and in final year classes of preschool. All preschools were private, the socioeconomic status was homogeneous and from middle to upper class. The trait shyness of children was measured by means of a teachers' and parents' shyness checklist. Three measures were used to examine the language development of children: a standardized test of receptive vocabulary, a systematic measure of children's speech in two "Show and Tell" sessions, and observation of children's verbal behaviour during two free play sessions. Shy children obtained lower scores in the vocabulary test and they were more reticent in these two school settings. Teachers' shyness scores predicted children's verbal behaviour in "Show and Tell" and during free play sessions over and above any differences between shy and non-shy children in vocabulary test scores. Vocabulary scores did not mediate or moderate the relations between shyness and observed verbal behaviours in these sessions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The pattern and predictors of discharge AMA have not been studied in Saudi Arabian hospitals. Thus, we assessed the prevalence and predictors of discharge AMA in a major teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia. MethodsThis study was conducted at a university teaching hospital in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A case-control design and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess factors predicting discharge AMA from hospital discharge data between January 2007 and December 2009 from the departments of surgery, obstetrics, psychiatry and general medicine. ResultsOf 16175 discharges during the study period, 648 were AMA (4. 01 %). Younger age (OR, 1. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 11 – 1. 43), number of comorbid conditions (OR, 1. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 4 – 1. 8), short length of stay (OR, 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 03 – 1. 05), male gender (OR, 1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 4 – 2. 5) and Saudi national (OR, 2. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 6 – 3. 3) increased the odds for discharge AMA. Other factors associated with increased discharge AMA included admission to the psychiatry department and the holy feast of Eid Al-Adha.

Our objectives were to study teacher's {{knowledge and}} attitudes and identify areas in which further teacher training and education are required. MethodsA stratified random sample survey involving a group of primary school teachers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia included private/public schools designated for male and female students. A structured 37 -item questionnaire was used to examine their demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and experience with epilepsy. ResultsSix hundred and twenty primary school teachers working in public (58 %) or private (42 %) schools were included with ages ranging between 21 and 59 years (mean 36). Most teachers (79 %) were of <b>Saudi</b> Arabian <b>nationality</b> and 66 % had a college or university degree. Their years of experience ranged from 1 to 35 (mean 13. 5). Only 17 % of the teachers felt very well informed about epilepsy. Teachers with higher education {{were more likely to have}} good knowledge (p= 0. 009). Teachers of <b>Saudi</b> <b>nationality</b> were also more likely to report good knowledge, independent of their educational level (p= 0. 013).

40|$|Introduction: Work-related stress (WRS) is an {{insidious}} and persistent {{part of everyday}} life related to the response of people to work environment. Nursing is a strenuous job and WRS is prevalent among nurses. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of WRS among nurses working in primary and secondary health care levels in Dammam, Eastern Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in 17 primary health care centers (PHCCs) representing the primary level of health care and  Medical Tower Complex (MTC) representing the secondary health care level in Dammam city. The total number of nurses included in the study was 637 nurses (144 in PHCCs) and (493 MTC). Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire, which was developed based on the pertinent literature. It included two main parts: Sociodemographic and job characteristics of nurses and 31 WRS questions. Results: The overall prevalence of WRS among all studied nurses was 45. 5 %; 43. 1 % and 46. 2 % in primary and secondary levels, respectively. In the primary level, there was a statistical significant association between WRS and being married (85. 5 %), and having living three children and more (53. 2 %). Moreover, younger age group 20 -< 30 years (79. 4 %), <b>Saudi</b> <b>nationality</b> (86. 8 %), being married (74. 6 %), having nonbachelor degree (83. 3 %), work shifts (89. 5 %), and working in surgical department (46. 5 %) were the significant associating factors with the occurrence of WRS among nurses in secondary levels. Young age was the only predicting factor for WRS in primary care level. While being female, Saudi, married, with work shifts, and working in surgical department were found to predict WRS in the secondary level. Recommendations: Appropriate strategy in health care organization to investigate stress in health care settings is recommended. Moreover, interventional programs to identify, and relieve sources and effects of stress should be developed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diabetes {{imposes a}} large {{economic}} {{burden on the}} individual, national healthcare systems, and countries. Objective: To determine {{the economic impact of}} diabetes mellitus on Saudi healthcare system, both now and in the future. Materials and Methods: This research study uses a prevalence-based approach that combines the demographics of the population (classified by nationality, sex and age group) with and without diagnosed diabetes in 1992 and 2010. The economic impact of diabetes is estimated in this study, using secondary sources of information provided by Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance and Central Department of Statistics and Information databases. Results: People diagnosed with diabetes, on average, have medical healthcare expenditures that are ten times higher ($ 3, 686 vs. $ 380) than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes. Over 96 % of all medical healthcare expenditures attributed to diabetes are incurred by persons of <b>Saudi</b> <b>nationality,</b> with the remaining 4 % incurred by persons of non-Saudi nationality. The population age 45 - 60 incurs 45 % of diabetes-attributed costs, with the remaining population under age 15 incurs 3. 8 %, age 15 - 44 incurs 27. 5 %, and age 60 and above incurs 23. 8 %. Conclusion: The actual national healthcare burden because of diabetes is likely to exceed the $ 0. 87 billion estimated in this study, because it omits the indirect costs associated with diabetes, such as absenteeism, lost productivity from disease-related absenteeism, unemployment from disease-related disability, lost productivity due to early mortality by disease. The social cost of intangibles such as pain and suffering and care provided by non-paid caregivers as well as healthcare system administrative costs, cost of medications, clinician training programs, and research and infrastructure development is also omitted from this research study. Further studies are needed to confirm the present findings and to improve our understanding of economic costs of diabetes and its related complications...|$|R
40|$|Concern {{about privacy}} is an {{important}} consideration for users of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT), particularly when using computer-mediated communication (CMC), i. e. Internet usage. Several researchers have studied privacy issues by taking into account the views of users to include individuals, organisations, privacy policy makers, governments and trust organisations. This thesis investigates whether an individual’s perspectives about privacy are culturally relevant when using the Internet. This research used a survey {{in the form of a}} questionnaire in two countries, namely, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia to compare online privacy perspectives of young and mature (male and female) Saudi and Malaysian students. The research examines the relationship of the effect of the cultural background including the effect of social norms, religious belief, Internet regulation and IT skills of these Internet users upon their attitude towards privacy online and their perspectives about privacy. It also examines the effect of <b>nationality</b> (Malaysian and <b>Saudi),</b> gender and age groups. In this study, online privacy perspectives are a synthesis of three perceptions; what is ‘personal’ information online, the online privacy concerns and the Internet trust, whereby the cultural effects are the effect of religious beliefs, social norms, Internet regulation and IT skills in the privacy attitudes of keeping personal information safe, caring about their and others’ privacy online and when revealing personal information. The demographic factors in this research are nationality, gender and age. To study these relationships, the research uses t-test, ANOVA, and single regression methods as data analysis techniques. The results show that the level of concern and degree of trust exhibited by Malaysian students with regard to submitting personal information via the Internet was affected the most by their gender, and social norms upon their online privacy attitudes. For Saudi students, the level of concern and trust with regard to submitting personal information via the Internet was found to be related to the effect of their age, gender, and religious beliefs on their online privacy attitudes. The other cultural factors, i. e. Internet regulation in force in each country and the IT skills of participants, are likely to have equal effects on both Malaysian and Saudi privacy perspectives. This research adds the cultural background, age and gender effects to the model of the calculus of the privacy concern that is proposed by Dinev and Hart (2006, pp. 63 - 64). The research also establishes what is ‘private’ in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, by identifying “what counts as personal information with regard to Internet users” and provides a comparison in this concept between the two countries, their gender and age groups. For examples, Malaysian students consider name, e-mail address, date of birth, nationality and religion as ‘personal’ information and Saudi students consider home address, phone number, photographic image and credit card number as ‘personal’ information. In addition Saudi females tend to consider, particularly, home address, phone number, and photographic image as ‘personal’ information more than Saudi males. These findings should help both web designers and Internet policy makers in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia to consider these cultural effects when designing the privacy policies of their websites...|$|R
40|$|Saudi Arabia has {{undergone}} rapid {{social and economic}} change in recent years. As {{one of the largest}} employers in the country, these changes have {{had a significant impact on}} the healthcare sector, in particular on the nursing workforce. In the past, Saudi Arabia relied almost exclusively upon expatriate nurses to meet the healthcare needs of its growing population. However, an increase in the Saudi population, high levels of Saudi unemployment, and a desire to redress the country’s reliance on an expatriate workforce, led the Saudi government to implement a Saudisation program, an initiative to recruit, train and employ Saudi nationals throughout the workforce. As a result, approximately 50 % of nurses are now of <b>Saudi</b> <b>nationality.</b> This research is a mixed methods study. A quantitative study was undertaken to gain a description of the Saudi nursing workforce in Riyadh city; in particular their motivations, views of the profession and future plans. The initial aim of the quantitative study was to ascertain why high numbers of Saudi males were entering the nursing workforce in Saudi Arabia; however, female nurses were also surveyed in order to understand if there was a relationship between gender and motivations to undertake nursing, views of the profession and future plans. In this component of the study, a self-administered survey was distributed to all Saudi nurses working as registered nurses in Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals in Riyadh. The results indicated that the Saudi Arabia nurses surveyed were young and inexperienced with a mean age of 27 years and with 80 % having less than five years’ experience in the nursing field. Other important issues emerged in this study, such as the nurses’ desire for educational and professional development; poor working conditions in the sector; the low social status of the profession; difficulties associated with working in a mixed-gender environment; and cultural and communication problems. Significantly, just below half of all respondents intended leaving the profession. These results informed the second, qualitative component of this study which sought to explore in more depth, some of the findings which emerged from the initial component of the study. The second study aimed to explore the lived experience of newly gradated Saudi Nurses. Twelve newly graduate nurses who had been working in Ministry of Health Hospitals in Riyadh five years or less were interviewed. In-depth interviews in the Arabic language were performed with the nurses, who had been working in the profession for five years or less. Themes were identified from the data using van Manen’s hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Six major themes emerged from analysis of the data. Firstly, nurses felt unprepared for nursing. They felt they lacked the educational and training support they required, had little knowledge of the profession before joining, and had rarely chosen the profession themselves. Secondly, nurses in the study felt they were not readily included in nursing teams and were marginalised and discriminated against by management and expatriate nurses. In addition, Saudi nurses suffered from the poor social status associated with the profession and were subject to criticism and poor treatment by family, other health professionals and society at large. Despite this, nurses in general had a positive attitude to their profession. Saudi nurses indicated that they believed Saudi nurses were vital to the profession; both male and female nurses considered male nurses of central importance to the profession to ensure that the cultural and religious needs of Saudi patients were met. Finally, Saudi nurses showed an awareness of social changes occurring in nursing and in society in general and expressed a desire to be part of this change. This study offers important insights into a segment of the Saudi nursing workforce, which has not been the subject of intensive study. This new, emerging nursing workforce is making a mark on the Saudi healthcare sector. In order to prevent attrition in the nursing field, Saudi nurses need to be provided with appropriate education, training, respect and working conditions. This study offers important recommendations and insights for the future of Saudi nursing. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Nursing, 201...|$|R
