Note that the carboxylic acid in the starting materials was changed from <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which {{was used in the}} literature [28], to 2 -ethylhexanoic acid according to Dr. Masayuki Kanehara's kind suggestions because the use of <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{led to the formation of}} ITO nanoflowers, instead of nanoparticles, with significantly broadened SPR peaks (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The proportion of the tin precursor in the reagents, i.e., [tin(II) 2 -ethylhexanoate] / ([tin(II) 2 -ethylhexanoate] + [indium acetate]), was set to be 10 mol.% because this dopant ratio generated ITO nanocrystals with relatively high free electron density and strong SPR in the NIR region [28]. In a typical reaction, indium acetate (1.08 mmol), tin(II) 2 -ethylhexanoate (0.12 mmol), 2 -ethylhexanoic acid (3.6 mmol), oleylamine (10 mmol), and ODE (10 ml) were loaded in a three-neck flask and stirred at 80 °C under vacuum for 30 min to obtain a clear solution. The solution was heated at 150 °C for 60 min under an argon atmosphere. The reaction temperature was further raised to 280 °C and stabilized for 2 h to generate ITO nanocrystals. The ITO nanocrystals were precipitated out by adding ethyl acetate, purified, and redispersed in C 2 Cl 4.|$|E
40|$|Ghrelin is a {{peptide hormone}} that is acylated with a fatty acid, usually <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{at the third}} amino acid residue (usually a serine or threonine), and this {{acylation}} {{is known to be}} essential for ghrelin activity not only in mammals but also in non-mammals, such as fish. However, the modification mechanisms of ghrelin modification in fish are not known. In this study, we elucidated the structure of ghrelin in a teleost, the barfin flounder (Verasper moseri), and determined whether ingested free fatty acids of various chain lengths participated in ghrelin acylation. Complementary DNA cloning revealed the barfin flounder prepro-ghrelin to be a 106 -amino acid (aa) peptide and the mature ghrelin to be a 20 -aa peptide (GSSFLSPSHKPPNKGKPPRA). However, purification of ghrelin peptides from stomach extracts demonstrated that the major form of the hormone was a 19 -aa decanoylated peptide (GSS[C 10 : 0]FLSPSHKPPNKGKPPR) missing the last alanine of the 20 -aa peptide. Ingestion of feed enriched with n-heptanoic acid (C 7), <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 8), or n-nonanoic acid (C 9) changed the modification status of the peptide: ingestion of C 8 or C 9 increased the amount of C 8 : 0 or C 9 : 0 19 -aa ghrelin, respectively, but no C 7 : 0 ghrelin was isolated after ingestion of C 7.

40|$|Ghrelin, a {{peptide hormone}} {{produced}} predominantly by the stomach, stimulates food intake and GH secretion. The Ser(3) residue of ghrelin is mainly modified by a <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> In the human bloodstream, ghrelin circulates in two forms: octanoylated and desacylated. We previously demonstrated that ghrelin is desoctanoylated in human serum by butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 8) and other esterase(s), whereas in rat serum, only carboxylesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 1) is involved. The aims {{of this study}} were to determine the role of lipoprotein-associated enzymes in ghrelin desoctanoylation and the role of lipoproteins in the transport of circulating ghrelin. Our results show that ghrelin desoctanoylation mostly occurred in contact with low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and lipoprotein-poor plasma subfractions. Butyrylcholinesterase and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (EC 3. 1. 1. 47) were responsible for the ghrelin hydrolytic activity of the lipoprotein-poor plasma and LDL subfractions, respectively. Moreover, we observed that ghrelin is associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), very high-density lipoproteins (VHDLs), and to some extent LDLs. In conclusion, we report that the presence of the acyl group is necessary for ghrelin interaction with TRLs and LDLs but not HDLs and VHDLs. Ghrelin interacts via its N- and C-terminal parts with HDLs and VHDLs. This suggests that, whereas TRLs mostly transport acylated ghrelin, HDLs and VHDLs transport both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin.

The observed products and intermediates, {{as well as}} the observed inhibition of the air oxidation reaction by dissolved Fe 3 + ions, show that not only holes but also electrons participate in the oxidation reaction and that molecular oxygen has two roles: it accepts the electron generated in a TiO 2 crystallite and is reduced to a superoxide radical (O 2 ⋅– or HO 2 ⋅); and it combines with the organic radical, generated upon the hole or ⋅OH radical reaction with the reactant, to produce an organoperoxy radical (ROO⋅).

CO 2 evolves early in the resulting reaction sequence.

UNIFAC is weaker, especially when important roles are played by conformational freedom, intramolecular interactions, strong polar effects, and charge distribution of molecules in the mixture.

The acyltransferase that catalyzes ghrelin octanoylation has been recently identified and named ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT). The aim of this study was to clarify the physiological implications of GOAT in the regulation of energy balance, by assessing the effect of undernutrition, as well as fasting in adult male rats.

Our results show that chronic food restriction led to an increase in GOAT mRNA, particularly following long-term chronic malnutrition (21 days). Furthermore, following 48 h complete fasting, a situation with high-circulating ghrelin levels, we found similar mRNA expression of GOAT in fed and fasted rats; exogenous leptin administration markedly increase GOAT mRNA levels in the stomach mucosa of fasted rats. These findings suggest that increased GOAT mRNA levels may have a role in mediating the physiological responses to chronic undernutrition and could represent an adaptive response to prevent long-lasting alterations in energy balance and body weight homeostasis.

40|$|Regulation {{of energy}} {{homeostasis}} requires precise coordination between peripheral nutrient-sensing molecules and central regulatory networks. Ghrelin is a twenty-eight-amino acid orexigenic peptide acylated at the serine 3 position mainly with an <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is produced {{mainly in the}} stomach. It is the endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptors. Since plasma ghrelin levels are strictly dependent on recent food intake, this hormone plays {{an essential role in}} appetite and meal initiation. In addition, ghrelin is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The ghrelin gene is composed of four exons and three introns and renders a diversity of orexigenic peptides as well as des-acyl ghrelin and obestatin, which exhibit anorexigenic properties. Ghrelin stimulates the synthesis of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the arcuate nucleus neurons of the hypothalamus and hindbrain, which in turn enhance food intake. Ghrelin-expressing neurons modulate the action of both orexigenic NPY/AgRP and anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons. AMP-activated protein kinase is activated by ghrelin in the hypothalamus, which contributes to lower intracellular long-chain fatty acids, and this appears to be the molecular signal for the expression of NPY and AgRP. Recent data suggest that ghrelin has {{an important role in the}} regulation of leptin and insulin secretion and vice versa.

Unique among known animal peptides, the serine- 3 residue of ghrelin is posttranslationally acylated with an <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> a modification important for the peptide's active blood-brain transport and growth hormone secretagogue receptor- 1 agonist activity. Pharmacological degradation of ghrelin would be hypothesized to reduce ghrelin's biological effects. To study endogenous ghrelin's role in appetite and energy expenditure, we generated antibodies that hydrolyze the octanoyl moiety of ghrelin to form des-acyl ghrelin. The most proficient antibody catalyst, GHR- 11 E 11, was found to display a second-order rate constant of 18 M− 1 ·s− 1 for the hydrolysis of ghrelin to des-acyl ghrelin. I. v. administration of GHR- 11 E 11 (50 mg/kg) maintained a greater metabolic rate in fasting C 57 BL/ 6 J mice as compared with mice receiving a control antibody and suppressed 6 -h refeeding after 24 h of food deprivation.

The peaks at 1, 573 cm− 1 that were observed in FTIR spectra of the reaction mixtures at room temperature, 80 °C or 150 °C (Figure  1) were due to the formation of ammonium carboxylate salts which consumed free 2 -ethylhexanatic acid. The dissolution of indium acetate at 80 °C was because of the formation of oleylamine-indium acetate complex, instead of ligand replacement by free carboxylic acid. Given the condition that oleylamine was excessive in the reaction systems, a plausible deduction was that the oleylamine-indium acetate complex was responsible for the formation of ITO nanocrystals. We tested this hypothesis by conducting controlled experiments in which 2 -ethylhexanate acid was absent in the reagents. No nanocrystals but agglomerations with poor colloidal stability were formed, implying an exorbitantly fast reaction kinetics of the oleylamine-indium acetate complex. Therefore, the presence of 2 -ethylhexanate acid in the starting materials was critical to obtain high-quality ITO nanocrystals for the Masayuki method. This was also reflected by the fact that ITO flowers, instead of nanoparticles, formed when <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> instead of 2 -ethylhexanate acid, was used in the starting materials (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). We suspect that although majority of the 2 -ethylhexanate acid reacted with oleylamine to form ammonium carboxylate salts, considering the reversible nature of the acid-base reaction, 2 -ethylhexanate acid may impact {{in the formation of the}} oleylamine-indium carboxylate complex with adequate reaction kinetics. Nevertheless, such a process is complicated. Modifications on the Masayuki method that induce evident evolutions of the metal precursors are desirable.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{tested the}} ability of {{saturated}} n-monocarboxylic acids ranging from eight to 12 carbons in length to self-assemble into vesicles, and determined the minimal concentrations and chain lengths necessary to form stable bilayer membranes. Under defined conditions of pH and concentrations exceeding 150 mM, an unbranched monocarboxylic acid as short as eight carbons in length (<b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid)</b> assembled into vesicular structures. Nonanoic acid (85 mM) formed stable vesicles at pH 7. 0, the pK of the acid in bilayers, and was chosen for further testing. At pH 6 and below, the vesicles were unstable and the acid was present as droplets. At pH ranges of 8 and above clear solutions of micelles formed. However, addition of small amounts of an alcohol (nonanol) markedly stabilized the bilayers, and vesicles were present at significantly lower concentrations (∼ 20 mM) at pH ranges up to 11. The formation of vesicles near the pKa of the acids {{can be explained by}} the formation of stable RCOO−…HOOCR hydrogen bond networks in the presence of both ionized and neutral acid functions. Similarly, the effects of alcohols at high pH suggests the formation of stable RCOO−…HOR hydrogen bond networks when neutral RCOOH groups are absent. The vesicles provided a selective permeability barrier, as indicated by osmotic activity and ionic dye capture, and could encapsulate macromolecules such as DNA and a protein. When catalase was encapsulated in vesicles of decanoic acid and decanol, the enzyme was protected from degradation by protease, and could act as a catalyst for its substrate, hydrogen peroxide, which readily diffused across the membrane. We conclude that membranous vesicles produced by mixed short chain monocarboxylic acids and alcohols are useful models for testing the limits of stabilizing hydrophobic effects in membranes and for prebiotic membrane formation...|$|E

Under the experimental conditions employed in this study, no limitation of nutrient {{was necessary to}} induce for this microorganism to produce polymers, but limiting nitrogen improved the polymer yield. The main repeating unit in polymers produced from n-alkanoic acids longer than heptanoic acid was either 3 -hydroxyoctanoate or 3 -hydroxynonanoate. ^ Carbon sources examined for growth and PHA production were classified according to growth results. Both {{physical and chemical properties}} of the carbon substrate affected cell growth and PHA production. When a substituent was present, the better growth and PHA production were, the longer the separation between the carboxylic acid and the substituent was. ^ Polymers containing various unusual groups such as olefin, nitrile, ester, bromine, alcohol, cyclohexane, and phenyl group were obtained by growing P. oleovorans wither either single carbon substrate or mixtures of two carbon substrates. ^ Ninety-nine percent of repeating units in a PHA prepared from cells grown solely with 10 -undecenoic acid, UND:, contained olefin group. PHAs produced from mixtures of two carbon substrates both of which support cell growth and PHA production were generally random copolymers {{with the exception of the}} polymer produced from mixtures of 5 -phenylvaleric acid and either n-nonanoic acid, NA, or <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> OA. ^ Many carbon substrates that support cell growth without PHA production were incorporated into the polymer when these substrates were co-fed to P. oleovorans with NA or OA. ^ Polymers containing repeating units with bromine group could be prepared only when ω-bromoalkanoic acids were fed in the presence of NA, but a polymer containing nitrile group were obtained when 11 -cyanoundecanoic acid was fed in the presence of either NA or OA. ^ PHAs containing unsaturated units were crosslinked by heating in the air or by heating with peroxides under nitrogen atmosphere to get rubber elastic products.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the {{discovery}} of ghrelin, a gut peptide discovered in 1999 by Kojima and colleagues (1), {{has led to the}} identification of a complex system that introduced new perspectives in neuroendocrine and metabolic research. Ghrelin is a peptide-hormone of 28 amino acids, predominantly produced by the stomach and detected in a lower amount in other central and peripheral tissues (1 - 11). The ghrelin peptide has a biological peculiarity, which is the esterification of a fatty (mostly <b>n-octanoic)</b> <b>acid</b> at its third serine residue (1). This modification is necessary for binding and activation of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 a (GHS-R 1 a), the only cloned ghrelin receptor so far (1, 12, 13). Before the discovery of ghrelin, the GHS-R 1 a was an orphan G-protein coupled receptor specific for a family of synthetic molecules exerting a strong GH-releasing activity and therefore named Growth Hormone Secretagogues (GHS). The acyl-modified forms of ghrelin (AG), {{as well as some of}} the synthetic GHSs, have pleiotropic activities, including modulation of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Besides the acylated form of ghrelin (AG), an unacylated ghrelin molecule (unacylated ghrelin, UAG) is also present in circulation. The absence of the acyl modification makes UAG unable to bind or activate the GHS-R 1 a (1). Moreover, although a specific UAG receptor has not been isolated to date, its existence has been strongly suggested. UAG shares with AG a variety of biological actions, but it also exerts AG-independent activities (11). Recently, a third molecule has been identified as a ghrelin-associated peptide and named obestatin (14). Obestatin is encoded by the same ghrelin gene and is a 23 -amino acid product of the pro-ghrelin peptide. However, it does not bind the GHS-R 1 a (14). The growing body of literature over the last few years profiled the complex identities and interactions of these newly discovered molecules and their known and unknown receptor(s), which constitute the ghrelin system. The line of research and the studies included in this thesis focus on the involvement of the ghrelin system in the regulation of glucose metabolism, with particular emphasis on AG, UAG and their receptor(s) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we have {{demonstrated}} that the preproghrelin derived hormones, ghrelin and obestatin, {{may play a role}} in ovarian cancer. Ghrelin and obestatin stimulated an increase in cell migration in ovarian cancer cell lines and {{may play a role in}} cancer progression. Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynaecological cancers and is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women in developed countries. As ovarian cancer is difficult to diagnose at a low tumour grade, two thirds of ovarian cancers are not diagnosed until the late stages of cancer development resulting in a poor prognosis for the patient. As a result, current treatment methods are limited and not ideal. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic markers, as well better therapeutic approaches and adjunctive therapies for this disease. Ghrelin has a number of important physiological effects, including roles in appetite regulation and the stimulation of growth hormone release. It is also involved in regulating the immune, cardiovascular and reproductive systems and regulates sleep, memory and anxiety, and energy metabolism. Over the last decade, the ghrelin axis, (which includes the hormones ghrelin and obestatin and their receptors), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases and it may t may also play an important role in the development of cancer. Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide hormone that exists in two forms. Acyl ghrelin (usually referred to as ghrelin), has a unique <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid</b> post-translational modification (which is catalysed by ghrelin O-acyltransferase, GOAT), and desacyl ghrelin, which is a non-octanoylated form. Octanoylated ghrelin acts through the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 a (GHSR 1 a). GHSR 1 b, an alternatively spliced isoform of GHSR, is C-terminally truncated and does not bind ghrelin. Ghrelin has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases Obestatin is a 23 amino acid, C-terminally amidated peptide which is derived from preproghrelin. Although GPR 39 was originally thought to be the obestatin receptor this has been disproven, and its receptor remains unknown. Obestatin may have as diverse range of roles as ghrelin. Obestatin improves memory, inhibits thirst and anxiety, increases pancreatic juice secretion and has cardioprotective effects. Obestatin also has been shown to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in some cell types. Prior to this study, little was known regarding the functions and mechanisms of action ghrelin and obestatin in ovarian cancer. In this study it was demonstrated that the full length ghrelin, GHSR 1 b and GOAT mRNA transcripts were expressed in all of the ovarian-derived cell lines examined (SKOV 3, OV-MZ- 6 and hOSE 17. 1), however, these cell lines did not express GHSR 1 a. Ovarian cancer tissue of varying stages and normal ovarian tissue expressed the coding region for ghrelin, obestatin, and GOAT, but not GHSR 1 a, or GHSR 1 b. No correlations between cancer grade and the level of expression of these transcripts were observed. This study demonstrated for the first time that both ghrelin and obestatin increase cell migration in ovarian cancer cell lines. Treatment with ghrelin (for 72 hours) significantly increased cell migration in the SKOV 3 and OV-MZ- 6 ovarian cancer cell lines. Ghrelin (100 nM) stimulated cell migration in the SKOV 3 (2. 64 +/- 1. 08 fold, p < 0. 05) and OV-MZ- 6 (1. 65 +/- 0. 31 fold, p < 0. 05) ovarian cancer cell lines, but not in the representative normal cell line hOSE 17. 1. This increase in migration was not accompanied by an increase in cell invasion through Matrigel. In contrast to other cancer types, ghrelin had no effect on proliferation. Ghrelin treatment (10 nM) significantly decreased attachment of the SKOV 3 ovarian cancer cell line to collagen IV (24. 7 +/- 10. 0...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Western males. Current diagnostic, {{prognostic}} and treatment approaches are not ideal and advanced metastatic prostate cancer is incurable. There is an urgent need for improved adjunctive therapies and markers for this disease. GPCRs are likely to {{play a significant role in}} the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Over the last decade, it has emerged that G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are likely to function as homodimers and heterodimers. Heterodimerisation between GPCRs can result in the formation of novel pharmacological receptors with altered functional outcomes, and a number of GPCR heterodimers have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease. Importantly, novel GPCR heterodimers represent potential new targets for the development of more specific therapeutic drugs. Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide hormone which has a unique <b>n-octanoic</b> <b>acid</b> post-translational modification. Ghrelin has a number of important physiological roles, including roles in appetite regulation and the stimulation of growth hormone release. The ghrelin receptor is the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 a, GHS-R 1 a, a seven transmembrane domain GPCR, and GHS-R 1 b is a C-terminally truncated isoform of the ghrelin receptor, consisting of five transmembrane domains. Growing evidence suggests that ghrelin and the ghrelin receptor isoforms, GHS-R 1 a and GHS-R 1 b, may have a role in the progression of a number of cancers, including prostate cancer. Previous studies by our research group have shown that the truncated ghrelin receptor isoform, GHS-R 1 b, is not expressed in normal prostate, however, it is expressed in prostate cancer. The altered expression of this truncated isoform may reflect a difference between a normal and cancerous state. A number of mutant GPCRs have been shown to regulate the function of their corresponding wild-type receptors. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of interactions between GHS-R 1 a and GHS-R 1 b, which are co-expressed in prostate cancer and aimed to investigate the function of this potentially new pharmacological receptor. In 2005, obestatin, a 23 amino acid C-terminally amidated peptide derived from preproghrelin was identified and was described as opposing the stimulating effects of ghrelin on appetite and food intake. GPR 39, an orphan GPCR which is closely related to the ghrelin receptor, was identified as the endogenous receptor for obestatin. Recently, however, the ability of obestatin to oppose the effects of ghrelin on appetite and food intake has been questioned, and furthermore, it appears that GPR 39 may in fact not be the obestatin receptor. The role of GPR 39 in the prostate is of interest, however, as it is a zinc receptor. Zinc has a unique role in the biology of the prostate, where it is normally accumulated at high levels, and zinc accumulation is altered in the development of prostate malignancy. Ghrelin and zinc have important roles in prostate cancer and dimerisation of their receptors may have novel roles in malignant prostate cells. The aim of the current study, therefore, was to demonstrate the formation of GHS-R 1 a/GHS-R 1 b and GHS-R 1 a/GPR 39 heterodimers and to investigate potential functions of these heterodimers in prostate cancer cell lines. To demonstrate dimerisation we first employed a classical co-immunoprecipitation technique. Using cells co-overexpressing FLAG- and Myc- tagged GHS-R 1 a, GHS-R 1 b and GPR 39, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate these receptors. Significantly, however, the receptors formed high molecular weight aggregates. A number of questions have been raised over the propensity of GPCRs to aggregate during co-immunoprecipitation as a result of their hydrophobic nature and this may be misinterpreted as receptor dimerisation. As we observed significant receptor aggregation in this study, we used additional methods to confirm the specificity of these putative GPCR interactions. We used two different resonance energy transfer (RET) methods; bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), to investigate interactions between the ghrelin receptor isoforms and GPR 39. RET is the transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore when they are in close proximity, and RET methods are, therefore, applicable to the observation of specific protein-protein interactions. Extensive studies using the second generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET 2) technology were performed, however, a number of technical limitations were observed. The substrate used during BRET 2 studies, coelenterazine 400 a, has a low quantum yield and rapid signal decay. This study highlighted the requirement for the expression of donor and acceptor tagged receptors at high levels so that a BRET ratio can be determined. After performing a number of BRET 2 experimental controls, our BRET 2 data did not fit the predicted results for a specific interaction between these receptors. The interactions that we observed may in fact represent ‘bystander BRET’ resulting from high levels of expression, forcing the donor and acceptor into close proximity. Our FRET studies employed two different FRET techniques, acceptor photobleaching FRET and sensitised emission FRET measured by flow cytometry. We were unable to observe any significant FRET, or FRET values that were likely to result from specific receptor dimerisation between GHS-R 1 a, GHS-R 1 b and GPR 39. While we were unable to conclusively demonstrate direct dimerisation between GHS-R 1 a, GHS-R 1 b and GPR 39 using several methods, our findings do not exclude the possibility that these receptors interact. We aimed to investigate if co-expression of combinations of these receptors had functional effects in prostate cancers cells. It has previously been demonstrated that ghrelin stimulates cell proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines, through ERK 1 / 2 activation, and GPR 39 can stimulate ERK 1 / 2 signalling in response to zinc treatments. Additionally, both GHS-R 1 a and GPR 39 display a high level of constitutive signalling and these constitutively active receptors can attenuate apoptosis when overexpressed individually in some cell types. We, therefore, investigated ERK 1 / 2 and AKT signalling and cell survival in prostate cancer the potential modulation of these functions by dimerisation between GHS-R 1 a, GHS-R 1 b and GPR 39. Expression of these receptors in the PC- 3 prostate cancer cell line, either alone or in combination, did not alter constitutive ERK 1 / 2 or AKT signalling, basal apoptosis or tunicamycin-stimulated apoptosis, compared to controls. In summary, the potential interactions between the ghrelin receptor isoforms, GHS-R 1 a and GHS-R 1 b, and the related zinc receptor, GPR 39, and the potential for functional outcomes in prostate cancer were investigated using a number of independent methods. We did not definitively demonstrate the formation of these dimers using a number of state of the art methods to directly demonstrate receptor-receptor interactions. We investigated a number of potential functions of GPR 39 and GHS-R 1 a in the prostate and did not observe altered function in response to co-expression of these receptors. The technical questions raised by this study highlight the requirement for the application of extensive controls when using current methods for the demonstration of GPCR dimerisation. Similar findings in this field reflect the current controversy surrounding the investigation of GPCR dimerisation. Although GHS-R 1 a/GHS-R 1 b or GHS-R 1 a/GPR 39 heterodimerisation was not clearly demonstrated, this study provides a basis for future investigations of these receptors in prostate cancer. Additionally, the results presented in this study and growing evidence in the literature highlight the requirement for an extensive understanding of the experimental method and the performance of a range of controls to avoid the spurious interpretation of data gained from artificial expression systems. The future development of more robust techniques for investigating GPCR dimerisation is clearly required and will enable us to elucidate whether GHS-R 1 a, GHS-R 1 b and GPR 39 form physiologically relevant dimers...|$|E
