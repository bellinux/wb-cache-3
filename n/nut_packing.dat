40|$|Survival of Salmonella senftenberg 775 W, S. anatum, and S. typhimurium during {{exposure}} to currently practiced, {{as well as}} abusive, pecan processing and storage conditions was studied. Thermal treatments normally carried out during the processing of pecans are inadequate to consistently destory salmonellae in highly contaminated inshell nuts. Pecan <b>nut</b> <b>packing</b> tissue was toxic to salmonellae, thus affording some protection against high initial contamination and subsequent survival of the organisms. Examinations of inoculated inshell pecans stored at - 18, - 7, 5, and 21 C for up to 32 weeks revealed that the extent of survival was inversely correlated to the storage temperature. S. senftenberg 775 W and S. anatum were not detectable on inshell nuts after 16 weeks of storage at 21 C. Little decrease in viable population of the three species was noted on inoculated pecan halves stored at - 18, - 7, and 5 C for 32 weeks. Due to organoleptic quality deterioration in pecan nutmeats at elevated temperatures, sterilization methods other than thermal treatment appear to be required {{for the elimination of}} viable salmonellae from pecan nuts...|$|E

50|$|A {{stuffing}} box of a sailboat {{will have a}} stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have <b>packing</b> <b>nut</b> threads or a gland <b>nut.</b> The <b>packing</b> is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|R
40|$|High {{moisture}} content, relative humidity, {{temperature and}} environment rich in oxygen (O₂) {{are the main}} factors for tree nuts to get infected by fungi and so aflatoxins (AFLs) contaminated. During storage and commercialization dry Brazil <b>nuts</b> <b>packs</b> need to maintain their safety and quality. Modified atmospheres in storage (macro-environment) and packaging (micro-environment) {{have been used to}} prolong food shelf life by reducing O₂ concentration with inhibitory gases or, more recently, by adding O₂ absorber pads. This work reports the application of O₂ atmosphere reducing methods on stored shelled Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>packs</b> aiming fungi and AFL degradation as well as hygienic conditions improvements. The methods applied were: (a) ozone - O₃, (b) carbon dioxide - CO₂ and (c) O₂ absorber pads with and without vacuum. Nuts were submitted to microbiological tests (fungi, aflatoxigenic strains, yeast and bacteria), moisture content and AFLs analysis. From all O₂ reducing atmosphere evaluated, the best performance was obtained with O₃. A reduction on fungi growth (1. 8 x 104 cfu. g- 1 to 2. 6 x 10 cfu. g- 1) and yeast destruction after the first month of storage were registered. Also O₃ was the only nut treatment that was able to degrade AFLs. None of the spiked (AFLs: 15 ppb) nut samples O₃ treated had AFLs detected up to the LOQ of the method (0. 36 μg. kg- 1 for AFB 1 +AFB 2 +AFG 1 +AFG 2) i. e., much lower than the allowed by the European Union regulation (MRL: 4 and 2 ppb for total and AFB 1, respectively), thus producing safer nuts. All other treatments stabilized and/or inhibited microorganisms growth. Add CO₂ and O₂ pads played an important role on nut quality. Further study will be carried out in order to adjust O₃ concentration and application conditions for longer period of storage...|$|R

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{application}} of oxygen-(O 2 -) reducing atmosphere methods on stored shelled Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa H. B. K.) packs aiming to evaluate the degree of aflatoxin degradation, nuts lipid oxidative stability, fungi control, and hygienic conditions improvement. The methods applied were (a) ozone: O 3, (b) carbon dioxide: CO 2, and (c) O 2 absorber pads with and without vacuum. From all modified atmospheres evaluated, the best performance was obtained with O 3, either with or without vacuum. It was the only nut treatment that was able to degrade aflatoxins. None of the spiked (AFLs: 15 [*]μg·kg− 1) nut samples O 3 - treated had aflatoxins detected up to the LC-MS/MS method LOQ (0. 36 [*]μg·kg− 1 for total AFLs), thus producing safer nuts. Also it kept the fatty acid oxidation indicator—malondialdehyde stable and improved the sensory attributes for consumer acceptance. In addition, the destruction of fungi and yeast was observed since the O 3 application (from 1. 8 × 104 [*]cfu/g to NG = no growth). All other treatments stabilized and/or inhibited microorganisms' growth only. By adding CO 2 gas also {{played an important role}} in the nut quality.

50|$|A gland is {{a general}} type of {{stuffing}} box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in {{the head of a}} tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease. The gland <b>nut</b> allows the <b>packing</b> material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a centrifugal pump may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the piston rod of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or wind pump is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} storage {{duration}} on fungal population, moisture content, lipid and {{free fatty acid}} contents, lipase activity, viability and vigor of physic nut seeds was investigated. Physic nut seeds with initial moisture content of 7. 9 % were stored in plastic bags under warehouse conditions. Samples of physic nut were collected before storage, and subsequently after one to six months of storage. The {{results showed that the}} moisture contents increased after one month of storage, and became relatively constant up to six months of storage. The range of moisture contents (7. 9 – 8. 4 %) was safe for storage of physic nut seeds. Sixteen fungal species were isolated from physic nut seeds during six months of storage. Fungal population decreased with the increase of storage duration. At the beginning of storage, most of the fungi that infected the seeds were classified as field fungi, such as Colletotrichum sp., Cladosporium spp., and Fusarium spp [...] Their populations decreased with the increase of storage duration. After three months of storage, the existence of field fungi was generally replaced by storage fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., and Penicillium spp. dominate the population. Lipid contents, viabilities and vigors decreased with the increase of storage duration, while free fatty acids and lipase activities increased. Under uncontrolled condi -tions, physic <b>nut</b> seeds <b>packed</b> in plastic material can be stored up to one month for seeds to be planted, while it can be stored up to five months for producing oil...|$|R
50|$|The stem {{serves as}} a {{connector}} from the actuator {{to the inside of}} the valve and transmits this actuation force. Stems are either smooth for actuator controlled valves or threaded for manual valves. The smooth stems are surrounded by packing material to prevent leaking material from the valve. This packing is a wearable material and will have to be replaced during maintenance. With a smooth stem the ends are threaded to allow connection to the plug and the actuator. The stem must not only withstand a large amount of compression force during valve closure, but also have high tensile strength during valve opening. In addition, the stem must be very straight, or have low run out, in order to ensure good valve closure. This minimum run out also minimizes wear of the packing contained in the bonnet, which provides the seal against leakage. The stem may be provided with a shroud over the <b>packing</b> <b>nut</b> to prevent foreign bodies entering the packing material, which would accelerate wear.|$|R
40|$|Butterfly valves {{are mostly}} used in various {{industries}} such as oil and gas plant. This valve operates with rotating motion using pneumatic system. Rotating actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows free passage of the fluid and when fully closed, the disc rotated a quarter turns to block the fluid. The primary failure modes for valves are the valve leaks to environment through flanges, seals on the valve body, valve stem packing not properly protected, over tightened <b>packing</b> <b>nuts,</b> the valve cracks and leaks over the seat. To identify the failure of valve Failure Mode and Effects Analysis has been chosen. FMEA is the one of technique to perform failure analysis. It involves reviewing as many components to identify failure modes, and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects {{on the rest of}} the system are recorded in a specific FMEA form. Risk priority number, severity, detection, occurrence are the factor determined in this studies. Risk priority number helps to find out the highest hazardous activities which need more attention than the other activity. The highest score of risk priority number in this research is seat. Action plan was proposed to reduce the risk priority number and so that potential failures also will be reduced...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted to}} determine the type, extent and severity of corrosion found in the 10 - and 14 -ton mild steel depleted UF{sub 6 } storage cylinders. Also discussed in this review is corrosion found in the valves and plugs used in the cylinders. Corrosion of the cylinders is a gradual process which occurs slowly over time. Understanding corrosion of the cylinders is an important concern for long term storage of the UF{sub 6 } in the cylinder yards, {{as well as the}} final disposition of the depleted UF{sub 6 } tails inventory in the future. The following conclusions are made from the {{literature review}}: (1) The general external corrosion rate of the cylinders is about 1 to 2 mils per year (1 mil = 0. 001 {double_prime}). The highest general external corrosion rate was over 5 mpy on the 48 G type cylinders. (2) General internal corrosion from the depleted UF{sub 6 } is negligible under normal storage conditions. Crevice corrosion can occur at the cylinder/saddle interface from the retention of water in this area. Crevice corrosion can occur at the cylinder/skirt interface on the older skirted cylinders {{due to the lack of}} water drainage in this area. Crevice corrosion can occur on cylinders that have been in ground contact. Crevice corrosion and galvanic corrosion can occur where the stainless steel I. D. nameplates are attached to the cylinder. The <b>packing</b> <b>nuts</b> on the bronze one-inch valves used in the cylinders are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Mechanical damage from routine handling can lead to a breach in a cylinder with subsequent accelerated corrosion of the mild steel due to attack from HF and other UF{sub 6 } hydrolysis by-products...|$|R
6000|$|More useful, and {{the fruit}} of an even grander tree, are those 'Brazil nuts' which are sold in every sweet-shop at home. They belong to Bertholletia excelsa, a tree which grows sparingly--I have never seen it wild--in the {{southern}} part of the island, but plentifully in the forests of Guiana, and which is said to be one of the tallest of all the forest giants. The fruit, round like the cannon-ball, and about the size of a twenty-four pounder, is harder than the hardest wood, and has to be battered to pieces with the back of a hatchet to disclose the <b>nuts,</b> which lie <b>packed</b> close inside. Any one who has hammered at a Bertholletia fruit will be ready to believe the story that the Indians, fond as they are of the nuts, avoid the 'totocke' trees till the fruit has all fallen, for fear of fractured skulls; and the older story which Humboldt gives out of old Laet, {228} that the Indians dared not enter the forests, when the trees were fruiting, without having their heads and shoulders covered with bucklers of hard wood. These 'Almendras de Peru' (Peru almonds), as they were called, were known in Europe as early as the sixteenth century, the seeds being carried up the Maragnon, and by the Cordilleras to Peru, men knew not from whence. [...] To Humboldt himself, I believe, is due the re-discovery of the tree itself and its enormous fruit; and the name of Bertholletia excelsa was given by him. The tree, he says, 'is not more than two or three feet in diameter, but attains one hundred or one hundred and twenty feet in height. It does not resemble the Mammee, the star-apple, and several other trees of the Tropics, of which the branches, as in the laurels of the temperate zone, rise straight toward the sky. [...] The branches of the Bertholletia are open, very long, almost entirely bare toward the base, and loaded at their summits with tufts of very close foliage. This disposition of the semi- coriaceous leaves, a little silvery beneath and more than two feet long, makes the branches bend down toward the ground, like the fronds of the palm-trees.' ...|$|R
