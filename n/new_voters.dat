Because of the changes announced for future elections, {{this was the last}} meeting of this particular committee.|$|E
5|$|On the {{weekends}} of 9–10 November 2013 and 8–9 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> to register {{and for those}} who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends to register at an IEC office during office hours. Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed to register to vote until the election date is published in a government gazette, after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million <b>new</b> <b>voters.</b> This increased the number of registered voters to 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E

25|$|After {{winning the}} 1866 elections, the Radical Republicans {{took control of}} the Reconstruction process. The Army {{registered}} all male voters, and elections returned a Republican government composed of a coalition of freedmen, carpetbaggers, and scalawags. By a constitutional convention, <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> created the constitution of 1868; this brought democratic reforms to the state, including its first public school system. Native white Republicans supported it, but white Democrats viewed the Republican government as representative of black interests only and were largely unsupportive.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of Italian immigration, Boston Italians tended to vote Democratic. The one major {{exception}} was in 1920, when, disappointed that Wilson had not supported Italy's claim to the seaport city of Fiume, they voted for Harding. From 1920 to 1940 they voted consistently, overwhelmingly, Democratic. In 1924, Democratic candidates for Congress and the Massachusetts senate received about 90% of the Italian vote. During this period there was a massive push by the Democratic party to mobilize <b>new</b> <b>voters.</b> Between 1924 and 1940, the number of male voters in the North End tripled, and the number of female voters increased eightfold.|$|E

Despite having lost many votes to the PdL, the UDC was able to woo some <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> from the centre-left and gained 5.6% of the vote, 36 deputies (all UDC members but four) and three senators. Soon after the election, Mario Baccini, {{one of the leaders of}} The Rose, surprisingly left the UdC in order to join the PdL.|$|E
25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} {{began to come}} apart {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of supply-side economics. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E
500|$|After {{being denied}} {{building}} permits for Rajneeshpuram, the commune leadership sought to gain political {{control over the}} rest of the county by influencing the November 1984 county election. Their goal was to win two of three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court, as well as the sheriff's office. Their attempts to influence the election included the [...] "Share-a-Home" [...] program, in which they had thousands of homeless people transported to Rajneeshpuram and attempted to register them to vote to inflate the constituency of voters for the group's candidates. The Wasco county clerk countered this attempt by enforcing a regulation that required all <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> to submit their qualifications when registering to vote.|$|E

500|$|In Harold Washington's {{successful}} first {{campaign for}} Mayor of Chicago in the 1983 municipal elections, Shiller was employed {{as the campaign}} organizer for the 46th Ward. Shiller owned and operated a print shop, Justice Graphics, that printed the campaign literature for Washington's first mayoral campaign. Justice Graphics published the All-Chicago City News, a 40,000 circulation pro-Washington, left-wing, bilingual, biweekly newspaper edited by Shiller and Walter [...] "Slim" [...] Coleman. Coleman formed a plan to register 100,000 <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> for Washington by canvassing public aid offices and became a close advisor to candidate and, later, Mayor Harold Washington. Just before the 1983 elections, Alderman Axelrod resigned from City Council {{to take a job}} in the Cook County Sheriff's office. Community activist Charlotte Newfeld and Jerome Orbach ran for alderman and went to a run-off, which Orbach won by 66 votes.

500|$|The 1820s and 1830s {{had seen}} a large {{increase}} in the franchise in the United States, which by 1840 was granted to many white males, even poor men, and the Whigs sought to recruit among <b>new</b> <b>voters.</b> There was concern that the Harrison campaign {{would not be able}} to keep up momentum, but supporters proved inventive. Some Clevelanders who had journeyed to Columbus had made a gigantic paper ball, [...] in diameter, with pro-Harrison and anti-Van Buren slogans written on it. As a newly-coined phrase went, they kept the ball rolling, taking it from town to town. This inspired a Harrison supporter from Zanesville, Ohio, Alexander Coffman Ross to write new lyrics to an old minstrel song called [...] "Little Pigs", that immediately became a huge hit. In so doing, Ross coined what Shafer called [...] "the first—and the most famous—slogan of any presidential campaign", for the song began, ...|$|E
500|$|The {{consequences}} of defeat, however, were severe for the Democratic Party. [...] The 1896 presidential race {{is generally considered}} a realigning election, {{when there is a}} major shift in voting patterns, upsetting the political balance. [...] McKinley was supported by middle-class and wealthy voters, urban laborers, and prosperous farmers; this coalition would keep the Republicans mostly in power until the 1930s. The election of 1896 marked a transition as the concerns of the rural population became secondary to those of the urban; according to Stanley Jones, [...] "the Democratic Party reacted with less sensitivity than the Republicans to the hopes and fears of the <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> which the new age was producing". [...] This was evidenced in the tariff question: Bryan spent little time addressing it, stating that it was subsumed in the financial issue; Republican arguments that the protective tariff would benefit manufacturers appealed to urban workers and went unrebutted by the Democrats.|$|E

500|$|The {{ordinance}} {{that had}} recently passed in Eugene {{was met with}} a different strategy of opposition. Eugene was a college town so liberal the Grateful Dead spent their summers there. A housewife named Lynne Greene rejected the Biblical rhetoric offered by Bryant and instead argued that since gays already had the protection they needed under the law further legislation was unnecessary. Since homosexuality was a chosen lifestyle, they reasoned, homosexuals were not a minority and needed no protection. Acknowledging the rights of gays would lead the law to give them rights to marry, and adopt children. Though gay rights advocates worked differently in Eugene, registering many <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> and seeing lesbians significantly working the campaign for the first time, their opposition worked steadily by canvassing neighborhoods. Most of their volunteers were members of conservative churches, and the message was similar to recent campaigns: [...] "Keep it straight. Our children come first," [...] but the Eugene campaign lacked the sensational aspect as those in Miami and St. Paul.|$|E
500|$|Independents {{including}} Aldermen Dick Simpson (44th), Martin J.

Turley was also unanimously endorsed by the 46th Ward Citizens Search Committee, a group of 50 ward residents who interviewed 10 candidates. Turley and another candidate Carl Lezak, a former priest and {{former director of the}} American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), were challenged and stricken from the ballot by the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners, leaving a three-way race for alderman between Axelrod, Shiller, and former television news reporter Michael Horowitz. Shiller charged that the regular Democratic organization used unfair campaign practices against her, challenging about 100 of the 400 <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> she helped register, stealing her campaign posters, and pressuring store owners to remove her signs. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Axelrod, noting Shiller [...] "runs primarily as a champion of the poor." [...] Axelrod prevailed, receiving 5,575 votes, or 54.5%, to Shiller's 3,475 votes.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{was arrested}} on his twenty-first {{birthday}} in Washington, D.C. following his participation in demonstrations against apartheid at the South African Embassy. He had been arrested {{with his father and}} brother the year before in a similar activity. His protest against apartheid extended to weekly demonstrations in front of the South African Consulate in Chicago. Jackson shared the stage with Nelson Mandela when Mandela made his historic speech following his release from a 27-year imprisonment in Cape Town in February 1990. Before entering the House, he became secretary of the Democratic National Committee's Black Caucus, the national field director of the National Rainbow Coalition {{and a member of the}} Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Jackson served as the national field director of the Rainbow Coalition from 1993 to 1995. Under Jackson's leadership, the Rainbow Coalition attempted to stimulate equitable hiring in the National Basketball Association because while 78% of the league's players were African American, 92% of the front-office executive positions, 88% of the administrative jobs, and 85% of the support positions were held by whites. [...] While serving as the field director for the National Rainbow Coalition, he helped register millions of <b>new</b> <b>voters</b> through a newly instituted national non-partisan program. He also created a voter education program to teach citizens the importance of participating in the political process. He was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and also a founding board member of the Apollo Alliance.|$|E
