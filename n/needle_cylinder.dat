30|$|Singh et al. (2015 a) found a {{specific}} micro-structural relation between mineral matter and the coaly substance in Meghalaya coal. In the moderately dull coal, mineral matter occurs as superficial impregnation and cavity filling; in moderately bright coal as superficial impregnation, cavity filling, and intimate intergrowth; and in bright coals as superficial mounting and pore fillings. In Umaria and Ib valley coal, in general mineral matter is more dominant in dull bands {{as compared to}} the brighter ones (Fig.  3 d–f). The micro structural relationships between coaly substances and mineral matter in vitrain, appears as amorphous mass with conchoidal fracture or observed mainly superficial mounting (Fig.  3 a), superficial blanketing (Fig.  3 b, c), deep intergrowth (Fig.  3 d) and massive impregnation (Fig.  3 c). Saikia (2009) has reported two different morphological types of collotelinite in Assam coals. Those are of typically angular in shape and with parallel laminations. Increase in coal rank appears {{to increase the number of}} laminations and give more ordered system of stacked sheets. Particular, in Umaria coal, telinite shows cellular structures with woody matter compressed probably due to pressure (Fig.  3 e, f). In case of clarain, characterised by alternate thin bands of vitrain and durain, mineral matter occurs as superficial blanketing and cellular cavity filling. In dull bands it occurs as massive intergrowth and deep impregnations. In durain which is characterised by structureless, compact, residual ground mass, the mineral matter occurs as intergrowth and massive impregnation. This lithotype records the maximum contamination. Finkelman and Stanton (1978) found pyrite concentrated in vitrinite macerals; illite, quartz, and rutile in the carbominerite; and kaolinite in fusinite and semifusinite. Finkelman (1980) has reported sulfides, concentrated in inertinites and vitrinites. Late epigenetic minerals, such as kaolinite, siderite, pyrite, calcite, barite and silica and most commonly the aluminum silicates have been reported by Finkelman (1980) to occur in micro cleats of coal. In the present investigation, the voids are seen to be filled with clayey, sideritic and at places limonitic mineral matter (Fig.  4 a, b). Davis et al. (1986) and Saikia (2009) have reported rod-like (<b>needle)</b> <b>cylinders</b> resembling fossilised xylem plant vessels in coal. In case of Ib valley and Umaria coal, generally the concentration of mineral matter is less in fusain. The mineral matter has been found in pitted vessels of parenchyma. The pitted vessels and mechanical cavities owe their origin to the crushing of cell fibres (Fig.  4 c–f).|$|R
40|$|A {{forested area}} is modeled as {{a volume of}} {{randomly}} oriented and distributed disc-shaped, or needle-shaped leaves shading a distribution of branches modeled as randomly oriented finite-length, dielectric cylinders above an irregular soil surface. Since the radii of branches have {{a wide range of}} sizes, the model only requires the length of a branch to be large compared with its radius which may be any size relative to the incident wavelength. In addition, the model also assumes the thickness of a disc-shaped leaf or the radius of a needle-shaped leaf is much smaller than the electromagnetic wavelength. The scattering phase matrices for disc, <b>needle,</b> and <b>cylinder</b> are developed in terms of the scattering amplitudes of the corresponding fields which are computed by the forward scattering theorem. These quantities along with the Kirchoff scattering model for a randomly rough surface are used in the standard radiative transfer formulation to compute the backscattering coefficient. Numerical illustrations for the backscattering coefficient are given {{as a function of the}} shading factor, incidence angle, leaf orientation distribution, branch orientation distribution, and the number density of leaves. Also illustrated are the properties of the extinction coefficient as a function of leaf and branch orientation distributions. Comparisons are made with measured backscattering coefficients from forested areas reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a theoretical {{study of the}} microwave scattering problems in electrically dense discrete random media {{and the development of}} the microwave scattering models with applications to these dense media. A medium is considered electrically dense when the average distance between the scatterers is smaller than the wavelength. In this case, the conventional assumption of independent scattering from the scatterers is no longer valid and the coherence effect from the scatterers should be taken into account. This effect can be included by incorporating the array phase correction factor to the scattering matrix of the scatterers. The array phase correction factor is developed based on the antenna array concept where the overall phase contributions from the correlated scatterers are considered. In this study, the array phase correction factor for spherical scatterers developed by Chuah et. al. (1996) is generalized to non -spherical scatteres with either prescribed or random orientation. Theoretical analysis of the array factor for various frequencies, valume fractions and scattering angles is also carried out. In addition to the coherence effect, the near field interaction between the scatterers should also be incorporated in the scattering theory for a dense medium. For spherical scatterers, this near field interaction effect is considered through the amplitude correction where the range dependent terms in the exact expression of the scattered field of Mie scatterers are included. For disks, <b>needles</b> and <b>cylinders,</b> since the overall scattered field of a scatterer is approximated by integrating the scattered fields from each volume element of the scatterer, the near field interaction effect is considered by including not only the near field amplitude term of the scattered fields (as the amplitude correction) but also the higher order terms in the phase of the scattered fields (as the Fresnel phase correction). For the application of the theoretical model in a dense medium embedded with spherical scatterers such as now, a scattering problem from a single layer of Mie scatterers bounded both on top and bottom by rough interfaces characterized by the IEM model is considered. Theoretical analysis of the model with the amplitude and the array phase corrections is carried out with comparison to the predictions of the dense medium matrix doubling model. In addition, the model predictions are also compared with laboratory and snow field measurement data. Encouraging results are obtained where good agreement with the snow measurement data for co-polarization returns is observed. For cross-polarization returns, more high order terms are found to be necessary for better model predictions. For the study of scattering mechanisms in a vegetation medium, the single layer model is extended to a multilayer model. The leaves, branches and trunks are modelled by simple geometrical shapes such as disks, <b>needles</b> and <b>cylinders.</b> The IEM model is again used to characterize the ground surface. Theoretical studies {{of the effects of the}} array phase, the amplitude and the Fresnel phase corrections on the phase matrices of disks, <b>needles</b> and <b>cylinders</b> are presented and good agreement is obtained between the theoretical results and the backscattering cross section measurement of rods, disks, birch stick and aspen leaf. The phase matrices are then applied in the backscatter model and theoretical analysis of the backscattering returns from both the single layer and the multilayer models is carried out. Three types of forests are chosen for the theoretical study of the multilayer model: temperate coniferous forest, tropical deciduous forest and tropical evergreen forest. Various dominat scattering contributions from the vegetation are identified and siscussed. Good agreement is obtained between model predictions and multi-frequency, multi-angle and multi-polarization measurement data for Japanese Cypress, soybean and wheat canopies, boreal forest, walnut orchard and Sugi coniferous trees. In conclusion, it is generally found that the arry phase correction is necessary for an electrically dense medium. In addition, near field interactions such as the amplitude correction and the Fresnel phase correction are also vital in the dense medium models. Good agreement of the model predictions with the available measurement results validates the applicability of the models in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{scattered}} fields from nonspherical seatterers {{is becoming an}} important subject particularly {{in the area of}} theoretical modeling of microwave backscatter from vegetation. The generalized Rayleigh-Gans approximation has been widely used in the calculation of scattered fields from scatterers where at least one of its dimensions is comparably smaller than the wavelength. In such calculations, far-field approximations are used, which are not accurate when the observation points are in the Fresnel and near-field regions of the scatterer. Hence, the effects of Fresnel phase and amplitude corrections for the scattered field of circular disks, <b>needles,</b> and <b>cylinders</b> have been examined and shown to be significant in the calculation of closely spaced scatterers. However, the effects of Fresnel corrections in the scattered fields from general ellipsoids and elliptic disks have not yet been studied. In this paper, the scattered fields from general ellipsoids and elliptic disks are, formulated based on the generalized Rayleigh-Gans approximation for cases with and without Fresnel corrections. Theoretical analysis shows that the Fresnel effects are important particularly at larger frequencies and at the null locations in the plots of the backscattering cross section. These effects become more important as the ellipticity of the scatterer increases. Comparisons with measurement data demonstrate that the calculated results with Fresnel corrections provide a better match compared with those without...|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{characteristics of}} radar return from vegetation targets are investigated through a simulation study {{based upon the}} first-order scattered field. For simulation purposes, the vegetation targets are modeled as a layer of randomly oriented and spaced finite <b>cylinders,</b> <b>needles,</b> or discs, {{or a combination of}} them. The finite cylinder is used to represent a branch or a trunk, the needle for a stem or a coniferous leaf, and the disc for a decidous leaf. For a plane wave illuminating a vegetation canopy, simulation results show that the signal returned from a layer of disc- or needle-shaped leaves follows the Gamma distribution, and that the signal returned from a layer of branches resembles the log normal distribution. The Gamma distribution also represents the signal returned from a layer of a mixture of branches and leaves regardless of the leaf shapes. Results also indicate that the polarization state does not {{have a significant impact on}} signal distribution...|$|R
40|$|A {{vegetation}} medium can {{generally be}} modeled. as a discrete random medium where scatterers such as disks, <b>needles,</b> and <b>cylinders</b> {{are used to}} represent the leaves, branches, and trunks. At low frequency, {{it is possible that}} the spacing between the scatterers is comparable or smaller than the wavelength. This medium is considered electrically dense, and the coherence effect from the scatterers indicates that the assumption of independent scattering of the scatterers is no longer valid. In addition, in a dense vegetation medium where the scatterers are close to each other, near field interactions should also be considered, In this paper, the coherence effect from the various correlated scatterers is taken into account by introducing the array phase correction to the phase matrices of the scatterers. For the near field interaction effect, both the Fresnel phase correction and the amplitude correction are considered. The Fresnel phase correction is incorporated by including the higher order terms in the phase of the scattered field from a scatterer, whereas the amplitude correction is obtained from the near field amplitude term of the scattered field, These corrected phase matrices for the disks, needles, and branches are applied in the single layer random discrete medium where the second order iterative radiative transfer solutions are obtained. Theoretical analyses of the effects of these corrections to the backscattering returns for various volume fractions, frequencies, incident angles, orientations, and sizes are carried out. It is found that the array phase correction is important for an electrically dense medium, whereas the amplitude and the Fresnel phase corrections are required when the frequency increases and enters into the Fresnel region. Good agreements are obtained from the comparisons of the theoretical predictions with the multifrequency and multipolarization measurement results of the Japanese cypress and boreal forest...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{results of}} phenol {{degradation}} in water induced by a positive pulsed streamer corona discharge are presented. A novelty {{of this work}} is studying an influence of the pulsed streamer corona discharge enhanced with the Fenton reaction on phenol degradation in the tap water. To our knowledge, the tap water has never been used before in such studies. The positive pulsed streamer corona discharge was generated between a stressed <b>needle</b> and a <b>cylinder,</b> both immersed in the water contaminated with phenol (0. 62 mM). Iron ions {{in the form of}} FeSO 4 (0. 08 mM) were added to the water. They were supposed to enhance the phenol degradation through the Fenton reaction. It was found that the Fenton reaction enhanced significantly phenol degradation rate only in the distilled water of low conductivity (1 μS/cm). In the tap water, which has relatively high conductivity (600 μS/cm), the Fenton reaction was weak and had to be initiated by lowering the initial pH from alkaline (7. 6) to acidic (4. 1). During phenol degradation the water acidity increased due to organic acids, which were the secondary products of the phenol degradation. The primary products of the phenol degradation were dihydroxyphenols. Keywords—streamer corona discharge, water purification, Fenton reaction, phenol I...|$|R
30|$|We used a MaxCore System (MC 1416) by BARD Biopsy Systems: {{penetration}} depth 22  mm, length and {{width of the}} original biopsy rift: 19  ×  2.1  mm. In a first step the original needle notch including the rift was cut away which shortened the needle by ca. 22  mm. We then manufactured a positioning frame to keep the needle under tension and mounted it on a fine metal milling machine. Two parallel 19  mm in length rifts were then milled into the needle’s shaft {{in such a way}} that a 100  µm thin sheet remained standing between them. The tip of the needle was then sharpened in the original angle to reconstitute a fully functioning <b>needle.</b> The cutting <b>cylinder,</b> which is running over the needle was adapted to the new needle length and the notch sharpened accordingly. No other modification to the biopsy system were necessary. The modifications were neither initiated by BARD Biopsy Systems nor are they covered by the company’s liability regulations. The modified biopsy system is not certified for in patient use. Prototype testing has been performed with ex vivo radical prostatectomy samples within this research project approved by our local ethics committee (328 / 15). Samples were biopsied within 15  min after resection. The patient gave written consent prior to the procedure.|$|R
40|$|Gymnosperms have various {{structure}} of needles. These needles are often exposed to different light conditions {{in various parts}} of the crown. Therefore, coniferous trees began to adapt to a different intensity of solar radiation by changing the morphology and anatomy of needles. These adaptations concern the tree both in the stands and urban environment. This bachelor's thesis is focused on comparing characteristics of sunny and shady needles of Scots pine. The aim consists in determining the effect of light on the anatomical and morphological {{structure of}} needles, which are located in different world sides and within different levels of the crown. Needles undertook measurement of parameters as follows: needle width and thickness, <b>needle</b> area, central <b>cylinder</b> area, xylem and phloem area. World sides were found having no effect on anatomical and morphological structure of needles. In contrast, needles at the base of the crown (shaded) had a smaller area comparing with those needles from the top of the crown (sun). The solar radiation amount is one of the main factors determining the anatomical and morphological structure of needles. A sudden change in lighting conditions (thinning, seedlings remove, building removal) may therefore lead to the crown stress and necrosis. For this reason, while planting in urban environment, it is necessary to consider the light demands of trees as well as light conditions, in which the plants had been grown...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrated}} that a thin aluminium disk {{can be used}} as nozzle to electrospin PVA nanofibres on a large-scale. A schematic of this electrospinning system and a SEM image of as-spun PVA nanofibers are shown in Figure 1. The lower part of the disk is inside a bath containing the polymer solution, which is connected to a high voltage powder supply. During electrospinning, the disk rotates and picks up a thin layer of electrically charged PVA solution. A large number of fibres are then electrospun simultaneously from two sides of tile disk and deposited on the electrode collector. With the small prototype unit we used, the fibre production rate can be as high as 6. 0 which is about 270 times higher than that of a corresponding normal needle electrospinning system (0. 022 g/hr). The effects of appliedb voltage, the distance between the disk nozzle and collector, and PVA concentration on the fibre morphology were examined. The dependency of fibre diameter on the PVA concentration showed a similar trend to that for a conventional electrospinning system using a syringe needle nozzle, but the diameter distribution was wider for the disk electrospun fibres in this study. The profiles of electric field strength in disk electrospinning showed considerable dependence on the disk thickness, with a thin disk exhibiting similar electric field profile to that of a needle electrospinning system, but a thick disk (cylinder) exhibiting levelled electric field between the disk and the collector. PVA nanofibres electrospun from disk electrospinning were compared to that electrospun from syringe <b>needle</b> and metal <b>cylinder</b> nozzles...|$|R
5000|$|In 1741, Jacques de Vaucanson, a French {{inventor}} {{who designed}} and built automated mechanical toys, was appointed inspector of silk factories. [...] Between 1747 and 1750, he tried to automate Bouchon’s mechanism. In Vaucanson's mechanism, the hooks that were to lift the warp threads were selected by long pins or [...] "needles", which were pressed against a sheet of punched paper that was draped around a perforated cylinder. Specifically, each hook passed at a right angle through an eyelet of a <b>needle.</b> When the <b>cylinder</b> was pressed against the array of needles, some of the needles, pressing against solid paper, would move forward, which in turn would tilt the corresponding hooks. The hooks that were tilted would not be raised, so the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would remain in place; however, the hooks that were not tilted, would be raised, and the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would also be raised. By placing his mechanism above the loom, Vaucanson eliminated the complicated system of weights and cords (tail cords, simple, pulley box, etc.) {{that had been used}} to select which warp threads were to be raised during weaving. Vaucanson also added a ratchet mechanism to advance the punched paper each time that the cylinder was pushed against the row of hooks. [...] However, Vaucanson’s loom was not successful, probably because, like Bouchon’s mechanism, it could not control enough warp threads to make sufficiently elaborate patterns to justify the cost of the mechanism.|$|R

This bakery alone sends every day to the trenches two hundred thousand loaves made from the wheat of western Canada! Of all sights {{to be seen in}} this place, however, the reclamation [...] "plant" [...] is the most wonderful. It covers acres. Everything which is broken in war, from a pair of officer's field-glasses to a nine-inch howitzer carriage is mended here--if it can be mended. Here, when a battle-field is cleared, every article that can possibly be used again is brought; and the manager pointed with pride to the furnaces in his power-house, which formerly burned coal and now are fed with refuse--broken wheels of gun-carriages, sawdust, and even old shoes. Hundreds of French girls and even German prisoners are resoling and patching shoes with the aid of American machinery, and even the uppers of such as are otherwise hopeless are cut in spirals into laces. Tunics, breeches, and overcoats are mended by tailors; rusty camp cookers are retinned, and in the foundries the precious scraps of cast iron are melted into braziers to keep Tommy in the trenches warm. In the machine-shops the injured guns and cannon are repaired. German prisoners are working there, too. At a distance, in their homely grey tunics, with their bullet-shaped heads close-cropped and the hairs standing out like the <b>needles</b> of a <b>cylinder</b> of a music-box, they had the appearance of hard citizens who had become rather sullen convicts. Some wore spectacles. A closer view revealed that most of them were contented, and some actually cheerful. None, indeed, seemed more cheerful than a recently captured group I saw later, who were actually building the barbed-wire fence that was to confine them.|$|R
40|$|Citation: Matthews, Howard David and Dial, Thomas E. The {{induction}} motor. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1904. Introduction:The {{induction motor}} {{is a type}} of alternating current motor in which the magnetic flux is furnished by either a single phase or a polyphase current. Consider the action of a compass suspended over a magnetic field, the needle thus suspended will take a position parallell to the lines of force, which flow from pole to pole. Now if the nagnet be rotated the needle will change position relative to it. If the magnet be substituted for a four pole electro-magnet as shown in Fig. 1 Plate 1 and a current of electricity be allowed to flow about either of the sets of poles, and the needle be allowed to swing freely in the center, it will set its self parallel to the lines if a current is flowing in all four poles at the same time this needle will set itself diagonally half way between the sets of poles, as illustrated by Fig. 2. Plate 1. It is now easily conceivable that, if one of these currents, in the windings of the poles is becoming weaker as the other is growing stronger, t the needle will be attracted to the former until the flux reaches its maximum value. Where an alternating current is used this process of rapidly changing from maximum to minimum tends to rotate the <b>needle.</b> If,now, a <b>cylinder</b> consisting of copper conductors be used, instead of a needle, the machine becomes an Induction Motor. The direction of rotation is determined by the phase relation of the currents, The direction of rotation may be reversed by interchanging and two wires of a three phase three wire circuit. Thus by means of polyphase currents it is very easy to produce rotating fields...|$|R
