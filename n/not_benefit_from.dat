5|$|There {{are many}} types of heat {{treating}} processes available to steel. The most common are annealing, quenching, and tempering. Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the eutectoid composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> heat treatment.|$|E
5|$|There {{had already}} been public debate {{on the fate of}} retired cricketers, and {{counties}} had improved pay and conditions for their professional players. For example, several counties, including Yorkshire, had instituted winter pay before Pullin's writings were published. However, former players did <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> these reforms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War the operas began to be {{performed}} in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music {{in the way that}} Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 Vespers were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the Selva morales and Missa e Salmi volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.|$|E

50|$|Laches argues {{against the}} need for {{fighting}} in armour by claiming that the Spartans do not practice it; the instructors that Laches has seen are not brave soldiers and so have <b>not</b> <b>benefitted</b> <b>from</b> this knowledge; and it causes cowards to take foolish and damaging military risks.|$|R
5|$|The Chinese used chariots for horse-based warfare {{until light}} cavalry forces became common during the Warring States era (402221 BC). A major {{proponent of the}} change to riding horses from chariots was Wu Ling, c.320 BC. However, {{conservative}} forces in China often opposed change, and cavalry never became as dominant as in Europe. Cavalry in China also did <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the additional cachet attached to being the military branch dominated by the nobility.|$|E
5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a business, on the {{condition}} that the nephew would pay the uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate. As executrix she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of privity would not apply.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E
50|$|Joda {{is a city}} in the Kendujhar {{district}} {{of the state of}} Odisha, India. The area has rich iron ore deposits and the economy centres on the large-scale production of steel.

5|$|The {{bill passed}} through the Senate {{practically}} without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased {{by the time it}} reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank, and those of the agrarian lifestyle would <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> it. Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from The Federalist Papers. Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill. The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small size does <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} Mary's reign were {{consistently}} wet. The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine. Another {{problem was the}} decline of the Antwerp cloth trade. Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> Spain's enormously lucrative trade with the New World. The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone illicit trade or piracy against her husband. In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued Northumberland's policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities. She granted a royal charter to the Muscovy Company, whose first governor was Sebastian Cabot, and commissioned a world atlas from Diogo Homem. Adventurers such as John Lok and William Towerson sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.|$|E
50|$|They {{were almost}} entirely provincials, {{especially}} from the Danube provinces where about half the Roman army was deployed. These Danubians mostly came from Pannonia, Moesia, Thrace, Illyria and Dalmatia. They were generally far less wealthy than the landowning Italians (<b>not</b> <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> centuries of inherited wealth) and they rarely held non-military posts.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of the AIF's {{formation}} training was rudimentary and performed mainly at unit-level. There were no formal schools and volunteers proceeded straight from recruiting stations to their assigned units, which were still in the process of being established. Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed quickly into collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, drill and musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and lacked realism, meaning that commanders did <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> handling their troops under battlefield conditions.|$|E

There were no formal schools and volunteers proceeded straight from recruiting stations to their assigned units, which were still in the process of being established. Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. Camps were established in every state including at Enoggera (Queensland), Liverpool (New South Wales), Broadmeadows (Victoria), Brighton (Tasmania), Morphettville (South Australia) and Blackboy Hill (Western Australia). In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others—such as the 5th Battalion—spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still quite rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed quickly into collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, drill and musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and they lacked realism, meaning that commanders did <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> handling their troops under battlefield conditions.|$|E
5|$|Several minor {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the Upper Ward under Victoria. Anthony Salvin rebuilt Wyatville's grand staircase, with Edward Blore constructing a new private chapel within the State Apartments. Salvin also rebuilt the State Dining Room following a serious fire in 1853. Ludwig Gruner assisted {{in the design of the}} Queen's Private Audience Chamber in the south range. Blore and Salvin also did extensive work in the Lower Ward, under the direction of Prince Albert, including the Hundred Steps leading down into Windsor town, rebuilding the Garter, Curfew and Salisbury towers, the houses of the Military Knights and creating a new Guardhouse. George Gilbert Scott rebuilt the Horseshoe Cloister in the 1870s. The Norman Gatehouse was turned into a private dwelling for Sir Henry Ponsonby. Windsor Castle did <b>not</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> many of the minor improvements of the era, however, as Victoria disliked gaslight, preferring candles; electric lighting was only installed in limited parts of the castle at the end of her reign. Indeed, the castle was famously cold and draughty in Victoria's reign, but it was connected to a nearby reservoir, with water reliably piped into the interior for the first time.|$|E
