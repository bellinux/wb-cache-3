5|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Clarke {{established}} good order in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble so long as the policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> their <b>return</b> to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|R

He took no <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> Tom's <b>return,</b> being too entirely absorbed in the cut and thrust,--the solemn one, two, three, four; and Tom, not without a slight feeling of alarm at Mr. Poulter's fixed eye and hungry-looking sword, which seemed impatient for something else to cut besides the air, admired the performance from as great a distance as possible. It was not until Mr. Poulter paused and wiped the perspiration from his forehead, that Tom felt the full charm of the sword-exercise, and wished it to be repeated.|$|R

I believe there is no portion of our whole army better prepared to contest a battle than there is within my district, and I am very much mistaken if I have not got the confidence of officers and men.

5000|$|In any case, Postumus' {{banishment}} did ensure Tiberius' priority as {{the heir}} of Augustus. Tacitus reports {{a rumor that}} Augustus paid a highly covert visit to the island in 13 AD to apologise to his adopted son and to give him <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> plans to <b>return</b> him to Rome. Augustus allegedly travelled to Planasia with a trusted friend, Paullus Fabius Maximus, and swore him to secrecy about the matter; Maximus then told his wife, Marcia, who mentioned it to Livia.

Cassius Dio's version [...] reports the island visit as fact, though the brief account is likely based on Tacitus' account [...] and does not mention Fabius and Marcia.

She had simply been told that she was to be Lady Linlithgow's companion,--without salary, indeed,--but receiving shelter, guardianship, and bread and meat in return for her services.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer and a remanufacturer. The market demands and the product returns are stochastic and are correlated with each other. The used products are converted into “as-good-as-new” products and used, together with new products, to satisfy the market demand. The remanufacturing process takes time and is subject to a random yield. Remanufactured products are pushed into the manufacturer’s inventory. It is assumed that the manufacturer exploits the order-up-to policy to determine its brand-new production quantity. We compute {{the benefit of the}} manufacturer obtaining advance <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the product <b>return</b> quantities from the remanufacturer and demonstrate that the lead times, random yields and parameters describing the returns play a significant role. The interesting and counter-intuitive result is that increasing the lead time at the remanufacturer can increase the benefit. It is also shown that Bullwhip is generated even if both the demand and the return processes are a white noise process. Analytical results suggest that there is a fundamental underlying trade-off in a CLSC, which could be a barrier against the spread of CLSC...|$|R
