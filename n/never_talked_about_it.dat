500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and didn't think about it at the time. When she told Lennon he said, [...] "There's only one thing for it Cyn, we'll have to get married".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Cornell {{said the}} major {{change with the}} {{reformed}} Soundgarden {{was a lack of}} alcohol: [...] "The biggest difference I noticed... and we haven't even really talked about it: there are no bottles of Jack Daniel's around or beers. And we <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it...</b> it's just not there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wainwright {{identified}} as gay while a teenager. In 1999, he told Rolling Stone {{that his father}} recognized his homosexuality early on. [...] "We'd drive around in the car, he'd play 'Heart of Glass' and I'd sort of mouth the words, pretend to be Blondie. Just a sign of many other things to come as well." [...] Wainwright later said in another interview that his [...] "mother and father could not even handle me being gay. We <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> really." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a first-rate}} soldier," [...] the man said, [...] "and I expect {{he will get}} the first vacancy among the sergeants. We all think {{he has been an}} officer, though he <b>never</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He's the best-tempered fellow possible, but you can never get him to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the past. However, that makes no {{difference}} to us." ...|$|R

5000|$|From the {{way that}} her family members (father, mother, brother and sister) look at her, Agnes is sure that they know her guilty secret—but <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> As the reader learns, five years before Agnes was sent to Birmingham, Alabama in order to study {{stenography}} at a business school, for which purpose her father gave her fifty dollars. Instead, however, {{she went to a}} [...] "beauty-culture school" [...] and learned to be a manicurist.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{this time}} he met two composers who were to be {{important}} influences: John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. His friendship with Cage began in 1949 when Cage was visiting Paris. Cage introduced Boulez to two publishers (Heugel and Amphion) who agreed to take his recent pieces; Boulez helped to arrange a private performance of Cage’s Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano. When Cage returned to New York they began an intense, six-year correspondence {{about the future of}} music. In 1952 Stockhausen arrived in Paris to study with Messiaen. Although Boulez knew no German and Stockhausen no French, the rapport between them was instant: [...] "A friend translated [...] we gesticulated wildly... We talked about music all the time—in a way I've <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> with anyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Part II (On the Run)" [...] {{was written}} by Jay-Z, James Fauntleroy, Timbaland and J-Roc, while the {{production}} was handled by the latter two. It contains a sample of [...] "Believe in Me" [...] by American band One Way and Jay-Z uses Juvenile's [...] "Back That Azz Up" [...] flow when he rhymes [...] "Push your ma'fucka wig back, I did that/I been wilding since a Juve." [...] "Part II (On the Run)" [...] {{is viewed as a}} sequel to Beyoncé and Jay-Z's collaboration [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] (2002), when rumors about the pair dating started, as before that neither artist had <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The lyrics of the song were revealed by Jay-Z prior to its official release on June 27, 2013 thru a Samsung smartphone application. However, on July 4, 2013, the song leaked on the Internet prior to its official premiere.|$|E
2500|$|His unit's {{actions were}} largely {{forgotten}} or unknown. [...] Of his war experience, his wife Lucy said, [...] "He <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Never." [...] In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, The Ardennes: The Battle of the Bulge. Author Hugh M. Cole mentioned Bouck's platoon in passing, which upset platoon member William James (Tsakanikas). He contacted Bouck and encouraged his former commanding officer {{to get his}} men their proper recognition. Bouck contacted his former division commander, Maj. Gen. Walter Lauer, who nominated Bouck for a Silver Star. [...] To Bouck's surprise, the Silver Star arrived in Bouck's mailbox in June 1966, but no other man was recognized, which upset Bouck. He was shortly afterwards interviewed by John S. D. Eisenhower for his book The Bitter Woods, in which {{the actions of the}} unit were told in detail. Eisenhower became the Ambassador to Belgium and hosted Bouck {{and other members of the}} platoon when they visited Lanzerath in December 1969.|$|E
50|$|Harold {{attempts}} {{a relationship}} with Iris, but Kate threatens her away during a family dinner. The next day, Harold flies into a psychotic rage and rapes and kills his own mother, who he thinks committed suicide. A dazed, traumatized Harold then goes for a ride {{with some of his}} partners-in-crime, who are afraid he, in the mental state he is, lets information of any crime that might involve them, and make sure he <b>never</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't forget," [...] the boy said. [...] "I <b>never</b> do <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before him; {{it makes}} him angry. I don't know why, but it does." ...|$|R
50|$|After a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} (consisting of Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams), Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth), Greg Phillipe (Lochlyn Munro), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall)) accidentally hit {{an old man with}} their car they decide to dump his body in a lake and <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> again (in a spoof of I Know What You Did Last Summer). A year later a person with a Scream mask kills them one by one.|$|R
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Haggard {{recorded}} [...] "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," [...] {{also written}} by Liz Anderson {{with her husband}} Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: [...] "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all that much.... I {{could tell he was}} in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they're gonna be about the third row down—and say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'" [...] Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: [...] "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kinney {{said that}} there are lyrics on the album that deal with {{original}} vocalist Layne Staley. He elaborated, [...] "There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. And there's a lot to address, with all of that stuff coming to the forefront. A lot has happened since 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot has happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 2003 season, {{his last}} in the majors, Henderson {{discussed}} his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career: [...] "Each and every day I set a record, but we <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We'll <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a home run hitter 24/7. Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays. You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would {{look at it as}} a fantastic career. Instead, Rickey thinks people want Rickey to quit more than anything." ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes I don't think I'm a feeb at all. I play in {{the band}} and read music. We're all {{supposed}} to be feebs in the band except the leader. He's crazy. We know <b>it,</b> but we <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> except amongst ourselves. His job is politics, too, and we don't want him to lose it. I play the drum. They can't get along without me in this institution. I was sick once, so I know. It's a wonder the drooling ward didn't break down while I was in hospital.|$|R
5000|$|Today I {{am going}} to refer quite frankly to a very grave chapter. We can mention it now among {{ourselves}} quite openly and yet we shall <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in public. I'm referring to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. Most of you will know what it's like to see 100 corpses side by side or 500 corpses or 1,000 of them. To have coped with this and—except for cases of human weakness—to have remained decent, that has made us tough. This is an unwritten—never to be written—and yet glorious page in our history.|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{father never}} took to his farm again, but hung about the out stations, doing a job {{here and there}} for his grub.

60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived a king and queen who loved each other dearly, {{and would have been}} {{perfectly}} happy if they had only had a little son or daughter to play with. They <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and always pretended that {{there was nothing in the}} world to wish for; but, sometimes when they looked at other people's children, their faces grew sad, and their courtiers and attendants knew the reason why.|$|E
50|$|Andy {{claims to}} have been born and raised in Simsbury, Connecticut. His birth name was Walter Bernard Jr., but after his younger brother was born, his parents decided that the new baby better {{embodied}} that name and should be named after his father instead. Thus, the original Walter was renamed Andrew, a name taken from a book of baby names. He {{claims to have}} been an obese child, though he <b>never</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It can be assumed that Andy's family was considerably wealthy growing up, as he admits that whenever anybody wanted something they would write it on a list for the housekeeper to get.|$|R
5000|$|Matthew Weiner {{compared}} Peggy's {{standing at}} Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce {{to his own}} standing while working under David Chase on The Sopranos. Jon Hamm commended the writers for adding in the conversation that references the child Peggy gave away, calling it [...] "heartbreaking" [...] for Peggy. Matthew Weiner said, [...] "they can acknowledge that that happened. Even though they had sworn to <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> together, {{this is the place}} that they can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I also think that Don’s interest in it is really a big part of it." [...] Weiner elaborated on Draper's dislike for Duck, attributing it to Duck's [...] "lack of understanding of creative" [...] and [...] "his alcoholism", while citing Duck's sexual relationship with Peggy, who Weiner said could be Don's daughter figure in that moment.|$|R

If {{anything}} went wrong, I never wasted any time in telling him about it, and I guess it was one reason he liked me. Some of the people up here didn't understand him, kow-towed to him, they were scared of him, and if he thought they had something up their sleeves {{he looked as if}} he were going to eat 'em alive. Regular fighting eyes, the kind that get inside of a man and turn the light on. And he sat so still--made you ashamed of yourself. Well, he was a born fighter, went from Harvard into the Rebellion and was left for dead at Seven Oaks, where one of the company found him and saved him. He set that may up for life, and <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> either. See what he wrote on the bottom--'To my friend, Claude Ditmar, Stephen Chippering.' And believe me, when he once called a man a friend he never took it back. I know one thing, I'll never get another friend like him." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} written in 1995 {{by two of the}} founders of the {{original}} Dixie Chicks band, the Erwin sisters, who were not strangers to writing music and performing (they are now known as Martie Maguire and Emily Robison). Robison wrote most of the song, and Maguire supplied the bridge. It is a very autobiographical song, about the breakup of Robison's and Maguire's parents and their subsequent divorce. In one interview, when asked <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Robison said that their parents generally [...] "sweep it under the rug", saying, [...] "They know <b>it's</b> <b>about</b> them, but whispers we <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> laughs They don't want to bring it up because they're still weird around each other.

He avowed the vices that he had, and that others [...] have; but he was no hypocrite. He was neither more nor less [...] abominable than they; he was only more frank, and more consistent, [...] and sometimes he was profound {{in the midst of his}} depravity.

Some of the effects of the criminal justice system on children and their families can be seen from the following quotes: I hate you. Look what you have done. Now he's in prison I've lost everything.

50|$|After {{moving to}} Philadelphia, Father Divine's wife, Penninah, died. The exact date is not known, because Father Divine <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or even {{acknowledged}} her death. However, it occurred sometime in 1943, and biographers believe Penninah's death rattled Father Divine, making him {{aware of his}} own mortality.

50|$|Back in the present, Ricky and Sears {{reveal that}} the Chowder Society <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> again, not even with each other.

Whereas Sears is dubious, both Ricky and Don believe that Alma and Eva are the same woman and that her ghost has returned to seek revenge.|$|E
50|$|In later years, Bennett again {{developed}} {{major health}} problems. “He <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but always showed joy,” Boudreau states. “It wasn’t just a business relationship we had, {{it was more}} than just music. We were pals, and he would treat me as a son.” Bennett did not slow his output, creating original works for the nation’s bicentennial celebrations and accepting commissions from a variety of sources, including a Presbyterian church in Florida, for which he accepted only a modest fee.|$|E

You could be respected. You could be honored. You could feel that you had actually done something that made a difference. I {{want to tell you that}} is why I was in love with mediation.

And if he hadn't needed more drugs I would have been just one more news report, where you see the parents grieving for their daughter.And I was singing hymns, as I say in the song, because he told me to.
