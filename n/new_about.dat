5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing <b>new</b> <b>about</b> herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something <b>new</b> <b>about</b> herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

He had {{to spend a lot}} of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people—including artists, musicians, and directors—who had an {{interesting}} perspective on Madonna and the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present anything <b>new</b> <b>about</b> the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E
5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then <b>new</b> <b>about</b> music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club {{was less}} {{positive}} about the episode, grading it as a B-. He praised the early scene where Amy was abandoned for the [...] "zingy dialogue" [...] but found himself [...] "enjoying the cleverness of the explanation without really buying into it". He expressed confusion at how the time-shift worked and thought the problem was too thin {{to carry out the}} whole episode, and that Amy's abandonment and love for Rory which was left [...] " [...] pull it off". He thought that the two Amys seen in the mini episodes [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were more fun to watch and the episode did not reveal anything <b>new</b> <b>about</b> Amy and Rory. However, he praised how the decision the Doctor had to make was portrayed.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Kapoor co-starred in Vijay Krishna Acharya's action-thriller Tashan, {{where she}} met her future husband in actor Saif Ali Khan. Although a poll (conducted by Bollywood Hungama) named it the most anticipated release of the year, the film underperformed {{at the box office}} grossing [...] in India. After providing her voice for the character of Laila, the love interest of a street dog named Romeo, in the Yash Raj Films and Walt Disney Pictures animated film Roadside Romeo, Kapoor played a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful in Rohit Shetty's comedy Golmaal Returns. A sequel to the 2006 film , the film had an ambivalent reception from critics, and Kapoor received mixed reviews. The Indian Express believed the screenplay was derivative, concluding: [...] "There is nothing particularly <b>new</b> <b>about</b> a suspicious wife keeping tabs on her husband, and there is nothing particularly new in the way Kareena plays it."

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in February 2011. He thought that the two plots didn't tie in {{together}} but said of the episode that [...] "while I didn't exactly love it, I'm happy it exists". He thought that the scenes with D'Sora and Data were [...] "very, very odd", and that the ending didn't reveal anything <b>new</b> <b>about</b> Data at all. The subplot involving the nebula was described as [...] "an interesting hook, but it doesn't go anywhere". He gave the episode a B grade. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website Jammer's Reviews described the main plot as [...] "pleasant enough" [...] but couldn't understand D'Sora's motivations in pursuing the relationship with Data. He described the subplot as [...] "pure perfunctory filler barely worthy of mention" [...] and didn't know why Picard piloted the shuttle instead of a more experienced shuttle pilot. He gave the episode a score of 2.5/4.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} David H. Goodman, while being directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer veteran David Solomon. [...] Goodman used Cinderella's storyline to produce more character development for Emma, a character with no flashbacks to draw upon. Morrison stated that Ashley/Cinderella [...] "is definitely a character Emma relates to." [...] Executive producer Steve Pearlman developed the series to have standalone episodes that still encouraged viewers to watch each week. In an interview, he used [...] "The Price of Gold" [...] {{as an example of}} this, as the episode [...] "introduce Cinderella in the first act and we resolve the story in the final act. [...] Emma portion of that story that kind of continues." [...] Pearlman added that [...] "there are other twists and turns along the way that don't {{have anything to do with}} the specifics of the Cinderella story that are additive to our character development. Hopefully, what we're doing over the course of the season is continuing to build each week, give the audience something <b>new</b> <b>about</b> our main characters that keeps them coming back." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily learn anything <b>new</b> <b>about</b> Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and even though I knew the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down." [...] Another IGN article ranked [...] "All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues" [...] the 33rd best Lost episode.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy surrounding the term salsa {{and the idea}} that it is its own distinct genre.

[...] Similarly, New York native Tito Puente stated: [...] "The only salsa I know is sold in a bottle called ketchup. I play Cuban music."

From the STEPS {{building}} (2010), to Seeley G. Mudd, to Zoellner, modern architecture has made good, though respectful, inroads. Yet with Linderman, the Grace Hall palaestra (1942, from E. G.

Even a small 4 acre section of the campus remains from the 19th century when it was known as [...] "University Park", {{at the corner of}} Packer and Brodhead Avenues. However, as education is an ever advancing and changing field, work always remains. Dr. John D. Simon, Chemist, assumes office for the fall semester, 2015, as Lehigh's 14th President.|$|E
