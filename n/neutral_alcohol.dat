25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a <b>neutral</b> <b>alcohol</b> (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E
2500|$|In organic chemistry, the hydroboration–oxidation {{reaction}} is a two-step organic reaction that converts an alkene into a <b>neutral</b> <b>alcohol</b> by the net addition of water across the double bond. The hydrogen and hydroxyl group are {{added in a}} syn addition leading to cis stereochemistry. Hydroboration–oxidation is an anti-Markovnikov reaction, with the hydroxyl group attaching to the less-substituted carbon. [...] The reaction was first reported by Herbert C. Brown in the late 1950s and it was recognized in his receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe is {{traditionally}} prepared from a distillation of <b>neutral</b> <b>alcohol,</b> various herbs, spices and water. Traditional absinthes were redistilled {{from a white}} grape spirit (or eau de vie), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes. The principal botanicals are grande wormwood, green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called [...] "the holy trinity." [...] Many other herbs {{may be used as}} well, such as petite wormwood (Artemisia pontica or Roman wormwood), hyssop, melissa, star anise, angelica, peppermint, coriander, and veronica.|$|E
25|$|The OH {{group is}} not a good leaving group in {{nucleophilic}} substitution reactions, so <b>neutral</b> <b>alcohols</b> do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH2+, the leaving group (water) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with hydrochloric acid to produce tertiary alkyl halides, where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom by unimolecular nucleophilic substitution. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with hydrochloric acid, an activator such as zinc chloride is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using thionyl chloride.|$|R

40|$|A {{difference}} {{was observed in}} the reactivity of alcohols and ethers toward free electrons. Whereas the lowest core-excited state of the negative ion—a ²(n, 3 s²) Feshbach resonance—of the alcohols readily dissociates by losing a hydrogen atom, ethers show no observable signal from this resonance. This difference in reactivity has a parallel in the anomalous shapes and energies of the parent states of the Feshbach resonances, the ¹(n, 3 s) Rydberg states of the <b>neutral</b> <b>alcohols.</b> We explained this anomaly using potential surfaces of the alcohols and ethers calculated using the TD-DFT method {{as a function of}} the dissociation coordinate. The lowest excited state of alcohols was found to be repulsive, whereas a barrier to dissociation was found in the ethers. Rydberg-valence mixing and avoided crossings are decisive in determining the shapes of the potential surfaces. It is concluded that the reactivities of alcohols and ethers toward free electrons are rationalized by assuming that the potential surfaces of the daughter Feshbach resonances closely follow those of the parent Rydberg states, i. e., the lowest Feshbach resonance is repulsive, but a barrier occurs in ethers. The potential surfaces of both the Rydberg states and the Feshbach resonances thus differ dramatically from the non-dissociative surface of the grandparent ²(n ⁻¹) positive ions, despite the nominally non-bonding character of the Rydberg electrons...|$|R

In the present study, we have fabricated multilayer thin film of PVA-borate and chitosan on colloidal particle (MF particle) and monitored the layer-by-layer growth using Zetapotential measurements.

Subsequently,disintegration of multilayer thin film and microcapsules was observed in presence of glucose. We investigated the disassembly of PVA-borate and chitosan self-assembly under CLSM and atomic force microscopy.

40|$|Exposure {{to alcohol}} cues reduces {{the breadth of}} attentional scope, called “virtual myopia”. Past {{research}} has suggested approach motivation as a possible mechanism that underlies this myopia in response to alcohol cues. The current study expanded on these findings by identifying the neural underpinnings {{of the relationship between}} attentional narrowing, approach motivation, and exposure to alcohol cues. Participants completed 32 trials that consisted of <b>neutral</b> or <b>alcohol</b> related stimuli followed by a measure of attentional narrowing (i. e., Navons letter task). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the experiment to assess greater left-frontal hemispheric asymmetry, a measure of approach motivation. Results revealed alcohol cues caused greater “virtual myopia ” as measured by narrowed attentional scope. Greater left-frontal activation to alcohol cues related to greater myopia, suggesting that approach motivation is associated with virtual myopia. Left-frontal activation appears to be a neural correlate of cognitive narrowing related to approach motivation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aim: This {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) study examined reactivity to alcohol, polydrug, marijuana and emotional picture cues in students who were referred to a college alcohol and drug assistance program. Methods: The fMRI data of 10 participants (5 females; 5 males) were collected while they viewed standardized emotional and appetitive cues. Results: Positive and negative emotional cues produced greater activity than neutral cues in the expected brain areas. Compared with <b>neutral</b> cues, <b>alcohol</b> cues produced greater brain activation in the right insula, left anterior cingulate, left caudate and left prefrontal cortex (Z = 2. 01, 1. 86, 1. 82, 1. 81, respectively; P < 0. 05). Drug cues produced significantly greater left prefrontal activity compared with neutral cues, with polydrug cues activating the right insula and marijuana cues activating left anterior cingulate. Conclusions: Students at-risk for alcohol abuse showed neural reactivity to alcohol cues in four brain regions, which is consistent with their greater use of alcohol. Insula activation to appetitive cues may be an early marker of risk for progression to alcohol/drug abuse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{reactions}} of dimethyl ether ions with <b>neutral</b> amino <b>alcohols</b> {{were examined in}} both a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. These ion-molecule reactions produced two types of ions: the protonated species [M + 1]+ and a more complex product at [M + 13]+. The abundance of the [M + 13]+ ions relative {{to that of the}} [M + 1]+ ions decreases with increasing formal interfunctional distance. Multistage collision-activated dissociation techniques were used to characterize the [M + 13]+ product ions, their reactivities, and the mechanisms for their formation and dissociation. In addition, molecular semiempirical calculation methods were used to probe the thermochemistry of these reactions. Reaction at the amino alcohol nitrogen site is favored, and the resulting [M + 13]+ addition products may cyclize for additional stabilization. Comparisons were made among the behavior of related compounds, such as alcohols, diols, amines, and diamines. The alcohols reacted only to form the protonated species, but the diols, amines, and diamines all formed significant amounts of [M + 13]+ ions or related dissociation products...|$|R
