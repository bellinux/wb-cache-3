5|$|At {{the time}} of the release of Mughal-e-Azam, a typical Bollywood film would garner a {{distribution}} fee of 300,000–400,000 (about US$63,000–84,000 in 1960) per territory. Asif insisted that he would sell his film to the distributors at <b>no</b> <b>less</b> than 700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually sold at a price of 1.7million (US$356,000) per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. Thus, it set the record for the highest distribution fee received by any Bollywood film at that time.|$|E
5|$|BioWare's Baldur's Gate {{series was}} <b>no</b> <b>less</b> important, the most {{significant}} D series to be released since the Gold Box era. The games created the most accurate and in-depth D simulation yet, and featured support for up to six-players in cooperative mode. Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E

This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is <b>no</b> <b>less</b> so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

5|$|Lactantius' De Mortibus Persecutorum, a {{political}} Christian pamphlet on the reigns of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, provides valuable but tendentious detail on Constantine's predecessors and early life. The ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret describe the ecclesiastic disputes of Constantine's later reign. Written {{during the reign}} of Theodosius II (408–50AD), a century after Constantine's reign, these ecclesiastic historians obscure the events and theologies of the Constantinian period through misdirection, misrepresentation and deliberate obscurity. The contemporary writings of the orthodox Christian Athanasius and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian Philostorgius also survive, though their biases are <b>no</b> <b>less</b> firm.|$|E
