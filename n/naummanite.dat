40|$|The Kencana Au-Ag low-sulfidation epithermal deposit, {{situated}} in the Neogene magmatic arc of Halmahera, Eastern Indonesia, has an estimated resource of 4. 4 Mt @ 27. 9 g/t Au, containing 4 Moz Au. The deposit, forming part of the Gosowong Goldfield, is the third, and most recently discovered (2002) deposit in the goldfield, after the Gosowong and Toguraci deposits. The Gosowong goldfield is situated {{on the eastern side}} of the NW arm of Halmahera, which is composed of four superimposed volcanic arcs, produced as a result of subduction of the Molucca sea plate beneath Halmahera since the Palaeogene. Lithologies are dominated by andesite to basaltic andesite volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks and diorite intrusions. Epithermal mineralization is hosted by the upper Miocene Gosowong Formation, a series of interbedded volcaniclastic rocks, ignimbrites and coherent andesitic volcanic flows and diorite intrusions. Andesites and diorites are closely temporally related, with andesite emplacement at 3. 73 ± 0. 22 Ma followed by diorite intrusion at 3. 50 Ma. Epithermal mineralization post-dates andesite and diorite emplacement with 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of hydrothermal adularia giving a mean age of 2. 925 ± 0. 026 Ma for the Kencana deposit. The deposit is hosted by two main sub-parallel NW-trending fault structures, (namelyK 1 and K 2) with a strike length of 400 m, a vertical extent of 200 m and dipping 46 °E; joined by link structures, such as K-Link (KL). Bonanza Au-grade zones are located in dilational zones above hematitic volcaniclastic mudstone packages. The deposit does not crop out, but displays a weak surface expression represented by carbonate veining and faults filled with clay and pyrite. Kencana (K 1 vein) shows a complex, multiphase history of formation with numerous brecciation and opening events. Eleven infill types are recognized at Kencana, including wallrock (1), quartz stockwork (2), wallrock breccias with crystalline quartz cement (3), red chalcedony infill (4), massive crystalline quartz (5), massive crystalline quartz breccias (6), cockade-banded quartz-chlorite breccias (7), banded quartz-chlorite (8), banded quartz-adularia (9), grey cryptocrystalline quartz stringer veins (10) and black quartz-molybdenite infill (11). Infill types 1, 2 and 3 are distributed throughout the deposit and are particularly prevalent on the margins of the vein. Types 7, 8 and 9 are the main ore-bearing stages and form the bulk of the central section of the vein. Type 11 infill is most prevalent to the north. Types 4, 5, 6 and 10 are variably and sporadically distributed across the vein. Ore assemblages are dominated by high-fineness electrum and sulfides, with selenides and lesser tellurides and sulfosalts. Chalcopyrite is the most common sulfide mineral, with selenian-galena, sphalerite, bornite and pyrite in order of decreasing abundance. Other accessory minerals include aguilarite and molybdenite, with trace tennantite, arsenian-pyrite, silver and lead tellurides, <b>naummanite</b> and rare bismuth minerals. Gangue minerals are crystalline, microcrystalline and cryptocrystalline quartz, adularia, chlorite and calcite. Ore deposition is interpreted to be the result of a combination of processes (mixing, boiling and cooling), with mixing processes inferred to be of particular importance, based on the presence of high-fineness electrum and selenium-bearing minerals. Evidence for boiling processes is present at Kencana after deposition of infill type 5, including bladed carbonate pseudomorphs and abundant adularia. A general transition from early coarse crystalline quartz to micro- and cryptocrystalline quartz is observed in the paragenetic sequence of the K 1 vein, reflecting an increase in the rate of silica precipitation in silica-saturated fluids. Fluid inclusion data indicate that early crystalline quartz (type 2 c) was precipitated from near-neutral, hot, low salinity, low CO 2 (203. 0 to 248. 8 °C, 0. 1 to 0. 5 wt...|$|E
