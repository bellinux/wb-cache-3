40|$|Objective: Ionizing {{radiation}} produces {{free radicals}} which induce DNA damage and cell death. Origanum vulgare leaf extract (OVLE) {{is a natural}} compound and its capability of scavenging free radicals and its antioxidant activity have been demonstrated by many researchers. In this study, using micronucleus assay, radioprotective effect of OVLE against clastogenic and cytotoxic effect of gamma irradiation has been investigated in mice bone marrow cells. Materials and Methods: OVLE was injected intraperitoneally to the BALB/c mice 1 hr prior to gamma irradiation (3 Gy) at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg. Twenty four hours after irradiation or treatment, animals were killed and smears were prepared from the bone marrow cells. The slides were stained with May Grunwald–Giemsa method and analyzed microscopically. The frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MnPCEs), micronucleated <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (MnNCEs) and cell proliferation ratio PCE/PCE+NCE (polychromatic erythrocyte/polychromatic erythrocyte + <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte)</b> were calculated. Results: The results showed that gamma irradiation (3 Gy) increased the frequency of MnPCEs, MnNCEs and  reduced the PCE/PCE+NCE ratio in mice bone marrow compared to the non-irradiated control group (p< 0. 0001). Injection of OVLE significantly reduced the frequency of MnPCEs (p< 0. 0001) and MnNCEs (p< 0. 05) and increased the PCE/PCE+NCE ratio {{as compared to the}} irradiated control group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: It seems that OVLE with its antioxidant properties and its capability of scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species can reduce the cytotoxic effects of gamma irradiation in mice bone marrow cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{intend to}} study the {{inhibitory}} effect of sulfur compound in Ramsar hot spring mineral on tumor-genesis ability of high natural background radiation. Objective: The radioprotective effect of sulfur compounds was previously shown on radiation-induced chromosomal aberration, micronuclei in mouse bone marrow cells and human peripheral lymphocyte. Ramsar is known for having {{the highest level of}} natural background radiation on Earth. This study was performed to show the radioprotective effect of sulfur-containing Ramsar mineral water on mouse bone marrow cells. Method: Mice were fed three types of water (drinking water, Ramsar radioactive water containing sulfur and Ramsar radioactive water whose sulfur was removed). Ten days after feeding, mice were irradiated by gamma rays (0, 2 and 4 Gy). 48 and 72 hours after irradiating, mice were killed and femurs were removed. Frequency of micronuclei was determined in bone marrow erythrocytes. Results: A significant reduction was shown in the rate of micronuclei polychromatic erythrocyte in sulfur-containing hot spring water compared to sulfur-free water in hot spring mineral water. Gamma irradiation induced significant increases in micronuclei polychromatic erythrocyte (MNPCE) and decreases in polychromatic erythrocyte/polychromatic erythrocyte + <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> ratio (PCEs/ PCEs+NCEs) (P < 0. 001) in sulfur-containing hot spring water compared to sulfur-free hot spring mineral water. Also, apparently {{there was a significant difference}} between drinking water and sulfur-containing hot spring water in micronuclei polychromatic erythrocyte and polychromatic erythrocyte/polychromatic erythrocyte+ <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> ratio. Conclusion: The results indicate that sulfur-containing mineral water could result in a significant reduction in radiation-induced micronuclei representing the radioprotective effect of sulfur compounds...|$|E
40|$|Cyclophosphamide is a chemo-therapeutic agent {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of various cancers and autoimmune diseases. This composition has cytotoxic and clastogenic properties. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the protective effect of methanol extracts of Thymus vulgaris L. against DNA damage induced by cyclophosphamide in mouse bone marrow cells by the micronucleus test. The extract concentrations of 375, 750, 1500 mg/kg were injected intraperitoneally (Ip) into mice for 7 consecutive days. One hour after the last injection, cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg Ip was injected. 24 hours after cyclophosphamide injection, the animals were killed and the samples of bone marrow were prepared and stained using the standard methods. For each sample, 1000 cells of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) and the same number of <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (NCE) and the cells containing their micronucleus were counted. Cyclophosphamide increased the frequency of micronuclei polychromatic erythrocytes (MnPCE) and decreased cell proliferation (PCE/PCE+NCE). All doses of extracts significantly reduced the micronucleus frequency ratio (P< 0. 05). The cells proliferation ratio (PCE/PCE+NCE) was also increased. The best effect in reducing the micronucleus frequency was at 1500 mg/kg dosage.

40|$|Abstract: Hyperglycemia is {{the main}} {{determinant}} of long term diabetic complications mainly through induction of oxidative stress responsible for secondary defects including cancer, infertility etc. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are known to posses the antioxidant potential against the reactive oxygen species. The ability of clinically used TZDs like Rosiglitazone (RSG) and Pioglitazone (PIO) in diabetic complications is {{still need to be}} studied extensively in the literature. In this study, the role of RSG and PIO on the frequency of nuclear and germinal cell damage was studied using bone marrow micronucleus (MN) test, sperm shape abnormality and sperm count in normal animals. The drugs were tested in the three doses (1, 10 and 100 mg/kg) after acute (48 hrs and 72 hrs) and chronic (4 weeks) treatment. The results indicated that RSG has produced significant (p < 0. 01) decrease in P/N (polychromatic and <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes)</b> ratio at 10 and 100 mg/kg without affecting the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes, sperm shape morphology and sperm count. PIO in the tested doses did not induce any change in P/N ratio and sperm count but the higher dose (100 mg/kg) showed suppression of MN in <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> and % sperm shape abnormality compared to the control group...|$|R
40|$|The radioprotective {{effect of}} {{hawthorn}} (Crataegus microphylla) fruit extract against genotoxicity induced by gamma irradiation {{has been investigated}} in mouse bone marrow cells. A single intraperitoneal (ip) administration of hawthorn extract at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg 1 h prior to gamma irradia-tion (2 Gy) reduced the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MnPCEs). All four doses of hawthorn extract significantly reduced the frequencies of MnPCEs and increased the PCE/ PCE+NCE ratio (polychromatic erythrocyte / polychromatic erythrocyte + <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte)</b> in mice bone marrow compared with the non drug-treated irradiated control (p < 0. 02 – 0. 00001). The maxi-mum reduction in MnPCEs was observed in mice treated with extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Adminis-tration of amifostine at dose 100 mg/kg and hawthorn at dose 200 mg/kg reduced the frequency of MnPCE almost 4. 8 and 5. 7 fold; respectively, after being exposed to 2 Gy of gamma rays, compare with the irradiated control group. Crataegus extract exhibited concentration-dependent activity on 1, 1 -diphenyl 2 -picrylhydrazyl free radical showing that Crataegus contained high amounts of phenolic compounds and the HPLC analysis determined that it contained chlorogenic acid, epicatechin and hyperoside.

In this study, the genotoxicity of the lyophilized tincture of H. impetiginosus bark (THI) was evaluated in mouse bone marrow using micronucleus assays. The interaction between THI and genotoxic effects induced by the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin (DXR), was also analyzed. Experimental groups were evaluated 24 to 48 h after treatment with N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (NEU; 50 mg/kg), DXR (5 mg/kg), sodium chloride (NaCl; 150 mM), and THI (0. 5 - 2 g/kg). Antigenotoxic assays were carried out using THI (0. 5 g/kg) in combination with NEU or DXR. Analysis of the micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) indicated {{no significant differences between}} treatment doses of THI (0. 5 - 2 g/kg) and NaCl. Polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE) to <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (NCE) ratios did not indicate any statistical differences between DXR and THI or NaCl, but there were differences between THI and NaCl. A significant reduction in MNPCEs and PCE/NCE ratios was observed when THI was administered in combination with DXR. This study suggested the absence of THI genotoxicity that was dose-, time-, and gender-independent and the presence of moderate systemic toxicity that was dose-independent, but time- and gender-dependent. The combination of THI and DXR also suggested antigenotoxic effects, indicating that THI reduced genotoxic effects induced by chemotherapeutic agents...|$|E
40|$|Background: Interactions of free {{radicals}} from ionizing radiation with DNA can induce DNA damage {{and lead to}} mutagenesis and carsinogenesis. With respect to radiation damage to human, {{it is important to}} protect humans from side effects induced by ionizing radiation. In the present study,the effects of arbutin were investigated by using the micronucleus test for anti-clastogenic activity, to calculate the ratio of polychromatic erythrocyte to polychromatic erythrocyte plus <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (PCE/PCE+NCE) in order to show cell proliferation activity. Methods: Arbutin (50, 100, and 200  mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (ip) administered to NMRI mice two hours before gamma radiation at 2 and 4 gray (Gy). The frequency of micronuclei in 1000 PCEs (MnPCEs) and the ratio of PCE/PCE+NCE were calculated for each sample. Data were statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA,Tukey HSD test, and t-test. Results: The findings indicated that gamma radiation at 2 and 4  Gy extremely increased the frequencies of MnPCE (P< 0. 001) while reducing PCE/PCE+NCE (P< 0. 001) compared to the control group. All three doses of arbutin before irradiation significantly reduced the frequencies of MnPCEs and increased the ratio of PCE/PCE+NCE in mice bone marrow compared to the non-drug-treated irradiated control (P< 0. 001). All three doses of arbutin had no toxicity effect on bone marrow cells. The calculated dose reduction factor (DRF) showed DRF= 1. 93 for 2 Gy and DRF= 2. 22 for 4  Gy.

METHODS: Eighteen male Wistar rats, were distributed into three groups of six animals: group 1 - submitted to ESTPI and HBO sessions; group 2 - submitted to ESTPI and HBO simulations; group 3 - underwent cyclophosphamide administration. In groups 1 and 2, blood samples from the animals' tails were collected before surgery (T 0) and immediately after the 13 th HBO session or simulation (T 1). In group 3, tail blood samples were collected from animals before (T 0) and 24 hours after (T 1) cyclophosphamide (CP) delivery. The number of micronucleated <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> (MNNCE) was determined by blind counting 2000 <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> (NCE) per animal. RESULTS:Micronuclei average after CP delivery in group 3 was higher than before its use, thus confirming the mutagenic activity of this drug (p= 0. 01).

Methods: A total of 48 albino rats were divided into three groups each of sixteen animals. Groups-I and II were kept at a benzene station for 60 and 120 days, respectively; while group-III was kept as a control under normal laboratory conditions. At the end of the experiment, animals were sacrificed and bone marrow samples were taken to investigate the effect of air pollutants at a benzene station on chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei formation. Tissue samples were also picked out to evaluate histotoxic effects of these air pollutants. Results: Results indicated pronounced time-dependent effects because of the work place pollutants. Genetic examination revealed higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations and elevated mitotic index after exposure to air pollutants. Micronuclei formation also increased either in polychromatic or <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> due to air pollutants. Histopathological examination revealed congestion of the pulmonary blood vessels with pulmonary edema. Bronchial hyperplasia and metaplasia were also seen in late stage of exposure. The liver showed degenerative changes or even necrosis of hepatocytes, while the kidneys showed congestion of the renal blood vessels and glomerular tufts. Hyalinization of the glomeruli was also detected. The heart showed various mononuclear infiltration and the testes showed degenerative changes of seminiferous tubules. Spleen showed hemosiderosis while testes showed degenerative changes of seminiferous tubules.

The frequency of micronucleated polychromatic <b>erythrocytes</b> (PCEs) and <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> (NCEs); the ratio of PCEs/NCEs; and the mitotic index (MI) of bone marrow cells and sperm, head, and tail abnormalities were evaluated. Administration of vitamin B 12 pre-irradiation resulted in a significant inhibition {{in the frequency of}} radiation-induced MNPCE and MNNCE {{as well as in the}} ratio of PCEs/NCEs and MI of bone marrow cells and a significant amelioration in sperm head and tail abnormalities. The results suggested that vitamin B 12 in a dose of 0. 8 mg/kg body weight plays a protective role when administered prior to irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine the cytotoxic and cytogenetic effects of 1, 3 -butadiene and two structural analogs, chloroprene and isoprene, in the bone marrow cells of B 6 C 3 F 1 mice exposed to the chemicals by inhalation. In one study, animals were exposed to 1, 3 -butadiene concentrations of 6. 25, 62. 5, or 625 ppm 6 hr/day on 10 exposure days {{and in the second}} study, to the same concentrations on weekdays for 13 weeks. Chloroprene and isoprene treatments involved 6 hr/day exposures on 12 exposure days at concentrations of 0, 12, 32, 80, and 200 ppm for chloroprene and 0, 438, 1750, and 7000 ppm for isoprene. In the 10 -day study, 1, 3 -butadiene induced significant increases in sister chromatid exchange (SCE) at 6. 25 ppm, micronuclei at 62. 5 ppm, and chromosomal aberrations at 625 ppm. In the 13 -week study, the frequency of micronucleated <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> in the peripheral blood was significantly elevated in all exposure groups including the 6. 25 -ppm group. Isoprene induced both SCE and micronuclei, whereas chloroprene gave negative results for all cytogenetic end points assessed in bone marrow cells...|$|R
40|$|Micronucleus assays {{were carried}} out {{independently}} in two laboratories with 10 chemicals selected for aneuploidy studies in a coordinated project supported by the CEC. All chemicals were distributed from a single batch by the project coordinator. Male and female mice were treated by single i. p. injections, bone marrow was sampled 6, 24 and 48 h after treatment. Polychromatic and <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> were evaluated {{for the presence of}} micronuclei after May-Grünwald/Giemsa or Wright staining. The results from both laboratories are in close agreement even though different stocks of mice and different sample sizes were employed in the two laboratories. Only three of the 10 compounds induced micronuclei in mouse erythrocytes: colchi-cine, hydroquinone and vinblastine. The other seven chemicals gave negative results: econazole, chloralhydrate, diazepam, thiabendazole, cadmium chloride, thimerosal and pyrimethamine. The negative results for econazole and chloralhydrate were unexpected {{in light of the fact}} that these two chemicals were previously shown to increase the mitotic index and to induce c-mitotic effects in mouse bone marrow cells. The need for further investigations of these compounds by chromosome counting in second post-treatment metaphases is emphasized to determine their ability to induce aneuploidy. © 1991 Oxford University Press.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} extra virgin (EV) olive oil and genetically modified (GM) soybean on DNA, cytogenicity and some antioxidant enzymes in rodents. Forty adult male albino rats were {{used in this study}} and divided into four groups. The control group of rodents was fed basal ration only. The second group was given basal ration mixed with EV olive oil (30 %). The third group was fed basal ration mixed with GM (15 %), and the fourth group survived on a combination of EV olive oil, GM and the basal ration for 65 consecutive days. On day 65, blood samples were collected from each rat for antioxidant enzyme analysis. In the group fed on basal ration mixed with GM soyabean (15 %), there was a significant increase in serum level of lipid peroxidation, while glutathione transferase decreased significantly. Interestingly, GM soyabean increased not only the percentage of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MPCE), but also the ratio of polychromatic <b>erythrocytes</b> to <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> (PEC/NEC); however, the amount of DNA and NCE were significantly decreased. Importantly, the combination of EV olive oil and GM soyabean significantly altered the tested parameters towards normal levels. This may suggest an important role for EV olive oil on rodents’ organs and warrants further investigation in humans...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{belonging}} to the Celastraceae family {{have been used in}} traditional medicine for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic properties, among others. Maytenus ilicifolia is the principal species of this family, and is used in the treatment of gastric ulcers. However, owing to its inadequate management in Brazil, the species is becoming extinct and is being substituted with Maytenus robusta, which also displays gastroprotective activity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the genotoxic effects of M. robusta hydroalcoholic extract in vivo, using the comet assay and micronucleus test. Three doses (50, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) were administered to mice orally 2 times at 24 -h intervals. Cytotoxicity was assessed by scoring 200 consecutive total polychromatic and <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> to calculate their ratio. Parametric (analysis of variance/Tukey) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn post hoc) tests were used to evaluate the results according to the nature of the data distribution. The results showed a significant increase in the frequency of DNA damage on leukocytes at the 2 higher doses tested, but the extract did not enhance micronucleus frequency in bone marrow cells. Our findings showed that after 48 h of treatment, M. robusta hydroalcoholic extract had weak genotoxic effects but no clastogenic effects in mice cells...|$|R
40|$|Phyllanthus niruri L. (Euphorbiaceae), {{known as}} "quebra-pedra" (Portuguese for "stonebreaker"), is an herb used for kidney disorders. In light of its {{frequent}} {{use by the}} population, the present study aimed to investigate the genotoxic, antigenotoxic and cytotoxic activities of a standardized P. niruri extract in bone marrow rats. Three groups of 12 animals were treated daily by gavage {{over a period of}} 30 days, with 50, 150 or 250 mg/kg of P. niruri extract aqueous solution. The control group (n = 12) received tap water. At the end of treatment (day 31), groups were divided into two minor subgroups (n= 6 /group) and received cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg, i. p.) or saline 0. 9 % (i. p.). After 24 hours, we evaluated the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes for each animal (MNPCE) at 1000 PCE. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with the PCE/NCE ratio (NEC = <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes).</b> General toxicity was assessed during treatment using the parameters of body weight gain, ration and water consumption. The dry extract did not provoke changes in body weight, weight gain, ration and water intake or changes in the frequency of MNPCE or cytotoxicity in bone marrow. We propose that the P. niruri extract used here showed no genotoxic, antigenotoxic and cytotoxic activities under the experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} incidence of micronuclei in peripheral blood erythrocytes of B 6 C 3 F 1 mice that had been chronically exposed to radiofrequencies (RF) used for mobile communication. Materials and methods: 'Ferris wheels' were used to expose tube-restrained male and female mice to simulated environmental RF signals of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM, 902 MHz) or Digital Cellular System (DCS, 1747 MHz). RF signals were applied to the mice for 2 hours/day on 5 days/week for two years, at maximal whole-body-averaged specific absorption rates of 0. 4, 1. 3, and 4. 0 W/kg body weight. Concurrent sham-exposed mice, cage controls, and positive controls injected with mitomycin C were included in this investigation. At necropsy, peripheral blood smears were prepared, and coded slides were stained using May-Grunwald-Giemsa or acridine orange. The incidence of micronuclei was recorded for each mouse in 2000 polychromatic and 2000 <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes.</b> Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} the frequency of micronuclei between RF-exposed, sham-exposed, and cage control mice, irrespective of the staining/counting method used. Micronuclei were, however, significantly increased in polychromatic erythrocytes of the positive control mice. Conclusions: In conclusion, the data did not indicate RF-induced genotoxicity in mice after two years of exposure...|$|R

Evaluation {{of the effects of}} Arthrospira maxima (AM) was made, otherwise known as Spirulina, on the teratogenicity, genotoxicity, and DNA oxidation processes induced by cadmium (Cd). Pregnant ICR mice were divided into groups and administered water, Cd only, AM only, or AM plus Cd. AM was administered orally at doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg from gestational day 0 (GD 0) to GD 17, and at GD 7 there was an intraperitoneal challenge of Cd (1. 5 mg/kg). Cd only caused fetal malformations, including exencephaly, micrognathia, ablephary, microphthalmia, and clubfoot, as well as {{a significant increase in the}} quantity of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPE) and of micronucleated <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> (MNNE) in blood cells of both the mothers and their fetuses. An increased level of oxidation was also found, measured by a rise in the levels of the adduct 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine. In a dose-dependent manner, AM significantly reduced the number of external, visceral, and skeletal malformations, the quantity ofMNPE andMNNE, and the level of DNA oxidation. The results suggest that AMmay reduc...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the genotoxicity of lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) (CAS registry No. 91465 - 08 - 06), a pyr-ethroid insecticide, in bone marrow cells and in colonic crypt epithelial cells of groups of four rats per dose treated in vivo by gavage at doses of 0. 8, 3. 06 and 6. 12 mg/kg body weight (body wt). We measured genotoxicity using the micronucleus (MN) assay, scoring 2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) per animal for bone marrow and 1000 colonic crypt epithelial cells per animal for the colon. We assessed cytotoxicity in bone marrow by calculating the ratio of PCEs to <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes,</b> and in the colonic crypt epithelium by observing the frequency of binucleate cells and the mitotic index in 1000 cells. Apop-tosis in colonic crypt epithelial cells was measured by observing the frequency of karyorrhexis and karyolysis in 1000 cells. We found that LCT induced a statistically signi-ficant dose-related increase in MN formation in the bone marrow and the colonic crypt. The colonic epithelium was {{more sensitive to the}} clastogenic effects of LCT than the bone marrow as judged by the significantly higher frequen-cies of MN in the colon than in the bone marrow at doses of 3. 06 and 6. 12 mg/kg body wt...|$|R
40|$|Solanum paniculatum L. is a {{plant species}} {{widespread}} throughout tropical America, {{especially in the}} Brazilian Cerrado region. It is used in Brazil for culinary purposes and in folk medicine to treat liver and gastric dysfunctions, as well as hangovers. Previous studies with S. paniculatum ethanolic leaf extract or ethanolic fruit extract demonstrated {{that they have no}} genotoxic activity neither in mice nor in bacterial strains, although their cytotoxicity and antigenotoxicity were demonstrated in higher doses. In order to assess the possible compounds responsible for the activities observed, we fractionated the ethanolic fruit extract of S. paniculatum, characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra, and evaluated two fractions containing steroidal alkaloids against mitomycin C (MMC) using the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Swiss mice were orally treated with different concentrations (25, 50, or 100 mg. kg− 1) of each fraction simultaneously with a single intraperitonial dose of MMC (4 mg. kg− 1). Antigenotoxicity was evaluated by using the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE), whereas anticytotoxicity was assessed by the polychromatic and <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> ratio (PCE/NCE). Our results demonstrated that steroidal alkaloids isolated from S. paniculatum strongly protected cells against MMC aneugenic and/or clastogenic activities as well as modulated MMC cytotoxic action...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{were exposed}} to benzene for 13 to 14 weeks by {{inhalation}} for either 3 or 5 consecutive days per week or by gavage for 5 consecutive days per week. A weekly evaluation of peripheral blood smears for micronucleated (MN) erythrocyte frequencies and for the percentage of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) indicated that the induction of MN-PCE by benzene depended on the sex and strain of mice and on the route of exposure, {{but not on the}} inhalation regimen or on the exposure duration. The frequency of MN <b>normochromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> (NCE) not only depended on the sex and strain of mice and on the route of exposure, but directly depended on the inhalation regimen and on the exposure duration. Similarly, the extent of erythropoietic depression in benzene-exposed mice was dependent on sex, mouse strain, exposure duration, and route. However, in contrast to the MN-NCE data, the 3 day/week exposure regimen induced a more persistent depression in erythropoiesis than the 5 day/week exposure regimen. Exposure to benzene also induced in mice a significant depression in packed cell volume (PCV) and bone marrow cellularity, the magnitude of which depended on the sex and strain of mice and on the regimen and route of exposure...|$|R
