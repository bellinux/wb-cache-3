5|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> increased, {{including}} Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens. Work {{was undertaken}} during the 19th century {{to protect the}} stonework from further decline, with particular efforts to remove ivy from the castle in the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the park}} by {{tourists}} improved {{in the early years}} of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} north-south road in Ocean City, MD 528 {{experiences}} heavy {{traffic in the}} summer months as the resort town sees a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> and seasonal residents. The route also provides access to hurricane evacuation routes leading out of Ocean City, including US 50, MD 90, and DE 54. MD 528 {{is a part of}} the main National Highway System from US 50 to the Delaware state line.|$|E

5|$|Most {{recreation}} {{takes place}} around Lake Inari, although a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> hike into the fells. The reserve is a demanding hiking area and inexperienced hikers are recommended to avoid traversing the wilderness. The freedom to roam grants everyone {{the right to}} hike, ski and short-term camping everywhere in the area. The park can be accessed from National Road 971 and 969; public transport is available to Nellim.|$|E
5|$|Since its completion, {{the road}} has acted {{as the primary}} access point to St. Peter's Square, and by {{extension}} to the Vatican City itself. At times, such as during the funeral of Pope John Paul II, it has acted as an extension to the square itself, allowing a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to attend functions conducted there.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-70 the San Rafael Swell was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect the swell as early as 1935. Since {{the construction}} of the freeway the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the swell has increased significantly, as the swell can now be accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation.|$|E

5|$|During {{that same}} year, {{a series of}} {{scalding}} cases, including an incident in which a senior citizen diabetic lost six toes to gangrene after soaking in the hot spring, prompted the Singapore General Hospital to warn that people with nerve disorders or diseases affecting blood circulation should be cautious to hot mineral springs. As a result of some negative rumors and hearsay, and the RSAF redevelopment, public interest began to wane and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> dwindled.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th and early 20th centuries the pier was popular both with locals and {{tourists}} to the town. As a boarding point for steamers plying their trade in the Bristol Channel, it underwent various extensions and modifications over the years. During the Second World War the pier was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck by the Admiralty as part of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. The pier reopened after the war, but the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> and steamer passengers declined. The final excursion visited the pier in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{hospitality}} sector received a major boost {{due to the}} games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who were coming to see the Games - media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from the Games, and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city. Many famous places such as the Charminar and the Chowmahalla Palace saw record <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{recognised}} {{that the}} permitted <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> on Lady Musgrave Island at this time, have reached (and at times exceeded) an ecologically sustainable level.|$|R

5|$|Maiden Castle has {{provided}} inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations {{were carried out}} under Niall Sharples, which added {{to an understanding of}} the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors.</b> Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|Several {{areas of}} Bath had {{undergone}} development during the Stuart period, and development increased during Georgian times {{in response to}} the increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the spa and resort town who required accommodation. The architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone used for construction throughout the city was obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, which were owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the site}} was founded to honour {{the memory of the}} Newfoundland Regiment, it also {{contains}} a number of memorials as well as four cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission; that of Y Ravine Cemetery, Hawthorn Ridge Cemeteries No. 1 and No. 2 and the unusual mass burial site of Hunter's Cemetery. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The ever-increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the Memorial has resulted in the authorities taking measures to control access by fencing off certain areas of the former battlefield.|$|E
50|$|In addition, on Sundays {{in summer}} the {{municipality}} of Kastellaun offers a children's activity programme. Further special events attract particularly large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the ruin.|$|R

5|$|By the 1820s, {{visitors}} could {{purchase an}} early guidebook {{at the site}} outlining the castle's history, and Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence to wander around the castle. In the early 1820s, the antiquarian Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick attempted to purchase the site, {{with the aim of}} converting the castle back into a private dwelling, but was unable to convince the owners to sell. Instead, Meyrick built the neo-gothic Goodrich Court in a similar style next door, which greatly displeased Wordsworth when he returned to Goodrich in 1841 and found the view spoilt by the new building. The new bridge over the river Wye, built in 1828, and the 1873 railway line added to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors,</b> as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the {{television}} series Hawaii Five-0 chose Battleship Cove, a housing community {{just outside the}} dock of the USS Missouri museum, as the location for an episode. The episode, with police cars racing down Tennessee and Nevada Streets, featured a number of Ford Island homes and some residents appeared as extras. That year, Peter Berg featured the USS Missouri in the film Battleship. The ship, which was towed off Ford Island for maintenance, was brought out to sea between completion of the maintenance and its return to the dock for filming. Michael Carr, president of the Battleship Missouri Memorial, hoped that the film would spike the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> to the Ford Island museum.|$|E
