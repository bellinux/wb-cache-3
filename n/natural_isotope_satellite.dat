40|$|A Fourier {{deconvolution}} {{method has}} been developed to explicitly {{determine the amount of}} backbone amide deuterium incorporated into protein regions or segments by hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Determination and analysis of the level and number of backbone amide exchanging in solution provide more information about the solvent accessibility of the protein than do previous centroid methods, which only calculate the average deuterons exchanged. After exchange, a protein is digested into peptides as a way of determining the exchange within a local area of the protein. The mass of a peptide upon deuteration is a sum of the <b>natural</b> <b>isotope</b> abundance, fast exchanging side-chain hydrogens (present in MALDI-TOF H/ 2 H data) and backbone amide exchange. Removal of the components of the isotopic distribution due to the <b>natural</b> <b>isotope</b> abundances and the fast exchanging side-chains allows for a precise quantification of the levels of backbone amide exchange, as is shown by an example from protein kinase A. The deconvoluted results are affected by overlapping peptides or inconsistent mass envelopes, and evaluation procedures for these cases are discussed.
