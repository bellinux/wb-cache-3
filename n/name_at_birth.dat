5|$|Jinnah's given <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> was Mahomedali, and he {{was born}} most likely in 1876, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented {{apartment}} {{on the second floor}} of Wazir Mansion near Karachi, Sindh, now in Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's family was from a Gujarati Ismaili background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings. According to Akbar Ahmed however, Jinnah moved to the Sunni sect early in life. Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background, his father was a merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village. They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay. Jinnah was the second child; he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah. The parents were native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and English. Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.|$|E

25|$|The core of Lucas' worldview is his Jewish identity, and {{particularly}} his deep {{affinity for the}} state of Israel. His time growing up in the Soviet Union, which was notorious for its antisemitism, meant that like many Russian Jews, Lucas had to repress his identity. Lucas has claimed that he was given his mother's maiden <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> specifically because Treivas sounded less Jewish than his father's surname Bregman.|$|E

They had five children, of whom three would become significant Bábís.|$|E
25|$|Where births are {{required}} to be officially registered, the name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become a legal name. The assumption in the Western world is often that the name from birth, or perhaps from baptism or bris, persists to adulthood in {{the normal course of}} affairs. Some possible changes concern middle names, uses of diminutive forms, adoption, choice of surname as parents divorce or were not married. Matters are very different in some cultures, where a <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> is only a childhood name rather than the default choice for later life.|$|E
25|$|Britannicus' <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> was Tiberius Claudius Germanicus. The agnomen, {{his first}} surname Germanicus, was first awarded to his {{paternal}} grandfather Drusus the Elder {{after his death}} in 9 BC to commemorate his victories over the Germanic tribes. Accordingly, Drusus' sons (Claudius and Germanicus) inherited the name and passed it to their sons as well. Britannicus was given to his father in AD 43 following his conquest of Britain. Claudius never used it himself and gave the name to his son instead, and his full name became: Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus. He came to be known by his new name which seems to have replaced Germanicus altogether.|$|E

25|$|A child's {{given name}} or names are usually {{chosen by the}} parents soon after birth. If a name is not {{assigned}} at birth, one may be given at a naming ceremony, {{with family and friends}} in attendance. In most jurisdictions, a child's <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> is a matter of public record, inscribed on a birth certificate, or its equivalent. In western cultures, people normally retain the same given name throughout their lives. However, in some cases these names may be changed by petitioning a court of law. People may also change their names when immigrating from one country to another with different naming conventions.|$|E
25|$|Diệm {{was born}} in 1901 in Quảng Bình, a central Vietnam province. His family {{originated}} in the Phú Cam district, a (formerly) Catholic district in Huế city. His clan had been among Vietnam's earliest Catholic converts in the 17th century. Diệm was given a saint's <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth,</b> Gioan Baotixita (a Vietnamized form of Jean Baptiste), following the custom of the Catholic Church. The Ngô-Đình family, along with other Vietnamese Catholics, suffered from anti-Catholic persecutions from Emperors Minh Mạng and Tự Đức. In 1880, while Diệm's father, Ngô Đình Khả (1850–1925), was studying in British Malaya, an anti-Catholic riot led by Buddhist monks almost wiped out the entire Ngô-Đình family. Over 100 of the Ngô clan were burned alive in a church including Khả's parents, brothers, and sisters. Note that while he is usually referred to as Diệm in English, his family name is actually Ngô.|$|E

[...] Thích Nhất Hạnh has translated his Dharma names as Nhất = One, and Hạnh = Action. Vietnamese names follow this naming convention, placing the family or surname first, then the middle or intercalary name which often refers to the person's position in the family or generation, followed by the given name.|$|E

Peng's grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion, and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals: that everyone should have enough food to eat, that women should not bind their feet, and that land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as [...] "lower-middle peasant".|$|E

His given <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> is unclear—it was traditional at that time, when becoming a monk, {{to take on a}} new name with the same initial as one's birth name. Symeon may have ignored that tradition in order to take the same name as his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. In his writings, he sometimes described the experiences of [...] "George," [...] which might have been his birth name.
