The sensitive part of the spectrometer is the Helium-3 proportional counter, which detects neutrons through the reaction 3He(n,p)3H. This particular reaction has a significant cross-section only at thermal neutron energies. In order for a higher energy neutrons to be detected their energies must be decreased, or [...] "moderated". To slow down neutrons at higher energies the NNS uses different amounts of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The He-3 proportional counter is surrounded by varying amounts of HDPE to sample various energy regions of the <b>neutron</b> <b>field.</b> The standard NNS has seven HDPE cylinders which are nested together, similar to Russian nesting dolls, to measure neutrons of higher and higher energies.|$|E

40|$|The need of {{radiation}} detectors capable of efficiently measuring in pulsed <b>neutron</b> <b>fields</b> is attracting widespread interest since the 60 s. The {{efforts of the}} scientific community substantially increased in the last decade due to the increasing number of applications in which this radiation field is encountered. This is a major issue especially at particle accelerator facilities, where pulsed <b>neutron</b> <b>fields</b> are present because of beam losses at targets, collimators and beam dumps, and where the correct assessment of the intensity of the <b>neutron</b> <b>fields</b> is fundamental for radiation protection monitoring. LUPIN is a neutron detector that combines an innovative acquisition electronics based on logarithmic amplification of the collected current signal and a special technique used to derive the total number of detected neutron interactions, which has been specifically conceived to work in pulsed <b>neutron</b> <b>fields.</b> Due to its special working principle, it is capable of overcoming the typical saturation issues encountered in state-of-the-art detectors, which suffer from dead time losses and often heavily underestimate the true neutron interaction rate when employed for routine radiation protection measurements. This thesis presents a comprehensive study into the design, optimisation and operation of two versions of LUPIN, based on different active gases. In addition, two other devices, a beam loss monitor and a neutron spectrometer, which have been built using LUPIN’s acquisition electronics, are also discussed in detail. Experimental results obtained in a number of facilities where the detectors have been exposed to most diverse and extreme conditions are shown in order to demonstrate the superior instrument performance in a critical assessment with commercial devices commonly employed for personnel and machine protection...|$|R

In Japan, Accelerator Based Neutron Sources (ABNS) are being developed for BNCT. For the spread of ABNS based BNCT, we should characterize the <b>neutron</b> <b>field</b> beforehand. For this purpose, we have been developing a low-energy neutron spectrometer based on 3 He position sensitive proportional counter. In this study, a new intense epi-thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>field</b> was developed with a DT neutron source for verification of validity of the spectrometer. After the development, the <b>neutron</b> <b>field</b> characteristics were experimentally evaluated by using activation foils. As a result, we confirmed that an epi-thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>field</b> was successfully developed suppressing fast neutrons substantially. Thereafter, the neutron spectrometer was verified experimentally. In the verification, although a measured detection depth distribution agreed well with the calculated distribution by MCNP, the unfolded spectrum was significantly different from the calculated neutron spectrum due to contribution of the side neutron incidence. Therefore, we designed a new neutron collimator consisting of a polyethylene pre-collimator and boron carbide neutron absorber and confirmed numerically that it could suppress the side incident neutrons and shape the neutron flux to be like a pencil beam...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{stochastic}} <b>neutron</b> <b>field</b> theory (neutron noise) for {{the measurement}} of reactor physics parameters {{goes back to the}} early work of Serber, Feynmann, and Orndoff. Since then, a large variety of methods and applications has been developed. In the majority of these methods, some form of modified one-point reactor kinetics was used for the interpretation of the measurements. In fact, the high level of sophistication of the instrumentation used was not matched by the theory. In 1965, Bell developed a general theory of the stochastic <b>neutron</b> <b>field,</b> and in 1987, Munoz-Cobo et al enlarged this treatment to include the effect of the detectors in the <b>neutron</b> <b>field.</b> In both instances, the complexity of the theoretical results were beyond the computing capabilities then available thus, the mismatch between experimental and theoretical methods remained in existence because the powerful Monte-Carlo methods then at work, were only applicable to static neutron fields. This problem was eliminated by the development of a time-dependent Monte-Carlo code specially written by T. E. Valentine for the analysis of stochastic measurements that gave them relevance to the results of the general theory. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the derivation of observables of the stochastic neutron filed from its general treatment...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the right}} conditions, self {{sustaining}} fission waves can form in fertile nuclear materials. These waves {{result from the}} transport and absorption of neutrons and the resulting production of fissile isotopes. When these fission, additional neutrons are produced and the chain reaction propagates until it is poisoned by the buildup of fission products. It is typically assumed that fission waves are soliton-like and self stabilizing. However, we show that in uranium, coupling of the <b>neutron</b> <b>field</b> to the 239 U-> 239 Np-> 239 Pu decay chain {{can lead to a}} Hopf bifurcation. The fission reaction then ramps up and down, along with the wave velocity. The critical driver for the instability is a delay, caused by the half-life of 239 U, between the time evolution of the <b>neutron</b> <b>field</b> and the production of 239 Pu. This allows the 239 Pu to accumulate and burn out in a self limiting oscillation that is characteristic of a Hopf bifurcation. Time dependent results are obtained using a numerical implementation of a reduced order reaction-diffusion model for a fast <b>neutron</b> <b>field.</b> Monte Carlo simulations in combination with a linear stability analysis are used to confirm the results for the full system and to establish the parameter space where the Hopf occurs.
