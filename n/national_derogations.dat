40|$|Significant {{difficulties}} in the practical application of the transposed legislation appear in the model of complete harmonization. They cover both the more precisely-defined scope of the Directive on unfair B 2 C commercial practice, {{as well as the}} possibility of maintaining <b>national</b> <b>derogations</b> from the exhaustive list set out in detail concerning absolute prohibitions effective in all conditions. These issues concern the judgment of the Court of Justice in the Mediaprint Zeitungs- und Zeitschriftenverlag GmbH & Co KG case, in which it ‘ [...] . hereby rules, that the Directive must be interpreted as precluding a national provision, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which lays down a general prohibition on sales with bonuses and is not only designed to protect consumers but also pursues other objectives. ’ It is desirable that those commercial practices which are in all circumstances unfair be identified to provide greater legal certainty. Lists of unfair clauses make it easier for traders, consumers, and courts or authorities to determine the meaning of the general clause. Member States may not adopt stricter rules than those provided for in the Directive, even in order to achieve a higher level of consumer protection. But the far-reaching consequence discussed in the paper justifies posing questions about the best level of consumer protection and which harmonization regime should be chosen for it. ...|$|E

For many cultivated plants, however, organic seed is often not available. This is mainly because investment in organic plant breeding and seed production has been low in the past. To {{bridge the gap between}} organic seed supply and demand, national and European regulations define certain circumstances under which organic producers are permitted to use non-organically produced seed. While the organic sector currently depends on these concessions, they also threaten to impede a further increase in the demand for organic seed, thereby potentially restraining present and future investment in organic seed production and plant breeding. We review the current status of the organic seed regulations framework by analysing key issues such as the role of the <b>national</b> <b>derogation</b> regimes, the role of expert groups, databases and seed prices. Key points are that (a) the situation of the organic seed sector has improved over the last few years; however, (b) reporting on organic seed to the EU by different countries needs to be harmonised; (c) the success of the organic seed sector depends critically on the implementation and improvement of national expert groups; and (d) to protect genetic diversity, the use of local varieties and landraces should not be impeded by organic seed regulations...|$|R

30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several exemptions and derogations for the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption [2]. Pseudonymisation is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre for <b>national</b> regulations (<b>derogations</b> defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that exemptions and derogations for research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the national reports according EC Regulation 1452 / 2003 of the years 2004 and 2005, recording the number of authorisations permitted, the quantity of nonorganic seeds used and the main reasons for allowing derogation for each crop (species). The work was carried out as part of the “EEC 2092 / 91 (Organic) Revision” project (No. SSPE-CT- 2004 - 502397) within the EU 6 th Framework Programme. The main objective was to analyse <b>national</b> <b>derogation</b> reports with respect to total seed use of selected species/subspecies, and to analyse the feedback from expert interviews and meetings regarding the implementation of the new seed regulation, in order to provide recommendations for further improvement of the implementation of the organic seed regulation. The national annual organic seed reports 2004 and 2005 differ much in form and quality. The data show considerable differences in the offer of organic seeds and the use of non-organic seeds between the reporting states. Authorisations for the use of non-organic seeds or a general derogation mean a financial benefit for the respective farmers. Since the seed costs can not be neglected in calculating the whole sale product price, countries with high rates of non-organic seeds can take advantage of this situation on the European market. Harmonisation of the derogation policy on EU-level as well as on national level should therefore be of high importance for the authorities. To increase the use of organic seed we propose the following measures to be taken: Measures recommended on national level 1. Some national databases need technical improvement and more registered varieties to be a useful tool for organic farmers. International cooperation of the database managers should be enhanced. 2. A registration duty for farmers calling for a derogation of the acreage planted or the number of pot plants produced, in order to allow the evaluation of the acreage planted with non-organic seeds in the national organic seed reports. 3. Use of a standardised reporting scheme including a common species list, subtotals for crop groups (e. g. vegetables), species and subspecies to make reports comparable. Assembling of raw data versions according to a common template in order to allow a direct comparison in Pivot-tables. The reports should immediately be made publicly available, according to Art. 12 and 13 of the EC-Regulation 1452 / 2003. 4. Establishment at a national level of lists of equivalent varieties (useful for professional growers) for every subspecies (variety group) in order to facilitate the decision making of the control bodies and to make possible, that individual calls for derogation can be denied with respect to farmers needs. 5. Establish a fee system that balances the cost difference between organic and non-organic seed in order to avoid unfair competition. This money can be used to promote organic seed marketing, to support organic seed production and breeding projects as well as to reduce the price of organic seeds. 6. Introduction of national Annexes as preliminary stage to come to a common European one (Annex 1) with respect to the national organic seed offer. Making the organic seed use compulsory would give security for the seed companies to increase the organic seed production. 7. In order to grant fair conditions among EU producers, common Annexes with neighbour countries or countries with similar production systems and markets (especially export markets) should be favoured. Annexes on national or bilateral/regional level seem to be more realistic, than a common European Annex 1. The number of species/subspecies listed in the national Annex 1 has to increase annually. Measures recommended on EU-Commission level 1. In order to harmonize organic seed availability among EU Member States and facilitate seed companies in supplying their seeds wherever requested, it should be possible for all seed companies to enter the National database of all Members States where they have a local distributor. 2. To allow well supplied subspecies according to cultivation and use (crop types, variety groups, e. g. cherry tomatoes) to be listed on the Annex 1 instead of whole botanical species. In cases of unforeseen shortage of organic seed, national authorities should get the right to allow individual derogations according Article 5. 1 of the EC-Regulation 1452 / 2003. 3. Including the use of non-organic basic seed as reason in Article 5 (1) for derogation for Annex 1 species, to get more complete data in the seed reports, (in addition to already mentioned exemptions for conservation varieties and variety trials). 4.
