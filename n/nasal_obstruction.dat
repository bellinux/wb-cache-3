25|$|Sinus {{infections are}} treated by {{prolonged}} courses of antibiotics. The development of nasal polyps or other chronic changes within the nasal passages may severely limit airflow through the nose, {{and over time}} reduce the person's sense of smell.

25|$|Obstructed airways – The {{restoration}} of normal breathing by correcting <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{caused by a}} cosmetic rhinoplasty wherein nasal cartilages were over-aggressively trimmed, and the nose appears pinched, which compromises nasal potency (airflow), especially when the patient attempts deep inspiration. These grafting techniques restore normal breathing by increasing {{the size of the}} nose tip with baton grafts (internal cartilage), and spreader grafts to widen the nasal middle vault. Furthermore, to improve breathing a septoplasty can be performed concurrent to the reconstructive surgery; likewise, if there is turbinate hypertrophy, an inferior turbinectomy can be performed.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{three-dimensional}} structure of the nose, the repair of the nasal defect requires reconstruction of three different layers: skin envelope, osteocartilaginous framework and nasal lining. Before nasal reconstruction can be accomplished, the nose must rest on a stable platform to avoid late <b>nasal</b> <b>obstructions,</b> and septal deviations resulting from scar contraction. We present three cases of nasal reconstruction using a forehead flap in which we performed a preliminary stage to increase reliability of outcomes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRhinolithiasis {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{involving a}} mineralized mass located in the nasal cavity. It may be endogenous or exogenous in origin. The fact that it appears with different symptoms can make diagnosis difficult. Rhinolithiasis was diagnosed {{as a result of}} endoscopic examination in two patients previously diagnosed with sinusitis and with no lessening of symptoms despite numerous applications of medical treatment. Rhinolithiasis should be considered in long-term fetid nasal discharges and unilateral <b>nasal</b> <b>obstructions,</b> and the patient should be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist for endoscopic examination...|$|R
2500|$|Symptoms of ENS {{include a}} {{sensation}} of {{being unable to}} breathe, a feeling of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> and dryness, and crusting, oozing, and foul smells inside the nose from infections.

2500|$|Empty nose {{syndrome}} (ENS), {{one form}} of secondary atrophic rhinitis, is a rare clinical syndrome in which people who have clear nasal passages experience a range of symptoms, most commonly feelings of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction,</b> nasal dryness and crusting, and a sensation of being unable to breathe. People who experience ENS have usually undergone a turbinectomy (removal or reduction of turbinates, structures inside the nose) or other surgical procedures that interfere with turbinates; the overall incidence is unknown but it appears to occur in {{a small percentage of}} those who undergo nasosinal procedures. [...] It appears to be a health care caused condition but its existence as a medical condition, cause, diagnosis and management are controversial.|$|E

40|$|Olfactory {{disorders}} {{may have}} several causes. Nasal polyposis or chronic sinusitis {{can result in}} <b>nasal</b> <b>obstructions</b> that block the access of odorants to the olfactory epithelium, and this can explain the development of olfactory disorders. On the other hand, when nasal endoscopy has revealed that the nasal cleft is free of inflammatory or tumoural disease, olfactory disorders {{may be explained by}} neuroepithelial or central nervous system disturbances. This paper will provide information about current approaches to smell disorders in otorhinolaryngology. Major causes will be reviewed as outcomes after medical or surgical treatment. An algorithm will also be given to standardise clinical investigations, including psychophysical olfactory testing, imaging and electrophysiological examinations...|$|R

50|$|The nasal airway may be {{compromised}} partially (where there is increased {{resistance to the}} flow of air due to narrowing of the lumen {{at some point in}} the upper respiratory tract) or completely obstructed.

30|$|Among {{the effects}} of rapid maxillary {{expansion}} (RME) treatment, improvements in breathing function were reported [11 – 13]. These changes were associated to reduce <b>nasal</b> <b>obstructions</b> [14] and effects in tongue position [15]. Transitory increasing of facial height and in some Class II patients even a forward relocation of the mandible might occur after RME [16, 17]. The abovementioned mandibular effects could contribute to enlarge oropharynx volume with repositioning of tongue and soft palate with an improvement of upper airway volume after treatment. Recently, the lowering of radiation dose using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) allowed the growth of several PC softwares which are manually either or automatically able to compute airway volumes {{in order to better}} understand changes after treatment. Moreover, functional data such as the ones obtained by rhinomanometric examinations and polysomnography (PSG), often employed in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) subjects, could be greatly helpful [13] as diagnostic tool and in measuring treatment outcomes.|$|R

[15] recently compared changes of tongue posture with changes in the nasal airway ventilation pattern after RME treatment.

50|$|Acute adenoiditis is {{characterized}} by fever, runny nose, <b>nasal</b> airway <b>obstruction</b> resulting in predominantly oral breathing, snoring and sleep apnea, Rhinorrhea with serous secretion in viral forms and mucous-purulent secretion in bacterial forms. In cases due to viral infection symptoms usually recede spontaneously after 48 hours, symptoms of bacterial adenoiditis typically persist up to a week. Adenoiditis is sometimes accompanied by tonsillitis. Repeated adenoiditis may lead to enlarged adenoids.|$|R

40|$|Objective: An abrupt refusal by {{the infant}} to breastfeed {{is often called}} “nursing strike”. In fact a common reason for {{cessation}} of nursing is infant’s refusal to breast feed. This problem can often be overcome. This paper has aimed to identify the causes of “breast feeding refusal ” or “nursing strike ” in 6 month old infants visiting the East Tehran health center for their scheduled vaccination of 6 months old. Materials and methods: Totally 175 six month old infants were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire was filled by mother for each child and later the infants with “nursing strike ” were compared with all others. Results: In this study prevalence of breast feeding refusal in infants was 24 %. There was significant relation between the “breastfeeding refusal ” and maternal academic education or working status. In this study mothers reported various reasons associated with “refusal breast feeding. According to the mothers playful infant and <b>nasal</b> <b>obstructions</b> were the probable causes for refusal. Conclusion: There is a diverse variety of factors influencing nursing strike. Most of these factors can be prevented by identifying the background reasons and proper training...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nasal {{spirometry}} {{has been}} used previously to monitor the nasal cycle. Asymmetry of nasal airflow is expressed as a nasal partitioning ratio (NPR) that ranges from – 1 (left <b>nasal</b> cavity <b>obstruction)</b> to + 1 (right <b>nasal</b> cavity <b>obstruction)</b> with 0 indicating symmetry of airflow. This study investigated the normal range of NPR in the decongested nose {{as a means of}} assessing the degree of nasal septal deviation. Methods: NPR was measured in 100 healthy volunteers using a portable spirometer. Results: Mean NPR before decongestion was – 0. 1 ± 0. 32 SD (range, – 0. 84 – 0. 75), and after decongestion mean NPR was – 0. 02 ± 0. 16 SD (range, – 0. 46 – 0. 51). Male NPR ranged from – 0. 46 to 0. 51 (mean, -– 0. 1 ± 0. 22) whereas female NPR was from – 0. 21 to 0. 37 (mean, – 0. 03 ± 0. 1; p < 0. 001).
