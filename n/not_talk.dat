5|$|All four of her {{grandparents}} had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex {{history of the}} U.S., but her extended family has said that people did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about the era of slavery when they were growing up. Her distant ancestry includes Irish and other European roots. In addition, a paternal first cousin once-removed is the African-American Jewish Rabbi Capers Funnye, son of her grandfather's sister.|$|E
5|$|Among her {{maternal}} ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, a slave on Henry Walls Shields' 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and {{born into}} slavery about 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers {{said his father}} was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of her master. Melvinia did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to relatives about Dolphus' father. Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War, {{and some of his}} children migrated to Cleveland, Ohio and Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|Madame Schmidt did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the}} matter even after the war. She died in 1954 {{at the age of}} 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E
5|$|The two {{go ahead}} with their plans to meet Alex, who brings along his friend, Junior (Chaddha) to the hotel. The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an {{argument}} between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four {{head back to the}} hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about anything that had happened.|$|E

25|$|As Mangum had no identification, would <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to police, {{was having}} {{difficulty}} walking, and seemed severely impaired, police {{took her to}} Durham Center Access, a mental-health and substance-abuse facility, for involuntary commitment.

25|$|In many ways, Migrant Mother is {{not typical}} of Lange's careful method of {{interacting}} with her subject. Exhausted {{after a long}} road-trip, she did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> much to the migrant woman, Florence Thompson, and didn't record her information accurately. Although Thompson became a famous symbol of White motherhood, her heritage is Native American. The photograph's fame caused distress for Thompson and her children and raised ethical concerns about turning individuals into symbols.|$|E
25|$|In 1935–36 and 1937–38, Belaney toured Canada and Britain (including Hastings) {{to promote}} his books and lecture about conservation. His {{popularity}} attracted large, interested audiences, as Pilgrims in the Wild at one point was selling 5,000 copies a month. Belaney appeared in traditional Ojibwa clothing {{as part of his}} fraudulent First Nations identity. Although his aunts recognised him at his 1935 appearance in Hastings, they did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about his true, British origins until 1937.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{an honorary}} degree and public {{platform}} {{was given to}} pro-choice Holy Cross alumnus Chris Matthews despite pro-life alumni objections. College President Fr. Michael McFarland defended the invitation and degree, despite clear direction from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishop policies and Catholic Church policies never to give a public platform to those at odds with central holdings of the Church, such as the teachings on abortion. McFarland along {{with the majority of}} the current Holy Cross community continue to defend this, stating that while Matthews is pro-choice, that is not his defining characteristic and he did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> purely about abortion in his speech.|$|E

60|$|Yet this {{universal}} language has not succeeded, {{at a moment}} of crisis, in imposing itself on the whole world. Nay, it has not, at the moment of crisis, succeeded in imposing itself on its own principal champions. Herve is <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he is talking French. Bebel is <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he is talking German. Blatchford is <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he is talking English, and jolly good English, too. I do not know whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde's nursery speech, but I am quite certain he will know more of it after this struggle than he knew before. In short, whether or no there be a new union of hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of tongues.|$|R

25|$|Minh {{was allowed}} to emigrate to France in 1983 and settled near Paris, and it was again assumed that the communists had {{permitted}} him to leave {{on the basis that}} he remain aloof from politics and history. In the late 1980s, there was speculation he would be allowed to return to Vietnam to live out his last years, but this did not happen. In the last few years of his life, he lived in Pasadena, California, with his daughter, Mai Duong. He later needed a wheelchair for mobility. In exile, Minh kept his silence, did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about the events in Vietnam, and did not produce a memoir.|$|E
25|$|SSR is not {{understood}} by researchers {{to be limited}} to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, transitional and developed countries. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after war has ceased. However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about reforms in the benefactors.|$|E
25|$|Although Inayat Khan did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> {{about her}} {{activities}} under interrogation, the SD found her notebooks. Contrary to security regulations, she had copied {{out all the}} messages she had sent as an SOE operative (this {{may have been due}} to her misunderstanding what a reference to filing meant in her orders, and also the truncated nature of her security course due to the need to insert her into France as soon as possible). Although she refused to reveal any secret codes, the Germans gained enough information from them to continue sending false messages imitating her. As a WAAF signaller, Inayat Khan had been nicknamed 'Bang Away Lulu' because of her distinctively heavy-handed style, which was said to be a result of chilblains.|$|E

25|$|MPs must confine their {{observations}} {{to the subject}} being discussed and may <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about irrelevant matters, and will be ruled out of order if they use offensive and insulting language about other MPs. They are also not permitted to impute improper motives to other MPs, or {{to refer to the}} conduct or character of any MP or public servant other than that person's conduct as an MP or public servant. There are restrictions on discussing the conduct of the President or a Judge or Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court; and referring to matters that are sub judice (pending before a court), though when a bill is being considered such cases can be discussed {{in a way that does}} not prejudice the parties to the case.|$|E
25|$|The main Mosque in Lhasa {{was burned}} down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently {{assaulted}} by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and do <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively {{and it had}} the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the above}} Quranic verses, there some {{authenticated}} references for this issue. For example, Ali Ibn Burhanu'd-din Halabi Shafi'i {{writes in his}} Siratu'l-Halabiyya, p.39 that at first Fatimah complained to Abu Bakr {{about the fact that}} she was given the fadak as a gift by the holy prophet of Islam, as the witnesses were unavailable she was forced to allege her right based on the inheritance law. Also it is mentioned in Mu'jam Al-Buldan of Yaqut al-Hamawi, Tafsir al-Kabir of Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi, Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa of Ibn Hajar p.21, Sharh al-Nahju'l-Balagha of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali Vol 4, p.80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to Abu Bakr and Umar again.|$|E
