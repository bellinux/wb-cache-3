60|$|Not {{only the}} {{practical}} geometry of Euclid, {{but also its}} nearest generalisation, the practical geometry of Riemann, and therewith {{the general theory of}} relativity, rest upon this assumption. Of the experimental reasons which warrant this assumption I will mention only one. The phenomenon of the propagation of light in empty space assigns a tract, namely, the appropriate path of light, to each interval of local time, and conversely. Thence it follows that the above assumption for tracts must also hold good for intervals of clock-time in the theory of relativity. Consequently it may be formulated as follows:--If two ideal clocks are going at the same rate at any time and at any place (being then in immediate proximity to each other), they will always go at the same rate, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> and when <b>they</b> are again compared with each other at one place.--If this law were not valid for real clocks, the proper frequencies for the separate atoms of the same chemical element would not be in such exact agreement as experience demonstrates. The existence of sharp spectral lines is a convincing experimental proof of the above-mentioned principle of practical geometry. This is the ultimate foundation in fact which enables us to speak with meaning of the mensuration, in Riemann's sense of the word, of the four-dimensional continuum of space-time.|$|R

The aim of the study is to investigate the possibilities and impediments for EU-citizens in Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom to enforce their (moral and/or legal) social rights in the fields of education, health care, housing and social assistance. Our focus is on redress mechanisms. It is a study that is comparative in several dimensions (between rights, between citizens, between countries and potentially also between different legal levels). Results indicate that if rights are provided and ifredress is offered, we have in the countries studied found no formal hindrances that discriminate against mobile EU-citizens. This said, we also learn that extra-procedural hindrances are a reality and that they create barriers especially problematic to mobile EU-citizens but also to EU-citizens living in their native countries. We conclude that the EU-citizenship project would gain from an exploration of new and innovative means of creating systems and institutions for the provision of basic, fundamental, social protection to secure life, dignity and means of social inclusion to all its citizens, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> in Europe <b>they</b> live or work.

40|$|Assuming {{that the}} cost of {{education}} of an engineer in 1963 in Poland amounted to about 670 000 zł in current prices, the question is being put forward how much time is needed for such a qualified worker to pay back to the community this sum of money. It seems to be reasonable to believe that rate of repayment is depending on the way an engineer is being employed. As there exists a lack of accurate figures on this matter, the author is trying to apply some sort of model analysis and is approaching the problem from both, productivity and salary points of view. At first he starts with the rate of growth of the national income that is assumed {{to be the result of}} a labour productivity of all the employed engineers only, but their productivity may result in the above mentioned rate of growth from 25 % to 100 %. Then the average salary in 1963 gives him an opportunity to suppose that the so called,,value for the community" adequate to the Marxian surplus value) may swing from 25 % to 150 % respectively. In this way he is geting a relatively wide gap, which seems to include all the engineers <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> and how <b>they</b> are employed. The above mentioned gap constitutes at the same time a proper answer to his basic question. As a result, the author comes to the conclusion, that approximately 5 — 15 years are needed for an engineer to repay to the community the education expenses (the so called unproduced value included) and 3, 5 — 10 years — if the latter element is being excluded.
