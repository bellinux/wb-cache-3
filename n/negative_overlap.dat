Among these, the ethanolamine conjugate of the n- 3 poly unsaturated long chain fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) (DHA) was shown to possess strong anti-inflammatory properties. Previously, we identified the serotonin conjugate of DHA, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA- 5 -HT), in intestinal tissues and showed that its levels are markedly influenced by intake of n- 3 PUFAs. However, its biological roles remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that DHA- 5 -HT possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating the IL- 23 -IL- 17 signaling cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DHA- 5 -HT down-regulates LPS-induced genes, particularly those involved in generating a CD 4 + Th 17 response. Hence, levels of PGE 2, IL- 6, IL- 1 β, and IL- 23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving the activation of pathogenic Th 17 cells in a concerted way, {{were found to be}} significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100 – 500 nM DHA- 5 -HT. Furthermore, DHA- 5 -HT inhibited the ability of RAW 264. 7 cells to migrate and downregulated chemokines like MCP- 1, CCL- 20, and gene-expression of CCL- 22 and of several metalloproteinases.

If at the same time community noise levels would increase due to the use of Krueger leading edge devices the effort to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft would be partly contradicted. In view of the above initial noise measurements on a 3 -dimensional semi-span wind tunnel model were conducted in order to (i) characterize the noise generated by a Krueger device and (ii) to compare the airframe noise contribution of a Krueger device with a conventional slat under similar aerodynamic conditions. Two different Krueger designs were noise tested in the anechoic open test section of DNW’s low speed wind tunnel Braunschweig.

In {{the first part of the}} paper, the effect of single injection timing on combustion phasing and underlying physical and chemical processes involved was examined through a series of analytical studies using the multi-cycle 3 D engine simulation programme.

As the injection was retarded to the intake stroke, the charge cooling effect tended to slow down the autoignition process.

The HCCI combustion was generated by creating a <b>negative</b> valve <b>overlap</b> (early exhaust valve closing combined with late intake valve opening) thus trapping {{a large amount of}} residuals (~ 55 %). Fifteen different fuels with high octane numbers were tested six of which were primary reference fuels (PRF's) and nine were commercial fuels or reference fuels. The engine was operated at constant operational parameters (speed/load, valve timing and equivalence ratio, intake air temperature, compression ratio, etc.) changing only the fuel type while the engine was running. Changing the fuel affected the auto-ignition timing, represented by the 50 % mass fraction burned location (CA 50). However these changes were not consistent with the classical RON and MON numbers, which are measures of the knock resistance of the fuel. Indeed, no correlation was found between CA 50 and the RON or MON numbers. However, when only the PRF's were considered, a correlation was found between the auto-ignition timing and the RON number. Although a substantial difference in auto-ignition timing between PRF 70 ON and PRF 98 ON was expected, the difference was only 1. 5 CAD. Furthermore, the differences in auto-ignition timing between all fuels spanned only 4. 5 degrees. It was found that the reason for the different behavior of the fuels during these measurements was the method of generating the HCCI combustion mode.

A novel approach to the formation of in-cylinder flow that promote Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition HCCI engine by generating various patterns of the incylinder flow has been proposed. Two types of inlet manifold diffusers were experimentally applied to a 4 -valve pentroof optical engine and the spatial flow inhomogeneities were carefully analysed.

A comparison of in-cylinder flow effects generated by different intake deflectors indicate that a low-swirl port configuration can potentially improve the fuel and thermal homogeneity by producing higher values of Root Mean Square (RMS) of velocity fluctuation and turbulence intensity. The high-swirl port configuration generates high stratification of gas flow field at Top Dead Centre (TDC). The final part of the study investigates the stratification of gas temperatures.

Thus, this paper aims at demonstrating the achievement of Controlled Auto-Ignition combustion on a standard 4 -cylinder gasoline engine with <b>negative</b> valve <b>overlap</b> (NVO) and analyzing its performance and emissions. The engine remained with substantially original components. The only major modification was the replacement of the camshafts for a new set of bespoke ones. The results showed a fair range of load and speed under CAI combustion with reduced brake specific consumption and ultra-low levels of NOx emissions. CO was also reduced, while HC emissions showed increased values. The results also point out some of the drawbacks of CAI combustion and the technological challenges of this advanced combustion process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{combined}} effects of boosting, intake air temperature, trapped residual gas fraction, and dilution on the Maximum Pressure Rise Rate (MPRR) in a boosted single cylinder gasoline HCCI engine with combustion controlled by <b>negative</b> valve <b>overlap.</b> Dilutions by both air and by cooled EGR were used. Because of {{the sensitivity of}} MPRR to boost, the MPRR constrained maximum load (as measured by the NIMEP) did not necessarily increase with boosting. At the same intake temperature and trapped residual gas fraction, dilution by recirculated burn gas was effective in reducing the MPRR, but dilution by air increased the value of MPRR. The dependence of MPRR on the operating condition was interpreted successfully by a simple thermodynamic analysis that related the MPRR value to the volumetric heat release rate. United States.

40|$|When {{simulating}} homogenous charge {{compression ignition}} or HCCI using one-dimensional models {{it is important}} to have the right combustion parameters. When operating in HCCI the heat release parameters will have a high influence on the simulation result due to the rapid combustion rate, especially if the engine is turbocharged. In this paper an extensive testing data base is used for showing the combustion data from a turbocharged engine operating in HCCI mode. The experimental data cover a wide range, which span from 1000 rpm to 3000 rpm and engine loads between 100 kPa up to over 600 kPa indicated mean effective pressure in this engine speed range. The combustion data presented are: used combustion timing, combustion duration and heat release rate. The combustion timing follows the load and a trend line is presented that is used for engine simulation. The combustion duration in time is fairly constant at different load and engine speeds for the chosen combustion timings here. The heat release rate is fitted to a Wiebe function where the heat release parameter m is found. It is shown that this parameter m scale to the load and the presented trend line is used for simulating the heat release. When the engine is operated with <b>negative</b> valve <b>overlap</b> the mass flow is reduced through the engine. In an engine simulation the valve timings has to be estimated for different intake temperatures and boost pressure levels. By using the intake temperature at intake valve closing as a prediction tool for the temperature at top dead center, the exhaust valve closing timing can be estimated and will then follow the real test results closely as shown in a GT-Power simulation. The turbocharged test engine is an in-line four cylinder gasoline engine with a total displacement of 2. 2 l. The engine is direct injected of spray-guided type. To achieve HCCI combustion the engine is operated with low lift and short duration valve timings where the variable <b>negative</b> valve <b>overlap</b> is used for combustion control...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{ab initio}} simulations aimed at identifying the atomistic and electronic structure {{origin of the}} high valence and conduction band, and band gap tunability of halide perovskites. We found that the two key ingredients are the overlap between bivalent cation and halide atomic orbitals, and the electronic charge of {{the bottom of the}} conduction band (CBM) state on the Sn or Pb atoms. In particular, we found that lower gaps are associated to higher <b>negative</b> antibonding <b>overlap,</b> and higher CBM charge on the bivalent cation. Both overlap and CBM charge on Sn/Pb can be tuned by the chemical nature of halide, bi and monovalent cation, as well as the symmetry of crystal structure. On the basis of our results we provide some practical rules to tune the valence band maximum, conduction band minimum, and band gap in this class of materials.
