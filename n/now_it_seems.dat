500|$|... "Listening to The Basement Tapes <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be the}} {{beginning}} of what is called Americana or alt.country," [...] wrote Billy Bragg. [...] "The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' {{is that it is not}} polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless—and the best Americana does that as well." [...] The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, [...] "If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts—Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, The Waterboys—have since tried to get back to that place." ...|$|E
500|$|Paste {{magazine}} writer Brent Koepp {{called it}} [...] "another incredible episode" [...] {{and said the}} impending conflict between Walter and Gus [...] "has the makings of one of television's finest showdowns". He also said the script made good use of the supporting characters, and that the growing distance between Hank and Marie was particularly well handled. Matt Seitz of Salon.com compared [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to excellent third season episodes that had [...] "very few scenes and sequences but luxuriated in them, allowing the characters (and the viewer) time to experience the tiny eddies and currents of the moment". He also called an overhead shot of Walter standing outside Gus' house alone [...] "one of the best shots in the show's history". Tim Surette of TV.com especially praised the scene with Walter approaching Gus' house, writing: [...] "Breaking Bad has always been good at creating an air of tension, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as though the series has mastered it. He also said Paul's acting during Jesse's emotional breakdown [...] "ripped my heart out and shredded it to pieces". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said the photography and direction during Jesse's party scenes was masterful: [...] "Here we are four seasons into Breaking Bad and I shouldn't still be amazed at the innovated visuals or perfectly honed sense of sound. These are masters at work, people." [...] Slate writers Jessica Grose and June Thomas both enjoyed the episode, although they found Walter's character increasingly difficult to sympathize with. Both praised the scene when Mike attacked Walter, while Grose especially enjoyed Aaron Paul's performance and Skyler's subplot.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{announcement}} that the character had been written out of Grey's Anatomy, Mary Macnamara wrote a critical LA Times editorial on the decision. She deemed Smith's firing: [...] "a grim reminder that certain prejudices are still ascendant in television", writing that [...] "most gay characters are allowed to have sex on network television {{only if they are}} part of a single-episode story line, and all actively sexual lesbian characters must be sylphlike, gorgeous and preferably under 30." [...] She went on to assess that: [...] "Smith probably got the boot not because her character wasn't interesting enough or sympathetic enough but because she, especially when paired with Ramirez, just didn't fit the visual template of [...] "Grey's" [...] or indeed, of most of network television. She is a character actress, not a tabloid star. In other words, and they are words I deeply regret, Ramirez, with all her lipglossed lusciousness, may be beautiful enough to be bi, but Smith is not beautiful enough to be gay. At least not on network TV. Some ground, it would appear, is too calcified to be broken." [...] After Ellen's Dorothy Snarker was similarly critical of the decision, explaining that: [...] "Smith's dismissal means the loss of American broadcast TV's only lesbian/bisexual couple in primetime. It was also the first significant gay relationship portrayed on the hit ABC series. The handful of remaining lesbian/bisexual relationships on TV are on cable, premium channels and daytime television." [...] Detailing the decision to also change a new character's orientation from bisexual to heterosexual, Snarker added: [...] "Besides striking a serious blow for queer women's visibility on the small screen, the moves seem to signal a significant setback in the industry's acceptance of mainstream gay and lesbian storylines." [...] She concluded that: [...] "While Callie had fleeting moments of gay panic where she slept with friend and fellow surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the interaction between the two women was both organic and romantic. Callie and Erica's relationship stood out as one of the few bright spots for lesbian and bisexual characters on primetime TV. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> all we’re left with is taillights." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home <b>now?</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

2500|$|Atik Mustafa Pasha Mosque ( [...] ; {{also named}} Hazreti Cabir Camii) {{is a former}} Eastern Orthodox church in Istanbul, {{converted}} into a mosque by the Ottomans. The dedication {{of the church is}} obscure. For a long time it has been identified with the church of Saints Peter and Mark, but without any proof. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> more probable that the church is to be identified with Saint Thekla of the Palace of Blachernae (Greek: , Hagia Thekla tou Palatiou tōn Vlakhernōn). The building belongs stylistically to the eleventh-twelfth century.|$|E
2500|$|The Goons made a {{considerable}} {{impact on the}} humour of The Beatles, and especially on John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book The Goon Show Scripts for The New York Times. He wrote: [...] "I was 12 when The Goon Show first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof {{that the world was}} insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called The Daily Howl. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> strangely similar to The Goon Show." [...] Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015 two {{government}} agencies, the State General Administration of Sports and the Ministry of Culture, {{announced the}} development of 12 model square dancing routines it had hired and trained instructors to introduce around the country. [...] "Dancing in public squares represents the collective aspect of Chinese culture, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that the overenthusiasm of participants has dealt it a harmful blow with disputes over noise and venues," [...] explained Liu Guoyong, director of General Administration of Sports' public fitness department. [...] "So we have to guide it with national standards and regulations." [...] Xinhua, the government's press agency, explained that the new routines would help make square dancing [...] "a nationally unified, scientifically crafted new activity that brings positive energy to the people." [...] The announcement {{was accompanied by a}} video set to [...] "Little Apple" [...] demonstrating one of the new routines.|$|E

2500|$|The album also {{received}} criticism for following the musical directions of artists that {{are said to}} have been influenced by Goldfrapp. Andy Gill of The Independent observed that [...] "Goldfrapp now suddenly effect a complete volte-face on Head First, heading back to the electronic pop of their three previous releases", which is [...] "a curious, circuitous trajectory which gives the impression that Goldfrapp are in the invidious position of playing catch-up to all the Gagas, [...] and Little Boots upon whom they must surely have been a major influence." [...] Barry Nicolson of NME commented, [...] "Once the source of pop inspiration, <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> they're content to follow", concluding that the album is [...] "basically an upbeat electro-pop record with one foot in the '80s, much like roughly 85 per cent of music made in the last two years." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer agreed, stating, [...] "Having pre-empted the wave of womanly electro, they appear now to be behind rather than ahead of the curve", while calling the album [...] "decent but unsurprising".|$|E
2500|$|Johnston {{traveled}} to Columbia, South Carolina, {{to begin a}} virtual retirement. However, as the Confederacy became increasingly concerned about Sherman's March to the Sea across Georgia and then north through the Carolinas, the public clamored for Johnston's return. The general {{in charge of the}} Western Theater, P.G.T. Beauregard, was making little progress against the advancing Union force. Political opponents of Jefferson Davis, such as Sen. Louis Wigfall, added to the pressure in Congress. Diarist Mary Chesnut wrote, [...] "We thought this was a struggle for independence. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> it is only a fight between Joe Johnston and Jeff Davis." [...] In January 1865, the Congress passed a law authorizing Robert E. Lee the powers of general in chief, and recommending that Johnston be reinstated as the commander of the Army of Tennessee. Davis immediately appointed Lee to the position, but refused to restore Johnston. In a lengthy unpublished memo, Davis wrote, [...] "My opinion of General Johnston's unfitness for command has ripened slowly and against my inclinations into a conviction so settled that it would be impossible for me again to feel confidence in him as the commander of an army in the field." [...] Vice President Alexander H. Stephens and 17 senators petitioned Lee to use his new authority to appoint Johnston, bypassing Davis, but the general in chief declined. Instead, he recommended the appointment to Davis.|$|E
2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E
