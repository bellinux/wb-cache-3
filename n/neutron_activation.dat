5|$|Thallium has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses {{that range from}} 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose.

The subsequent AMS measurements were carried out at the 14 MV tandem accelerator of the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratory in Garching using the Gas-filled Analyzing Magnet System (GAMS).

This value is slightly lower than two recently published measurements using the time-of-flight (TOF) method, but agrees within the uncertainties.

5|$|The 169Yb isotope (with a {{half-life}} of 32 days), {{which is}} created {{along with the}} short-lived 175Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, {{has been used as}} a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{practically}} stable 48Ca, the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is 41Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable 41K with a half-life {{of about a}} hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of 41K: traces of 41Ca also still exist today, {{as it is a}} cosmogenic nuclide, continuously reformed through <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> of natural 40Ca. Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from 34Ca to 57Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than 41Ca, the most stable among them being 45Ca (half-life 163days) and 47Ca (half-life 4.54days). The isotopes lighter than 42Ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than 44Ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium, although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes, with 79Br making up 51% of natural bromine and 81Br {{making up the}} {{remaining}} 49%.

The other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are 80Br (t1/2 = 17.7min), 80mBr (t1/2 = 4.421h), and 82Br (t1/2 = 35.28h), which may be produced from the <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is 77Br (t1/2 = 57.04h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 79Br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium; that of isotopes heavier than 81Br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton; and 80Br may decay by either mode to stable 80Se or 80Kr.|$|E
40|$|In Nigeria, large {{percentages}} of the populations {{are engaged in}} farming on the arable land. Elements play very {{important role in the}} fertility of these arable soils. To determine the essential elemental composition of soils obtained from Savannah and Rainforest parts of Nigeria, thermal <b>neutrons</b> <b>activation</b> analysis technique (TNAA) was used and the outer irradiation channel of Nigeria Research Reactor- 1 (NIRR- 1). This research reactor was operated at full power of 31 kW and a neuron setting of 2. 50 x 10 11 cm- 2 s- 1. Nine elements were determined in all the samples and identified in two groups. Group I elements identified as nutritionally-essential macronutrients to plants includes; Mg, K, Ca Na, Mn, and V. Group II elements identified to be non metabolic nutrients to plant includes Al Ti and Dy. However, Mg, K, Ca were present in large concentration and Na, Mn, V present in minor concentration in all the samples. Also, Al and Ti were present in minor concentration and Dy present in relatively low concentration in all the samples...|$|R

40|$|Major {{nuclear data}} {{libraries}} exhibit some discrepancies for the neutron capture reactions (235) U(n,gamma) and (238) U(n,gamma) at keV energies. These differences reflect also the scatter of experimental {{data that are}} primarily based on time-of-flight measurements (TOF) with detection of prompt gamma-rays. We report here on an independent approach for studying such reactions: <b>Neutron</b> <b>activations</b> with subsequent accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement represent an independent technique, where interference from fission is completely excluded. Activations of natural uranium samples were performed with cold neutrons (Budapest), thermal (Vienna) and with neutrons of 25 and 500 keV (Karlsruhe) for the measurement of (235) U(n,gamma) and (238) U(n,gamma). The produced long-lived (236) U and the decay product of (239) U, (239) Pu, respectively, were subsequently counted by AMS at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator. This method for measuring the neutron capture cross section has the advantage that the involved systematic uncertainties are in no way correlated with those inherent to the TOF technique. Preliminary data for these neutron energies indicate good agreement with evaluations and seem to support in the keV energy range the reported lower cross-section values for both capture reactions...|$|R
5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have nuclear spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> of natural chlorine.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} {{chlorine}} radioisotope is 36Cl. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 35Cl is electron capture to isotopes of sulfur; that of isotopes heavier than 37Cl is beta decay to isotopes of argon; and 36Cl may decay by either mode to stable 36S or 36Ar. 36Cl occurs in trace quantities in {{nature as a}} cosmogenic nuclide in a ratio of about (7–10)×10−13 to 1 with stable chlorine isotopes: it is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of 36Ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons. In the top meter of the lithosphere, 36Cl is generated primarily by thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> of 35Cl and spallation of 39K and 40Ca. In the subsurface environment, muon capture by 40Ca becomes more important {{as a way to}} generate 36Cl.|$|E
40|$|The stellar (n,gamma) {{cross section}} of 40 Ca at kT= 25 keV has been {{measured}} {{with a combination of}} the activation technique and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). This combination is required when direct off-line counting of the produced activity is compromised by the long half-life and/or missing gamma-ray transitions. The <b>neutron</b> <b>activations</b> were performed at the Karlsruhe Van de Graaff accelerator using the quasistellar neutron spectrum of kT= 25 keV produced by the 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be reaction. The subsequent AMS measurements were carried out at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) with a 3 MV tandem accelerator. The doubly magic 40 Ca is a bottle-neck isotope in incomplete silicon burning, and its neutron capture cross section determines the amount of leakage, thus impacting on the eventual production of iron group elements. Because of its high abundance, 40 Ca can also play a secondary role as "neutron poison" for the s-process. Previous determinations of this value at stellar energies were based on time-of-flight measurements. Our method uses an independent approach, and yields for the Maxwellian-averaged cross section at kT= 30 keV a value of 30 keV= 5. 73 +/- 0. 34 mb. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel.
