40|$|The RNA genome of the Moloney isolate of murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV) {{consists}} of two parts [...] a sarcoma-specific region with no homology to known leukemia viral RNAs, and a shared region present also in Moloney murine leukemia virus RNA. Complementary DNA was isolated which was specific for {{each part of the}} M-MSV genome. The DNA of a number of mammalian species was examined for the presence of <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> homologous with the two M-MSV regions. Both sets of viral <b>sequences</b> had homologous <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> present in normal mouse cellular DNA. MSV-specific sequences found in mouse cellular DNA closely matched those <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> found in M-MSV as seen by comparisons of thermal denaturation profiles. In all normal mouse cells tested, the cellular set of M-MSV-specific <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> was present in DNA as one to a few copies per cell. The rate of base substitution of M-MSV <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> was compared with the rate of evolution of both unique sequences and the hemoglobin gene of various species. Conservation of MSV-specific <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> among species was similar to that of mouse globin gene(s) and greater than that of average unique cellular sequences. In contrast, cellular <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> that are homologous to the M-MSV-murine leukemia virus "common" nucleotide region were present in multiple copies in mouse cells and were less well matched, as seen by reduced melting profiles of the hybrids. The cellular common <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> diverged very rapidly during evolution, with a base substitution rate similar to that reported for some primate and avian endogenous virogenes. The observation that two sets of covalently linked viral sequences evolved at very different rates suggests that the origin of M-MSV may be different from endogenous helper viruses and that cellular sequences homologous to MSV-specific <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> may be important to survival...|$|R
40|$|Recombination between viral and {{cellular}} genes can {{give rise to}} new strains of retroviruses. For example, Rous-associated virus 61 (RAV- 61) is a recombinant between the Bryan high-titer strain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and normal pheasant DNA. Nucleic acid hybridization techniques were used to study the genome of RAV- 61 and another RAV with subgroup F specificity (RAV-F) obtained by passage of RSV-RAV- 0 in cells from a ring-necked pheasant embryo. The <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> acquired by these two independent isolates of RAV-F that were not shared with the parental virus comprised 20 to 25 % of the RAV-F genomes and were indistinguishable by nucleic acid hybridization. (In addition, RAV-F genomes had another set of <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> that were homologous to some pheasant <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> and also {{were present in the}} parental viruses.) A specific complementary DNA, containing only <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> complementary to those acquired by RAV- 61 through recombination, was prepared. These <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> were pheasant derived and were not present in the genomes of reticuloendotheliosis viruses, pheasant viruses, and avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses of subgroups A, B, C, D, and E. They were partially endogenous, however, to avian DNA other than pheasant. The fraction of these <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> present in other avian DNAs generally paralleled the genetic relatedness of these avian species to pheasants. However, there was a high degree of homology between these pheasant <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> and related <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> in the DNA of normal chickens as indicated by the identical melting profiles of the respective hybrids...|$|R

Among three specimens of O.couesi, the sequence in this segment differed by only 1%, and all changes were silent mutations. The amino acids of the S segment differ by 7 to 10% from those of the related hantaviruses Bayou virus (BAYV; from the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris), Catacamas virus (CATV; from a Honduras population of Oryzomys couesi), and Black Creek Canal virus (BCCV; from the hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus).

5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequence)</b> and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequence</b> is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E

40|$|We have {{detected}} <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> {{related to the}} transforming gene of avian sarcoma vius (ASV) in the DNA of uninfected vertebrates. Purified radioactive DNA (cDNAsarc) complementary to most {{of all of the}} gene (src) required for transformation of fibroblasts by ASV was annealed with DNA from a variety of normal species. Under conditions that facilitate pairing of partially matched <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> (1. 5 M NaCl, 59 degrees), cDNAsarc formed duplexes with chicken, human, calf, mouse, and salmon DNA but not with DNA from sea urchin, Drosophila, or Escherichia coli.

In contrast to the preceding findings, <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> complementary to the remainder of the ASV genome were observed only in chicken DNA.

5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequence</b> of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
