5|$|Until the mid-1970s, the Conservative Party {{was mostly}} {{controlled}} by one-nation conservatives. The {{rise of the}} <b>New</b> <b>Right</b> in conservative politics led to a critique of one-nation conservatism which contended that Keynesian economics and welfarism had damaged the economy and society. The Winter of Discontent of 1978–79 was portrayed by the <b>New</b> <b>Right</b> as illustrative of the overextension of the state. Figures such as Margaret Thatcher believed that to reverse the national decline, {{it was necessary to}} revive old values of individualism and challenge the dependency culture created by the welfare state.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, Strache and the new leader of the French National Front, Marine Le Pen, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Shortly thereafter, the FPÖ attempted {{to become a member}} of the Europe for Freedom and Democracy group, but was vetoed by some of its parties. The FPÖ's two MEPs are individual members of the establishing European Alliance for Freedom. After the 2014 European elections, the party joined the National Front, the Northern League, Vlaams Belang and the Czech Civic Conservative Party in forming the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom, and participated along with these parties, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alternative for Germany, the Polish Congress of the <b>New</b> <b>Right</b> and a former member of the UK Independence Party in the Europe of Nations and Freedom parliamentary group.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the <b>New</b> <b>Right,</b> one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E

It discusses the advantages and constraints of the human rights framework and analyses {{the creation of}} <b>new</b> <b>rights</b> by the movement as a way to overcome the limitations of the ‘rights master frame’.

5|$|The FN {{has been}} part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also {{consisted}} of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN. From 1999 to 2001, the FN {{was a member of the}} Technical Group of Independents. In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It leads the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Polish Congress of the <b>New</b> <b>Right,</b> Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany, the Dutch Freedom Party, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party. They're also part of the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom since 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideology}} featured heavily during Disraeli's {{terms in}} government, during which considerable social reforms were passed. Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the party moved away from paternalism in favour of free market capitalism, but fears of extremism during the interwar period caused the revival of one-nation conservatism. The philosophy continued to be held by the Conservative party throughout the post-war consensus, influencing the decision to maintain Labour government Keynesian intervention in the economy, forming a welfare state and National Health Service. Later years saw the rise of the <b>New</b> <b>Right,</b> which attributed the country's social and economic troubles to one-nation conservatism. David Cameron, former leader of the Conservative Party, named Disraeli as his favourite Conservative and some commentators and MPs have suggested that Cameron's ideology contains an element of one-nationism. Other commentators have questioned the degree to which Cameron and his coalition have embodied One-Nation Conservatism, instead locating them in the intellectual tradition of Thatcherism. In 2016, Cameron's successor, Theresa May, referred to herself as a one-nation conservative in her first speech as prime minister and outlined her focus on social justice.|$|E

25|$|The {{reforms were}} criticised for the {{influence}} of <b>New</b> <b>Right</b> ideas and their effect of introducing market mechanisms and notions of competition in the education system.

25|$|Waugh broadly {{supported}} Margaret Thatcher in {{her first}} years as prime minister, but by 1983 he became disillusioned by the government's economic policy, which he felt used the destructive economics and cultural ideas of the <b>New</b> <b>Right.</b> When Thatcher became a strong public opponent of his friend and Sunday Telegraph editor Peregrine Worsthorne, Waugh became a staunch opponent of Thatcher. Her closeness to The Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, whom Waugh despised, further confirmed his view.|$|E
25|$|This {{proposed}} future route {{would cross}} the downtown core {{at right angles}} to the downtown transit mall and connect two new legs: the Southeast leg and the North-Central leg. It would exceed the capacity of the downtown transit mall, requiring that it use a <b>new</b> <b>right</b> of way going over or under the existing transit mall. Elevated tracks would conflict with Calgary's downtown +15 system, which is the most extensive pedestrian skywalk system in the world, so this option is unlikely. Most likely the system will go underground, crossing underneath the future downtown subway, which already has a short section of tunnel built under 8th Avenue S and a ghost station under the Calgary Municipal Building. The exact routes and station locations are currently in the planning stages.|$|E
25|$|Catherine did {{initiate}} {{some changes}} to serfdom, though. If a noble {{did not live}} up to his side of the deal, then the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law. Catherine gave them this <b>new</b> <b>right,</b> but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because {{she did not want to}} be bothered by the peasantry, but did not want to give them reason to revolt, either. In this act, though, she unintentionally gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before. Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs. Some serfs did apply for freedom and were, surprisingly, successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means all-inclusive.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the {{parliamentary}} elections of November 2, 2003, in which the <b>New</b> <b>Rights</b> overcame the 7-percent threshold, were abolished. New general elections were called. There was very little time left before the March 28, 2004 elections. The revolutionary sentiments were gaining momentum. Therefore, everyone {{inside and outside of}} the country was sure that none of the opposition parties would be able to succeed. From the so-called non-revolutionary parties, only the <b>New</b> <b>Rights</b> were able to overcome the 7-percent barrier. They made a coalition with another party of centre-right orientation, the Industrials and consequently successfully overcame the 7-percent threshold. David Gamkrelidze {{was in charge of the}} Industrial’s and <b>New</b> <b>Right’s</b> election campaign on March 28, 2004 as well.|$|R

25|$|The term Third Way {{refers to}} various {{political}} positions which try to reconcile right-wing and left-wing politics by advocating a varying synthesis of right-wing economic and left-wing social policies. Third Way was {{created as a}} serious re-evaluation of political policies within various center-left progressive movements {{in response to the}} ramifications of the collapse of international belief in the economic viability of the state economic interventionist policies that had previously been popularized by Keynesianism; and the corresponding rise of popularity for neoliberalism and the <b>New</b> <b>Right.</b> It supports the pursuit of greater egalitarianism in society through action to increase the distribution of skills, capacities, and productive endowments, while rejecting income redistribution as the means to achieve this. It emphasizes commitment to: balanced budgets, providing equal opportunity combined with an emphasis on personal responsibility, decentralization of government power to the lowest level possible, encouragement of public-private partnerships, improving labor supply, investment in human development, protection of social capital, and protection of the environment.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 2014, the National Front won the European {{election}} in France with 24.90% of the vote. Marine Le Pen came {{in first place}} in her North-West constituency with a score of 33.60%. 25 FN members {{were sent to the}} European Parliament of Strasbourg. They voted against the Juncker Commission in July. One year later, she was able to announce the formation of a group composed of the French National Front, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Italian Lega Nord, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Polish Congress of the <b>New</b> <b>Right,</b> the Flemish Vlaams Belang and former UKIP member Janice Atkinson. Her first attempt to constitute this group in 2014 failed because of the UKIP refusal and some controversial statements of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in June. Le Pen sat in the commission for international trade. In 2016, Politico ranked her as the second-most influential MEP after Martin Schulz.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{began in}} earnest {{on the morning of}} September 19. Bragg's men {{strongly}} assaulted but could not break the Union line. The next day, Bragg resumed his assault. In late morning, Rosecrans was misinformed that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore up the supposed gap, Rosecrans accidentally created an actual gap, directly in the path of an eight-brigade assault on a narrow front by Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, whose corps had been detached from the Army of Northern Virginia. Longstreet's attack drove one-third of the Union army, including Rosecrans himself, from the field. Union units spontaneously rallied to create a defensive line on Horseshoe Ridge, forming a <b>new</b> <b>right</b> wing for the line of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas, who assumed overall command of remaining forces. Although the Confederates launched costly and determined assaults, Thomas and his men held until twilight. Union forces then retired to Chattanooga while the Confederates occupied the surrounding heights, besieging the city.|$|E

40|$|When the Supreme Court grants <b>new</b> <b>rights,</b> public {{awareness}} {{is a crucial}} part of enforcement. Gerald N. Rosenberg and Michael J. Klarman famously criticized minority rights organizations for attempting to gain <b>new</b> <b>rights</b> through the judiciary. The crux of their argument relied heavily on the American media 2 ̆ 7 s scanty coverage of Court issues and subsequent low {{public awareness}} of Court cases. Using the 2013 United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry rulings as a case study, I suggest that the media environment has changed so much since Rosenberg and Klarman were writing that their theories warrant reconsideration. Minority rights groups now have access to social media, a potentially powerful tool with which to educate the public about the Supreme Court and <b>new</b> <b>rights</b> granted by the Court...|$|R
25|$|As {{had been}} the case for {{ratification}} in 1950, the Labour government concluded in 1965 {{that there was little}} to be lost from giving in to the pressure to recognise the Court and the right of petition. In December 1965, Wilson informed the House of Commons that the right of petition would be recognised for an initial period of three years. At the time the government were concerned that the Burmah Oil Company would take advantage of the <b>new</b> <b>right</b> to contest the legality of the War Damage Act 1965 depriving the company of the right to compensation for damage caused during World War II as recognised by a House of Lords' decision, the acceptance was timed to fall outside the six-month limitation period for challenges to the Act and the United Kingdom's acceptance also explicitly stated that it applied only to claims arising after its effective date. The declarations of acceptance were deposited by Robert Boothby MP with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 14 January 1966.|$|E

500|$|Recent {{historians have}} seen Agnew as {{important}} {{in the development of}} the <b>New</b> <b>Right,</b> arguing that he should be honored alongside the acknowledged founding fathers of the movement such as Goldwater and Reagan; Victor Gold, Agnew's former press secretary, considered him the movement's [...] "John the Baptist". Goldwater's crusade in 1964, at the height of Johnsonian liberalism, came too early, but by the time of Agnew's election, liberalism was on the wane, and as Agnew moved to the right after 1968, the country moved with him. Agnew's fall shocked and saddened conservatives, but it did not inhibit the growth of the <b>New</b> <b>Right.</b> Agnew, the first suburban politician to achieve high office, was one of the first public figures to capitalize on the politics of resentment, and helped to popularize the view that much of the national media was controlled by elitist and effete liberals. Levy noted, [...] "He helped recast the Republicans as a Party of 'Middle Americans' and, even in disgrace, reinforced the public’s distrust of government." ...|$|E
