50|$|Xsan {{file system}} uses several logical storages to {{distribute}} information. The two main classes of information appear on Xsan: the user data (such as files) and the file system metadata (such as <b>folders,</b> <b>file</b> names, file allocation information and so on). Most configurations use different storages for data and metadata.The file system supports dynamic expansion {{and distribution of}} both data and metadata areas.|$|R

40|$|Hierarchical file {{systems and}} file browsers offer {{powerful}} capabilities for managing and organizing <b>folders</b> and <b>files.</b> Yet they lack robust tools for annotating and documenting these files—individually or collectively—with descriptive text. In contrast, Web pages and wikis {{make it easy}} to create rich and meaningful narratives around digital artifacts, allowing files to be embedded within explanatory text and images. Unfortunately, considerable effort is required to manage files stored on Web servers and to ensure that the published content remains up-to-date. In this note, we describe WikiFolders, a hybrid system for annotating <b>file</b> <b>folders</b> that draws upon the strengths of both the hierarchical file system and wikis.

50|$|File Explorer can be {{extended}} to support non-default functionality by means of Windows Shell Extensions, which are COM objects that plug the extended functionality into Windows Explorer. Shell extensions {{can be in the}} form of shell extension handlers, toolbars or even namespace extensions that allow certain folders (or even non-filesystem objects such as the images scanned by a scanner) to be presented as a special <b>folder.</b> <b>File</b> Explorer also allows metadata for files to be added as NTFS Alternate Data Streams, separate from the data stream for the file.|$|R
50|$|The {{right-hand}} pane, {{which usually}} just lists <b>files</b> and <b>folders,</b> {{can also be}} customized. For example, {{the contents of the}} system folders aren't displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer. It's possible to define additional Explorer panes by using DIV elements in <b>folder</b> template <b>files.</b> This feature was abused by computer viruses that employed malicious scripts, Java applets, or ActiveX controls in <b>folder</b> template <b>files</b> as their infection vector. Two such viruses are VBS/Roor-C and VBS.Redlof.a.|$|R
50|$|A <b>file</b> <b>folder</b> (US usage) (or folder in British and Australian usage) {{is a kind}} of folder {{that holds}} loose papers and money {{together}} for organization and protection. <b>File</b> <b>folders</b> usually consist of a sheet of heavy paper stock or other thin, but stiff, material which is folded in half, and are used to keep paper documents. Files may also contain other things like magazine, cased in music cd's, etc. sometimes mostly not used for any official use, rather used as normal storage in a home. They are often used in conjunction with a filing cabinet for storage. <b>File</b> <b>folders</b> can easily be purchased at office supply stores. Although the origin of the <b>file</b> <b>folder</b> is uncertain, many theories point to U.S. Civil War lieutenant Joseph P. Meisburger as the first to develop the concept.|$|R

50|$|The {{document}} {{presented in}} a Planz window can be saved as an HTML file to be viewed in a web browser or edited in a word processor. Structure as well as content is preserved. The structure of a Planz document can also be exported for re-use either as a project template or for immediate use in another project. On the back-end, the file system headings and subheadings correspond to <b>file</b> system <b>folders</b> and sub-folders. Links within Planz correspond either to local <b>files</b> within these <b>folders</b> or to shortcuts which, in turn, can point to files, web pages or e-mail messages. The mapping from headings and links to <b>folders,</b> <b>files,</b> and shortcuts is one-to-one. Thus, Planz works with, and as an alternative to, the file manager. Users can create, modify or delete <b>folders</b> and <b>files</b> through operations initiated within Planz. In the other direction, a process of synchronization works to ensure the document views of Planz are current with respect to changes to the file system made outside of Planz.|$|R
50|$|Virtual folders {{provide a}} means for {{making it easier for}} users to find files that are content-related, such as by project. The user needs to specify {{criteria}} and all files matching the criteria are dynamically aggregated into the virtual <b>folder.</b> <b>Files</b> in a virtual folder are not limited to any single physical location on the hard drive, {{as is the case with}} traditional folders, but can be in any location. In fact, files in a virtual folder do not even need to be stored as files on the hard drive. They may be on a network share or in a custom application datastore such as e-mail inbox or even a database.|$|R
5000|$|In computing, {{directory}} service or name service maps {{the names of}} network resources to their respective network addresses. It is a shared information infrastructure for locating, managing, administering and organizing everyday items and network resources, which can include volumes, <b>folders,</b> <b>files,</b> printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers and other objects. A {{directory service}} is {{a critical component of}} a network operating system. A directory server is a server which provides such a service. Each resource on the network is considered an object by the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as a collection of attributes associated with that resource or object.|$|R

As stated, some refer to <b>file</b> <b>folders</b> simply as folders, but in North America this is confusing because folder can refer to several different things. Others use the term manila folders, but this is confusing because not all <b>file</b> <b>folders</b> are made of Manila hemp. This type of folder is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a [...] "vanilla folder." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{second type}} of {{hyperlink}} icon represents objects common in a physical office space and desktop environment. It includes the basic icons used for a <b>file,</b> <b>file</b> <b>folder,</b> trashcan, inbox, together with the spatial real estate of the screen, i.e. the electronic desktop. This model originally enabled users, familiar with common office practices and functions, to intuitively navigate the computer desktop and system. (Desktop Metaphor, pg 2). The icons stand for objects or functions accessible on the system, and enable the user to do tasks common to an office space. These desktop computer icons developed over several decades; data files in the 1950s, the hierarchical storage system (i.e. the <b>file</b> <b>folder</b> and <b>filing</b> cabinet) in the 1960s, and finally the desktop metaphor itself (including the trashcan) in the 1970s.|$|R
