5000|$|There is {{a rise in}} {{pressure}} at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This [...] "overpressure profile" [...] is known as an <b>N-wave</b> because of its shape. The [...] "boom" [...] is experienced {{when there is a}} sudden change {{in pressure}}; therefore, an <b>N-wave</b> causes two booms - one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive [...] "double boom" [...] from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s when {{supersonic}} transport (SST) designs were being actively pursued, {{it was thought}} that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the North American B-70 Valkyrie started flying, and {{it was found that the}} boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000 m). It was during these tests that the <b>N-wave</b> was first characterized.|$|E
50|$|For today's {{supersonic}} aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies {{from less than}} 50 to 500 Pa (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an <b>N-wave</b> boom. Peak overpressures for U-waves are amplified two to five times the <b>N-wave,</b> but this amplified overpressure impacts {{only a very small}} area when compared to the area exposed {{to the rest of the}} sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an F-4 flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of 100 ft. In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage — shattered glass, for example — will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and other agencies.|$|E

5000|$|The later {{shock waves}} are {{somewhat}} {{faster than the}} first one, travel faster {{and add to the}} main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined <b>N-wave</b> shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the [...] "rise time" [...] of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about 40000 ft, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be [...] "softer". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.|$|E

50|$|Seebass and George {{also worked}} on the problem from a {{different}} angle, trying to spread out the <b>N-wave</b> laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused (SR-71 Blackbird, Boeing X-43) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nosecone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed (bow shock), and using a swept back flying wing or an oblique flying wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from 40000 ft to 60,000 feet (from 12,000 m to 18,000 m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.|$|E
40|$|The large-time {{behavior}} of solutions to Burgers equation with small viscosity is described using invariant manifolds.

Through each of these fixed points there exists a one-dimensional, global, attractive, invariant manifold corresponding to the diffusive <b>N-waves.</b> Thus, metastability corresponds to a fast transient in which solutions approach this "metastable" manifold of diffusive <b>N-waves,</b> followed by a slow decay along this manifold, and, finally, convergence to the self-similar diffusion wave...|$|R

E orts to design an airplane to produce a minimized sonic boom at the ground require knowledge {{of the impact of}} sonic booms on people. Loudness, being a fundamental and well-understood characteristic of human hearing, was chosen as a means of quantifying the magnitude of sonic boom impact on people.

The procedure is applied {{to a wide range of}} sonic booms, both classical <b>N-waves</b> and a variety of other shapes of booms. The loudness of <b>N-waves</b> is controlled by overpressure and the associated rise time. The loudness of shaped booms is highly dependent on the characteristics of the initial shock. A comparison of the calculated loudness values indicates that shaped booms may have signi cantly reduced loudness relative to <b>N-waves</b> having the same peak overpressure.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some basic}} concepts {{that arise in}} the study of the tropical cyclone frictional boundary layer. Part I discusses the concepts of asymptotic triangular waves and asymptotic <b>N-waves</b> in the context of the nonlinear advection equation and Burgers' equation.

In Part II, analytical solutions of a line-symmetric, $f$-plane, slab model of the atmospheric boundary layer are presented. The boundary layer flow is forced by a specified pressure field and initialized with $u$ and $v$ fields that differ from the steady-state Ekman solution. With certain smooth initial conditions, discontinuities in $u$ and $v$ can be produced during the transient adjustment to the steady-state Ekman solution. Associated with these discontinuities in the horizontal wind components are singularities in the boundary layer pumping and the boundary layer vorticity, which can be either divergence-preferred or vorticity-preferred.

I. 0 BIntroduction inimization of sonic booms centers on reducing or eliminating the shock waves that contain high frequency audible components. A major conceptual breakthrough occurred when McLean 1 noted that booms from large aircraft in the real atmosphere would not necessarily evolve into far-field <b>N-wave</b> signatures at the ground. Non-N-wave mid-field signatures were possible. Figure 1 shows a range of candidate boom signatures.
