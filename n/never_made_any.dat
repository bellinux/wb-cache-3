Eisenhower attempted to clarify procedures through a signed agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon, drafted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr.. However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E

25|$|Mirabilis is an Israeli {{start-up}} which pioneered {{instant messaging}} (IM) and {{was bought by}} America Online. By giving away their ICQ product for free and preventing interoperability between their client software and other products, {{they were able to}} temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system.

25|$|Braathens SAFE started flying {{scheduled}} services to Hamar from 16 May 1956, using de Havilland Herons. Hamar was an intermediate {{stop on the}} route between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Trondheim Airport, Værnes, which also called at Røros Airport. Braathens remained until 1958, when they replace the Herons with the larger Fokker F27 Friendships on the route. These could not land on the short runway at Stafsberg, so Hamar was dropped from the service. Braathens stated that they <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> money from operating at Hamar. As a short-time replacement, Solbergfly started a route which connected Notodden Airport, Tuven with Oslo and Hamar, using a Cessna 310. However, the route was abandoned after a single season.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{its history}} at the airport, Braathens SAFE <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> profits on the route. For this the {{aircraft}} were too large. Prior to 1994 the airlines received concessions to operate the various routes. This were granted based on that some routes were profitable while other would operate at a loss. From 1 April 1994 the airline market in Norway was deregulated, and Braathens was no longer obliged to operate to Røros. The authorities announced that they would introduce a public service obligation (PSO) auction, financed through a NOK10 fee which would be charged on all domestic routes. Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines System agreed to waiver the fee in exchange for still operating their unprofitable routes.|$|E
25|$|In December 1957 Craig and {{his family}} left Indiana, largely because of his disgust with the state Republican Party, and moved to Virginia where he opened a law office and later became {{president}} of an automotive company. In 1965 he moved again to Los Angeles and continued practicing law. Finally in 1967, he returned home again to Brazil, Indiana and retired. He resumed some activity in the Republican Party as a political adviser, but <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> significant public appearances. He continued practicing law until 1976, and was made {{a member of the}} State Board of Law Examiners that year and remained on the board for a decade. He retired in 1986 and lived relatively secluded until his death on December 17, 1992.|$|E

He stated that he had ordered his assistant to log the incident. Another operator gave evidence that he had observed Red 1 and Red 2 fly first from Tromsø to Setermoen and then northwards to Alta and Kautokeino, in the no-fly zone. No other employees at Sørreisa could recall any such incidents, and the logs showed that Garvin was not working {{on the day of the}} accident. Garvin <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> comments about Harriers during the 1980s and his statements between 1997 and 2003 changed from him airing a possibility to a certain fact.|$|E
25|$|During {{the whole}} trial, the {{prosecution}} presented medical descriptions of Rappe's bladder {{as evidence that}} she had an illness. In his testimony, Arbuckle denied he had any knowledge of Rappe's illness. During cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Leo Friedman aggressively grilled Arbuckle that he refused to call a doctor when he found Rappe sick, and argued that he refused to do so because he knew of Rappe's illness and saw a perfect opportunity to rape and kill her. Arbuckle calmly maintained that he never physically hurt or sexually assaulted Rappe in any way during the September 5 party, and he also claimed that he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> inappropriate sexual advances against any woman in his life. After over two weeks of testimony with 60 prosecution and defense witnesses, including 18 doctors who testified about Rappe's illness, the defense rested. On December 4, 1921, the jury returned five days later deadlocked after nearly 44 hours of deliberation with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, and a mistrial was declared.|$|E
25|$|Erik Satie, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and {{the other}} members of The Group of Six in Paris <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> secret of their sympathy for ragtime, which is {{sometimes}} evident in their works. Consider, in particular, the ballet of Satie, Parade (Ragtime du Paquebot), (1917) and La Mort de Monsieur Mouche, an overture for piano for a drama in three acts, composed in the early 1900s in memory of his friend J.P. Contamine de Latour. In 1902 the American cakewalk was very popular in Paris and Satie two years later wrote two rags, La Diva de l'empire and Piccadilly. Despite the two Anglo-Saxon settings, the tracks appear American-inspired. La Diva de l'empire, a march for piano soloist, was written for Paulette Darty and initially bore the title Stand-Walk Marche; it was later subtitled Intermezzo Americain when Rouarts-Lerolle reprinted it in 1919. Piccadilly, another march, was initially titled The Transatlantique; it presented a stereotypical wealthy American heir sailing on an ocean liner on the New York–Europe route, going to trade his fortune for an aristocratic title in Europe. There is a similar influence in Milhaud's ballets Le boeuf sur le toite and Creation du Monde, which he wrote after a trip to Harlem during his trip in 1922. Even the Swiss composer Honegger wrote works in which the influence of African American music is pretty obvious. Examples include Pacific 231, Prélude et Blues and especially the Concertino for piano and orchestra.|$|E

25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> original contribution to Theology. He just {{was not interested in}} this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> money from this invention {{due to his}} failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly {{a result of the}} advice of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not patentable, and partly a result of the commercial failure of his earlier patent of 1791 for an early form of aniline dye. This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 into the street and domestic lighting market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered as Boulton and Watt did not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|E
