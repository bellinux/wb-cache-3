5000|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod, {{also known}} as nanowire, has a direct bandgap energy of 3.37 eV, {{which is similar to}} that of GaN, and it has an {{excitation}} binding energy of 60 meV. The optical bandgap of ZnO nanorod can be tuned by changing the morphology, composition, size etc. Recent years, ZnO nanorods have been intensely used to fabricate nano-scale electronic devices, including field effect transistor, ultraviolet photodetector, Schottky diode, and ultra-bright light-emitting diode (LED). Various methods have been developed to fabricate the single crystalline, wurtzite ZnO nanorods. Among those methods, growing from vapor phase is the most developed approach. In a typical growth process, ZnO vapor is condensed onto a solid substrate. ZnO vapor can be generated by three methods: thermal evaporation, chemical reduction, and Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS) method. In the thermal evaporation method, commercial ZnO powder is mixed with SnO2 and evaporated by heating the mixture at elevated temperature. In the chemical reduction method, zinc vapor, generated by the reduction of ZnO, is transferred to the growth zone, followed by reoxidation to ZnO. The VLS process, originally proposed in 1964, is the most commonly used process to synthesize single crystalline ZnO nanorods. In a typical process, catalytic droplets are deposited on the substrate and the gas mixtures, including Zn vapor and a mixture of CO/CO2, react at the catalyst-substrate interface, followed by nucleation and growth. Typical metal catalysts involve gold, copper, nickel, and tin. ZnO <b>nanowires</b> <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> epitaxially on the substrate and assemble into monolayer arrays. Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) has also been recently developed. No catalyst is involved in this process and the growth temperature is at 400 ~500 °C, i.e. considerably milder conditions compared to the traditional vapor growth method. Moreover, metal oxide nanorods (ZnO, CuO, Fe2O3, V2O5, others) can be simply made by heating initial metal in air in a Thermal oxidation process. For example, to make a dense [...] "carpet" [...] of CuO nanorods it was found to be enough to heat Cu foil in air at 420 °C.|$|E

The process flow begins with the gas phase synthesis and size selection of nanoparticle seeds. The seed particles are deposited onto addressable locations on a substrate by Coulomb force and fringing field directed assembly. The seed particles are then subsequently grown into nanowires in a second reactor. Gold <b>nanowires</b> <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> in a focused deposition and annealing process.

40|$|The kinks {{formation}} in heterostructural <b>nanowires</b> <b>was</b> observed to be dominant when InAs <b>nanowires</b> <b>were</b> <b>grown</b> on GaAs <b>nanowires.</b> <b>Nanowires</b> <b>were</b> <b>grown</b> through vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism in an MOCVD (metalorganic chemical vapor deposition) reactor. GaAs <b>nanowires</b> <b>were</b> <b>grown</b> in [(1) over bar(1) over bar(1) over bar]B direction on a GaAs ((1) over bar(1) over bar(1) over bar) B substrate. When InAs nanowires grown on the GaAs nanowires, {{most of the}} InAs nanowires changed their growth directions from ((1) over bar(1) over bar(1) over bar) B to other B directions. The kinks formation is ascribed to the large compressive misfit strain at the GaAs/InAs interface (7. 2 % lattice mismatch between GaAs and InAs) and the high mobility of indium species during MOCVD growth. The in-depth analysis of the kinks formation was done by growing InAs for short times on the GaAs nanowires and characterizing the samples. The hindrance to compressively strain InAs to form coherent layers with GaAs pushed the InAs/Au interfaces {{to the sides of}} the GaAs nanowires growth ends. New InAs/Au interfaces have generated at the sides of GaAs nanowires, due to lateral growth of InAs on GaAs nanowires. These new interfaces led the InAs nanowires growth in other B directions.
