30|$|The {{metabolic}} rate of Scombrid fish {{can be reduced}} by intra-muscular anaesthetics administered through injection of ketamine and medetomidine into the well vascularized red muscle along the midline of the body (Williams et al. 2004). This method {{can be used with}} the tuna tubes, as the sedative agent is not delivered through the water, and the sedation effect can be reversed with atipamezole when the fish are transferred to the holding tank. Yazawa et al. (2015) have shown that stress and activity levels can be reduced in mackerel tuna if the fish are kept in dark conditions during handling. Therefore, dark <b>non-reflecting</b> <b>material</b> should be used as padding {{to the inside of the}} tubes, as well as overall coverage to reduce light penetration and reflection.|$|E
