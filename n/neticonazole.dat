40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of KP- 103, a novel triazole derivative, against pathogenic fungi that cause dermatomycoses and its therapeutic efficacy against plantar tinea pedis and cutaneous candidiasis in guinea pigs were investigated. MICs {{were determined by}} a broth microdilution method with morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-buffered RPMI 1640 medium for Candida species and with Sabouraud dextrose broth for dermatophytes and by an agar dilution method with medium C for Malassezia furfur. KP- 103 was the most active of all the drugs tested against Candida albicans (geometric mean [GM] MIC, 0. 002 μg/ml), other Candida species including Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata (GM MICs, 0. 0039 to 0. 0442 μg/ml), and M. furfur (GM MIC, 0. 025 μg/ml). KP- 103 (1 % solution) was highly effective {{as a treatment for}} guinea pigs with cutaneous candidiasis and achieved mycological eradication in 8 of the 10 infected animals, whereas none of the imidazoles tested (1 % solutions) was effective in even reducing the levels of the infecting fungi. KP- 103 was as active as clotrimazole and <b>neticonazole</b> but was less active than lanoconazole and butenafine against Trichophyton rubrum (MIC at which 80 % of isolates are inhibited [MIC 80], 0. 125 μg/ml) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (MIC 80, 0. 25 μg/ml). However, KP- 103 (1 % solution) exerted therapeutic efficacy superior to that of <b>neticonazole</b> and comparable to those of lanoconazole and butenafine, yielding negative cultures for all samples from guinea pigs with plantar tinea pedis tested. This suggests that KP- 103 has better pharmacokinetic properties in skin tissue than the reference drugs. Because the in vitro activity of KP- 103, unlike those of the reference drugs, against T. mentagrophytes was not affected by hair as a keratinic substance, its excellent therapeutic efficacy seems to be attributable to good retention of its antifungal activity in skin tissue, in addition to its potency...|$|E
