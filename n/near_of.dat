25|$|In 1990, the MILL {{prepared}} {{to open its}} fourth season with six teams: the Baltimore Thunder, Detroit Turbos, New England Blazers, New York Saints, Philadelphia Wings, and Pittsburgh Bulls. Each of the six teams played an eight-game schedule over the 1990 season. During the <b>near</b> <b>of</b> {{the end of the}} season, the New York Saints defeated the Philadelphia Wings, 8–5, before the first sellout and the largest crowd in league history: 17,177 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Saints' victory forced a rematch the next week in the playoffs. However, the Wings won that game and later {{went on to become the}} first team to win two league championship games, defeating the New England Blazers, 17–7 in front of 11,479 fans.|$|E
25|$|The four-site {{models have}} four {{interaction}} points by adding one dummy atom <b>near</b> <b>of</b> the oxygen along the bisector of the HOH {{angle of the}} three-site models (labeled M in the figure). The dummy atom only has a negative charge. This model improves the electrostatic distribution around the water molecule. The first model to use this approach was the Bernal–Fowler model published in 1933, which {{may also be the}} earliest water model. However, the BF model doesn't reproduce well the bulk properties of water, such as density and heat of vaporization, and is thus of historical interest only. This is a consequence of the parameterization method; newer models, developed after modern computers became available, were parameterized by running Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations and adjusting the parameters until the bulk properties are reproduced well enough.|$|E

25|$|Taxis {{and mobile}} apps {{transport}} are widely available. The {{primary means of}} public transportation is by minibus, called angkot (from angkutan=transportation and kota=city). They are privately operated and cheap, serving multiple routes throughout the city, but are basic transport and not known for being comfortable. To find exact angkot routes, information is available through the drivers or at terminals. City-owned buses, called DAMRI, operate on longer high capacity routes. Bandung has 2 intercity bus terminals: Leuwipanjang, serving buses from the west, and Cicaheum, serving buses from the east. Both are at full capacity and are {{to be replaced by}} a new terminal at Gedebage on 15 hectares land, after which the old terminals will function as inner city terminals.

25|$|However, in 2005, the Hurricane Katrina {{destroyed}} many of {{the houses}} of the Isleños, and the Isleños Museum, {{and most of them}} migrated to other places in the U.S. during the hurricane. Over time, many Isleños who left the area eventually returned to Saint Bernard to build homes there. But in all, {{more than half of the}} population emigrated to other areas of Louisiana (where they had family) or to other areas of the United States still live there and the Isleño community continues to decline. Thus, of the <b>near</b> <b>of</b> 40,000 Isleños that, according to different estimates, Saint Bernard had in the year 2000, now only some 19,826 remain. Moreover, after Hurricane Katrina, the Spanish government in the Canary Islands donated money to help repair the Canary Islander Museum and historical properties in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. So, over time, the Isleños museum has been reconstructed. Currently, thousands of descendants of Isleños live in urban New Orleans.|$|E
500|$|Benjamin Powell {{argued that}} {{statelessness}} {{led to more}} order and less chaos than had the previous state, and economist Alex Tabarrok claimed that Somalia in its stateless period provided a [...] "unique test {{of the theory of}} anarchy", in some aspects <b>near</b> <b>of</b> that espoused by anarcho-capitalists David D. Friedman and Murray Rothbard, although this is disputed by various anarchists, of both the capitalist and anti-capitalist varieties, who contend it is not anarchy, but merely chaos, perhaps resulting from unequal distribution of power and meddling by neighbors and developed nations like the United States. The Somali experience since the collapse of the state, and especially the failure of international intervention, has offered a clear challenge to elements of conventional economic, political and social order theory and the very premises under which Western diplomacy and development agencies operate, and in particular, in the words of anthropologist Peter D. Little, [...] "assumptions about the role of states in maintaining order and services".|$|E

2500|$|According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony {{heard a voice}} {{telling him}} [...] "Go out and see." [...] He went out and saw an angel who wore a girdle with a cross, one {{resembling}} the holy Eskiem (Tonsure or Schema), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, [...] "Anthony, do this and you will rest." [...] Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution {{that was about to}} happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, {{and the end of the}} age. When Saint Macarius visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew <b>near</b> <b>of</b> the departure of Saint Paul the First Hermit in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from St Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th Patriarch of Alexandria.|$|E

The Qur'an says: “And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His {{messenger}} from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will.

From the Sunnah and Practice of the Prophet of Islam it is evident that Muhammad himself used to manage Fai {{as the head of the}} Islamic republic.|$|E
