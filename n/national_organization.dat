5|$|As the 1984 U.S. presidential {{election}} primary season neared its end and Walter Mondale became the likely Democratic nominee, {{the idea of}} picking a woman as his vice-presidential running mate gained considerable momentum. The <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> for Women and the National Women's Political Caucus pushed the notion, as did several top Democratic figures such as Speaker Tip O'Neill.

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to found a}} <b>national</b> <b>organization</b> was likely the result of several factors. First, the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized. Second, the localists gained confidence from their involvement in the dock workers' strike in Hamburg in late 1896 and early 1897. Third, loss of membership (for example, the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897) convinced the localists {{of the need for}} action.|$|E
5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded a <b>national</b> <b>organization</b> of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally {{supposed to take}} place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E
