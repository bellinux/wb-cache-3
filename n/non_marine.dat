40|$|Introduction Borate {{deposits}} {{are often}} important constituents of economic <b>non</b> - <b>marine</b> evaporates. They produce under arid climatic conditions in playa lakes (Floyd et al., 1998). In the south – western {{parts of the}} Kerman province, such as the Khatoonabad area (east {{of the city of}} Shahr –e –Babak) and Robat – Marvast basin (west of Shahr – e – Babak), there are several borate deposits. They can be seen mainly in Sanandaj – Sirjan depressions and they occur as borate bearing nodules beneath a thin layer of soil. In general, boron considerably reduces the thermal expansion of glass, provides good resistance to vibration, high temperatures and thermal shock, and improves its toughness, strength, chemical resistance and durability. It also greatly reduces the viscosity of the glass melt. These features, and others, allow it to form superior glass for many industrial and specialty applications (Garrett, 1998). In the past, the ancient residents used them as co-melting matters. Ulexite which is frequently found in the Khatoonabad playa (at 30 km South East of Shahr Babak) have Jewel properties (Ghaedi et al., 2014). Materials and methods After reviewing and Library Studies, geological field studies on the borate deposits were carried out from Shahr – e – Babak Playa. In order to take better samples, several pits were excavated with a depth of 30 cm to 1 meter so that borate minerals became apparent. X-ray diffraction analysis (IMIDRO, Karaj), and ICP AES (ALS CHEMEX, Canada) methods were carried out on representative samples taken from the studied area. Discussion Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Borate minerals also occur in fibrous aggregates and massive forms. Mineralogy XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly belong to the hydrated borates and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data indicate that the boron is the dominant constituent in the studied playa. Borate minerals are divided into two groups of hydrated and non-hydrated borate category (Palache et al., 1952.; Garrett, 1998). Both hydrated and non-hydrated borate minerals have been formed in the Shahr-e-Babak playa. Hydrated borate in the study areas: Hydrated borates are those borates in which water molecules are involved (Garrett, 1998). In the studied area, the hydrated borate minerals include: Borax, Ulexite, Inyoite, Gowerite. Non-hydrated borate in the study areas: In the Shahr-e-Babak playa, Sassolite non-hydrated borate minerals are abundant. According to the XRD analyses performed on samples from the study areas, the hydrated borate minerals are more important minerals. The main economic valuable minerals include: 1 - Ulexite (NaCaB 5 O 9. 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 (Ghose et al., 1978). In the Shar – e - Babak playa, ulexite occurs as deposits with massive, cauliflower-like nodules and fibrous textures. 2 - Borax (Na 2 B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 • 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m. Crystals are commonly short to long prismatic [001] (Levy and Lisensky, 1978). In the studied borate samples, it can be found in association with the other borate minerals, and often occurs in the form of salt marsh. 3 - Gowerite (CaB 6 O 8 (OH) 4 • 3 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Erd et al., 1959). In the Khatoonabad samples, it was found as prismatic and spherical crystals along with ulexite. 4 - Inyoite (CaB 3 O 3 (OH) 5 • 4 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Christ, 1953). This mineral has been detected in the studied area by XRD. Sassolite (H 3 BO 3) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 and as scaly pseudohexagonal crystals (Allen and Kramer, 1957). This mineral is found frequently in the Marvast Playa. Geochemistry Geochemical data indicate that in the studied playa, boron is very abundant. Good correlation between the elements, such as B and Ca confirms the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas. Origin Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from the Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of the Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Result The XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly are hydrated ones and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data confirm the frequency of boron in the playa. Good correlation between the elements such as B and Ca verifies the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas.

Chitinozoans such as Margachitina elegans, Ancyrochitina fragilis brevis, Ancyrochitina fragilis, Sphaerochitina sphaerocephala, Urnochitina urna, Pseudochlathrochitina carmenchui and Lagenochitina brevicollis confer the Pridoli age assignment. This assemblage of chitinozoans correlates very well with Assemblage D from the Alternances Gréso-Argileuses Formation of the A 1 - 61 well in northwestern Libya. Among the acritarchs present are: Cymbosphaeridium pilar, Leoniella carminae,Diexallophasis spp., Tunisphaeridium cf caudatum, Leiofusa estrecha and Eupoikilofusa striatifera. Furthermore, the join occurrence of U. urna, P. carmenchui and M. elegans is clearly indicative of the middle part of the Pridoli as in the Libyan well A 1 - 61, and in many wells in Algeria. This corresponds to what {{is considered to be}} a transgressive mid Pridoli event in the Algerian Sahara, with <b>non</b> <b>marine</b> intervals bracketing this brief marine sea level rise. This event is likely to have extended into all of north Gondwana including Arabia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{developments}} of maritime sector in Indonesia shows increasing demand for ships. Especially ships with size of 30 GT has problem with low {{availability of the}} ship engine, {{which most of the}} ships still use <b>non</b> <b>marine</b> diesel engine as its main propulsion. The problem gives interest to make a step to improve by design marine diesel engine using reverse engineering method. Cam system of marine diesel engine design was needed to be calculate to select the material and the motion. The design of cam system needs study about the stress analysis in cam system to make sure the distribution of force and moment. The result of stress analysis was used to select material of components in cam system. The motion analysis result was used to be input data of stress analysis. The condition to obtain the stress of components was on maximum condition, its contain pressure, torque, rotation, and force. All component that calculated are camshaft, lifter (flat-tappet), push rod, rocker arm, spring, and valve. Each component was given two different materials and material selection was based on safety factor of each component. Material for camshaft and lifter were malleable cast iron, for push rod and rocker arm were mild steel, for spring was ASTM A 231, for intake valve was steel JIS SUH 3, and for exhaust valve was steel JIS SUH 35. The result of motion analysis were angular velocity of camshaft with value was 2400 deg/sec, friction force between camshaft and lifter with maximum value was 125. 393 N, and contact force between camshaft and lifter with maximum value was 845. 307 N, and linear velocity of intake valve with maximum value was 696. 573 mm/s, and linear velocity of exhaust valve was 463. 734 mm/s. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{stratigraphy}} {{of the newly}} defined mid-Carboniferous boundary. The selection of the mid-Carboniferous stratotype section should reconcile problems between the different mid-Carboniferous biostratigraphies developed throughout the world and provide a standard against which other successions can be correlated. The nature of the mid-Carboniferous boundary in the Clare Basin has been investigated. Various geochemical analyses have been conducted on a mid-Carboniferous section {{and it has been}} possible to construct a chart relating these various geochemical parameters to relative sea-level. It is shown that although deposition is complete through the interval, there is a geochemical expression of a lowstand during the lowest Chokierian. Additionally, doubt is cast on the presumption that all sediments deposited outside 'marine bands' are <b>non</b> <b>marine.</b> A model has been developed for mid-Carboniferous deposition in the Clare Basin. It is envisaged that the shelves of the Clare Basin were flooded during the early Namurian leading to an environment suitable for phosphate authigenesis. During a major regression in the Pendleian/lower Arnsbergian the phosphate was reworked into a lag. The lowstand of the basal Chokierian is marked by a thin lag on the shelves, whilst deposition was continuous in the basin centre. Later Chokierian times are marked by a widespread transgression. The mid-Carboniferous stratotype has been chosen at Arrow Canyon,Nevada. Microfacies studies show that deposition was on a winnowed carbonate platform showing reworking of bioclasts. Faunal diversity and eveness studies have also been conducted on this section. No drop in diversity is seen at the mid-Carboniferous boundary, although a drop in eveness is seen, whether this relates to a specialised fauna or selective winnowing of bioclasts is unknown. Correlations between America and western Europe show that conodonts are strongly facies controlled and {{it is unlikely that the}} appearance of Declinognathodus noduliferus is truly isochronous between sections, and thus is an unwise choice for defining the mid-Carboniferous boundary. Additionally it is suggested that Arrow Canyon was a poor choice for the stratotype section due to both the possibility of reworking, the presence of an unconformity in the section and possible doubts over the conodont record at this locale. The Rhachistognathus minutus zone is recognized as a new conodont zone across the Arnsbergian/Chokierian boundary...|$|E
40|$|The marine Eucla basin in {{southern}} Australia {{is emerging as}} a major new heavy minerals province in Australia. Beach placers {{are associated with a}} series of partially buried Cenozoic coastal barrier sands formed along an arcuate 2, 000 -km-long basin margin, the trace of which is up to 320 km inland of the present coastline. The presence of high-grade deposits with dominant zircon over ilmenite and lesser amounts of rutile and leucoxene was established with the discovery of the Jacinth and Ambrosia heavy mineral deposits in late 2004. An additional 10 heavy mineral prospects were subsequently identified and are at various stages of evaluation. The Eucla basin and its adjacent paleovalley system have a large areal extent that contains a complicated succession of marine and <b>non</b> <b>marine</b> strata spanning a wide range of depositional environments. Four distinct constructional phases for the development of shorelines can be recognized and correlated with major third-order sea-level events, established by others from the marine depositional record as occurring during the middle Eocene (∼ 42. 5 Ma), late middle Eocene (39 - 36 Ma), late Eocene (36 - 34 Ma), and Miocene-Pliocene (15 - 2. 6 Ma). Prevailing westerly winds built extensive dune systems by longshore drift. Sediment movement was from west to east. Detrital zircon rocks from the Ooldea and Barton barriers show a distribution of zircon age that is consistent with the Proterozoic Musgrave province {{to the north of the}} basin as the dominant primary source area of the heavy minerals, with a contribution from the Albany Fraser orogen to the west. The likelihood is that these heavy minerals have been recycled via sedimentary basins that flank the Musgrave province and include the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Officer basin and Permian to Mesozoic deposits of the Bight basin. Our current depositional model is summarized as follows: (1) initial rapid transgression and deposition of a shallow marine sand sheet subsequently overlain by shallow marine limestone during middle Eocene; (2) a major Eocene transgression and deposition of a shelf barrier and lagoonal shoreface marine complex during the late middle Eocene; (3) further transgression and highstand deposition during the late Eocene; (4) renewed transgression of barrier lagoonal and possibly flooding deltaic sand blanket in the southeastern coastal plain with neotectonic uplift tilting in the western Eucla margin during Mio-Pliocene time. Each stage of reworking increased the potential for heavy mineral concentration in placer deposits. 26 page(s...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The {{most important factor}} in the area to influence both structure and stratigraphy is the Santa Susana overthrust. Overthrusting along the Santa Susana fault has in many cases taken place along more than one plane producing an imbricate structure. Structurally the period of orogeny which culminated in this overthrusting resulted in close and overturned folding and faulting. The most prominent anticlinal fold is that which extends in a nearly east-west direction across the entire width of the area and passes just below the Holt Ranch, in Browns Canyon. Faults which are older than the Santa Susana orogeny are found, and include both the normal and reverse types. Some of these earlier faults have cut out varying thicknesses of formation, introducing local stratigraphic gaps. Several periods of folding, uplift arid erosion, indicated by unconformities, are evident, and provide lines of weakness which have been influential in guiding and controlling the later folding. Thin development of formations and the numerous unconformities point to a very unstable area. Recent diadtrophic movement is indicated by folding and faulting of the (Pleistocene) Santa Susana overthrust plane. Through the medium of this overthrusting, an entirely different stratigraphy from that native to the area has been introduced. Above the thrust, a thick section composed of Modelo shale, (lower Monterey) (Valvulineria californica zone) shale, and non-marine Topanga sandstone, conglomerate, and basalt is found, This section, which has been overthrust from the north, presents an entirely different environmental lithology. The lithology below the thrust, and native to the area, is much less well-developed, and differs considerably from the introduced section found above the thrust. The poor development of these formations, {{and the fact that they}} thicken northward and that they are nearly all separated by unconformities, suggests a marginal oscillating environment in the old Miocene-Pliocene depositional basin. The overthrust section and sections to the north, as at Pico and Elsmeree canyons, are much thicker and lack many of the unconformities present in this area. These areas undoubtedly occupied a position nearer the center of the Miocene-Pliocene depositional basin. The oldest rock native to this area is the great thickness of Chico (Upper Cretaceous) sandstone, which makes up the boldly outcropping Simi Hills. Unconformably overlying this is the basal Martinez conglomerate (lower Eocene), which, in the particular area mapped, is in fault contact with younger Eocene to Pliocene formations. The only other Eocene formation mapped was the thick section (1300 feet [ [...] . ]) of Llajas (middle Eocene) shales and silts, which grade downward to sandstone and conglomerate near the base of the formation. The Llajas is abundantly fossiliferous. A big stratigraphic break separates the Liajas from an unconformably overlying upper Topanga conglomerate and silt, 50 to 100 feet thick. This thin section of marine fossiliferous Topanga, limited above and below by unconformities, is a marked contrast to the thick section of <b>non</b> <b>marine</b> sandstone, conglomerate, and basalt which lies above the thrust and was introduced from an area to the north by overthrusting. Disconformably above the Topanga, in the section native to the area, is found a thin section of argillaceous Modelo shale, varying in thickness from about 25 feet in the southern part of the area to more than 100 feet in the northern portion, where sandstone lenses and layers are found interbedded. This relatively thin section is in marked contrast to the thick overthrust section of Modelo, which is in excess of a thousand feet thick. The Valvulineria californica shale section found between the Topanga non-marine and Modelo shale lying above the thrust is not found in the section below the thrust. Disconformably above the "native" Modelo shale is found a late lower and early middle Pliocene concretionary silt which is equal in age to about the middle of the Pico formation at the type section in Pico Canyon. This partial equivalent of the type Pico has been designated as the Pico formation in the area mapped. An unconformity separates these Pico silts from an overlying sandstone, conglomerate and fossil reef formation which has been designated the San Diego formation because of the similarity of its abundant fossil content with that of the type San Diego. This 75 to 100 foot thickness of upper middle Pliocene-San Diego strata is, however, an age equivalent of the upper Pico formation at its type locality. Both mega- and micro- fossil evidence points to this. Thus it may be said that the time represented in the accumulation of the strata at the type locality of the Pico formation has its equivalent in the Aliso and Browns Canyons area. This time equivalent is represented by the San Diego formation, the so-called Pico silts of the area, the unconformity separating the two, and by part of the time represented in the unconformity below the Pico silts and above the Miocene Modelo formation. The San Diego formation grades upward into brackish and non-marine Saugus deposits composed of 500 feet of sands, conglomerates and mudstones. All of these previously mentioned formations were involved in the latest severe folding which culminated in the Santa Susana overthrust. Lying on the erosion surface formed by the partial beveling of these folded deposits are found younger Pleistocene terrace and river channel deposits consisting of large, hard, sandstone boulders, mud, and Modelo shale fragments...|$|E
