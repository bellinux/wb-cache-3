40|$|Superior {{performance}} levels of advanced fighter aircraft require highly integrated <b>nozzles</b> <b>with</b> thrust vectoring capability. <b>A</b> platypus <b>nozzle</b> design <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large width to height ratio of its exhaust duct exit meets propulsion integration goals. The aerodynamic performance {{of three different}} geometry concepts of two-dimensional convergent/divergent <b>nozzles</b> <b>with</b> thrust vector control capability was investigated at flight Mach numbers 0. 6 and 0. 8 at sea level altitude. Under consideration of the external afterbody flowfield, Euler calculations were carried out for <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slot exit, <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> S-shaped duct, and <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> configuration <b>with</b> injection of secondary air as coolant to reduce vectoring flap wall temperatures and for fluidic control of the gross thrust vector. As results of the CFD calculations of the nozzle/afterbody flow fields the thrust vector behavior is shown for a large range of nozzle pressure ratios, various pitch vectoring flap positions, and different mass flows of secondary air. Due to the asymmetry of the nozzle geometry, pitching moments are generated which change considerably when varying the nozzle pressure ratio from idle to maximum dry power operating conditions. The complex interaction between the external afterbody flow, the jet plume flow, and the secondary cooling air flow at subsonic Mach numbers leads to large changes of the longitudinal moment coefficients {{as a function of}} secondary air pressure ratios. Flowfield phenomena are demonstrated with isolines for Mach numbers and pressure coefficients together with pressure distributions along internal nozzle walls and external afterbody contours. (orig.)
