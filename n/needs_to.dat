5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone.

5|$|Gene {{expression}} first involves transcription, {{in which}} DNA {{is used as}} a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be exported.|$|E

The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E

5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They {{must be taken into}} account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E
