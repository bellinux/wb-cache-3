5|$|While <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> {{had already}} begun to move from a foreign policy based upon proletarian internationalism at the Conference of Party Representatives in 1966, the WPK {{leadership}} had never explicitly broken with proletarian internationalism as it did at the 6th Congress. In theory, a communist party supports policy contributing to the world revolution. Communist regimes rarely lived up to this ideal; by the 1950s, ideological schisms within the world communist movement made it all but impossible. From 1966 onwards, <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> strengthened relations with neutral countries in the global Cold War. Proletarian internationalism was replaced with a national, independent foreign policy; if a socialist and non-socialist country were at war, <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> could (in theory) support the non-socialist country if it benefited <b>North</b> <b>Korea.</b> At the 6th Congress, Kim Il-sung attached more importance to relations with Third World countries than to unity in the socialist camp. Nevertheless, <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> still received massive funds and aid from the Soviet bloc, the People's Republic of China and relations with the United States would remain bitterly cold. While <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> argues that independence and proletarian internationalism are not exclusive, in orthodox communist theory they are.|$|E
5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> writing about <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> tend to speak positively of <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

[...] However, this forms the second echelon of <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> deployment to the DMZ, with the first echelon composed of four infantry corps, and the rest in strategic reserve.
