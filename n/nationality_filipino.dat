Our Lady of Good Counsel's membership includes people of about 80 different nationalities, and it holds mass in four languages: Norwegian, English, Polish, and Vietnamese. Of the parish's population, only slightly over half were born in Norway, with the next most common <b>nationalities</b> being Vietnamese, <b>Filipino,</b> and Polish.

50|$|Prior to the {{promulgation}} of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, {{residents of}} the Philippines were considered nationals of the United States, and naturalization was governed by Act No. 2927, the Naturalization Law, passed by the Philippine Legislature. However, {{with the passage of}} the Tydings-McDuffie Act in 1934, national status for {{residents of the}} Philippines was revoked in preparation for the islands' independence, and the question of nationality was passed on to the then-newly formed Commonwealth government inaugurated in 1935. Pursuant to Article IV of the 1935 Constitution, the National Assembly of the Philippines passed Commonwealth Act No. 473, the Revised Naturalization Law of 1939, which provided a mechanism for the acquisition of <b>Filipino</b> <b>nationality</b> by naturalization.|$|R

40|$|Overseas {{employment}} workers play {{an important}} role in Philippines economy. Nearly ten percent of GDP is contributed by overseas workers remittances. According to the POEA 2010 - 2014 statistic report, over 400, 000 Filipino seafarers work on-board ocean-going vessels. Because of the relatively high standard of training and language skills of the Filipinos, they are the most hired workers in today s shipping industry in terms of number. Due to the lack of commonly accepted judicial standards in place, however, there exists many areas of conflict between the Filipino workers and their foreign employers. In spite of the government s attempts to improve the relations between the seafarers and their employers and, to bring equality and fairness into the contractual relation, more and more Filipino seafarers file petitions against shipowners seeking to obtain compensation and benefits. It is a necessity that issues regarding work-related injury, illness or even death on board vessels be addressed in the terms of the contract. While the mechanism of compensation and benefits are detailed in the negotiated contract agreed by parties. Disputes are often solved by petitions filed by the employees who try to interpret the terms differently from the custom usage and seek for a chance of unjust enrichment, rather than by the binding rules of the contract. Also NLRC/NCMB, court of appeal and even the Supreme Court sometime set the clear evidence aside and made decisions in favor of the labors in some cases. From P&I comment, To some shipowners the frustration is so immense that they consider changing crew <b>nationalities</b> away from <b>Filipinos</b> This study will look into the problems described above in the introduction both on the legal aspect and through a practical approach. In this context, the study has the following scope: (1) Examine the grounds to interpret POEA SEC terms.

5000|$|Despite being numerous, {{the tongs}} had some similarities.To join most tongs, {{there were no}} {{requirements}} placed on being from a specific clan or birthplace, as well as no particular economic status, since tong members seem {{to have come from}} all different aspects of society. Also, while most of the tong members were obviously Chinese, membership was not limited to the basis of <b>nationality,</b> as Japanese, <b>Filipino,</b> and even Caucasians were known, albeit rarely, {{to be part of a}} tong organization. All tongs used harmless and peaceful sounding names, such as The Society of Pure Upright Spirits and the Peace and Benevolence Society. [...] This could be because many of these organizations original intentions and goals were good. Many of the “traditional” tongs were formed for the collective protection of their countrymen from discrimination by others, as well as criminals in general. The criminal elements of the tongs eventually either found that it was more profitable to participate in illicit activities, or the criminal elements of the tong wrestled power away. Tongs took an intense interest in attempting to corner the market on criminal markets, especially anything that would bring in a nice profit, such as prostitution, opium, gambling, and forcing Chinese merchants to pay “protection fees.” One interesting aspect of the tongs was that each organization had two to three fluent English speakers, who served a variety of functions for the tong such as skimming over the local newspapers so that if their group was mentioned, they could inform their fellow members. They also dealt with the “foreigner” lawyers and Americans if the need arose. Membership numbers varied from tong to tong, from as few as 50 to as many as 1,500 members in 1887. [...] It was common for a tong to splinter when it accumulated too many members. One problem that was common throughout the period that would aid in the breakout of wars between the tongs was that some members could be a member of six tongs at any one time, so that if that member was killed by another tong in a war, one of his other five tongs he was a member of would, and sometimes did, seek revenge by declaring war.|$|R
