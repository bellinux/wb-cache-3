40|$|Interest in <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> over finite fields stems {{both from}} {{mathematical}} theory and practical applications. There {{has been a}} lot of literature dealing with various properties of <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> (for finite fields and for Galois extension of arbitrary fields). The advantage of using <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> to represent finite fields was noted by Hensel in 1888.

The present thesis studies various theoretical and practical aspects of <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> in finite fields. We first give some characterizations of <b>normal</b> <b>bases.</b> Then by using linear algebra, we prove that F q n has a basis over F q such that any element in F q represented in this basis generates a normal basis if and only if some groups of coordinates are not simultaneously zero.

In particular, optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> are desirable. When no optimal normal basis exists, it is useful to have <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> with low complexity. In this paper, we study the type k(⩾ 1) Gaussian normal basis N of the finite field extension Fqn/Fq, which is a classical normal basis with low complexity. By studying the multiplication table of N, we obtain the dual basis of N and the trace basis of N via arbitrary medium subfields Fqm/Fq with m|n and 1 ⩽m⩽n. And then we determine all self-dual Gaussian <b>normal</b> <b>bases.</b> As an application, we obtain the precise multiplication table and the complexity of the type 2 Gaussian normal basis and then determine all optimal type 2 Gaussian <b>normal</b> <b>bases...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we shall}} first obtain some basic {{theoretical}} results on trace-orthogonal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> of GF(qn) over GF(q) : We show {{that such a}} basis exists {{if and only if}} a self-dual normal basis exists (in fact, any such basis is equivalent to a self-dual one) and we give several characterizations of the trace-orthogonal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> in terms of two matrices M and T (associated with every normal basis N) describing the multiplicative structure of GF(qn). The matrix T is actually the matrix used in investigating the complexity of the normal basis N. Using this fact, we also completely determine the trace-orthogonal optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases.</b> In the special case q = 2, n even, we then give a simple construction associating with every self-dual normal basis N another such basis N∗ and relate the complexities of these two bases. This allows us to obtain an upper bound on the complexity of self-dual <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> in this case which turns out to explain several entries in the available tables on computer searches regarding the complexity of <b>normal</b> <b>bases.</b> Finally, we give a product construction for (trace-orthogonal) <b>normal</b> <b>bases...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Normal</b> <b>bases</b> and {{efficient}} arithmetic in finite fields Efficient arithmetic of finite fields {{is important in}} implementing cryptosystems, error-correcting codes and computer algebra systems. <b>Normal</b> <b>bases</b> offer considerable advantages. Optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> in finite fields were introduced at the University of Waterloo by Mullin et al., and are used in practical hardware implementation of public-key cryptosystems. In the same paper, Mullin et al. constructed two families of optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> and, based on a computer experiment, they conjectured no more exist. This conjecture had remained open for several years before H. W. Lenstra, Jr. proved it for finite fields over F 2. Lenstra’s method, however, is not applicable to other fields. In [4], we confirmed the conjecture for all finite fields by using a substantially different argument. Together with Lenstra, we proved the conjecture holds even for any finite Galois extension of an arbitrary field and the proof for the general case is again different but simpler. The final result is published in [5]. By our classification in [5], not all finite fields have optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases.</b> For fields without optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases,</b> it is desirable to have a normal basis of low complexity. In [10], we construct several families of such bases, which come from an explicit factorization of cxq+ 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Polynomial <b>bases</b> and <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> {{are both}} used for {{elliptic}} curve cryptosystems, but field arithmetic operations such as multiplication, inversion and doubling for each basis are implemented by different methods. In general, {{it is said}} that <b>normal</b> <b>bases,</b> especially optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> (ONB) which are special cases on <b>normal</b> <b>bases,</b> are efficient for the implementation in hardware in comparison with polynomial bases. However there seems to be more examined by implementing and analyzing these systems under similar condition. In this paper, we designed field arithmetic operators for each basis over GF(2 233), which field has a polynomial basis recommended by SEC 2 and a type-II ONB both, and analyzed these implementation results. And, in addition, we predicted the efficiency of two elliptic curve cryptosystems using these field arithmetic operators...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} fast {{algorithm}} for computing multiplicative inverses in GF(2 m) using <b>normal</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>bases</b> have the following useful property: In {{the case that}} an element x in GF(2 m) is represented by <b>normal</b> <b>bases,</b> 2 k power operation of an element x in GF(2 m) {{can be carried out}} by k times cyclic shift of its vector representation. C. C. Wang et al. proposed an algorithm for computing multiplicative inverses using <b>normal</b> <b>bases,</b> which requires (m − 2) multiplications in GF(2 m) and (m − 1) cyclic shifts. The fast algorithm proposed in this paper also uses <b>normal</b> <b>bases,</b> and computes multiplicative inverses iterating multiplications in GF(2 m). It requires at most 2 [log 2 (m − 1) ] multiplications in GF(2 m) and (m − 1) cyclic shifts, which are much less than those required in the Wang's method. The same idea of the proposed fast algorithm is applicable to the general power operation in GF(2 m) and the computation of multiplicative inverses in GF(qm) (q = 2 n) ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the energy}} demand and {{greenhouse}} gases emission is increasing day by day the popularity of renewable energy systems is also being raised. One {{of the most popular}} renewable energy systems over the past decade has been the wind energy or wind turbines. Wind turbine extracts kinetic energy from the wind. Currently much research has concentrated on improving the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine. Variable speed horizontal axis wind turbines use blade pitch control to meet specified objectives for three regions of operation named low wind, medium wind and high wind conditions.

Step response of this PID controller <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator system will be analyzed.
