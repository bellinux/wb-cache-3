40|$|Chinese input {{presents}} unique {{challenges to}} the field of human computer interaction. This study provides an anatomical analysis of today's standard Chinese input process, which is based on pinyin, a phonetic spelling system in Roman characters. Through a combination of human performance modeling and experimentation, our study decomposed the Chinese input process into sub-tasks and found that choice reaction time and <b>numeric</b> <b>keying,</b> two components resulted from the large number of homophones in Chinese, were the major usability bottlenecks. Choice reaction alone took 36 % of the total input time in our experiment. <b>Numeric</b> <b>keying</b> for multiple candidates selection tends to take the user's attention away from the computer visual screen. We designed and implemented the EASE (Eye Assisted Selection and Entry) system to help maintaining complete touch-typing experience without diverting visual attention to the <b>numeric</b> <b>keys.</b> The EASE approach used a common selection key (spacebar) and implicit eye-tracking to replace the numeric keystrokes. Our experiment showed that such a system could indeed work, even with today's imperfect eyetracking technology...|$|R

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the systematic way of hashing string values using NFO and NOF collision resolution strategies. NFO and NOF are techniques used for hashing <b>numeric</b> <b>keys.</b> The same principles and techniques for hashing <b>numeric</b> <b>keys</b> are deployed in the hashing of string values but with slight modifications in the hashing process and implementations. These variants followed the standard ways of evaluating and implementing algorithms to resolve collisions in hash tables. They are very effective in resolving the problem of collisions of string keys or values in the same slot of a hash table...|$|R

This paper presents a study of four candidate display styles, three commonly used in commercial products (“vertical,” “horizontal, ” and “compact-horizontal”) and one novel (“matrix”), together with various manual selection methods (mouse, <b>numeric</b> <b>key,</b> spacebar, cursor <b>key,</b> <b>numeric</b> keypad and unrestricted input method). The results show that (1) when typing a single kanji character, about 70 % of total operation time is spent on choice selection; and (2) the “compact-horizontal ” and “matrix ” display styles are superior to the other display styles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — To improve {{security}} of the various devices, the graphical password is memorable authentication method for authorization. But when a Personal Identification Number (PIN) entered as a numeric password in mobile or stationary systems, the Shoulder Surfing Attack (SSA) becomes great concern. To prevent SSA and to establish a secure transaction, The Multi color Technique and The Session key mechanism is proposed. In Multi color method, every <b>numeric</b> <b>key</b> is visually split into two halves and each half filled with two distinct colors simultaneously; So there exist four color groups on the numeric keypad and two colors for every <b>numeric</b> <b>key.</b> Session key mechanism constructed based on the basic layout of vertical array of digits from 0 to 9 with another array of ten familiar Symbols. This method make harder for a criminal to obtain PINs even if the iteration are fully observes the entire input of a PIN entry procedure. For Secure transaction, A One Way Hash is generated to Validated PIN and is sent to Server in public channel so that an active attacker cannot extract the PIN by monitoring the channel. Once Server Authenticated the PIN, Quick Response for the Mobile App will be redirect the user to the Services...|$|R
