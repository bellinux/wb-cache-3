5000|$|Atrocities perpetrated {{throughout}} {{the town and}} the surrounding area, including massacres such as the described by the President of the ICTY as horrific events ranking high [...] "in the all too long, sad and wretched history of man’s inhumanity to man", without any sign that the civilian authorities made any sustained attempt to limit or condemn the violent lawlessness of groups such as <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukic's.</b> The ICTY Trial Chamber in the Lukić case found that <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukić</b> was an opportunist who took advantage of an environment in which he could commit crimes against Muslims with impunity.|$|R

50|$|JNA {{officers}} {{planned the}} ethnic cleansing of the town's Muslim population; {{the threat of}} being killed by marauding units like <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukić's</b> White Eagles was used to concentrate refugees in one area of the town, outside which they were afforded no protection.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, former Hipnotisano Pile vocalist Bojan Banović {{together}} with a former Električni Orgazam guitarist Goran Sinadinović founded the band called Petar i Zli Vuci.

5000|$|Ratko Mladić, Defense Minister of the Republika Srpska, {{was also}} present. He {{said that he}} knew nothing about the abduction, had come {{to see what was going}} on and say that the Army of Republika Srpska had nothing to do with it and would do {{everything}} in his power to help locate the abductees. Locals were subjected to further intimidation by <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukić.</b> Serbian President Slobodan Milošević refused to receive the missing persons' relatives while a special government committee set up by Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić came up with no further results. The remaining Bosniak inhabitants of Sjeverin fled to Priboj. Four days after the abduction, when Serbian police stopped <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukić</b> driving through Sjeverin, Lukić produced a forged ID and driver's licence, issued by the Višegrad police.|$|R
50|$|Momir Savić was {{the close}} {{associate}} of <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukić,</b> notoriously {{responsible for the}} campaign of terror directed against Bosniak civilians in the strategically located town of Višegrad and the surrounding municipality {{in the spring and}} summer of 1992, as part of the ethnic cleansing of the Bosniak population from the Podrinja area of Eastern Bosnia.|$|R

These convictions were the first following {{the appointment of a}} special war crimes prosecutor by the Serbian parliament.|$|R
50|$|It {{continues}} to be questioned whether Lukić's unit were acting as paramilitaries or were in fact part of the Republika Srpska Army's Višegrad Brigade. Oliver Krsmanović, one of <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukić's</b> accomplices found guilty by the Belgrade District Court livede as a fugitive from justice for years until his arrest was reported in May 2011.

50|$|On 11 October 2011, the Valjevo Municipal Assembly {{denied the}} Serbian Radical Party's request {{to use the}} great hall of the local {{parliament}} building as a space to promote Lukić's book {{on the grounds that}} it was revealed that the book's author was in fact Rajko Đurđević and not <b>Milan</b> <b>Lukić.</b> After the failed request the Serbian Radical Party promoted the book at Valjevo's city square.|$|R
50|$|At {{the trial}} of Nebojša Ranisavljević, the only suspect convicted for the crime, Luka Dragicević, Commander of the Višegrad brigade of the Republika Srpska Army (RSA), {{admitted}} the “Avengers” unit were part of these armed forces.
