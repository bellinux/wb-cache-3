5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{technique for}} buddy breathing {{is for the}} divers to alternately breathe from the demand valve, usually each taking two breaths before exchanging the DV, but {{it is common for}} the receiver to be out of breath {{at the start of the}} procedure, and they may <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more breaths to stabilize. Once a rhythm has been established, it is usual to terminate the dive and start the ascent, so buddy breathing training will usually include assisted ascents. Assisted ascents using a secondary demand valve are simpler than buddy breathing ascents, and this skill is quicker to learn.|$|E

Both forwards will have to go unclaimed on waivers for twenty four hours before they are officially assigned the Crunch. The Lightning also provided an update on injured backup goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. Today Vasilevskiy did an on ice work out goalie coach Frantz Jean, facing shots from close range. He is still on blood thinners, which is restricting him from facing shots in the left shoulder area. He has an appointment on October 21, which will hopefully clear him for a return to full practice. Vasilevskiy stated that he thinks he will <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> games in Syracuse on a conditioning assignment before he is ready to return to the lineup.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} to become one marked by controversy in another way. Critical Eye – Great Britain United, a Channel 4 documentary of 12 September featured interviews {{with a number of}} club personnel. [...] Amongst them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented [...] "when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hard white men to carry the artistic black players through". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programmes makers, and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for £2.5 million. Palace finished tenth in the First Division, losing rising England star John Salako to a cruciate ligament injury. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new FA Premier League for the 1992–93 season. However, they would be without the services of another key player – Mark Bright – who was sold to Sheffield Wednesday and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were demoted on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4–3 victory over Southampton. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. Palace's drop prompted the resignation of manager Steve Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant Alan Smith.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the years}} EastEnders has {{typically}} featured {{a number of}} elderly residents, {{who are used to}} show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. Over the years they have been joined by the likes of Mo Butcher, Jules Tavernier, Marge Green, Nellie Ellis, Jim Branning, Charlie Slater, Mo Harris, Patrick Trueman, Cora Cross, Les Coker, Rose Cotton, Pam Coker, Stan Carter, Babe Smith, Claudette Hubbard, Sylvie Carter, Ted Murray and Joyce Murray. Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale in the show. She commented, [...] "I don't want to be disloyal, but I think you <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced.

Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is one of}} the academies {{that was}} instituted during the 2011-2012 school year. The FOCUS academy {{attempted}} to focus in on the 13% of students in the entire high school. [...] Speaking earlier about the plans, district superintendent Dr. Richard N. Johns said there are four types of students that would be targeted for the FOCUS academy — students who are at risk of dropping out, not graduating on time, not graduating and receiving a General Education Diploma, and students who are graduating with a 75 percent average or below. This program will be flexible with time and will allow students to come for their core classes and graduation requirements and leave {{for the remainder of the}} day, should they have to work or other extenuating circumstances. This academy was scheduled to be the first one implemented and was set to be used in the 2011–2012 school year. This academy was housed in the Wetzel Road Elementary building, which was closed last spring because of declining enrollment and an $11 million budget shortfall. It will first <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> renovations including new gang bathrooms and science laboratories. The FOCUS academy was ultimately shut down after in session for one year as it was deemed a major waste as a part of the school budget without any significant improvements by students.|$|E
2500|$|After Goschen {{left the}} meeting, Bethmann Hollweg {{received}} {{a message from}} Prince Lichnowsky saying that Grey was most anxious for a four power conference, but that if Germany attacked France, then Britain would have no other choice but {{to intervene in the}} war. In response to the British warning, Bethmann Hollweg suddenly changed course. As he wrote to Prince Tschirschky: [...] "If therefore, Austria should reject all mediation, we are faced with a conflagration in which Britain would be against us, Italy and Romania in all probability not with us. We should be two Powers against Four. With Britain an enemy, the weight of the operations would fall on Germany... Under these circumstances we must urgently and emphatically suggest to the Vienna Cabinet acceptance of mediation under the present honourable conditions. The responsibility falling on us and Austria for the consequences which would ensure in case of refusal would be uncommonly heavy." [...] Five minutes later, Bethmann Hollweg asked Vienna in a second message to stop [...] "refusing any exchange of views with Russia", and warned that they [...] "must refuse to allow Vienna to draw us into a world conflagration frivolously and without regard to our advice." [...] In another message, Bethmann Hollweg wrote [...] "To avert a general catastrophe or in any case to put Russia in the wrong, we must urgently wish Vienna to begin and continue conversations with Russia." [...] As the historian Fritz Fischer noted, only when Bethmann Hollweg received a clear warning that Britain would intervene in a war did he begin to apply pressure on Austria for peace. Bethmann Hollweg's advice was rejected by Austria as being too late. Count Berchtold told the German Ambassador that he would <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days to think about the German offer, and until then, events would proceed.|$|E
