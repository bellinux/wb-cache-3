The influence of various reaction parameters like, concentration of Fe 3 + ions, concentration of the dye, concentration of ammonium persulfate, pH of the solution {{and the presence of}} hydroxyl radical scavenger are studied and optimal conditions are reported. The degradation rate decreased at higher dye concentration and at higher pH. The rate constant (k), catalytic efficiency (kc) and process efficiency (Φ) are evaluated for different concentration of Fe 3 + ions.

40|$|Intracellular protein {{degradation}} {{is required}} for maintaining the cellular proteome and regulating cellular processes. This pathway involves proximal ATP-dependent proteases that unfold and translocate proteins targeted for degradation into catalytic chambers. The large peptides produced are further cleaved by ATP independent endopeptidases, aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases to release free amino acids. Lon and Clp are the key ATP-dependent proteases in prokaryotes and 26 S proteasomes in eukayotes. In general, enzymes involved in the distal processing of peptides are ATP-independent, display greater redundancy and their orthologs are present in most organisms. The aim {{of the present study}} was to generate biochemical and functional insights on the ATP-independent enzyme, Peptidase N (PepN), which belongs to the M 1 family. Previous studies in our laboratory identified Escherichia Coli PepN, to harbor both amino and endopeptidase activitities. In addition, it is responsible for the cleavage of majority of aminopeptidase substrates in E. Coli and is known to be involved in Sodium salicylate(NaSal) -induced stress. The present study consists of four parts. First, intracellular proteolysis plays an important role for virulence in pathogens. Therefore, it becomes important to study the biochemical properties and roles of enzymes involved in protein degradation. In this direction, a study was initiated to characterize the biochemical properties of Peptidase N from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium(S. typhimurium). To study the contribution of PepN to the overall cystosolic protein degradation in S. typhimurium, a targeted deletion in pepN was generated. Cystosolic lysates of S. typhimurium wild type(WT) and ΔpepN strains were examined for their ability to cleave a panel of aminopeptidase and endopeptidase substrates. The ΔpepN strain displayed greatly reduced cleavage of nine out of a total of thirteen exopeptidase substrates, demonstrating a significant contribution of PepN to cytosolic aminopeptidase activity. S. typhimurium PepN also cleaved the endopeptidase substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC, similar to E. Coli PepN. To understand the physiological role of PepN, WT and ΔpepN were subjected to different stress conditions. During nutritional downshift in combination with high temperature stress, the growth of ΔpepN was significantly reduced compared to WT. Importantly, the PepN overexpressing strains grew better than WT, demonstrating an enhanced ability to overcome this stress combination. The above study clearly underscores the importance of PepN, to play distinct roles during stress. The significance of this study lies in understanding the biochemical and functional properties of a M 1 family member from a pathogenic organism. Second, peptidases belonging to the M 1 family are widely distributed with orthologs found across different kingdoms. The key amino acids in the catalytic domain are conserved in this family. However, amino acids present in the C-termini are variable and the three available crystal structures of M 1 family members display distint differences in organization of this domain. To investigate the functional role of C-termini, progressive deletions were generated in PepN from E. Coli and Tricorn interacting factor F 2 from Thermoplasma acidophilum(F 2). Catalytic activity was partially reduced inPepN lacking four aa from C-terminus (PepNΔC 4) whereas it is greatly reduced in F 2 lacking ten amino acids from C-terminus(F 2 ΔC 10) or eleven amino acids from PepN (PepNΔC 11). To understand the mechanistic reasons involved, biochemical and biophysical studies were performed on purified WT and C-termini deleted proteins. Increased binding to 8 -amino- 1 - <b>naphthalene</b> <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (ANS) was observed for all C-termini deleted proteins revealing greater numbers of surface exposed hydrophobic amino acids. Further, trypsin sensitivity studies demonstrated that mutant proteins were more sensitive compared to WT. Notably, expression of PepNΔC 4, but not PepNΔC 11, in E ColiΔpepN increased its ability to resist nutritional and high temperature stress, demonstrating a physiological role for the C-terminus. Together, these studies reveal involvement of distal amino acids in the C-termini of two distant M 1 family members in repressing the exposure of apolar residues and enhancing enzyme function. Third, the crystal structure of E. coliPepN displayed the presence of Zn 2 +. To study the role of metal cofactor, apo-PepN was isolated by chelating the holoenzyme with 1, 10 -phenanthroline. Among different metals tested, only Zn 2 + rescued the greatly reduced catalytic activity of the apo-PepN. Further confirmatory studies were performed using pepN mutants in the conserved GXMEN and HEXXH motifs. No major structural differences were observed in purified mutants(E 264 A, H 297 A, and E 298 A) using circular dichroism (CD) and intrinsic fluorescence studies; however, they lacked catalytic activity. These studies clearly demonstrate that Zn 2 + was essential for catalysis but not for the overall structural integrity of PepN. Estimation of the Zn 2 + content by atomic absorption spectrometry demonstrated that the WT contained one molecule of zinc per molecule of enzyme. Similar results were obtained in purified proteins of E 264 A and E 298 A. residues involved in catalysis. However the Zn 2 + amount was greatly reduced in H 297 A, which is involved in Zn 2 + binding. Further, the in vivo role of metal cofactor and catalyis were studied during two established stress conditions. Over expression of the mutants, unlike WT, was unable to rescue the growth of ΔpepN during nutritional down shift and high temperature stress. These results demonstrate that E 264, H 297 and E 298 were required for PepN function during nutritional downshift and high temperature stress. However during NaSal-induced stress condition, overexpression of WT or mutants reduced growth of ΔpepN, demonstrating that PepN function was independent of catalytic activity or metal cofactor. Further studies identified the YL motif, which is conserved in all members of the M 1 family, to play a role during NaSal-induced stress. Over expression of Y 185 F or L 186 Q did not modulate catalytic activity although growth reduction of ΔpepN in the presence of NaSal was compromised. To understand the mechanisms by which the YL motif plays a role during this condition, Y 185 F and L 186 Q mutant proteins were purified. In vitro, both mutant proteins were found to aggregate at a lower temperature and their catalytic activities were more sensitive to temperature, compared to WT. Steady state analysis of WT, Y 185 F and L 186 Q were performed to study the modulation of PepN amount during stress conditions. Steady state amounts of Y 185 F and L 186 Q mutant proteins were greatly decreased compared to WT, during NaSal-induced stress. Most likely, the lowered amounts of Y 185 F and L 186 Q mutant proteins contribute to growth advantage during NaSal-induced stress. Thus, the YL motif in E. Coli PepN reduces protein aggregation and enhances the structural integrity of PepN during selective stress conditions in vivo. In summary, this study clearly identifies metal cofactor and peptidase-dependent and –independent motifs to play distinct functional roles in PepN. Fourth, the crystal structures of known M 1 family members have shown that the catalytic domain and mechanism of action are similar. To identify novel residues that may modulate the catalytic activity of PepN, multiple sequence alignment of important M 1 family members were performed. The alignment identified a subset of M 1 family members, including PepN, containing an aspargine residue which is present two amino acids before glycine in the GAMEN motif. A closer investigation of thecrystal structure of PepN revealed an interaction between N 259 (Catalytic domain) with Q 821 (C-terminal domain). To understand the functional role of this interaction, site-specific mutants were generated: N 259 D, Q 821 E and a double mutant, N 259 D & Q 821 E. Spectroscopic studies did not reveal any significant differences with respect to global structure or protein stability between purified WT and mutant enzymes. Also, binding to substrates by mutant enzymes was not affected as judged by Km values. However, the Kcat of PepN containing N 259 D or Q 821 E was enhanced with respect to both aminopeptidase and endopeptidase substrates. On the other hand, there was significant decrease in the catalytic activity of the double mutant. Modeling studies demonstrate that the N 259 -Q 821 interaction is located in the vicinity of residues important for catalysis in PepN and specific alterations in this interaction may affect the compactness of the catalytic domain. In summary, this study provides a functional role for the N 259 -Q 821 interaction in modulating the catalytic activity of PepN. Mammalian orthologs of M 1 family members play important roles in different physiological processes, e. g. angiogenesis, blood pressure, inflammation, MHC class I antigen presentation etc. PepN is a well characterized M 1 family member of microbial origin. The present study on E. Coli PepN provides new knowledge on the roles of: a) distal C-terminal amino acids in repressing exposed hydrophobic amino acids; b) the conserved YL motif during NaSal-induced stress condition; c) the N 259 and Q 821 interaction in modulating enzymatic activity. The implications of these results on other members of the M 1 family are discussed...|$|E

Previous re-searches, cited in the reference-list, have concerned themselves with the alkali metal soaps of oleic, ricinoleic, linoleic and other fatty acids, which until recently have been the best known of the surface-active materials of known constitution; recently, how-ever, there have been synthesized a number of compounds pos-sessing a high degree of surface activity. Among these are the alkylated <b>naphthalene</b> <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acids.</b> These new surface-active compounds have certain character-istics which are not possessed by the fatty acid soaps. Solutions of the alkylated naphthalene sulfonates are extremely stable, being unaffected by organic acids, mineral acids, and alkalies; unlike the soaps, they retain their activity in the presence of lime and magnesium salts, and in general are more resistant to metal salt formation. These compounds differ from soaps in that they lack detergent properties; they are superior to soaps in their ability to decrease solid-liquid interfacial tension, and as penetrating agents. The alkylated naphthalene sulfonates are surface active compounds which depend on the presence of nega-tively charged colloidal micelles for their surface activity.

METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into two groups and fed nucleic acid free 20 % casein diet (control) or this diet supplemented with 0. 5 % nucleoside-nucleotide mixture for four weeks. On the second week, colonic inflammation was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 0. 25 ml of 50 % ethanol containing 25 mg of trinitrobenzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Additionally, other sets of rats were treated with 0. 25 ml of 50 % ethanol, 25 mg of trinitrobenzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> in 0. 25 ml saline, or 0. 25 ml of 0. 9 % saline. RESULTS: After two weeks, colon weight, macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, were significantly greater (p < 0. 05) in the nucleoside-nucleotide supplemented group compared with the non-supplemented control groups. The same variables seen in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-ethanol group fed nucleoside-nucleotide free diet were greater (p < 0. 05) than {{in the rest of}} the groups fed nucleoside-nucleotide free diet and treated with ethanol, trinitrobenzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> in saline, or saline. Histologically, segmental ulceration and inflammation associated with significantly increased infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts were observed in the supplemented group compared with the controls. In the nucleoside-nucleotide supplemented group the epithelial damage, mucosal erosion, oedema, and coagulative necrosis of the muscularis propria was more extensive in comparison to the non-supplemented control groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that dietary nucleosides and nucleotides may aggravate colonic damage and inflammation in chemically induced experimental colitis in rats; and that nucleoside-nucleotide free diet combined with other pharmacological agents may offer a better response...|$|R
