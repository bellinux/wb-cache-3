50|$|<b>Nonel</b> is a <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> {{detonator}} {{designed to}} initiate explosions, generally {{for the purpose}} of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500 ft/s (2,000 m/s) {{along the length of the}} tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of nonel detonators incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications.|$|R

Over the past years, few researchers have reported the development of various <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> designs consisting of single, double, and triple polymeric layers. Despite the disclosure of the development of different <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> designs, none of the researchers presented experimental data enabling one to predict how shock tubes' properties and performance could be affected by the number of polymeric layers and the nature of polymeric materials present in the <b>shock</b> <b>tube.</b> The aim of this investigation was, therefore, to experimentally determine to which extent changing the number of polymeric layers and the type of polymeric materials could vary the properties and performance of a multi-layered <b>shock</b> <b>tube.</b> The methodology used during the investigation involved the extrusion and testing of a standard three-layered <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> similar to the commercially available high performance <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> and samples of different recipes of two-layered <b>shock</b> <b>tubes.</b> The three-layered <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> was made of high density polyethylene in the outer layer, ethylene based ionomer in the inner layer and ethylene acrylic acid copolymer in the intermediate layer.

40|$|Summary. [...] Interest has {{recently}} been revived in an apparatus which was first developed fifty years ago. This apparatus, which is known today as a <b>shock</b> <b>tube,</b> consists of a simple duct which may be closed or open at one end, and closed at the other end. A diaphragm divides this duct into two compartments which initially contain gases at different pressures. When the diaphragm is ruptured, an unsteady gas motion ensues. A survey of existing <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> theory and experimental results has been conducted; particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the features of actual <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> flow which diverged from ideal non-viscous theory. A basic ideal <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> theory has been formulated in detail; using those parameters which have greatest practical significance, and subsequently, performance charts affording a rapid method for the aerodynamic design of <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> using air as the working fluid have been developed. Experimental results diverge from the simple ideal theory mentioned above, principally because viscous effects are present in actual <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> flow. Careful analysis of available experimental data yielded a series of important parameters which should be incorporated in any modified theory of <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> flow. A new analytical approach {{led to the development of}} a theory of <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> flow which included the effects of boundary layer growth on the walls of the <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> and explained severaI features of the actual flow patterns which are at variance with ideal non-viscous theory.

In {{recent years}} a unique drug {{delivery}} system named as the transdermal {{drug delivery system}} has been developed which can deliver drug particles to the human skin without using any external needle. The solid drug particles are accelerated by means of high speed gas flow through a <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> imparting enough momentum so that particles can penetrate through the outer layer of the skin. Different systems have been tried and tested {{in order to make}} it more convenient for clinical use. One of them is the con-toured <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> system (CST). The contoured <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> consists of a classical <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> connected with a correctly expanded supersonic nozzle.

In 1966, Duff and Blackwell described a type of <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> driven by high explosives. These ranged in diameter from 0.6 to 2 m and in length from 3 m to 15 m.

50|$|Both compression-driven and blast-driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{currently}} used for scientific {{as well as}} military applications. Compressed-gas driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> are more easily obtained and maintained in laboratory conditions; however, {{the shape of the}} pressure wave is different from a blast wave in some important respects and may not be suitable for some applications. Blast-driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> generate pressure waves that are more realistic to free-field blast waves. However, they require facilities and expert personnel for handling high explosives. Also, in addition to the initial pressure wave, a jet effect caused by the expansion of compressed gases (compression-driven) or production of rapidly expanding gases (blast-driven) follows and may transfer momentum to a sample after the blast wave has passed. More recently, laboratory scale <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> driven by fuel-air mixtures have been developed that produce realistic blast waves and can be operated in more ordinary laboratory facilities. Because the molar volume of gas is much less, the jet effect is a fraction of that for compressed-gas driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes.</b> To date, the smaller size and lower peak pressures generated by these <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> make them most useful for preliminary, nondestructive testing of materials, validation of measurement equipment such as high speed pressure transducers, and for biomedical research as well as military applications.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} characterization of modular, oxy-acetylene driven laboratory scale <b>shock</b> <b>tubes.</b> Such tools are needed to produce realistic blast waves in a laboratory setting. The pressure-time profiles measured at 1 MHz using high speed piezoelectric pressure sensors have relevant durations and show a true shock front and exponential decay characteristic of free-field blast waves. Descriptions are included for <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> diameters of 27 - 79 mm. A range of peak pressures from 204 kPa to 1187 kPa (with 0. 5 - 5. 6 % standard error of the mean) were produced by selection of the driver section diameter and distance from the <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> opening. The peak pressures varied predictably with distance from the <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> opening while maintaining both a true blast wave profile and relevant pulse duration for distances up to about one diameter from the <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> opening. This <b>shock</b> <b>tube</b> design provides a more realistic blast profile than current compression-driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{and it does not}} have a large jet effect. In addition, operation does not require specialized personnel or facilities like most blast-driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes,</b> which reduces operating costs and effort and permits greater throughput and accessibility. It is expected to be useful in assessing the response of various sensors to shock wave loading; assessing the reflection, transmission, and absorption properties of candidate armor materials; assessing material properties at high rates of loading; assessing the response of biological materials to shock wave exposure; and providing a means to validate numerical models of the interaction of shock waves with structures.
