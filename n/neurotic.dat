The Marital Communication Inventory and the Personal Report of Spouse Communication Apprehension are used. The results show that the marriages of <b>neurotics</b> are characterised by poor communication and marital disharmony when compared with the normal marriages. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of research dealing with marital disharmony in terms of disturbed communication between spouses.

Later, Effy's father, Jim (Harry Enfield), discovers his wife's infidelity when his boss, Steve (David Baddiel), arrives at the house, declaring his love for Anthea. Effy grows miserable after Jim leaves the family, and Pandora, desperate for some fun, throws a pyjama party. Effy and Katie Fitch (Megan Prescott) arrive with Pandora at her house for the party and meet her <b>neurotic</b> mother, Angela (Sally Phillips). Disappointed {{by the lack of}} boys, drugs and alcohol because of Angela's strict supervision, Katie spikes the brownies that they make with MDMA. As Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) and Katie's twin sister, Emily (Kathryn Prescott), arrive together, Naomi urges Emily to admit that she is gay, but Emily denies it. All of the girls indulge in the brownies and Pandora is unhappy to see her mother's behaviour grow increasingly erratic. After Angela is carried into a bedroom to sleep, Pandora locks herself in the bathroom, upset about Thomas's departure and angry with Effy, who she believes spiked the brownies.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that {{neuroticism}} impairs cognitive performance mostly in difficult tasks, {{but not so much}} in easier tasks. One pervasive situation of this type is multitasking, in which the combination of two simple tasks creates a highly demanding dual-task, and consequently high <b>neurotics</b> show higher dual-task costs than low <b>neurotics.</b> However, the functional neuroanatomical correlates of these additional performance impairments in high <b>neurotics</b> are unknown. To test for this, we assessed brain activity by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 17 low and 15 high <b>neurotics</b> while they were performing a demanding dual-task and the less demanding component tasks as single-tasks. Behavioural results showed that performance (response times and error rates) was lower in the dual-task than in the single-tasks (dual-task costs), and that these dual-task costs were significantly higher in high <b>neurotics.</b> Imaging data showed that high <b>neurotics</b> showed less dual-task specific activation in lateral (mainly middle frontal gyrus) and medial prefrontal cortices. We conclude that high levels of neuroticism impair behavioural performance in demanding tasks, and that this impairment is accompanied by reduced activation of the task-associated brain areas...|$|R
40|$|A psychoticism {{questionnaire}} was designed constituting 110 questions framed {{on the basis}} of the following constructs: desocialization, paranoia, thought disorder, depression, perceptual disturbance, superstitions and mania. In the initial tryout, it was administered to 40 psychotics, 40 <b>neurotics</b> and 40 normals and 40 items inadequately discriminating between psychotics and normals/neurotics were deleted. The revised {{questionnaire was}} administered, in second tryout, to 50 psychotics, 50 <b>neurotics</b> and 50 normals. The results were again subjected to item analysis and 10 more items were deleted as they could not discriminate significantly between <b>neurotics</b> and psychotics or where they discriminated between normals and <b>neurotics.</b> Kuder-Richardson formula 20 was used for reliability and criterion validity was assessed by comparing the three diagnositic groups with one another. Both these were satisfactory. Thus a psychoticism questionnaire of 60 items was constructed...|$|R

Janov contends that the <b>neurotic</b> can thereby re-experience their feelings in response to the original traumatic incidents but can now express the emotions that at that time were repressed, thereby resolving the trauma.|$|E
