5|$|Development of Wild Guns {{began when}} a small team of Natsume staff was asked to create a game quickly and cheaply while waiting for their <b>next</b> <b>major</b> assignment. The team {{consisted}} of three core members: Shunichi Taniguchi for game design and graphics, Toshiyasu Miyabe for programming, and Hiroyuki Iwatsuki for sound. Two other people helped as support staff. The team chose to develop for the Super NES because the three had worked together previously on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for that system. Development of Wild Guns lasted approximately five months and was led by Taniguchi.|$|E

5|$|During Leisler's Rebellion Jacob Leisler {{demanded the}} {{charters}} of Albany {{and the city}} of New York be forfeited, and New York yielded but Albany's mayor, Pieter Schuyler, refused. Schuyler went on {{to become one of the}} major leaders in suppressing the rebellion. The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> threat to the charter government came during the American Revolution when the Common Council stopped meeting in 1775. The local Committee of Safety took over daily functions until 1778 when the Common Council began meeting again.|$|E
5|$|For his <b>next</b> <b>major</b> action, Gandhi {{decided on}} a raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans.

He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium, {{once one}} of the best stadiums in Triple-A baseball, began to be out shined by newer {{state-of-the-art}} ballparks being built in the late 1980s. The Reds let their player development contract (PDC) with the Sounds expire so they could place their Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis, which was closer to Cincinnati and was planning to build a new stadium. Nashville entered the offseason unsure of their <b>next</b> <b>major</b> league affiliate.|$|E

5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her <b>next</b> <b>major</b> novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, {{but only one}} survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E

This work is an {{anthology}} of very short works (on average 50–60 seconds) contributed by international film directors in which each used the original Auguste and Louis Lumière's motion picture camera to make his film. The Kiss is the 52-second film made by director Jaco Van Dormael featuring actor Pascal Duquenne. At the same time, Van Dormael was at work writing his <b>next</b> <b>major</b> work.|$|E

5|$|Planning for {{the route}} {{began in the}} 1950s, but the first segment between Wattle Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980. Over the next five years, the highway was {{extended}} north to Great Eastern Highway and south to Albany Highway, and a discontinuous section was constructed north of the Swan River. In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections, and three years later, Reid Highway became the northern terminus. The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> works on the highway, between 2003 and 2005, extended the highway south to Thomas Road.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E

Potter based his work on interviews {{with many of the}} Mexican survivors of the battle. The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers' The Alamo, was published in 1948. In the decades since, the battle has featured prominently in many non-fiction works.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, {{due to the lack}} of new {{gameplay}} features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band. The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> installment of the series, , was developed by Activision's Neversoft division.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> Japanese {{reinforcement}} effort failed {{during the}} Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau. Although most of Shōji's troops had escaped from Koli Point, {{the inability of}} the Japanese to keep their forces on Guadalcanal adequately supplied or reinforced prevented them from contributing effectively to {{what turned out to be}} Japan's ultimately unsuccessful effort to hold the island or retake Henderson Field from Allied forces.|$|E
25|$|West Germany {{failed to}} defend their titles in the <b>next</b> two <b>major</b> {{international}} tournaments. They lost to Czechoslovakia in the final of Euro 1976 in a penalty shootout 5–3. Since that loss, Germany has not lost a penalty shootout in major international tournaments.|$|R

5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> {{change to}} SH-34 {{occurred}} in 1954. On November 1 of that year, the highway was realigned {{to follow a}} new road extending north of Woodward, intersecting US-64 east of Buffalo, and following existing highways north to the state line. This would put SH-34 on its present-day route north of Woodward. SH-50 would remain concurrent with SH-34 north of US-64 until November 9, 1964.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> {{change to}} SH-34 {{would be brought}} about by the {{establishment}} of the southern part of State Highway 6. The new highway was introduced on July 7, 1975.

On January 5, 1987, the redundant section of SH-34 was removed, truncating it to its current southern terminus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>major</b> {{incident}} was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters {{located in the}} King David Hotel were bombed.

Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety-one victims. To assist in the search for those responsible, the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23July.|$|E
