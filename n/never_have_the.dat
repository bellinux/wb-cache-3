5|$|As the new line-up (with Wright) toured {{throughout}} North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was, on occasion, close by. The bassist had forbidden any {{members of}} Pink Floyd from attending his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances. Waters also issued a writ for copyright {{fees for the}} band's use of the flying pig, and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters gave up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on Astoria. Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, among other things, rights to The Wall. However, Waters claimed that they would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> level of success that they had during his tenure again.|$|E
500|$|In June 1980, Tyndall {{founded the}} New National Front (NNF). The NNF claimed {{that a third}} of the NF's {{membership}} defected to join them. Tyndall stated that [...] "I have one wish in this operation and one wish alone, to cleanse the National Front of the foul stench of perversion which has politically crippled it". As his choice of party name suggested, he remained hopeful that his breakaway group could eventually be re-merged back into the NF. There developed a great rivalry between the two groups, and as the NF's new leadership moved it away from the Tyndallite approach, Tyndall realised that he may <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to regain his position within it.|$|E
500|$|A {{substantial}} part of the text consists of recipes. In the Meat chapter, these begin with recipes for beef, including [...] "Baron of Beef", [...] "Sirloin (Norman-French, sur loin)", [...] "Rib of Beef", [...] "Boiled Beef with Carrots", and [...] "Oat Pudding, for Boiled Beef". Each recipe has a heading in italics; some have an illustration, drawn by Hartley, or else a quotation or proverb. There is no list of ingredients. The first paragraph often describes the dish or its ingredients. Thus for sirloin, she advises [...] "This is the best beef joint and should be roasted. <b>Never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> undercut taken out...". The instructions are given in a few paragraphs: [...] "Let the sirloin be well hung; dust it lightly with dry mustard, pepper and brown flour to give a crisp crust; bed the fat end well under the lean undercut, and secure in place with string or carefully placed skewer. Roast carefully, basting frequently." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna's vocal range spans {{almost one}} octave from F3 to D4. As {{she begins to}} sing the first verse, the bass pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus, and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This process is {{repeated}} during the second verse and chorus, which abruptly ends in a silence, with only the low and lifeless sound of the synthesizer, set in D minor. Madonna then starts to sing the bridge (or middle part)— [...] "If I ran away, I'd <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> strength"— between the tonal keys of D and F, closing with the repetition of the chorus until the song gradually fades out. The original composition of the song {{did not have the}} background synths, instead Leonard created a basic structure on piano, and Madonna added the words on top of it. According to Leonard, Madonna came up with the bridge by herself, extending it from the music that he was playing.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the women}} of 'The Inside' could <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same level of freedom to those on the outside, life inside the Inner Court was not disagreeable, as life was easier than the outside and most necessities were {{provided}} for. The women usually entered the palace as girls and remained inside {{for the rest of}} their lives. As girls they would be assigned certain duties as pages; as they grew older and became wives and mothers they would have a household to look after. During the reign of King Rama IV, {{the women of}} the palace were for the first time allowed to leave; however they were required to obtain permission from the directoress first and were strictly chaperoned. Dr. Malcolm A. Smith, physician to Queen Saovabha Phongsri from 1914 to 1919, [...] wrote that, [...] "there is no evidence to show that they longed for freedom or were unhappy in their surroundings. Even Mrs. Leonowens, fanatical opponent of polygamy that she was, does not tell us that". Indeed, Anna Leonowens' book The English Governess at the Siamese Court, published in 1873, was set inside the Inner Court.|$|E
500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone for granted, and that if you love them, you should tell them, because you might <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> chance to tell them how you really feel. She then starts to sing [...] "Never Too Far".|$|E

500|$|Critics panned The Wiz {{upon its}} October 1978 release. Many reviewers {{directed}} their criticism at Diana Ross, who they believed {{was too old}} to play Dorothy. Most agreed that what had worked so successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen. Hischak's Through the Screen Door: What Happened to the Broadway Musical When It Went to Hollywood criticized [...] "Joel Schumacher's cockamamy screenplay", and called [...] "Believe in Yourself" [...] the score's weakest song. He described Diana Ross's portrayal of Dorothy as: [...] "cold, neurotic and oddly unattractive"; and noted that the film was [...] "a critical and box office bust". In his work History of the American Cinema, Harpole characterized the film as [...] "one of the decade's biggest failures", and, [...] "the year's biggest musical flop". The Grove Book of Hollywood noted that [...] "the picture finished off Diana Ross's screen career", as the film was Ross's final theatrical feature. In his book Blockbuster, Tom Shone referred to The Wiz as [...] "expensive crud". In the book Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, the author criticized the script, noting, [...] "The Wiz was too scary for children, and too silly for adults." [...] Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film, did not think highly of The Wiz, stating [...] "The Wiz is overblown and will <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> universal appeal that the classic MGM musical has obtained." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Jinnah, India {{acquired}} the accession through [...] "fraud and violence."

For a plebiscite, Jinnah demanded simultaneous troop withdrawal for he felt that 'the average Muslim would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> courage to vote for Pakistan' {{in the presence of}} Indian troops and with Sheikh Abdullah in power. When Mountbatten countered that the plebiscite could be conducted by the United Nations, Jinnah, hoping that the invasion would succeed and Pakistan might lose a plebiscite, again rejected the proposal, stating that the Governors Generals should conduct it instead. [...] Mountbatten noted that it was untenable given his constitutional position and India did not accept Jinnah's demand of removing Sheikh Abdullah.|$|E

2500|$|By the 19th century, it was {{estimated}} that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%. Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to marry into money in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the [...] "Golden Lotus", being about three Chinese inches long (around [...] in Western measurement). This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.|$|E

He then shows the viewers a weekly programming schedule consisting of only The Simpsons, The X-files, and Melrose Place surrounded by question marks. Matt Groening notes in an interview that The Simpsons is in a unique place, and when former producers/writers move to different networks, they are told that [...] "We would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons on our network".

2500|$|In {{the months}} that followed, Thiers criticized the Emperor's costly and doomed {{expedition}} to conquer Mexico. He also condemned the Emperor's principle of nationalities, as applied in Italy, of supporting the unification into one country of small states whose populations spoke a common language. [...] "This principle will lead," [...] Thiers said, [...] "one day or the other, to a policy of race which will generate future wars." [...] On 3 May 1866, when war [...] seemed likely between Prussia and Austria over the Prussian annexation of Holstein, Thiers told the assembly: [...] "If Prussia is successful, we will see {{the creation of a}} new German Empire; [...] the Empire of Charles V which once resided in Vienna, will now reside in Berlin; [...] an Empire which will press against our borders..." [...] After the crushing defeat of Austria by Prussia at the Battle of Sadowa, Thiers declared, [...] "It was France which was defeated at Sadowa." [...] On 14 March 1867, he told the Assembly: [...] "France has no more allies in Europe. Austria is defeated, Italy is looking for adventure, England wants to avoid the Continent, Russia is occupied with its own interests, and as far as Spain is concerned, <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Pyrenees been so high.
