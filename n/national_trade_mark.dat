40|$|The Community Trade Mark in Comparison {{with the}} <b>National</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> - Focused on the Unitary Character of the Community Trade Mark and the Absolute Grounds of Refusal Abstract The Community Trade Mark system has existed since 1994 when the Community Trade Mark Regulation No. 40 / 94 /EC was adopted. Even though the European system is {{younger than the}} <b>national</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> systems, one cannot {{say that it is}} a less {{successful}} system - particularly according to the number of registered Community Trademarks. The regulation of trademarks is very complex and for this reason I have decided to focus only on one part of the regulation, namely the unitary character, which represents a special characteristic of a Community Trade Mark - and further on the absolute grounds of refusal and their comparison in European and Czech trade mark law. The two systems for the registration of trademarks show considerable resemblance; however, one shall find differences, e. g. an integration of bad faith as one of the absolute grounds of refusal appearing only in the national system. The purpose of my thesis is to compare the two systems of trademarks - the Community level and the National level, and to provide readers with clear guidance regarding the general rules applicable within the registration. I will do this through an analysis [...] ...|$|E

If properly protected, <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> can last forever; and can provide the business with a unique and immediately visible identification to its customers and the world beyond. A <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be protected by the law unless it is registered, since registration is considered as a basis of the legal protection. The <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 together with its Rules organize all matters concerning registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> and provide the procedure to be followed in obtaining such registration. This thesis examines the registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in Sudan under the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969. Chapter One highlights {{the historical development of}} the <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> laws in the Sudan and discusses the definition of the <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> under both the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Ordinance 1931 and the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 and the various functions of the <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> The discussion in Chapter Two is mainly about the registrability of <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Chapter Three concentrates on the procedure of registration.

40|$|Trade mark is a {{key element}} of company {{strategy}} and enhancing its value the enterprise can keep or acquiring market shares. The trade mark is an indispensable instrument for communicating with the public; it is a sign of quality and it establishes a relationship with the consumer based on trust by staking the company’s reputation and offering a guarantee of consistent quality; the trade mark is an important capital good of a company, that can be commercially exploited by licensing, franchising, merchandising and sponsorship. As a marketing tool it may even constitute the company’s main asset. Prior to the introduction of the Community trade mark, companies could protect their trade marks throughout the European Union in two different ways: nationally and internationally. Since the 1 st of January 1993, the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital within the Community has given an European dimension to the trade mark strategies of an increasing number of companies. It is also the case of the Romanian companies which must take into account the impact of the integration in the Single Market since Romania has been a Member State of the European Union. Therefore, the companies which still base this strategy on their national market as their main market will become aware of the requirements of the European Market. On 1 st January 2007 Romania has become a Member State of the European Union. The analysis presented in this paper focuses on the challenges of this aspect for the trade mark strategies of the Romanian companies; starting from the essential functions of a trade mark and going by the advantages of the Community trade mark, the paper focuses on the legal implications of enlargement for the national and Community trade mark systems (because it is possible to have a conflict situation between the <b>national</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and the Community trade mark), on the importance and the strengths which can afford the protection by the Community trade mark for the Romanian companies, confronted to a highest competition on an extended European Market. trade mark; Community trade mark; legal implications of enlargement for the national and Community trade mark. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} for the first time, a history of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia. Its {{focus is on the}} latter to middle part of the 19 th century and early into the 20 th century, predating the Commonwealth <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act. This is because it was during this period when the legislative framework for <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> protection was first established under the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime and the most important, characteristic features of modern <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law developed. With a specific focus on this critical period, the legal narrative and this thesis considers the inception of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime, contextualising its genesis. It also examines the architecture of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The final part of the narrative focuses on the operation of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The key reason for this particular doctrinal focus is twofold. The primary reason relates to the lack of consideration given to the historical development of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia to date, and in particular, the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The second ancillary reason relates to the potential importance of this thesis to modern debates about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, which often refer back to and rely upon the assumed traditional principles of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, without any inquiry or deep understanding as to what those traditional foundations actually are, at least from an Australian perspective. In taking a doctrinal and empirical approach, this thesis draws on the relevant legal archive, containing the limited primary and secondary sources available relating to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. Here, particular attention is paid to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registers, which have been examined in detail. However, the relevant legal archive also includes the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> statutes, the related Hansard reports, colonial newspapers and the case law reported as arising out of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. This thesis further draws on the body of 19 th century British (and to a lesser extent American) <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and other treatises as the authoritative legal texts of the time, as well as the statutory protection afforded to <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the United Kingdom and the extrinsic material concerning early British <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, so far {{as it relates to the}} colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} {{functional}} development of trade mark use from a legal and economic perspective, in order to assess the potential impact of the Trade Marks Act 1994 on the protection of registered rights in the United Kingdom. Trade marks {{play a vital role in}} the marketing and retail of goods in the 1990 's. They are a helpful aid to the bewildered consumer and a valuable asset to businesses of all sizes. An examination of these economic roles alongside existing legal theory suggests, however, that it is questionable whether the system of protection which has evolved under British law can adequately protect the potential of these commercial symbols. The concept of trade mark function is central to the nature and scope of registered rights. Both statute and case law show that traditional legal theories have been manipulated rather than altered to facilitate changes in commercial practice. Despite the flexibility of these theories, the creation of the European Economic Community led to an extensive reassessment of trade mark registration at both a national and European level. The new United Kingdom Trade Marks Act, which came in force on October 31 st 1994, is part of a programme of reform taking place on a European-wide scale which is intended to harmonise the <b>national</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law of Member States, to enable the creation of a Community Trade Mark. The Act intends to overhaul our system of national rights bringing them in line with other Member States. As part of this thesis, consideration will be given to whether the reworking of key legislative concepts to create a system of protection reflective of the economic realities of trade mark use across the Community is more adept at serving the needs of the modern market place. The aims of the thesis have been achieved by an assessment of the evolution of the United Kingdom's system of trade mark registration, which relies on an extensively researched bibliography. A questionnaire was sent out to one hundred and fifty firms which exported goods to Western Europe in order to discover how firms used and protected their marks, but this only provided information which was anecdotal in nature. From the questionnaire replies, it was clear that small to medium firms were not aware how to protect their marks either on a national or a European level, and in some cases they were even confused over what a "trade mark" comprised. These disappointing results led to reliance on academic writing and case law in the research and writing of thesis...|$|E
40|$|Modern <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> perform {{multiple}} functions {{taken up}} in a functional matrix. Amongst them the distinguishing function is invariable whilst the other functions are variable. A legal-historical and comparative investigation {{of the law of}} <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U. S. A. and South Africa reveals that only certain <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> functions have traditionally been afforded protection under law. This is mainly because of a historical resistance to accepting <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> as property in the Anglo and American <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> systems and the primacy of origin theory in the European Community <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> system. The bedrock of South African <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law has been the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law of the United Kingdom. The restrictions brought about by common law property theory have been carried over into the South African law of <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> The South African law of property is however derived from the civil law and not the common law. The historical break in continuity of the common law <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> tradition {{as a consequence of the}} interposition of the European Union and the reception of EC <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in the United Kingdom affords the opportunity for a theory of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> rights to be established in South Africa which is derived from concepts already present in South African law. The thesis proposes that the legal right to the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> in South African law is an independent subjective right of the kind proposed by Joubert. The legal object of this right is the <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> The entitlements of use of the holder of the right are the functions which the holder is entitled to have the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> perform. A range of values in which the property in a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> is to be found are associated with the functions.

The first problem is about law protection for the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right holder in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law, {{the second is the}} role of government and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, and the third is about consumer's law culture in relation with consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> The law protection for owner or right holder of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> has been regulated comprehensively covering administrative, civil and crime sides in a juridical way which is stated in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law.. From administrative side by implementing constitutive system, the owner of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> is acknowledged and given exclusive right, that is being protected as the one and only person who has the right of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> In case of law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner can do legal remedy through administrative action, sue a person for civil liability as well as crime liability. Based on its authority, the government plays important role in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation. As the authority holder, the government has the rights to make rule and policy on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office the government has a role as <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> administrator, consultant and controller on the use of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> in the community, as well as a law enforcement officer by a way of appointing the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office employee as Civil Investigator. From the analysis of field research result, it is revealed that the cancellation of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> within constitutive system still happens due to weak performance of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> office in examining the substansial requirements during <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registration request. Beside that the absence of implementation guidance of some rules in <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law has influenced law enforcement on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Meanwhile, the lack of knowledge and understanding about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> among law enforcement officer has influenced them in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation. They tend to give minor punishment to those who violate the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law. This condition shows the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection is not effective yet because the role of government through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation, need to be improved. On the other hand, <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation preventing action are also influenced by community's law culture as consumers who consume the goods and the services. The consumer's law culture gives negative response or does not support consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> which happens in the community whose opinion and behaviour do not give symbolical meaning on <b>trade</b> <b>mark,</b> the communal values which consider <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> imitation as something acceptable {{as long as it does}} not harm the consumers, especially their lives, and submissive behaviour to keep peace and harmony in life, and the tendency to avoid conflict in consumer dispute. The community will give positive response or support the consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> if their opinion and behaviour are meaningful on symbolical <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and they realise that <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation considered illegal, since it harms not only the consumers, but also blurs symbolical meaning of a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> since a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> means symbol, prestige, as well as certain lifestyle to the user. ...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} how <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owners actually go about enforcing their <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the civil courts. The few studies which have emerged recently show a high success rate for <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owners. In this study, we created a database of all <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> enforcement decisions of Australian courts for the period 1997 - 2003. Analysing the nature and outcomes of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> litigation, we found a more complex story than previous studies: counterfeit proceedings where the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner always wins and the alleged infringer often fails to show up in court on the one hand; more contentious proceedings on the other where the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner only succeeded around a third of the time. The study raises, although it cannot answer, some interesting questions about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner knowledge and motivations in entering litigation...|$|R
