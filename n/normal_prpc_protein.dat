40|$|Cell-based {{measurement}} of prion infectivity is currently restricted to experimental strains of mouse-adapted scrapie. Having isolated cell cultures with susceptibility to prions from diseased elk, we describe {{a modification of}} the scrapie cell assay allowing evaluation of prions causing chronic wasting disease, a naturally occurring transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. We compare this cervid prion cell assay to bioassays in transgenic mice, the only other existing method for quantification, and show this assay to be a relatively economical and expedient alternative that will likely facilitate studies of this important prion disease. Prions consist largely or entirely of PrPSc, a -sheet-rich conformer of the prion protein (PrP). During disease, PrPSc coerces the <b>normal</b> <b>PrPC</b> <b>protein</b> to adopt the PrPSc confor-mation. While protease-sensitive forms of PrPSc exist (20), PrPSc is usually partially resistant to limited proteinase K (PK) digestion (4). Bioassays in susceptible animals have, until re-cently, been the sole means of assessing prion infectivity. The scrapie cell assay (SCA) (12), which relies on detection of protease resistant PrPSc, while a substantial advance, has bee...|$|E
40|$|In the 'protein only' hypothesis, prion {{diseases}} {{are thought to}} result from the conformational change of a normal isoform of a prion protein (PrPC) to a protease-resistant, pathogenic form called PrPSc. This conversion rests on an autocatalytic process requiring the presence of pre-existing PrPSc. Theoretical kinetic analysis of the dynamic process, including the turnover of the normal prion protein, shows that the system exhibits bistability properties, indicating that the very slow accumulation of the abnormal form of the protein in the brain could in fact be the consequence and {{not the cause of}} the disorders. The cause would be a transition between two alternative steady states of the system. The presence of a small amount of the PrPSc protein in lymphocytes does not necessarily constitute any indication of a non-symptomatic but infectious pathogenic state. Moreover, infectious prion particles should not be seen as necessarily composed of the abnormal isoform of the protein, as usually stated. Particles containing only an excess of the normal form of the protein might also be pathogenic. Compounds that can act on the turnover rate of the <b>normal</b> <b>PrPC</b> <b>protein</b> could be a therapeutic strategy against {{prion diseases}}...|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} isoform of PrP, {{known as}} PrPSc, {{is able to}} convert <b>normal</b> <b>PrPC</b> <b>proteins</b> into the infectious isoform by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes prion disease. Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has {{a higher proportion of}} β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process. The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious PrPSc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.|$|R

40|$|A {{hallmark}} {{feature of}} prions, whether in mammals or yeast and fungi, is exponential growth associated with fission or autocatalysis of protein aggregates. We have employed a rigorous kinetic analysis to recent data from transgenic mice lacking a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor to the <b>normal</b> cellular <b>PrPC</b> <b>protein,</b> which show that toxicity requires the membrane binding. We find {{as well that}} the membrane is necessary for exponential growth of prion aggregates; without it, the kinetics is simply the quadratic-in-time growth characteristic of linear elongation as observed frequently in in vitro amyloid growth experiments with other proteins. This requires both: i), a substantial intercellular concentration of anchorless PrPC, and ii), a concentration of small scrapies seeding aggregates from the inoculum, which remains relatively constant with time and exceeds the concentration of large polymeric aggregates. We also can explain via this analysis why mice heterozygous for the anchor-full/anchor-free <b>PrPC</b> <b>proteins</b> have more rapid incubation than mice heterozygous for anchor-full/null PrPC, and contrast the mammalian membrane associated fission or autocatalysis with the membrane free fission of yeast and fungal prions...|$|R

Our results show that, at detergent conditions in which membrane rafts were intact, neither PrPC and Doppel co-immunoprecipitate with the appropriate antibodies, nor was Doppel retained by a Cu 2 +IMAC resin, as PrPC does.

40|$|The <b>normal</b> <b>PrPC</b> (cellular prion <b>protein)</b> {{contains}} sLeX [sialyl-LeX (Lewis X) ] and LeX. sLeX is a ligand of selectins. To {{examine whether}} PrPC is a ligand of selectins, we generated three human PrPC–Ig fusion proteins: one with LeX, one with sLeX, {{and the other}} with neither LeX nor sLeX. Only LeX-PrPC–Ig binds E-, L- and P-selectins. Binding is Ca 2 +-dependent and occurs with nanomolar affinity. Removal of sialic acid on sLeX-PrPC–Ig enables the fusion protein to bind all selectins. These findings were confirmed with brain-derived PrPC. The selectins precipitated PrPC in human brain in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. Treatment of brain homogenates with neuraminidase increased the amounts of PrPC precipitated. Therefore the presence of sialic acid prevents the binding of PrPC in human brain to selectins. Hence, human brain PrPC interacts with selectins {{in a manner that is}} distinct from interactions in peripheral tissues. Alternations in these interactions may have pathological consequences...|$|R

The differences between PrPC and rPrP appear {{to be due to}} the lack of the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor in the recombinant protein.

To understand how the PrPsc internalization process occurs, it is important to characterize the cell types that express <b>normal</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPc)</b> along the GIT. To do so, we studied the distribution of PrPc in the rat, monkey, and cow GIT. Using Western blot analysis, we found that PrPc is expressed in all digestive regions of the three species. Immunoreactivity for PrPc was found throughout the GIT in epithelial cells sharing the neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype.

40|$|Little {{is known}} {{regarding}} the potential risk posed by aerosolized prions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is transmitted horizontally, almost surely by mucosal exposure, and CWD prions {{are present in}} saliva and urine of infected animals. However, whether CWD may be transmissible by the aerosol or nasal route is not known. To address this question, FVB mice transgenetically expressing the <b>normal</b> cervid <b>PrPC</b> <b>protein</b> [Tg(cerPrP) mice] were exposed to CWD prions by either nose-only aerosol exposure or by drop-wise instillation into the nostrils. Mice were monitored for signs of disease for up to 755  days post-inoculation (p. i.) and by examination of tissues for lesions and PrPCWD after necropsy. In particular, nasal mucosa, vomeronasal organ, lungs, lymphoid tissue and the brain were assessed for PrPCWD by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Six of seven aerosol-exposed Tg(cerPrP) mice developed clinical signs of neurological dysfunction mandating euthanasia between 411 and 749 days p. i. In all these mice, CWD infection was confirmed by detection of spongiform lesions and PrPCWD in the brain. Two of nine intranasally inoculated Tg(cerPrP) mice also developed transmissible spongiform encephalopathy associated with PrPCWD between 417 and 755 days p. i. No evidence of PrPCWD was detected in CWD-inoculated Tg(cerPrP) mice examined at pre-terminal time points. These results demonstrate that CWD can be transmitted by aerosol (as well as nasal) exposure and suggest that exposure via the respiratory system merits consideration for prion disease transmission and biosafety...|$|R

In specific strains of PrP(C) -deficient mouse lines, Dpl is overexpressed and causes a neurological disease. Dpl neurotoxicity is counteracted and prevented by PrP(C), but the mechanism of antagonistic PrP(C) -Dpl interaction remains elusive. In contrast to its homologue PrP(C), initial studies suggest that Dpl is dispensable for prion disease progression and for the generation of PrP(Sc).

Cell surface PrPC constitutively cycles between the plasma membrane and early endosomes via a clathrin-dependent mechanism, a pathway consistent with a suggested role for PrPC in cellular trafficking of copper ions. PrP molecules carrying mutations linked to inherited prion diseases display several abnormalities in their biochemical properties, maturation, and localisation that may explain their patho-genicity.

Dpl deficiency did not interfere with embryonic and postnatal development, but resulted in male sterility. Dpl protein was expressed at late stages of spermiogenesis, and spermatids of Dpl mutants were reduced in numbers, immobile, malformed and unable to fertilize oocytes in vitro.

Here we investigate this question by grafting neural tissue overexpressing PrPC into the brain of PrP-deficient mice which are scrapie-resistant and do not propagate infectivity. After intracerebral inoculation with scrapie prions, the grafts accumulated high levels of PrPSc and infectivity and developed the severe histopathological changes characteristic of scrapie. Moreover, substantial amounts of graft-derived PrPSc migrated into the host brain.

After in vitro differentiation and grafting into adult brains of PrPC-deficient Prnp 0 / 0 mice, Dpl-deficient ES cell-derived grafts contained all neural lineages analyzed, including neurons and astrocytes. When Prnd-deficient neural tissue was inoculated with scrapie prions, typical features of prion pathology including spongiosis, gliosis and PrPSc accumulation, were observed.

40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that {{are caused by}} the conversion of a <b>normal</b> host-encoded <b>protein,</b> <b>PrPC,</b> to an abnormal, disease-causing form, PrPSc. This paper reports that cyclodextrins {{have the ability to}} reduce the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein PrPSc to undetectable levels in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells. Beta-cyclodextrin removed PrPSc from the cells at a concentration of 500 μM following 2 weeks of treatment.

The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) for beta-cyclodextrin was 75 μM, whereas α-cyclodextrin, which possessed less antiprion activity, had an IC 50 of 750 μM. This report presents cyclodextrins as a new class of antiprion compound. For decades, the pharmaceutical industry has successfully used cyclodextrins for their complex-forming ability; this ability is due to the structural orientation of the glucopyranose units, which generate a hydrophobic cavity that can facilitate the encapsulation of hydrophobic moieties. Consequently, cyclodextrins could be ideal candidates for the treatment of prion diseases...|$|R

Misfolded prion proteins are normally degraded by the proteasome. This work, analyzing models of scrapie disease, describes the in vivo relationship between the proteasome and prions. We report that the disease is associated with an increase of proteasome functionality, most likely as a means of counteracting the increased levels of oxidative stress. Here, we show that prions coprecipitate with the 20 S proteasome and that they colocalize within the same neuron, thus raising the possibility that PrP interacts with the proteasome in both normal and diseased brain, affecting substrate trafficking and proteasome functionality. This interaction, inducing proteasome activation, leads to different neuronal alterations and triggers apoptosis.

Although naïve mice developed scrapie at 175 +/- 5 days postintracerebral prion inoculation (dpi), gene transfer before inoculation delayed disease onset by 72 +/- 4 days. At 170 days postintracerebral prion inoculation, PrP(Sc) accumulation and prion infectivity in PrPFc-treated brains were reduced by 3. 6 and 4. 2 logs, respectively. When PrP-Fc(2) was delivered 30 days after prion inoculation, survival of the treated animals was extended by 25 days. We then used tissue-specific recombination to express PrP-Fc(2) in the entire central nervous system, in only astrocytes, or in only oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocyte-restricted PrP-Fc(2) expression impaired PrP(Sc) deposition and delayed disease even though oligodendrocytes are completely resistant to prion infection, suggesting that PrP-Fc(2) affords protection via noncell autonomous mechanisms.

This study also indicates a risk of prion spread to sheep and potentially to other animals through dietary exposure to pooled sheep milk or milk products. Prion diseases have emerged globally as a significant threat to human and animal health.

Dendritic cells (DCs, cells quite distinct from FDCs) are cells that are specialised to acquire antigens from peripheral tissues and to transport them to secondary lymphoid organs for presentation to T and B lymphocytes.

40|$|Propagation of {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies {{is associated}} with the conversion of <b>normal</b> prion <b>protein,</b> <b>PrPC,</b> into a misfolded, oligomeric form, PrPSc. Although the high-resolution structure of the PrPC is well characterized, the structural properties of PrPSc remain elusive. Here we used MS analysis of H/D backbone amide exchange to examine the structure of amyloid fibrils formed by the recombinant human PrP corresponding to residues 90 – 231 (PrP 90 – 231), a misfolded form recently reported to be infectious in transgenic mice overexpressing PrPC. Analysis of H/D exchange data allowed us to map the systematically H-bonded β-sheet core of PrP amyloid to the C-terminal region (staring at residue ≈ 169) that in the native structure of PrP monomer corresponds to α-helix 2, a major part of α-helix 3, and the loop between these two helices. No extensive hydrogen bonding (as indicated by the lack of significant protection of amide hydrogens) was detected in the N-terminal part of PrP 90 – 231 fibrils, arguing against the involvement of residues within this region in stable β-structure. These data provide long-sought experimentally derived constraints for high-resolution structural models of PrP amyloid fibrils...|$|R
40|$|Prion diseases, or {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) {{are typically}} characterised by CNS accumulation of PrP(Sc), an aberrant conformer of a <b>normal</b> cellular <b>protein</b> <b>PrP(C).</b> It is thought PrP(Sc) is itself infectious and the causative agent of such diseases. To date, no chemical modifications of PrP(Sc), or a sub-population thereof, have been reported. In this study we have investigated whether chemical modification of amino acids within PrP might cause this protein to exhibit aberrant properties and whether these properties can be propagated onto unmodified prion protein. Of particular interest were post-translational modifications resulting from physiological conditions shown {{to be associated with}} TSE disease. Here we report that in vitro exposure of recombinant PrP to conditions that imitate the end effects of oxidative/nitrative stress in TSE-infected mouse brains cause the protein to adopt many of the physical characteristics of PrP(Sc). Most interestingly, these properties could be propagated onto unmodified PrP protein when the modified protein was used as a template. These data suggest that post-translational modifications of PrP might contribute to the initiation and/or propagation of prion protein-associated plaques in vivo during prion disease, thereby high-lighting novel biochemical pathways as possible therapeutic targets for these conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
