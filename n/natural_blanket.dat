40|$|ABSTRACT: The Greenhouse Effect is {{a natural}} process that warms the Earth, and it is quite {{necessary}} for our survival. In atmosphere gases like water vapor (clouds), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4),and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) act as a <b>natural</b> <b>blanket</b> by preventing the sun’s heat energy from radiating back into space The natural greenhouse effect helps warm the Earth’s surface {{by as much as}} 33 o C, and without it, would be very tough to survive as it would be too cold [1. There has been increase in Green House Gases (GHGs) since pre-industrial times, which have led to a marked increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations causing global warming. The Largest growth in Global GHG emissions between 1970 and 2004 has come from various energy sectors like transport from burning of more fossil fuels, industry, land use like deforestation, land use change, forestry, agriculture, from buildings. The building sector has a high level of electricity use; hence total direct and indirect in this sector is much higher compared with direct emissions. Due to increase in GHGs, which leads to the greenhouse effect in turn global warming causing melting of ice glaciers in the Polar Regions of the earth, disturbing earth’s natural bio-geochemical cycles and harm to all ecosystems. The GHG’s like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, Freon gas and chloroflourocarbons (CFC’s) are major gases in different concentrations affecting the atmosphere and leading to global warming...|$|E

50|$|In a pure fusion design, the {{neutrons}} {{are used}} for breeding tritium in a lithium <b>blanket.</b> <b>Natural</b> lithium consists of about 92% Li-7 {{and the rest is}} mostly Li-6. Li-7 requires neutron energies even higher than those released by fission, around 5 MeV, well within the range of energies provided by fusion. This reaction produces T, Helium-3, and another slow neutron. Li-6 can react with high or low energy neutrons, including those released by the Li-7 reaction. This means that a single fusion reaction can produce several tritiums, which is a requirement if the reactor is going to make up for natural decay and losses in the fusion processes.|$|R
40|$|Most of Indonesian rubber {{products}} SIR 20 {{are made from}} the material of raw rubber obtained from smallholders. However, the quality of this material is not good enough. Thus, quality improvement has {{to be carried out}} by manufacturers. The liquid smoke used during the blanket hanging process can improve the quality of the {{rubber products}} SIR 20. This research aimed to determine and study the effects of liquid smoke spraying and blanket hanging duration on the drying factor, the dry rubber content, technical quality, vulcanization characteristics, and physical properties of vulcanized natural rubber. Treatments consisted of various hanging duration (6, 8, and 10 days, and without hanging) and spraying (with and without spraying of liquid smoke). The results showed that the spraying of liquid smoke on <b>natural</b> rubber <b>blankets</b> could improve the technical quality of the natural rubber, especially the values of Po and PRI. The spraying of liquid smoke could reduce the blanket hanging duration to 6 - 8 days. The blankets sprayed with liquid smoke had the optimum cure time of around 15 minutes and 19 seconds and the scorch time of around 3 minutes and 22 seconds. These values indicated that the vulcanization characteristics of blankets which were sprayed with liquid smoke were generally better than those of blankets which were not sprayed with liquid smok...|$|R
40|$|Spallation is an {{efficient}} endothermal process for releasing neutrons from nuclei. In order {{to sustain a}} spallation reaction, an energetic beam of particles, most commonly protons, must be supplied onto a heavy target. Spallation is a multifragmentation reaction which leads to only one heavy fragment whose mass {{is close to the}} target mass AT and a lot of light particles, such as neutrons, protons, deuterons etc. However spallation can play an important role as a source of neutrons whose flux can be easily controlled via the driving beam. A spallation neutron spectrum is determined by the type, the flux and the energy of the beam particles, {{as well as from the}} mass and the target geometry. The neutron spectrum of a spallation source in general is a continuous spectrum from intermediate up to fast neutrons. Therefore a spallation source can be used as an example in the material science, or the transmutation and incineration of nuclear wastes. Two different spallation sources were designed and their neutron production was investigated during this study. The first spallation neutron source “Gamma- 2 ” consists of cylindrical Pb target with 8 cm in diameter and length which was varied from 20 cm up to 40 cm. The Pb target was covered with a paraffin moderator. The second spallation source, “Energy plus transmutation” consist of a lead target, with 48 cm length and 8 cm diameter, surrounded by <b>natural</b> Uranium <b>blanket.</b> Four sections of <b>natural</b> Uranium <b>blankets</b> constitute the spallation source. Each section consists of 30 U-rods with 10. 4 cm in length and 3. 6 cm in diameter. The whole system was surrounded by a polyethylene moderator covered with 1 mm thickness Cd. The neutron spectrum produced by the irradiation of the “Energy plus Transmutation” is harder than the neutron spectrum from “Gamma- 2 ” set-up. In the current work the spallation neutron sources were used for transmutation and incineration purposes. In order to transmute an isotope via (n,γ) or (n,f) reaction with thermal neutron a soft neutron spectrum is needed, while a harder neutron spectrum is necessary in order to transmute an isotope via (n,xn) or (n,f) with fast neutrons. For radiation protection purposes spallation neutron sources must be surrounded by an appropriate shielding. In this work measurements of the neutron flux produced by the spallation neutron sources were performed using Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs). The number of neutrons escaping the shielding materials was also measured in the current work using SSNTDs. In addition phenomenological calculations of the neutron flux behind different shielding materials, as paraffin, polyethylene and concrete, based on empirical relations coming from high energy Physics, and measurements were made. The experimental results were compared with the phenomenological and with Monte Carlo calculations. According to this comparison the phenomenological calculations can be used in order to estimate the dose behind various shielding materials. Moreover the phenomenological method has the advantage that their execution time of the calculation is independent of the depth or thickness of shielding for which the computation is done. Consequently phenomenological method compares favourably with the Monte Carlo calculations and is able to obtain results where the Monte Carlo statistics are poor. According to the phenomenological calculations the most appropriate shielding to reach radiation protection recommendation (1 μSv/h) is proposed to be 140 cm of Concrete and 30 cm of Iron. The experiments were performed in Nuclotron accelerator at the Laboratory of High Energies at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), in Dubna Russia. ...|$|R
40|$|Systematic {{procedures}} {{have been devised}} and applied to evaluate core design and fuel management strategies for improving uranium utilization in Pressurized Water Reactors operated on a once-through fuel cycle. A principal objective has been the evaluation of suggested improvements on a self-consistent basis, allowing for concurrent changes in dependent variables such as core leakage and batch power histories, which might otherwise obscure the sometimes subtle effects of interest. Two levels of evaluation have been devised: a simple but accurate analytic model based on the observed linear variations in assembly reactivity {{as a function of}} burnup; and a numerical approach, embodied in a computer program, which relaxes this assumption and combines it with empirical prescriptions for assembly (or batch) power as a function of reactivity, and core leakage as a function of peripheral assembly power. State-of-the-art physics methods, such as PDQ- 7, were used ! to verify and supplement these techniques. These methods have been applied to evaluate several suggested improvements: (1) axial blankets of low-enriched or depleted uranium, and of beryllium metal, (2) radial <b>natural</b> uranium <b>blankets,</b> (3) low-leakage radial fuel management, (4) high burnup fuels, (5) optimized H/U atom ratio, (6) annular fuel, and (7) mechanical spectral shift (i. e. variable fuel-to-moderator ratio) concepts such as those involving pin pulling and bundle reconstitution. The potential savings in uranium requirements compared to current practice were found to be as follows: (1) O 0 - 3 %, (2) negative, (3) 2 - 3 %; possibly 5 %, (4) " 15 %, (5) 0 - 2. 5 %, (6) no inherent advantage, (7) 10 %. Total savings should not be assumed to be additive; and thermal/hydraulic or mechanical design restrictions may preclude full realization of some of the potential improvements.

40|$|Highlights • Sediment {{influence}} on hydrate dissolution was {{studied in the}} field and lab • In the field, CH 4 (aq) concentrations were at or below theoretical saturation • Dissolution of <b>natural</b> hydrate <b>blanketed</b> by 15 cm thick sediment was measured • This covered hydrate dissolved at a slower rate than nearby exposed hydrates • In the lab, exposed hydrate dissolved faster than covered hydrate Abstract Dissolution rates of naturally occurring gas hydrates vary by orders of magnitude across studies suggesting that environmental factors may influence hydrate dissolution. To determine the role that sediment cover plays in hydrate dissolution, we used a mini-pore fluid array sampler (mPFA) to continuously collect sediment porewater adjacent to a hydrate outcrop and maintain it at in situ pressure for later analysis. This allowed us to measure in situ dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations in the porewater over time without sample loss due to degassing. We deployed the mPFA at a hydrate outcrop at Barkley Canyon on the Cascadia Margin for nine months. This novel approach yielded concentration data that were used to determine the steady-state dissolution rate of the hydrate outcrop and test predictions of the diffusion-control model for dissolution in the field. In the lab, we conducted a series of experiments with artificial hydrate to directly compare dissolution rates between exposed and sediment-covered hydrate. The dissolution rate of the natural hydrate outcrop covered with sediment was 0. 06 cm y− 1. The laboratory experiments of sediment-covered hydrate yielded dissolution rates of 0. 6 ± 0. 5 cm y− 1 (n = 5). In both laboratory and field observations, the dissolution rate of hydrates exposed directly to bulk water (3. 9 ± 1. 7 cm y− 1 and 3. 5 cm y− 1 respectively) was at least an order of magnitude faster than the dissolution rate of sediment covered hydrate. These results are consistent with expectations of diffusion-control and support this model of hydrate dissolution. In nature, sediment may account for the persistence of hydrate in otherwise methane-depleted environments by increasing the diffusive boundary layer and slowing the rate of molecular diffusion via porosity/tortuosity effects. We provide a number of “Lessons Learned” for improving the instrument design and for consideration during future studies...|$|R
40|$|The most {{prevalent}} criticism of fission-fusion hybrids {{is simply that}} they are too exotic - that they would exacerbate the challenges of both fission and fusion. This is not really true. Intriguingly, hybrids could actually be more viable than stand-alone fusion reactors while mitigating many challenges of fission. This work develops a conceptual design for a fission-fusion hybrid reactor in steady-state L-mode tokamak configuration with a subcritical natural or depleted uranium pebble bed blanket. A liquid lithiumlead alloy breeds enough tritium to replenish that consumed by the D-T fusion reaction. Subcritical operation could obviate the most challenging fuel cycle aspects of fission. The fission blanket augments the fusion power such that the fusion core itself need not have a high power gain, thus allowing for fully non-inductive (steady-state) low confinement mode (L-mode) operation at relatively small physical dimensions. A neutron transport Monte Carlo code models the <b>natural</b> uranium fission <b>blanket.</b> Maximizing the fission power while breeding sufficient tritium allows for the selection of an optimal set of blanket parameters, which yields a maximum prudent fission power gain of 7. 7. A 0 -D tokamak model suffices to analyze approximate tokamak operating conditions. If {{the definition of a}} "reactor" is a device with a total power gain of 40, then this fission blanket would allow the fusion component of a hybrid reactor with the same dimensions as ITER to operate in steady-state L-mode very comfortably with a fusion power gain of 6. 7 and a thermal fusion power of 2. 1 GW. Taking this further can determine the approximate minimum scale for a steady-state L-mode tokamak hybrid reactor, which is a major radius of 5. 2 in and an aspect ratio of 2. 8. This minimum scale device operates barely within the steady-state L-mode realm with a thermal fusion power of 1. 7 GW. This hybrid, with its very fast neutron spectrum, could be superior to pure fission reactors in terms of breeding fissile fuel and transmuting deleterious fission products. It could operate either as a breeder, producing fuel for pure fission reactors from natural or depleted uranium, or as a deep burner, fissioning heavy metal and transmuting waste with a cycle time of decades. Despite a plethora of potential functions, its primary mission is deemed to be that of a deep burner producing baseload commercial power with a once-through fuel cycle. Although hybrids are often purported a priori to pose an elevated proliferation risk, this reactor breeds plutonium that could actually be more proliferation-resistant than that bred by fast reactors. Furthermore, a novel method (the "variable fixed source method") can maintain constant total hybrid power output as burnup proceeds by varying the neutron source strength. As for engineering feasibility, basic thermal hydraulic analysis demonstrates that pressurized helium could cool the pebble bed fission blanket with a flow rate below 10 m/s. The Brayton cycle thermal efficiency is 41 %. This device is dubbed the Steady-State L-Mode Non-Enriched Uranium Tokamak Hybrid (SLEUTH). The purpose of this work is not any sort of elaborate design, but rather the exploration of an idea coupled with corroborating numerical analysis. At this point in the hybrid debate, viable conceptual designs are persuasive while intricate build-ready designs are superfluous. This work conceives such a conceptual design, demonstrates its viability, and will perhaps, incidentally, spur a profusion of pro-fusion sentiment!by Mark Wilbert Reed. Thesis (S. M.)
