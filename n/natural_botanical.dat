5000|$|Timorex Gold is a <b>natural</b> <b>botanical</b> broad {{spectrum}} fungicide with prophylactic and curative activity, {{based on a}} plant extract of Melaleuca alternifolia. Timorex Gold is effective against {{a wide range of}} plant-pathogenic fungi, including Oomycetes, Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycota, on numerous crops, including vegetables, herbs, grapevines, fruit trees, and banana. Timorex Gold has demonstrated high efficacy against Black Sigatoka (Black leaf streak disease in banana). Plants damaged by Black Sigatoka have a significant reduction in the photosynthesizing area of the leaf, and fruit yield losses can reach 50% through premature maturation.|$|E
