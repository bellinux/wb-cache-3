5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely.

Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is <b>now</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
