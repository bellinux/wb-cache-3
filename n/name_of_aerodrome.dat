This company leased the facilities to the company Centro de Paracaidismo Costa Brava, the professional skydiving management firm.

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} to characterize changes occurring in EU transport policy, {{taking into account}} innovation <b>of</b> airports and <b>aerodromes.</b> To face challenges like: increase in air traffic, ensuring safety of flight operations, regional development or requirements of passengers {{it is necessary to}} determine desired direction network <b>of</b> airports and <b>aerodromes</b> within the aviation policy, {{which is part of the}} national and European transport policy. Overview of national and EU studies, strategies and legislative plans enable to specify changes taking place in the EU aviation policy, as well as to create potential scenarios of its development with particular attention to the innovation <b>of</b> <b>aerodromes</b> and airports. Based on the above analysis it should be noted, that aims of the European institutions and agencies are: reduction amount of restrictive rules on general aviation (including GA <b>aerodromes),</b> spread concepts <b>of</b> multimodality and Small Aircraft Transport Systems, enhance competitiveness of the EU aviation sector but also reduction investment funding at airports. Conclusions may be a theoretical inspiration in the process of updating master plans <b>of</b> <b>aerodromes</b> and airports...|$|R
