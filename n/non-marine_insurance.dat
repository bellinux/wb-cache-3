5000|$|By the 19th century {{membership}} of Lloyd's was regulated and in 1871, the Lloyd's Act was passed, establishing the corporation of Lloyd's {{to act as}} a market place for members, or [...] "Names". And {{in the early part of}} the twentieth century, the collective body of general insurance law was codified in 1906 into the Marine Insurance Act 1906, with the result that, since that date, marine and <b>non-marine</b> <b>insurance</b> law have diverged, although fundamentally based on the same original principles.|$|E
50|$|The {{roots of}} the company lie with the Roberts agency, which {{commenced}} underwriting marine insurance at the Lloyd's market in 1901. In 1946 Ralph Hiscox, who had joined the agency as an underwriter of <b>non-marine</b> <b>insurance</b> eight years earlier, formed the Roberts & Hiscox partnership {{for the purposes of}} managing syndicates at Lloyd's. Hiscox was elected chairman of Lloyd's in 1967, the same year his son Robert joined the group's Syndicate 33 as an underwriter of fine art and personal accident insurance. Robert Hiscox subsequently took over as head of the partnership in 1970 {{after the death of his}} father, and set about growing the size of the business.|$|E
5000|$|These {{two terms}} {{are used to}} {{differentiate}} the degree of proof where a vessel or cargo has been lost. An actual total loss occurs where the damages or cost of repair clearly equal or exceed {{the value of the}} property. A constructive total loss is a situation where the cost of repairs plus the cost of salvage equal or exceed the value. The use of these terms is contingent on there being property remaining to assess damages, which is not always possible in losses to ships at sea or in total theft situations. In this respect, marine insurance differs from <b>non-marine</b> <b>insurance,</b> where the insured is required to prove his loss. Traditionally, in law, marine insurance was seen as an insurance of [...] "the adventure", with insurers having a stake and an interest in the vessel and/or the cargo rather than simply an interest in the financial consequences of the subject-matter's survival.|$|E
50|$|Lloyd's Coffee House was {{the first}} marine {{insurance}} market. It became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led {{to the establishment of}} the insurance market Lloyd's of London and several related shipping and insurance businesses. The participating members of the insurance arrangement eventually formed a committee and moved to the Royal Exchange on Cornhill as the Society of Lloyd's. The establishment of insurance companies, a developing infrastructure of specialists (such as shipbrokers, admiralty lawyers, bankers, surveyors, loss adjusters, general average adjusters, et al.), and the growth of the British Empire gave English law a prominence in this area which it largely maintains and forms the basis of almost all modern practice. Lord Mansfield, Lord Chief Justice in the mid-eighteenth century, began the merging of law merchant and common law principles. The growth of the London insurance market led to the standardization of policies and judicial precedent further developed marine insurance law. In 1906 the Marine Insurance Act codified the previous common law; it is both an extremely thorough and concise piece of work. Although the title of the Act refers to marine insurance, the general principles have been applied to all non-life insurance. In the 19th century, Lloyd's and the Institute of London Underwriters (a grouping of London company insurers) developed between them standardized clauses for the use of marine insurance, and these have been maintained since. These are known as the Institute Clauses because the Institute covered the cost of their publication. Out of marine insurance, grew <b>non-marine</b> <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance. Marine insurance traditionally formed the majority of business underwritten at Lloyd's. Nowadays, Marine insurance is often grouped with Aviation and Transit (cargo) risks, and in this form is known by the acronym 'MAT'.|$|E
