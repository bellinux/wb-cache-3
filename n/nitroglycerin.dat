5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes <b>nitroglycerin,</b> beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many of these drugs have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs with the pain, or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates <b>nitroglycerin</b> and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of <b>nitroglycerin</b> and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the <b>nitroglycerin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sticky {{bomb was}} a glass flask filled with <b>nitroglycerin</b> and given an {{adhesive}} coating {{allowing it to}} be glued to a passing vehicle. In theory, it could be thrown, but in practice it would most likely need to be placed—thumped against the target with sufficient force to stick—requiring courage and good fortune to be used effectively. An order for one million sticky bombs was placed in June 1940, but various problems delayed their distribution in large numbers until early 1941, {{and it is likely}} that fewer than 250,000 were produced.|$|E
5|$|Parsons met Helen Northrup at a {{local church}} dance and {{proposed}} marriage in July 1934. She accepted and {{they were married in}} April 1935 at the Little Church of the Flowers in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, before undertaking a brief honeymoon in San Diego. They moved into a house on South Terrace Drive, Pasadena, while Parsons gained employment for the explosives manufacturer Halifax Powder Company at their facility in Saugus. Much to Helen's dismay, Parsons spent most of his wages funding the GALCIT Rocket Research Group. For extra money he manufactured <b>nitroglycerin</b> in their home, constructing a home laboratory on their front porch. At one point he pawned Helen's engagement ring, and he often asked her family for loans.|$|E
5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure <b>nitroglycerin</b> is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{graduated}} from University School in 1933, and moved {{with his mother}} and grandmother to a more modest house on St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in literature and poetry. He enrolled in Pasadena Junior College with the hope of earning an associate degree in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after only a term because of his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company. His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in Hercules, California on San Francisco Bay, where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to <b>nitroglycerin.</b> He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at Stanford University, but found the tuition fees unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the <b>nitroglycerin</b> began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to France, {{he was offered}} a script written by Georges-Jean Arnaud, an expatriate living in South America who had written about his own experiences there. Clouzot found it easy to imagine {{the setting of the}} script and was very anxious to film Arnaud's story. He started writing the film, The Wages of Fear, with his brother, Jean Clouzot, who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of Jérôme Geronimi. Production on The Wages of Fear lasted from 1951 to 1952. In order to gain as much independence as possible, Clouzot created his own production company called Véra Films, which he named after his wife. The sole female role in The Wages of Fear is played by Véra. Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife, as the character does not exist in the original novel. The Wages of Fear is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying <b>nitroglycerin</b> through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire. The Wages of Fear was the second most popular film in France in 1953 and was seen by nearly 7million spectators. It won awards for Best Film and Best Actor (for Charles Vanel) at the Cannes Film Festival. Clouzot's next big hit was Diabolique, whose screenplay he took away from director Alfred Hitchcock. Diabolique involves the story of a cruel headmaster who brutalizes his wife and his mistress. The two women murder him and dump his body in a swimming pool, but when the pool is drained, no corpse is found. In 1954, Diabolique won the Louis Delluc Prize and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best foreign film. In this early and mid-1950s period, with the films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique, Clouzot came to be fully embraced by international critics and audiences. Both films were screened and reviewed in America as well as in France, and were rated among the best thrillers of the decade. In 1955, Clouzot directed the documentary The Mystery of Picasso, about the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. The film follows Picasso drawing or painting 15 different works, all of which were intentionally destroyed following the film's production. Clouzot and Picasso were old acquaintances, having met when Clouzot was 14. The Mystery of Picasso won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, but was a financial failure in France, being seen by only 37,000 filmgoers during its initial run in 1956. In 1984, the film was declared a national treasure by the government of France.|$|E
25|$|A review {{indicated}} {{the effectiveness of}} transdermal <b>nitroglycerin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitroglycerin</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of angina, acute myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, and acute coronary artery spasms.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} {{almost from the}} time of the first {{synthesis}} of GTN by Ascanio Sobrero in 1846 that handling and tasting of <b>nitroglycerin</b> could cause sudden intense headaches, which suggested a vasodilation effect (as suggested by Sobrero). Constantine Hering developed a form of <b>nitroglycerin</b> in 1847 and advocated for its dosing as a treatment of a number of diseases; however, it use as a specific treatment for blood pressure and chest pain was not among these.|$|E
25|$|The {{latter half}} of the 19th century saw the {{invention}} of <b>nitroglycerin,</b> nitrocellulose and smokeless powders which soon replaced black powder in many applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} {{is in the}} form of <b>nitroglycerin,</b> either pill or liquid spray forms, which, as a prodrug, is denitrated and {{releases}} the active metabolite nitric oxide (NO).|$|E
25|$|Non-surgical {{treatments}} are recommended initially for acute and chronic anal fissures. These include topical <b>nitroglycerin</b> or calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem), or injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter.|$|E
25|$|Other {{vascular}} agents such as {{nitric oxide}} (NO), n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-Name), <b>nitroglycerin,</b> NO + phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil), and endothelin receptor antagonists have no effect, {{and in some}} cases worsen of the EIPH.|$|E
25|$|Ramon Bieri as Corlette, an {{oil company}} {{representative}} who seeks four experienced drivers to transport <b>nitroglycerin</b> to extinguish a fire on a remote oil well. He believes the explosion was caused by local terrorists.|$|E
25|$|Dynamite, a safe {{to handle}} blend of <b>nitroglycerin</b> and diatomaceous earth was {{patented}} in 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Dynamite increased productivity of mining, tunneling, road building, construction and demolition and made {{projects such as}} the Panama Canal possible.|$|E
25|$|This {{vasodilation}} {{does not}} decrease {{the volume of}} blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. <b>Nitroglycerin</b> pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The <b>nitroglycerin</b> reacts with a sulfhydryl group (–SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation. There is a potential role {{for the use of}} nitric oxide in alleviating bladder contractile dysfunctions, and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and afterload and by some direct vasodilation of coronary vessels.|$|E
25|$|The United States Navy in 1939 had {{quantities}} of Cordite N, a Canadian propellant {{that was much}} improved, yet its Bureau of Ordnance objected strongly to its use onboard U.S. warships, considering it unsuitable as a naval propellant due to its inclusion of <b>nitroglycerin.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{supplements}} of nitric oxide, {{the response is}} short-lived because, as a normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism, increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance, which {{is the reason that}} the effectiveness of sustained use of <b>nitroglycerin</b> for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days.|$|E
25|$|TNT {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications. TNT has been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating <b>nitroglycerin</b> in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized TNT.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitroglycerin,</b> {{also known}} as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), is a {{medication}} used for heart failure, high blood pressure, and to treat and prevent chest pain from not enough {{blood flow to the}} heart (angina) or due to cocaine. This includes chest pain from a heart attack. It is taken by mouth, under the tongue, applied to the skin, or by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|People with presumed ACS are {{typically}} treated with aspirin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor, <b>nitroglycerin,</b> {{and if the}} chest discomfort persists morphine. Other analgesics such as nitrous oxide are of unknown benefit. Angiography is recommended in those who have either new ST elevation or a new left bundle branch block on their ECG. Unless the person has low oxygen levels additional oxygen {{does not appear to}} be useful.|$|E
25|$|The four drivers embark upon {{a perilous}} journey of over 200 miles, facing many hazards and {{internal}} conflicts. Despite their differences, {{they are forced}} to co-operate. Eventually, after some setbacks, only Scanlon survives the ordeal and towards the end, struggles to stay sane, overwhelmed by hallucinations and flashbacks. When his truck's engine dies just two miles short of the destination, he is forced to carry the remaining <b>nitroglycerin</b> on foot.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{headaches}} and heartburn, {{as well as}} flushed skin. Caution is advised in those who have cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include prolonged erections, {{which can lead to}} damage to the penis, and sudden-onset hearing loss. Sildenafil should not be taken by people who take nitrates such as <b>nitroglycerin</b> (glycerin trinitrate), as this may result in a severe and potentially fatal drop in blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{headache}} and low blood pressure. The low blood pressure can be severe. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is {{safe for the}} baby. It {{should not be used}} together with medications within the sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitor) family due to the risk of low blood pressure. <b>Nitroglycerin</b> is in the nitrate family of medications. While it is not entirely clear how it works, it is believed to function by dilating blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|In Revolution-torn 1913 Mexico, Juan Miranda, a Mexican outlaw {{leading a}} bandit family, robs a coach of wealthy men and rapes a female {{passenger}} who insulted him. Passing by {{on a motorcycle}} is John (Seán) H. Mallory, an early Irish Republican explosives expert, who is working in Mexico as a silver mine blaster. Discovering his skill with dynamite and <b>nitroglycerin,</b> Juan relentlessly tries to force John to join him on a raid on the Mesa Verde National Bank.|$|E
25|$|Routine {{treatment}} {{should include}} immobilization {{of the affected}} limb, application of ice, local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis. Many other therapies have been used {{with varying degrees of}} success, including hyperbaric oxygen, dapsone, antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, <b>nitroglycerin,</b> electric shock, curettage, surgical excision, and antivenom. None of these treatments have been subjected to randomized controlled trials to conclusively show benefit. In almost all cases, bites are self-limited and typically heal without any medical intervention.|$|E
25|$|Provings are {{claimed to}} have been {{important}} {{in the development of the}} clinical trial, due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of statistics in medicine. The lengthy records of self-experimentation by homeopaths have occasionally proven useful in the development of modern drugs: For example, evidence that <b>nitroglycerin</b> might be useful as a treatment for angina was discovered by looking through homeopathic provings, though homeopaths themselves never used it for that purpose at that time.|$|E
25|$|The sublingual region {{underneath}} {{the front of}} the tongue is an ideal location for the administration of certain medications into the body. The oral mucosa is very thin {{underneath the}} tongue, and is underlain by a plexus of veins. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. This is the only convenient and efficacious route of administration (apart from Intravenous therapy) of <b>nitroglycerin</b> to a patient suffering chest pain from angina pectoris.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} 'effort angina', this {{refers to the}} classic type of angina related to {{myocardial}} ischemia. A typical presentation of stable angina is that of chest discomfort and associated symptoms precipitated by some activity (running, walking, etc.) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest or after administration of sublingual <b>nitroglycerin.</b> Symptoms typically abate several minutes after activity and recur when activity resumes. In this way, stable angina may {{be thought of as}} being similar to intermittent claudication symptoms. Other recognized precipitants of stable angina include cold weather, heavy meals, and emotional stress.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{powerful}} oxidizing acid, nitric acid reacts violently with many organic {{materials and the}} reactions may be explosive. The hydroxyl group will typically strip a hydrogen from the organic molecule to form water, and the remaining nitro group takes the hydrogen's place. Nitration of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives, such as <b>nitroglycerin</b> and trinitrotoluene (TNT). As very many less stable byproducts are possible, these reactions must be carefully thermally controlled, and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired product.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{arriving}} {{to the emergency}} department with a myocardial infarction (heart attack) {{are likely to be}} triaged to the resuscitation area. They will receive oxygen and monitoring and have an early ECG; aspirin will be given if not contraindicated or not already administered by the ambulance team; morphine or diamorphine will be given for pain; sub lingual (under the tongue) or buccal (between cheek and upper gum) glyceryl trinitrate (<b>nitroglycerin)</b> (GTN or NTG) will be given, unless contraindicated by the presence of other drugs, such as drugs that treat erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically includes octreotide or if not available vasopression and <b>nitroglycerin</b> to reduce portal pressures. This is typically in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varicies. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates {{may be used for}} the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues then balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varicies. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.|$|E
25|$|The {{new plant}} {{and the new}} town for the workers and {{families}} were named Penniman, in honor of Russell Sylvanus Penniman, an American chemist who is credited with the invention of ammonia dynamite in 1885, a safer form than the <b>nitroglycerin</b> used with Alfred Nobel's original formulation. At its peak, Penniman had housing for 15,000, and included dormitories, a store, a post office, bank, police station, church, YWCA, YMCA, Mess Halls canteen, and a hospital. The York County Chapter of the American Red Cross began its initial activities {{in support of the}} Dupont Factory and residents of Penniman.|$|E
