5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become <b>non-intersecting,</b> after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E

25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As we take the derivative, and each time we do so we bring down the tangent vector , when the volume operator acts on <b>non-intersecting</b> Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would need at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E

Start with three circles C1, C2 and C3, each {{one of which is}} tangent to the other two (in the general construction, these three circles can be any size, {{as long as they have}} common tangents). Apollonius discovered that there are two other <b>non-intersecting</b> circles, C4 and C5, which have the property that they are tangent to all three of the original circles– these are called Apollonian circles (see Descartes' theorem).

25|$|A very {{important}} aspect of the Hamiltonian operator is that it only acts at vertices (a consequence of this is that Thiemann's Hamiltonian operator, like Ashtekar's operator, annihilates <b>non-intersecting</b> loops except now it is not just formal and has rigorous mathematical meaning).

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to compute the approx-imate Boolean operations of two freeform polygonal mesh solids efficiently with the help of Layered Depth Images (LDI). After applying the LDI sampling based membership classification, the most challenging part, a trimmed adaptive contouring algorithm, is developed to reconstruct the mesh surface from the LDI samples near the intersected regions and stitch it to the boundary of the retained surfaces. Our method of approximate Boolean operations holds the advantage of numerical robustness as the approach uses volumetric representation. However, unlike other methods based on volumetric representation, we do not damage the facets in <b>non-intersected</b> regions, thus preserving geometric details much better and speeding up the computation as well. We show that the proposed method can successfully compute the Boolean operations of freeform solids with a massive number of polygons in a few seconds.

40|$|Given a {{triangulated}} model, we want {{to identify}} which voxels of a voxel grid are intersected by the boundary of this model. There are other branch of implemented voxelizations, in which not only the boundary is detected, also {{the interior of the}} model. Often these voxels are cubes. But it is not a restriction, there are other presented techniques in which the voxel grid is the view frustum, and voxels are prisms. There are di erent kind of voxelizations depending on the rasterization behavior. Approximate rasterization is the standard way of rasterizing fragments in GPU. It means only those fragments whose center lies inside the projection of the primitive are identi ed. Conservative rasterization (Hasselgren et al., 2005) involves a dilation operation over the primitive. This is done in GPU to ensure that in the rasterization stage all the intersected fragments have its center inside the dilated primitive. However, this can produce spurious fragments, <b>non-intersected</b> pixels. Exact voxelization detects only those voxels that we need. ...|$|R

40|$|Non-invasive {{localization}} {{of continuous}} atrial ectopic beats remains a cornerstone {{for the treatment}} of atrial arrhythmias. The lack of accurate tools to guide electrophysiologists leads to an increase in the recurrence rate of ablation procedures. Existing approaches are based on the analysis of the P-waves main characteristics and the forward body surface potential maps (BSPMs) or on the inverse estimation of the electric activity of the heart from those BSPMs. These methods have not provided an efficient and systematic tool to localize ectopic triggers. In this work, we propose the use of machine learning techniques to spatially cluster and classify ectopic atrial foci into clearly differentiated atrial regions by using the body surface P-wave integral map (BSPiM) as a biomarker. Our simulated results show that ectopic foci with similar BSPiM naturally cluster into differentiated <b>non-intersected</b> atrial regions and that new patterns could be correctly classified with an accuracy of 97 % when considering 2 clusters and 96 % for 4 clusters. Our results also suggest that {{an increase in the number}} of clusters is feasible at the cost of decreasing accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Efficient multiresolution {{representations}} for isosurfaces and interval volumes {{are becoming}} increasingly important as the gap between volume data sizes and processing speed continues to widen. Our multiresolution scalar field model is a hierarchy of tetrahedral clusters generated by longest edge bisection, that we call a hierarchy of diamonds. We propose two multiresolution models for representing isosurfaces, or interval volumes, extracted from a hierarchy of diamonds which exploit its regular structure. These models are defined by subsets of diamonds in the hierarchy, that we call isodiamonds, which are enhanced with geometric and topological information for encoding {{the relation between the}} isosurface, or interval volume, and the diamond itself. The first multiresolution model, called a relevant isodiamond hierarchy, encodes the isodiamonds intersected by the isosurface, or interval volume, as well as their <b>non-intersected</b> ancestors, while the second model, called a minimal isodiamond hierarchy, encodes only the intersected isodiamonds. Since both models operate directly on the extracted isosurface or interval volume, they require significantly less memory and support faster selective refinement queries than the original multiresolution scalar field, but do not support dynamic isovalue modifications. Moreover, since a minimal isodiamond hierarchy only encodes intersected isodiamonds, its extracted meshes require significantly less memory than those extracted from a relevant isodiamond hierarchy. We demonstrate the compactness of isodiamond hierarchies by comparing them to an indexed representation of the mesh at full resolution...|$|R

40|$|A generic {{algorithm}} is proposed to merge structured and unstructured hexahedral meshes automatically into one single valid finite element mesh of hexahedral, tetrahedral and pyramid elements. In view {{of the success of}} merging arbitrary tetrahedral meshes in addressing the industrial need for rapid modification, update and manipulation of meshed objects, the merging algorithm is extended to hexahedral meshes by first dividing each hexahedral element into five or six tetrahedral elements. <b>Non-intersected</b> hexahedral elements can be easily recovered from the merged tetrahedral mesh as the constituent tetrahedra as a subdivision of the original hexahedral elements are intact and present in the mesh. Like the merging of tetrahedral meshes, the procedure is robust and efficient as all operations such as loops of intersection, incorporation of intersection segments, partition of boundary surfaces and identification of regions of intersection are deterministic and topological. The mesh merging algorithm provides a means to combine, modify and insert new features to existing hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. It is also a powerful tool to create new meshes from existing hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes through the Boolean operations. High-quality regular hexahedral elements of the original mesh generated by mapping or extrusion will be preserved, which is important for finite element analysis as hexahedral elements are sensitive to shape distortions. Examples with details for each step of the mesh merging process are presented to elucidate the main ideas of the algorithm. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{problem of}} image {{correspondence}} measure selection for image comparison and matching is addressed. Many practical applications require image matching "just by shape" with no {{dependence on the}} concrete intensity or color values. Most popular technique for image shape comparison utilizes the mutual information measure based on probabilistic reasoning and information theory background. Another approach was proposed by Pytiev (so called "Pytiev morphology") based on geometrical and algebraic reasoning. In this framework images are considered as piecewise-constant 2 D functions, tessellation of image frame by the set of <b>non-intersected</b> connected regions determines the "shape" of image and the projection of image on{{to the shape of}} other image is determined. Morphological image comparison is performed using the normalized morphological correlation coefficients. These coefficients estimate the closeness of one image to the shape of other image. Such image analysis technique can be characterized as an “"ntensity-to-geometry" matching. This paper generalizes the Pytiev morphological approach for obtaining the pure "geometry-to-geometry" matching techniques. The generalized intensity-geometrical correlation coefficient is proposed including the linear correlation coefficient and the square of Pytiev correlation coefficient as its partial cases. The morphological shape correlation coefficient is proposed based on the statistical averaging of images with the same shape. Centered morphological correlation coefficient is obtained under the condition of intensity centering of averaged images. Two types of symmetric geometrical normalized correlation coefficients are proposed for comparison of shape-tessellations. The technique for correlation and matching of shapes with ordered intensities is proposed with correlation measures invariant to monotonous intensity transformations. The quality of proposed geometrical correlation measures is experimentally estimated in the task of visual (TV) and infrared (IR) image matching. First experimental results demonstrate competitive quality and better computational performance relative to state-of-art mutual information measure...|$|R
