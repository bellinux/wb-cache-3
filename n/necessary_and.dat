5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E
5|$|After {{the family}} obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a funeral {{director}} (also {{known as an}} undertaker) who collects the body, embalms it if <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> delivers it to the wake. In addition, they {{have to decide whether}} the body is to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E

5|$|An ineffectual start {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that deeper structural changes were <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika, or restructuring. Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman {{can be kept}} as a pet, though {{providing}} suitable care {{is expensive}} and requires extremely large enclosures. In many countries, permits or licenses are <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> most veterinarians have little experience of these exotic animals.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the {{corporate}} {{administrator for the}} RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize {{the attacks on the}} Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E

60|$|While he was {{collecting}} a few <b>necessaries</b> <b>and</b> cramming {{them into}} his pockets, he never once ceased communing with himself in a low voice, or unclenched his teeth, which he had ground together on finishing Miss Brass's note.|$|R
5|$|If we were {{to regard}} Sirius and Procyon as double stars, the change of their motions would not {{surprise}} us; we should acknowledge them as <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> have only to investigate their amount by observation. But light is no real property of mass. The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing against the existence of numberless invisible ones.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Singh and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining Y chromosome was <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> sufficient to convert a female mouse to male. This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of Chromosomal translocation of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to X chromosomes causing sex reversal in mice. These findings later became {{the foundation for the}} discovery of a similar phenomenon of sex reversal in humans.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Bloom {{bought the}} {{locomotive}} outright. During 1993 it was moved temporarily to the East Lancashire Railway near Manchester and whilst there an exercise was undertaken to establish what repairs were <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> {{how much they}} would cost. It {{was found that the}} extensive list amounted to £162,000 and no business plan could be found that would support such expenditure.|$|E

5|$|In September 2016, {{the museum}} {{announced}} the final {{cost of the}} restoration as £4.5 million, having risen from a £4.2m estimate released in summer 2015 due to further work being <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> the need {{to meet the deadline}} for the return to service.|$|E
5|$|Koht's role in {{the weak}} and unorganised defense against Operation Weserübung was debated {{during and after the}} occupation. After the World War, a {{commission}} named Undersøkelseskommisjonen av 1945 ("Scrutiny Commission of 1945") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions. After receiving Undersøkelseskommisjonen analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an Impeachment trial. The Parliament of Norway did not find it <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> no such trial took place.|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
60|$|To {{make this}} part of the story short, we put on board the ship which we went in, a large {{quantity}} of good furniture for our house, with stores of linen <b>and</b> other <b>necessaries,</b> <b>and</b> a good cargo for sale, and away we went.|$|R

5|$|Subdivision rules give a {{sequence}} of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some sense to an analytic structure on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> sufficient conditions for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates {{into the}} next higher layer of the atmosphere - stratosphere. Aerosols in the stratosphere last years instead of weeks - so only a relatively smaller (though still large) amount of sulfate emissions would be <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> side effects would be less. This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into stratosphere, many of which have been proposed though none are known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the point}} at which {{explicit}} constitutional authority for the creation of federal crimes runs out. But the statute went on to define additional crimes: theft or falsification of court records, perjury, bribery of federal judges, interference with judicial process, and liberation of federal prisoners. All of these were plainly <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> proper to the operation of the federal courts; Marshall was to cite the perjury section as precedent for the existence of implicit powers in M'Culloch v. Maryland.|$|E

5|$|This {{philosophy}} of approaching {{the art of}} acting has stood not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting {{for much of the}} 20th century to this day. Mikhail Chekhov considered Ivanov a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career. From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that has become known as Chekhov's gun, a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.|$|E
