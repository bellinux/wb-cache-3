500|$|During {{his time}} in Congress, Gore was {{considered}} a [...] "moderate" [...] (he once referred to himself as a [...] "raging moderate") opposing federal funding of abortion, voting {{in favor of a}} bill which supported a moment in silence in schools, and voting against a ban on interstate sales of guns. In 1981, Gore was quoted as saying with regard to homosexuality, [...] "I think it is wrong", and [...] "I don't pretend to understand it, but it is not just another <b>normal</b> <b>optional</b> life style." [...] In his 1984 Senate race, Gore said when discussing homosexuality, [...] "I do not believe it is simply an acceptable alternative that society should affirm." [...] He also said that he would not take campaign funds from gay rights groups. Although he maintained a position against homosexuality and gay marriage in the 1980s, Gore said in 2008 that he thinks [...] "gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women...to join together in marriage." [...] His position as a moderate (and on policies related to that label) shifted later in life after he became Vice President and ran for president in 2000.|$|E

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract A {{study on the}} codominant scoring of AFLP markers in association panels without prior knowledge on genotype probabilities is described. Bands are scored codominantly by fitting normal mixture models to band intensities, illustrating and optimizing existing methodology, which employs the EM-algorithm. We study features that improve {{the performance of the}} algorithm, and the unmixing in general, like parameter initialization, restrictions on parameters, data transformation, and outlier removal. Parameter restrictions include equal component variances, equal or nearly equal distances between component means, and mixing probabilities according to Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium. Histogram visualization of band intensities with superimposed <b>normal</b> densities, and <b>optional</b> classification scores and other grouping information, assists further in the codominant scoring. We find empirical evidence favoring the square root transformation of the band intensity, as was found in segregating populations. Our approach provides posterior genotype probabilities for marker loci. These probabilities can form the basis for association mapping and are more useful than the standard scoring categories A, H, B, C, D. They {{can also be used to}} calculate predictors for additive and dominance effects. Diagnostics for data quality of AFLP markers are described: preference for three-component mixture model...|$|R
40|$|Conclusions: Prone {{positioning}} reveals promising {{results in}} improving the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Objective: To evaluate {{the effect of the}} prone position on OSA. Methods: Thirty-two patients with mild to severe OSA were included in the study. This was a two-night study to evaluate the effect of the prone position on OSA; a first night in a <b>normal</b> bed with <b>optional</b> positioning and a second night on a mattress and pillow facilitating prone positioning. Results: A total of 27 patients, 22 males and 5 females, {{with a mean age of}} 51 years, 15 patients with positional OSA (POSA) and 12 patients with non-POSA with a total median AHI of 23 (min 5, max 93) completed the study protocol. The median AHI decreased from 23 to 7 (p < 0. 001) and the median ODI from 21 to 6 (p < 0. 001). The median time spent in the supine position decreased from 142 to < 1 min (p < 0. 0001) and the median time in the prone position increased from < 1 to 330 min (p < 0. 0001). In all, 17 of 27 patients (63 %) were considered to be responders to prone positioning, 12 of 15 (80 %) with POSA and 5 of 12 (42 %) with non-POSA. Five patients did not complete the study protocol due to sleep time < 4 h...|$|R

Software has been developed in R, containing the models for normal mixtures with facilitating features, and visualizations. The methods are applied to an association panel in tomato, comprising 1, 175 polymorphic markers on 94 tomato hybrids, as part of a larger study within the Dutch Centre for BioSystems Genomics...|$|R
40|$|Otitis {{media with}} {{effusion}} (OME) {{in children and}} obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in adults are common conditions in medicine. Several surgical and non-surgical methods have been suggested for treatment of these diseases. However, to find an appropriate treatment option is a challenging task for the clinician and many patients {{do not have an}} optimal treatment for their disease. In this thesis two new non-invasive treatment options were developed and evaluated. Papers 1 and 2 deal with OME in children and papers 3 and 4 concern OSA in adults. Paper 1 deals with {{the development of a new}} device for autoinflation and evaluation of the effect on OME. In a pilot study, the effect of the new device on middle ear pressure was studied in 21 children with persistent OME. In the treatment group 83 % of the ears were considered to be responders compared to 30 % improvement in the control group during the follow up period. Paper 2 was a randomised controlled cross-over study evaluating the effect of the new method for autoinflation, with respect to middle ear pressure and hearing thresholds in 45 children with persistent OME awaiting grommet surgery. After four weeks of treatment the mean middle ear pressure and the mean hearing thresholds were improved by 166 daPa and 6 dB hearing level respectively compared to non-significant alterations in the control group. After the cross-over of the control group to treatment, equivalent improvements were achieved. After four weeks of treatment in both groups only four of the 45 included children were operated with grommet due to persistent disease. Both groups were followed up during additional 10 months whereby another five children were submitted to grommet surgery due to disease recurrence. Compliance was satisfactory with all the children performing the manoeuvre. Paper 3 concerns evaluation of the effect of the prone sleeping position on severity of disease in OSA with polysomnograpic (PSG) and polygraphic (PG) sleep studies. During the two-night study, first on a <b>normal</b> mattress with <b>optional</b> positioning and then on a mattress and pillow facilitating prone positioning, the median apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was reduced from 23 to 7 and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) from 21 to 6. This improvement was achieved by a reduction in the supine and an increase in the prone sleep time. Paper 4 was an evaluation of the four-week compliance and the effect of the mattress and pillow for prone positioning (MPP) on severity of disease in OSA patients evaluated by PSG. The mean AHI and ODI were reduced from 26 and 21 to 8 and 7 respectively with the MPP. This was achieved with no significant disruption of the sleep architecture and satisfactory compliance in the four-week study...|$|R
