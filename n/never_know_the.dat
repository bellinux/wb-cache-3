5|$|History may <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> true {{story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action {{report from the}} battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E
5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E

Globocnik boasts that Auschwitz and the other camps have been totally razed, and March will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth for certain. Kripo Chief Arthur Nebe stages a rescue, intending to track March as he meets with Maguire at their rendezvous in Waldshut-Tiengen on the Swiss/German border. March realises what is happening and heads for Auschwitz, leading the authorities in the wrong direction.|$|E

We will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> destinies and {{legacies}} these men would have chosen for themselves if they had been allowed to make that choice. But I know this: their existence, however brief and cruelly interrupted, is forever woven into the fabric of my own life. My son will continue to be raised in an environment of tolerance, understanding and humility, now with even more pertinence than before.|$|E
500|$|Eliot's Simeon appears {{similar to}} Dante's {{depiction}} of Virgil in the Divine Comedy, as [...] "the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot {{enter the world}} that he makes possible". Virgil, in the Divine Comedy, leads Dante through Hell (Inferno) and Purgatory (Purgatorio), but cannot guide him into Paradise (Paradiso). In this context, Virgil was a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God. [...] In Eliot's depiction, Simeon will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing [...] "the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy".|$|E

500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that I would <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." ...|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Henry asks Emma {{about his}} father. Emma tells Henry that {{his dad was}} a trainee fireman who used to {{frequent}} the diner where she worked. The two of them [...] "hung out" [...] a few times, resulting in Emma being pregnant with Henry {{before she went to}} jail. Once there, she tried to tell him about Henry, only to discover that he had died while saving a family from a burning building. However, she later admits to Mary the story she gave Henry was a lie and he should <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth about his father. After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with pumpkin pie to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about finding a place to stay. After referring him to Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she reminds Henry that he said no one else ever comes to or leaves Storybrooke and Henry replies that they don't.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Joshua Safran {{initially}} {{wanted a}} [...] "straightforward action show" [...] {{different from his}} past work, which included the soapy dramas Gossip Girl and Smash. He revealed {{that he wanted to}} do something with a law enforcement theme such as a political thriller about the NYPD after the September 11 attacks. He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with knowing that I would <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." [...] He called the series a sexy romance and a political thriller, adding [...] "It's like, what would Die Hard be if Die Hard was weekly and was also a soap".|$|E

2500|$|Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) John Reich {{immediately}} blamed IndyMac's {{failure on}} {{the release of}} the letter. Reich said Schumer gave the bank a [...] "heart attack" [...] and opined, [...] "Would the institution have failed without the deposit run? We'll <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> answer to that question."

2500|$|... "curiously unsatisfying. Much {{of it is}} an elegantly {{presented}} {{narrative of}} information already {{in the public domain}} about Soviet mischief-making during the cold war." [...] and the reviewers wonder [...] "how much more confusion was sown when a filleted selection of information about KGB operations in the West was published under Mitrokhin's name in 1999, the non-secret world will <b>never</b> <b>know.</b> <b>The</b> same applies to this second volume, which details Kremlin dirty tricks in the third world.

He could {{live to be}} 100 and he'll <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> meaning of, I am my brother's keeper." [...] Chandler's statements were called [...] "bitter and resentful" [...] by MacKay, whom Chandler criticized for supporting of the passage of Bill C-250, which amended the Criminal Code by adding sexual orientation as a protected category under the Code offences prohibiting advocating genocide and publicly inciting hatred. Chandler suggested that the amendment {{would lead to the}} banning of the Bible and other religious texts in schools and public libraries.|$|E
2500|$|During the ceremony, smoke bombs {{exploded}} {{on the streets}} near the cathedral and subsequently there were rifle shots that came from surrounding buildings, including the National Palace. Many people were killed by gunfire and in the stampede of people running away from the explosions and gunfire; official sources reported 31 overall casualties, while journalists recorded that between 30 and 50 died. Some witnesses claimed it was government security forces that threw bombs into the crowd, and army sharpshooters, dressed as civilians, that fired into the chaos from the balcony or roof of the National Palace. However, there are contradictory accounts as to {{the course of the}} events and [...] "probably, one will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth about the interrupted funeral." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following Ruby's March 1964 {{conviction}} for murder with malice, Ruby's lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, {{appealed to the}} Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby's lawyers argued {{that he could not}} have received a fair trial in Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. A year after his conviction, in March 1965, Ruby conducted a brief televised news conference in which he stated: [...] "Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> true facts of what occurred, my motives. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world."

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Ion Simuţ, Georgescu defined himself as [...] "an analyst", and his books as [...] "psycho-social analyses". Using the Marxist {{terminology}} of dialectical materialism, he argued: [...] "Destiny is the dialectical tension between temperament and the socio-historical structure." [...] Basing himself on an interpretation of French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, he also expressed his belief in [...] "literary relativism". In Georgescu's own metaphorical definition, which {{he claimed to have}} outlined for the benefit of his fellow critic Manolescu, good criticism is characterized by how [...] "structural obsessions" [...] and [...] "affixed ideas" [...] that helped it avoid being [...] "washed out into the Black Sea". He also saw a psychological benefit to writing: [...] " [...] defends us internally, provides us with internal force. Wise guys manage things easily, but let's not envy them: they shall <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> great joys we experience through work. They are all poor human beings." ...|$|E
2500|$|For three months, UN officials, the CDC, {{and others}} argued against {{investigating}} {{the source of}} the outbreak.

I cannot say one way or another [...] It is not something we are thinking about at the moment. What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti." [...] Jordan Tappero, the lead epidemiologist at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for {{the source of the}} bacteria and that [...] "we may <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> actual origin of this cholera strain."
