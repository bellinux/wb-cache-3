The Constitution Preparation Committee represented all the groupings within the assembly, and was tasked with drawing up proposals for the constitution to be debated by the plenary session.

25|$|The Sikh gurus {{established}} a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react {{as a community}} to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, {{was responsible for the}} creation of the concept of Akal Takht (throne of the timeless one), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the Harmandir Sahib. The Sarbat Ḵẖālsā (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Hola Mohalla and when there is a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A gurmatā (literally, guru's intention) is an order passed by the Sarbat Ḵẖālsā {{in the presence of the}} Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs. The term hukamnāmā (literally, edict or royal order) is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā. However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which is a given order to Sikhs.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the episode commenced when executive producer Russell T Davies received an email from his agent, telling him James Marsters was interested in appearing on the series. Chris Chibnall wrote the episode [...] "absolutely" [...] for Marsters, and wanted Hart to become a conflict for Jack Harkness. Marsters believed that Hart was somewhat of a doppelganger to Harkness. After scripting was complete, Marsters did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> with the directors because he felt the script was self-explanatory.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the group}} arrives in Pamplona, Jake and Bill take {{a fishing trip}} to the Irati River. As Harold Bloom points out, the scene serves as an {{interlude}} between the Paris and Pamplona sections, [...] "an oasis that exists outside linear time." [...] More importantly, on another level it reflects [...] "the mainstream of American fiction beginning with the Pilgrims seeking refuge from English oppression"—the prominent theme in American literature of escaping into the wilderness, as seen in Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, and Thoreau. Fiedler calls the theme [...] "The Sacred Land"; he thinks the American West is evoked in The Sun Also Rises by the Pyrenees and given a symbolic nod {{with the name of}} the [...] "Hotel Montana." [...] In Hemingway's writing, nature is a place of refuge and rebirth, according to Stoltzfus, where the hunter or fisherman gains a moment of transcendence at the moment the prey is killed. Nature is the place where men act without women: men fish, men hunt, men find redemption. [...] In nature Jake and Bill do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the war because their war experience, paradoxically, is ever-present. The nature scenes serve as counterpoint to the fiesta scenes.|$|E

Meanwhile, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was pulled from shelves by Rockstar Games after it became public knowledge that, {{with the use of}} a Gameshark cheating device, the scene could be unlocked portraying the protagonist having sex with another character, although in the scene both characters have their clothes on. The game was later sold without the unlockable scene.|$|E

2500|$|Tradition {{is one of}} the key {{concepts}} in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of [...] "tradition in traditional societies". There is however no [...] "theory of tradition", as for most anthropologists the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical). There are however dissenting views; scholars such as Pascal Boyer argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.|$|E
2500|$|According to Radford, the Bell Witch {{story is}} an {{important}} one for all paranormal researchers: [...] "It shows how easily legend and myth can be mistaken for fact and real events and how easily the lines are blurred" [...] when sources are not checked. [...] Dunning wrote that there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the supposed paranormal activity until there was evidence that the story was true. [...] "Vague stories indicate that there was a witch in the area. All the significant facts of the story have been falsified, and the others come from a source of dubious credibility. Since no reliable documentation of any actual events exists, there is nothing worth looking into." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{group also}} {{provoked}} response from within. Many {{said it was}} a good first step in creating awareness about global economic issues, and creating drama and emotion around political issues (particularly as contrasted with Harvard's Institute of Politics). Others said that it picked up on struggles that already had momentum—for example, HEI divestment, which was already being championed by the Student Labor Action Movement. They stressed the importance but also the difficulty of raising awareness about economic injustice at a school for the wealthy and privileged. Some felt that the process was dominated by graduate students, particularly in its [...] "2.0" [...] phase that focused on the libraries. Some participants were already familiar with consensus decision-making; others were new—to its pitfalls as well as to its advantages. One student criticized Occupy Harvard for being too cautious: [...] "Occupy Harvard is so different from the activism I’ve done in Oakland. In Oakland people don’t hesitate to strike, they don’t hesitate to do radical stuff. Here we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> every nuance before we act.

The action of the municipality, or of the state or province, or {{of the central government}} itself may be called into play. But in one form or another, the economic loss involved in illness and infirmity must be shifted from the shoulders of the individual to those of society at large. There was but little realization of this obligation in the nineteenth century. Only in the sensational moments of famine, flood or pestilence was a general social effort called forth. But in the clearer view of the social bond which the war has given us we can see that famine and pestilence are merely exaggerated forms of what is happening every day in our midst.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bellamy {{has many}} ingenious {{arrangements}} {{to meet the}} needs of people who want to be singers or actors or writers,--in other words, who do not want to work. They may sing or act as much as they like, provided that enough other people will hand over enough of their food cards to keep them going. But if no one wants to hear them sing or see them act they may starve,--just as they do now. Here the author harks back unconsciously to his nineteenth century individualism; he need not have done so; other socialist writers would have it that one of the everlasting boards would [...] "sit on" [...] every aspiring actor or author before he was allowed to begin. But we may take it either way. It is not the major point. There is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the question of how to deal with the artist under socialism. If the rest of it were all right, no one need worry about the artist. Perhaps he would do better without being remunerated at all. It is doubtful whether the huge commercial premium that greets success to-day does good or harm. But let it pass. It is immaterial to the present matter.|$|E
6000|$|We may omit {{here all}} {{discussion}} of the historical progress of socialism and the stages whereby it changed from the creed of a few theorists and revolutionists to being the accepted platform of great political parties, counting its adherents by the million. All of this belongs elsewhere. It suffices here to note that {{in the process of}} its rise it has chafed away much of the superfluous growth that clung to it and has become a purely economic doctrine. There is no longer any <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> in connection with it the justification of marriage and the family, and the rightness or wrongness of Christianity: no need to decide whether the materialistic theory of history is true or false, since nine socialists out of ten to-day have forgotten, or have never heard, what the materialistic theory of history is: no need to examine whether human history is, or is not, a mere record of class exploitation, since the controversy has long shifted to other grounds. The essential thing to-day is not the past, but the future. The question is, what does the socialist have to say about the conditions under which we live and the means that he advocates for the betterment of them? ...|$|E
