500|$|The {{lyrics of}} anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive {{meanings}} hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially {{as a consequence}} of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning. The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s. Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to [...] "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" [...] (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase [...] "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" [...] (Strydom, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, and you will be crushed). Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. [...] "Thina Sizwe" [...] included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while [...] "Senzeni Na" [...] (what have we done) achieved the same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times. Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors. The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who [...] "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach". Lyrics from this period included calls such as [...] "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," [...] and [...] "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".|$|E

2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility. [...] I would feel pity if Your Imperial Majesty followed your anger and not your credibility." [...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
