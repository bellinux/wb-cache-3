5|$|Brotherhood {{was made}} {{as part of}} a planned {{multimedia}} expansion of Final Fantasy XV without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> series of games. The series was conceived by Ofuji in 2014, based on his wish to expand upon an in-game reference to the difficult childhood of one of the characters. The story focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and was designed to give players glimpses into the personal lives and personalities of the characters that would not have fitted within the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> {{relationship with a}} primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A {{key part of the}} ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E
5|$|However, {{another major}} reason for rising costs was the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> {{separate}} variant for the photo-reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused too great a performance penalty. The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS (as the reconnaissance version was designated) resulted in only 36Mirage IIIS fighters and 18IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen. Twelve were allocated to a reconnaissance squadron, three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons. It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the multi-role capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine. The Mirage IIIS went into service in 1967, and the IIIRS in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Sir Tom Farmer {{took control}} of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> stadium that would meet the {{requirements}} of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.|$|E

[...] To this day, certain Greek alumni continue to contribute monetarily {{on a scale that}} dwarfs non-members: In the 1980s run-up to funding the Carlson School of Business, former Greek Curt Carlson discovered that he and fellow Greeks were responsible for what he estimated to be 67% of all donations received by the UM Foundation - this from a community whose undergraduate population had at the time been 3% of the school's population.

2500|$|Deng {{first used}} the term in 1979, to denote the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> {{material}} civilization {{as well as a}} spiritual civilization. Analyst Nicholas Dynon believes it may have been introduced to placate the conservatives within the Party, Deng's way of reassuring them that socialism was not be abandoned. [...] "Socialist civilization" [...] was to replace class struggle as the main engine of progress, a worldview seen as more harmonious and cooperative. [...] "Socialist Spiritual Civilization" [...] was launched in the early 1980s to protect the party from foreign, corruptive influences but also to protect the CPC's policy of reform and opening up. While the two terms, [...] "material" [...] and [...] "spiritual" [...] civilizations, were added to the party constitution at the 12th National Congress, the terms and their meanings were hotly debated. For instance, Zhao Yiya, the editor-in-chief of the Liberation Army Press, criticized Hua Yaobang's speech to the 12th National Congress, noting that both material and spiritual elements contained [...] "class character" [...] as well as cultural elements. Material civilization was less contested, and it maintained close links to the Marxist view of economic development and the mode of productions, and the view that the material is the basis of the superstructure. On this, Deng was a classical Marxist who believed that the material served as the basis; [...] "when people's material wealth progresses, their cultural aspects will rise as well [...] their spiritual aspects will change considerably". Under the banner of spiritual civilization, the CPC would promote patriotic spirit, collectivism and the four haves. By the mid-1980s, Deng became concerned that material civilization was getting more attention than spiritual civilization; he said [...] "the one is tough [...] while the other is soft [...]" [...] The 6th plenary meeting of the 12th Central Committee adopted the [...] "Resolutions on the guiding principles for developing a Socialist Spiritual Civilization" [...] under the slogan [...] "In grasping with two hands, both hands must be firm". Deng's Spiritual Civilization continued using much of the old Maoist vocabulary and slogans, such as [...] "five stresses, four goods and three loves", [...] "study Lei Feng" [...] and [...] "serve the people". However, in a radical break from the past, Deng ended the Maoist emphasis on antagonism and contradiction in Chinese socialist thought.|$|E
