40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{a study on the}} {{performance}} of direct-oversampling correlator-type receivers in chaos-based direct-sequence code division multiple access systems over frequency <b>non-selective</b> <b>fading</b> channels. At the input, the received signal is sampled at a sampling rate higher than the chip rate. This oversampling step is used to precisely determine the delayed-signal components from multipath fading channels, which can be combined together by a correlator for the sake of increasing the SNR at its output. The main advantage of using direct-oversampling correlator-type receivers is not only their low energy consumption due to their simple structure, but also their ability to exploit the <b>non-selective</b> <b>fading</b> characteristic of multipath channels to improve the overall system performance in scenarios with limited data speeds and low energy requirements, such as low-rate wireless personal area networks. Mathematical models in discrete-time domain for the conventional transmitting side with multiple access operation, the generalized non-selective Rayleigh fading channel, and the proposed receiver are provided and described. A rough theoretical bit-error-rate (BER) expression is first derived by means of Gaussian approximation. We then define the main component in the expression and build its probability mass function through numerical computation. The final BER estimation is carried out by integrating the rough expression over possible discrete values of the PFM. In order to validate our findings, PC simulation is performed and simulated performance is compared with the corresponding estimated one.

Numerical results show that: (i) The new pre-processing outperforms the traditional other two in terms of achievable sum-capacity.

40|$|In {{frequency}} <b>non-selective</b> <b>fading</b> channels the multipath components can {{arrive at}} the mobile receiver via a three dimensional (3 -D) scattering mechanism. That case occurs especially in urban environments, in which the tall buildings and other obstacles cause an arrival of multipath energy in the elevation plane, besides that arriving in the azimuth one. Another issue, which {{is a matter of}} investigation, is that the multipath energy may {{arrive at the}} mobile receiver in specific angular sectors. This is caused when a part of energy is blocked by the channel obstacles, or no multipath energy arrives from certain directions, due to lack of scattering objects in those directions, or directional antennas are employed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{a state-of-the-art}} bandwidth-efficient coded modulation technique, known as bit interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID), together with various diversity techniques to dramatically improve {{the performance of}} digital communication systems over wireless channels. For BICM-ID over a single-antenna frequency <b>non-selective</b> <b>fading</b> channel, the problem of mapping over multiple symbols, i. e., multi-dimensional (multi-D) mapping, with 8 -PSK constellation is investigated. An explicit algorithm to construct a good multi-D mapping of 8 -PSK to improve the asymptotic performance of BICM-ID systems is introduced. By comparing {{the performance of the}} proposed mapping with an unachievable lower bound, it is conjectured that the proposed mapping is the global optimal mapping. The superiority of the proposed mapping over the best conventional (1 -dimensional complex) mapping and the multi-D mapping found previously by computer search is thoroughly demonstrated. In addition to the mapping issue in single-antenna BICM-ID systems, the use of signal space diversity (SSD), also known as linear constellation precoding (LCP), is considered in BICM-ID over frequency <b>non-selective</b> <b>fading</b> channels. The performance analysis of BICM-ID and complex N-dimensional signal space diversity is carried out to study its performance limitation, the choice of the rotation matrix and the design of a low-complexity receiver. Based on the design criterion obtained from a tight error bound, the optimality of the rotation matrix is established. It is shown that using the class of optimal rotation matrices, the performance of BICM-ID systems over a frequency non-selective Rayleigh fading channel approaches that of the BICM-ID systems over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel when the dimension of the signal constellation increases. Furthermore, by exploiting the sigma mapping for any M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation, a very simple sub-optimal, yet effective iterative receiver structure suitable for signal constellations with large dimensions is proposed. Simulation results in various cases and conditions indicate that the proposed receiver can achieve the analytical performance bounds with low complexity. The application of BICM-ID with SSD is then extended to the case of cascaded Rayleigh fading, which is more suitable to model mobile-to-mobile communication channels. By deriving the error bound on the asymptotic performance, it is first illustrated that for a small modulation constellation, a cascaded Rayleigh fading causes a much more severe performance degradation than a conventional Rayleigh fading. However, BICM-ID employing SSD with a sufficiently large constellation can close the performance gap between the Rayleigh and cascaded Rayleigh fading channels, and their performance can closely approach that over an AWGN channel. In the next step, the use of SSD in BICM-ID over frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels employing a multi-carrier modulation technique known as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is studied. Under the assumption of correlated fading over subcarriers, a tight bound on the asymptotic error performance for the general case of applying SSD over all N subcarriers is derived and used to establish the best achievable asymptotic performance by SSD. It is then shown that precoding over subgroups of at least L subcarriers per group, where L is the number of channel taps, is sufficient to obtain this best asymptotic error performance, while significantly reducing the receiver complexity. The optimal joint subcarrier grouping and rotation matrix design is subsequently determined by solving the Vandermonde linear system. Illustrative examples show a good agreement between various analytical and simulation results. Further, by combining the ideas of multi-D mapping and subcarrier grouping, a novel power and bandwidth-efficient bit-interleaved coded modulation with OFDM and iterative decoding (BI-COFDM-ID) in which multi-D mapping is performed over a group of subcarriers for broadband transmission in a frequency selective fading environment is proposed. A tight bound on the asymptotic error performance is developed, which shows that subcarrier mapping and grouping have independent impacts on the overall error performance, and hence they can be independently optimized. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the optimal subcarrier mapping is similar to the optimal multi-D mapping for BICM-ID in frequency non-selective Rayleigh fading environment, whereas the optimal subcarrier grouping is the same with that of OFDM with SSD. Furthermore, analytical and simulation results show that the proposed system with the combined optimal subcarrier mapping and grouping can achieve the full channel diversity without using SSD and provide significant coding gains as compared to the previously studied BI-COFDM-ID with the same power, bandwidth and receiver complexity. Finally, the investigation is extended to the application of BICM-ID over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system equipped with multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver to exploit both time and spatial diversities, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel fading coefficients. The concentration is on the class of unitary constellation, due to its advantages in terms of both information-theoretic capacity and error probability. The tight error bound with respect to the asymptotic performance is also derived for any given unitary constellation and mapping rule. Design criteria regarding the choice of unitary constellation and mapping are then established. Furthermore, by using the unitary constellation obtained from orthogonal design with quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK or 4 -PSK) and 8 -PSK, two different mapping rules are proposed. The first mapping rule gives the most suitable mapping for systems that do not implement iterative processing, which is similar to a Gray mapping in coherent channels. The second mapping rule yields the best mapping for systems with iterative decoding. Analytical and simulation results show that with the proposed mappings of the unitary constellations obtained from orthogonal designs, the asymptotic error performance of the iterative systems can closely approach a lower bound which is applicable to any unitary constellation and mapping...|$|E
40|$|New {{approaches}} and algorithms are {{developed for the}} identification and estimation of low order models that represent multipath channel effects in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communication systems. Based on these parsimonious channel models, low complexity receivers such as RAKE receivers are considered to exploit these propagation effects and enhance the system performance. We consider the scenario where multipath is frequency selective slowly fading and where the channel components including delays and attenuation coefficients {{are assumed to be}} constant over one or few signalling intervals. We model the channel as a long FIR-like filter (or a tapped delay line filter) with the number of taps related to the ratio between the channel delay-spread and the chip duration. Due to the high data rate of new CDMA systems, the channel length in terms of the chip duration will be very large. With classical channel estimation techniques this will result in poor estimates of many of the channel parameters where most of them are zero leading to a reduction in the system performance. Unlike classical techniques which estimate directly the channel response given the number of taps or given an estimate of the channel length, the proposed techniques in this work will firstly identify the significant multipath parameters using model selection techniques, then estimate these identified parameters. Statistical tests are proposed {{to determine whether or not}} each individual parameter is significant. A low complexity RAKE receiver is then considered based on estimates of these identified parameters only. The level of significance with which we will make this assertion will be controlled based on statistical tests such as multiple hypothesis tests. Frequency and time domain based {{approaches and}} model selection techniques are proposed to achieve the above proposed objectives. The frequency domain approach for parsimonious channel estimation results in an efficient implementation of RAKE receivers in DS-CDMA systems. In this approach, we consider a training based strategy and estimate the channel delays and attenuation using the averaged periodogram and modified time delay estimation techniques. We then use model selection techniques such as the sphericity test and multiple hypotheses tests based on F-Statistics to identify the model order and select the significant channel paths. Simulations show that for a pre-defined level of significance, the proposed technique correctly identifies the significant channel parameters and the parsimonious RAKE receiver shows improved statistical as well as computational performance over classical methods. The time domain approach is based on the Bootstrap which is appropriate for the case when the distribution of the test statistics required by the multiple hypothesis tests is unknown. In this approach we also use short training data and model the channel response as an FIR filter with unknown length. Model parameters are then estimated using low complexity algorithms in the time domain. Based on these estimates, bootstrap based multiple hypotheses tests are applied to identify the non-zero coefficients of the FIR filter. Simulation results demonstrate the power of this technique for RAKE receivers in unknown noise environments. Finally we propose adaptive blind channel estimation algorithms for CDMA systems. Using only the spreading code of the user of interest and the received data sequence, four different adaptive blind estimation algorithms are proposed to estimate the impulse response of frequency selective and frequency <b>non-selective</b> <b>fading</b> channels. Also the idea is based on minimum variance receiver techniques. Tracking of a frequency selective varying fading channel is also considered. A blind based hierarchical MDL model selection method is also proposed to select non-zero parameters of the channel response. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform better than previously proposed algorithms. They have lower complexity and have a faster convergence rate. The proposed algorithms can also be applied to the design of adaptive blind channel estimation based RAKE receivers...|$|E

The first two diversity combining techniquesare widely used in communication systems, while Post Detection Selection Combining is a new technique. Previous analysis of the EGC and the SC techniques shows that the EGC technique has a better performance than the SC technique in a Rayleigh fadingchannel. In this thesis, the effecton {{the performance of a}} noncoherent DPSK receiver using the diversity combiningtechniques for Rician fading is examined. It is shown that the PDSC technique provides a performance that is better than the SC but worse than the EGC technique. The PDSC technique allows a relatively simple receiver structure independent of the number of diversity branches. [URL] Junior Grade, Turkish Nav...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel pilot-symbol-aided (PSA) {{technique}} is proposed for fading estimation {{in the land}} mobile satellite fading channels. The proposed technique combines the fading estimates obtained from a bandwidth-efficient technique and a conventional technique according to the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the fading estimates. To enhance the transmission quality, trellis-coded modulation (TCM) and diversity reception are employed in the system, and the combined estimates are subsequently used to correct the channel fading effects, to weight the signals from different diversity branches, and to provide channel state information of the Viterbi decoder. Monte Carlo computer simulation {{has been used to}} study the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed technique on trellis-coded 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation in the frequency <b>non-selective</b> Rician <b>fading</b> channels. Results have shown that the proposed PSA technique requires a very low bandwidth redundancy to provide satisfactory BER performance at low SNRs, and thus is suitable for use with TCM and diversity reception to achieve both bandwidth and power-efficient transmission. postprin...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that independent and identically distributed Gaussian inputs, scaled appropriately {{based on the}} Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), achieve capacity on the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel at all values of SNR. In this paper, we consider {{the question of whether}} such good input distributions exist for frequency <b>non-selective</b> Rayleigh <b>fading</b> channels, assuming that neither the transmitter nor the receiver has a priori knowledge of the fading coefficients. In this noncoherent regime, it is shown that, for a Gauss-Markov model of the fading channel, the Gaussian input distribution is one of a large class of input distributions that generate bounded mutual information as the SNR gets large. This motivates the search for better choices of fixed input distributions for high-rate transmission over rapidly varying channels. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for characterizing such distributions for the worst-case scenario of memoryless fading, using the criterion that the mutual information is unbounded as the SNR gets large. Examples of both discrete and continuous distributions that satisfy these conditions are given...|$|R
