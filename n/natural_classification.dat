Up to about 1650 CE plants had been grouped either alphabetically or according to utilitarian folk taxonomy – by their medicinal uses or whether they were trees, shrubs or herbs. Between 1650 and 1700 CE there was a move from the utilitarian back to a scientific <b>natural</b> <b>classification</b> based on the characters of the plants themselves.|$|E

500|$|The {{palaeontologist}} Philippe Taquet {{wrote that}} [...] "the Règne Animal {{was an attempt}} to create a complete inventory of the animal kingdom and to formulate a <b>natural</b> <b>classification</b> underpinned by the principles of the 'correlation of parts'.." [...] He adds that with the book [...] "Cuvier introduced clarity into natural history, accurately reproducing the actual ordering of animals." [...] Taquet further notes that while Cuvier rejected evolution, it was paradoxically [...] "the precision of his anatomical descriptions and the importance of his research on fossil bones", showing for instance that mammoths were extinct elephants, that enabled later naturalists including Darwin to argue convincingly that animals had evolved.|$|E
500|$|In {{an earlier}} attempt {{to improve the}} {{classification}} of animals, Cuvier transferred the concepts of Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu's (1748-1836) method of <b>natural</b> <b>classification,</b> which had been presented in 1789 in Genera plantarum, from botany to zoology. In 1795, from a [...] "fixist" [...] perspective (denying the possibility of evolution), Cuvier divided Linnaeus's two unsatisfactory classes ("insects" [...] and [...] "worms") into six classes of [...] "white-blooded animals" [...] or invertebrates: molluscs, crustaceans, insects and worms (differently understood), echinoderms and zoophytes. Cuvier divided the molluscs into three orders: cephalopods, gastropods and acephala. Still not satisfied, he continued to work on animal classification, culminating over twenty years later in the Règne Animal.|$|E

500|$|Italian {{physician}} Andrea Caesalpino (1519–1603) studied {{medicine and}} taught botany at the University of Pisa for about 40 years eventually becoming Director of the Botanic Garden of Pisa from 1554 to 1558. His sixteen-volume De Plantis (1583) described 1500 plants and his herbarium of 260 pages and 768 mounted specimens still remains. Caesalpino proposed classes {{based largely on}} the detailed structure of the flowers and fruit; [...] he also applied {{the concept of the}} genus. He was the first to try and derive principles of <b>natural</b> <b>classification</b> reflecting the overall similarities between plants and he produced a classification scheme well in advance of its day. Gaspard Bauhin (1560–1624) produced two influential publications [...] (1620) and [...] (1623). These brought order to the 6000 species now described and in the latter he used binomials and synonyms that may well have influenced Linnaeus's thinking. He also insisted that taxonomy should be based on natural affinities.|$|E
500|$|Above {{all it was}} Swedish Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) who {{eased the}} task of plant cataloguing. He adopted a sexual system of {{classification}} using stamens and pistils as important characters. Among his most important publications were Systema Naturae (1735), Genera Plantarum (1737), and Philosophia Botanica (1751) {{but it was in}} his Species Plantarum (1753) that he gave every species a binomial thus setting the path for the future accepted method of designating the names of all organisms. Linnaean thought and books dominated the world of taxonomy for nearly a century. His sexual system was later elaborated by Bernard de Jussieu (1699–1777) whose nephew Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu (1748–1836) extended it yet again to include about 100 orders (present-day families). Frenchman Michel Adanson (1727–1806) in his [...] (1763, 1764), apart from extending the current system of family names, emphasized that a <b>natural</b> <b>classification</b> must be based on a consideration of all characters, even though these may later be given different emphasis according to their diagnostic value for the particular plant group. Adanson's method has, in essence, been followed to this day.|$|E

2500|$|The {{literature}} on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the English language with Samuel Frederick Gray's A natural arrangement of British plants (1821). Gray used a combination of Linnaeus' sexual classification and Jussieu's <b>natural</b> <b>classification</b> to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. Within the grouping he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. He treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as Amaryllideae, Liliaceae, Asphodeleae and [...] Asparageae.|$|E

60|$|Since {{the common}} {{properties}} {{of a true}} Kind, and consequently the general assertions which can be made respecting it, or which are certain to be made hereafter as our knowledge extends, are indefinite and inexhaustible; and since the very first principle of <b>natural</b> <b>classification</b> is that of forming the classes so that the objects composing each may have {{the greatest number of}} properties in common; this principle prescribes that every such classification shall recognize and adopt into itself all distinctions of Kind, which exist among the objects it professes to classify.

60|$|My {{work on the}} Cirripedia possesses, I think, {{considerable}} value, as besides describing {{several new}} and remarkable forms, I made out the homologies of the various parts--I discovered the cementing apparatus, though I blundered dreadfully about the cement glands--and lastly I proved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to and parasitic on the hermaphrodites. This latter discovery has at last been fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to attribute the whole account to my fertile imagination. The Cirripedes form a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my work was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the 'Origin of Species' the principles of a <b>natural</b> <b>classification.</b> Nevertheless, I doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.|$|E
60|$|Some {{writers have}} objected to any extinct species, {{or group of}} species, being {{considered}} as intermediate between any two living species, or groups of species. If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms or groups, the objection is probably valid. But in a <b>natural</b> <b>classification</b> many fossil species certainly stand between living species, and some extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families. The most common case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be that, supposing them to be distinguished at the present day by a score of characters, the ancient members are separated by a somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two groups formerly made a somewhat nearer approach to each other than they now do.|$|E
