5|$|The rapid {{social changes}} during this period, {{especially}} the 1920s, {{led to the}} reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan in the urban centers of Texas, with their strongest presence in Dallas. As in other states, the new Klan was not outwardly focused on suppression of black civil rights, but instead supported traditional morality including opposition to bootlegging, gambling, and other vices that had grown during the period. Bigotry, though, was <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the group's agenda. During the Depression, anti-New Deal sentiments among some leaders, such as John Kirby, led to their becoming loosely associated with the Klan and its ideals.|$|E

25|$|Murdoch was <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> controversy. His {{omission}} as wicketkeeper in {{the very}} first Test resulted in Australia's premier fast bowler, Fred Spofforth, boycotting the match. In 1884 as captain of Australia he was involved in the players' strike, where the Australian players refused to play unless they received a greater share of the gate takings. He was also the batsman whose contentious run out caused friction between New South Wales and a visiting English team led by Lord Harris, which also caused a spectator riot.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} Asian tiger {{mosquitoes}} begins with destroying {{the places where}} they lay their eggs, which are <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> where people are being bitten, since they are weak fliers, with only about a 180-m (650-ft) lifetime flying radius. Puddles that last more than three days, sagging or plugged roof gutters, old tires holding water, litter, and any other possible containers or pools of standing water should be drained or removed. Bird baths, inlets to sewers and drainage systems holding stagnant water, flower pots, standing flower vases, knotholes, and other crevices that can collect water should be filled with sand or fine gravel to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs in them.|$|E

25|$|Controversy was <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> McEnroe, however; in his fourth-round {{match against}} Mikael Pernfors at the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was {{ejected from the}} tournament for {{swearing}} at the umpire, supervisor, and referee. He was warned by the umpire for intimidating a lineswoman, and then docked a point for smashing a racket. McEnroe was apparently unaware that a new Code of Conduct, which had been introduced just before the tournament, meant that a third code violation would not lead to the deduction of a game but instead would result in immediate disqualification; therefore, when McEnroe unleashed a volley of abuse at umpire Gerry Armstrong, he was defaulted. He was fined $6,500 for the incidents.|$|E
25|$|As Secretary of State for Employment, she {{was also}} {{appointed}} First Secretary of State by Wilson, bringing her firmly {{into the heart of}} government. She was <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> controversy which reached a fever pitch when the trade unions rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her 1969 white paper, 'In Place of Strife'. This also involved a major cabinet split, with threatened resignations, hot tempers and her future nemesis James Callaghan breaking ranks to publicly try to undermine the bill. The whole episode alienated her from many of her friends on the left, with the Tribune newspaper railing very hard against the bill, which they held to be attacking the workers without attacking the bosses. The split is often said to be partly responsible for Labour's defeat at the 1970 general election. The eventual deal with the unions dropped most of the contentious clauses.|$|E
500|$|Critics did {{not receive}} Eternal Pyre very well, with few {{professionals}} actually reviewing the album. The Pitch criticized {{the price of the}} extended play at 5.99, stating in comparison it makes iTunes a bargain. The Pitch's reviewer also said that [...] "Slayer's worst is <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> its best, and this cut's in the middle." [...] The extended play was, however, generally well received by fans, despite having a limited number of copies available. Eternal Pyre debuted at number forty-eight on the Swedish charts, and number two on the Finnish charts. With a limited pressing of 1,000 copies, the EP was exclusively made available in Hot Topic stores starting on June 6, and was later made available in Europe on June 23.|$|E

Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual human beings can {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E
500|$|In the Himalayas, it is {{strongly}} associated with terrace cultivation, and it probably only spread to the Himalayas when these agricultural practices arrived 3000 to 4000 years ago. In towns where it occurs alongside the house or tree sparrow, it is found in gardens and less built up areas. In those hill stations in India where {{both the house and}} the russet sparrow occur, the house sparrow breeds around more-built up areas and bazaars, whereas the russet sparrow is [...] "rather more up market at the larger houses with gardens and open spaces". In towns where it is the only sparrow, it is not dependent on trees, breeding around houses and eating scraps in streets. In the winter, migratory birds occur in open cultivated land and riverine grasslands, but are <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> shrubs or trees.|$|E

2500|$|The {{expedition}} {{was plagued}} by poor planning, bad luck and unreliable allies. The expected assistance from the local fur trading companies and native peoples was less forthcoming than expected, and the dysfunctional supply line, coupled with unusually harsh weather and the resulting absence of game, meant that the explorers were <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> starvation. Eventually the Arctic coast was reached, but barely [...] had been explored before the exhaustion of the party's supplies and the onset of winter forced them to turn back.|$|E
2500|$|Applying for a U.S. Patent {{on their}} flying machine was <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the Wrights’ minds. [...] Their {{first attempt to}} get a patent on their {{invention}} failed, largely because they wrote the patent application themselves. Also contributing to its demise was their inability to demonstrate a “practical flying machine.” [...] At that time, the U.S. Patent Office had begun to receive a flood of patent applications for aerial craft of all descriptions, real and imagined, and had adopted a policy of only approving applications for inventions involving flying machines if the benchmark of “practicality” could be met and demonstrated. [...] The practicality benchmark has long since been discarded by the U.S. Patent Office as being unworkable.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} 1878 season, two matches {{were played}} by a Somerset team; a two-day match against Hertfordshire played at St Albans finished in a draw, while Worcestershire were beaten by an innings and 47 runs later in the month at Bath. [...] In 1879, Somerset played nine matches, albeit one of them against a Wells team. [...] During these early seasons, Somerset were <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> insolvency. An initial letter sent out after {{the formation of the}} club had only managed to raise £70 17s, while gate receipts in the first season raised the club £1 15s 8d. Despite this, fixtures continued to be arranged, and the amateurs kept on playing; bringing their own kit and paying for their own tickets for travel to away matches.|$|E
2500|$|The Concert Singer {{has been}} {{interpreted}} {{as a tribute to}} the poet Walt Whitman, who was warmly admired by both Eakins and Cook, and who was in his final illness at the time the painting was made. Eakins had met the poet in 1887, and completed a portrait of him the following year. Weda Cook had set some of Whitman's poems to music, and often performed for him. [...] "O rest in the Lord" [...] was a particular favorite of the poet, who asked Cook to sing it for him every time they met. Whitman was <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the thoughts of artist and model as the work progressed; Cook later recalled that Eakins quoted verses from Whitman while she posed.|$|E
2500|$|Apologists for the {{practice}} of mistresses referred to {{the practice}} in the ancient Near East of keeping a concubine; they frequently quoted verses from the Old Testament to show that mistress-keeping was an ancient practice that was, if not acceptable, at least understandable. John Dryden, in Annus Mirabilis, suggested that the king's keeping of mistresses and production of bastards was a result of his abundance of generosity and spirit. In its more sinister form, the theme of being [...] "kept" [...] is <b>never</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the surface in novels about women as victims in the 18th century in England, whether in the novels of Eliza Haywood or Samuel Richardson (whose heroines in Pamela and Clarissa are both put in a position of being threatened with sexual degradation and being reduced to the status of a kept object).|$|E
