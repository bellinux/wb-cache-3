40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} develop a system approach nutrient management package for advance kar season rice based cropping system in Tambaraparani command area. The nutrient treatments were imposed only to rice crops and no manure/fertiliser applied to rice fallow blackgram. The nutrient management packages adapted to advance kar season rice consisted of green manure alone, 100 % NPK with and without green manuring along with control. In pishanam season rice, various graded level of fertiliser treatments were adapted. Application of green manure along with recommended NPK recorded higher grain yield and yield attributes of advance kar season rice. The residual effect of integrated nutrient treatments adopted to advance kar rice increased the grain yield and yield attributes of rice fallow blackgram. Combined application of green manure and 100 % <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to advance kar season rice, raising rice fallow blackgram preceding to pishanam season rice and application of 100 % <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to pishanam season rice recorded higher yield and yield attributes, which was on par with 75 % recommended NPK to pishanam season rice, which recorded higher benefit: cost ratio...|$|E

All treatments were applied as single or combined inoculants, under nursery and field conditions, in a completely randomised design. The biofertilisers were applied to the roots by coating or dipping, with the inoculants in a solid or liquid support, respectively. At 30 days after inoculation, populations of 2. 5 × 106 to 1. 3 × 106 cfu g soil− 1 of A. brasilense and 10. 3 × 105 to 2. 6 × 105 of A. chroococcum were detected in the rhizosphere of the crop. The prevalence of colonisation of plants inoculated with AMF ranged from 35 to 57 %, with the greatest values recorded for the treatment involving single biofertilisation by root coating. In the nursery phase, single biofertilisation promoted a higher growth and nutrient content in the crop than combined biofertilisation. However, in the field phase the combined biofertilisation increased the nutrient content of the plant leaves, which was significantly greater than observed in the NPK treatment. The highest yields were recorded for the treatments involving a single inoculation of A. chroococcum and for those with the multi-strain of AMF, with average values of 2. 5 and 2. 3 kg plant− 1 respectively, compared with 1. 0 kg plant− 1 obtained with the treatment in which <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> was applied...|$|E

40|$|Declining {{soil quality}} is commonplace {{throughout}} Southern Asia and sustainable strategies {{are required to}} reverse this trend to ensure food security for future generations. One potential solution to halt this decline is the implementation of integrated nutrient management whereby inorganic fertilisers are added together with organic wastes. These organic materials, however, are often quickly broken down in soil and provide only a transitory improvement in soil quality. Biochar, which can potentially persist in soil for centuries, may offer a more permanent solution to this problem. To address this, we undertook a 2 -year field trial to investigate the interactions between conventional <b>NPK</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> farmyard manure (FYM) and biochar in a maize cropping system. Biochar application to the nutrient poor soil increased maize yields after year one by approximately 20 % although the yield increase was lower {{in the second year}} (ca. 12. 5 %). Overall, there was little difference in grain yield between the 25 t ha- 1 and the 50 t ha- 1 biochar treatments. In terms of soil quality, biochar addition increased levels of soil organic carbon, inorganic N, P and base cations and had no detrimental impact on pH and salinity in this calcareous soil. Overall, this field trial demonstrated the potential of biochar to induce short-term benefits in crop yield and soil quality in maize cropping systems although the long-term benefits remain to be quantified. From a management perspective, we also highlight potential conflicts in biochar availability and use, which may limit its adoption by small scale farming systems typical of Southern Asia...|$|R
30|$|From {{the current}} field experiment, it is {{observed}} that magnesium sulphate blended with NPK can serve as an alternative to sole NPK amendment to decrease methane emission significantly in the flooded rice paddy soil at 0.5  t/ha application level. The present study demonstrates that the application of leaves of neem-mixed NPK, tea leaves mixed with NPK and karanj-mixed NPK in rainfed rice fields is the key in promoting physical attributes of soil quality as well as yield in agricultural systems in comparison with the exclusive application of inorganic <b>fertiliser</b> <b>NPK.</b> It is suggested that the rice productivity can be improved with significant increase in soil organic matter without intensifying methane emission when fresh leaves of karanj at 1  t/ha blended with NPK are applied on the rainfed rice fields in an acidic soil before transplantation.

40|$|Fruit and {{vegetable}} farming generally involves {{high levels of}} chemical inputs {{despite the fact that}} consumers are increasingly concerned about the sanitary and organoleptic aspects of fruit quality. Pineapple is largely subject to these issues since it is dominated by conventional monocropping with high levels of agrochemical inputs due to nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) fertilisation, weed management, crop protection and flowering induction. However, low-input pineapple cropping systems are both rare and little documented. Our study aimed at replacing {{all or part of the}} chemical fertilisers used with local organic fertilisers. It was conducted on the cultivar 'Queen Victoria', without pesticides or herbicides, in Reunion Island. We compared the impacts of three fertilisation treatments on pineapple growth and yield, fruit quality traits, symptoms of two major fungal diseases in fruit and production costs and labour times: (i) conventional: <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> at recommended doses (265. 5 kg ha− 1 N– 10. 53 kg ha− 1 P– 445. 71 kg ha− 1 K); (ii) integrated: Mucuna pruriens green manure (240. 03 kg ha− 1 N, 18. 62 kg ha− 1 P, 136. 11 kg ha− 1 K) incorporated into the soil and a half-dose of <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and (iii) organic: M. pruriens green manure incorporated into the soil and foliar applications of sugarcane vinasse from a local distillery, rich in K (14. 44 g L− 1). Our results showed that NPK fertilisation could be replaced by organic fertilisers as well as by integrated fertilisation. 'D'-leaf analysis showed that vinasse supplies a largely sufficient K level for growing pineapples. With organic fertilisation, pineapple growth was slower, 199 days after planting vs. 149 days for integrated or conventional fertilisations, and fruit yield was lower, 47. 25 t ha− 1 vs. 52. 51 and 61. 24 t ha− 1, probably because M. pruriens green manure provided an early increase in soil mineral N, whereas N requirements are much higher four months after planting. However, the fruit weight (709. 94 ± 123. 53 g) was still within the size range required for the export market (600 – 900 g). Interestingly, organic fertilisation significantly reduced Leathery Pocket disease and produced the best quality fruit with the highest total soluble solids contents (TSS) and the lowest titratable acidity (TTA). Fruit quality was also significantly improved with integrated fertilisation, with fruit weight similar to that of conventional fertilisation. To conclude, these findings have implications for the sustainability of pineapple production and could lead to low-input innovative cropping systems that reduce production costs and develop local organic inputs.

Two-year experiments investigated the effects of three <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> levels (N 50, 100, 125 / 150 kg/ha), with and without irrigation, on yield, advancement of maturity, storage losses and shelf life. High fertilisation advanced maturity but irrigation had no effect. High fertilisation increased yield only in 1996 (5 B 7 %), but irrigation increased the yield noticeably: by 33. 5 % in 1995 and 8. 5 % in 1996. There was no interaction between fertilisation and irrigation. The low fertilisation optimum is attributed to the mineralisation of soil nitrogen, as the soil was rich in organic matter. At the low fertilisation level, plants took up twice as much nitrogen as present in the fertiliser, and with increased fertilisation the nitrogen uptake increased markedly. The foliage nitrogen content was low, evidently {{as a result of}} late harvesting. Treatments had only a minor effect on the storage performance and shelf life of onions.

40|$|Returning {{waste to}} {{agricultural}} land is a holistic systems approach {{to meet the}} challenging task of future food supply. As nutrient contents in organic material often are unbalanced {{in comparison to the}} plants’ needs, the aim of this paper was to study the fertilisation effect of waste-based NPK compound fertiliser products and their potential to substitute conventional fertilisers in agricultural plant production. A pot experiment with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. italicum) as experimental crop was conducted where the four N-rich waste resources meat and bone meal (MBM), composted fish sludge (CFS) and two types of industrial compost (Dynea 2009 and Dynea 2004) were tested alone and in combination with K-rich bottom wood ash (BWA). Fertilisation levels (150 kg N ha- 1 + 120 kg K ha- 1; 300 kg N ha- 1 + 240 kg K ha- 1) were based on total N and K content in Nrich waste and BWA, respectively. Treatments with BWA, artificial compound fertiliser (minNPK) and calcium nitrate (minN) only, as well as an unfertilised control were used as references. Availability of mineral N was the key limiting factor to plant growth. Mineral fertiliser treatments resulted in the highest total yields being significantly different from all waste combinations Plants that received MBM or CFS fertilisation had good and even biomass production throughout the season, but fertilisation effects were limited by mineralised N. Mineral fertiliser equivalents of MBM and CFS treatments were between 48 - 73 %. MBM treatments increased the amount of soluble P in plant-soil systems to amounts that were higher than total P applied with the fertiliser product. MBM might therefore be a more valuable alternative P-fertiliser than one assumed so far. CFS seems to be more appropriate as an ingredient in alternative <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> products than MBM because of reduced effects on residual P in the soil, good availability of P in the material, as well as a wider N:P ratio and relatively high initial amounts of mineral N. Dynea composts had poor fertilisation effects and can therefore rather be classified as soil conditioners than as fertilisers. K fertilisation effect of BWA was hidden by sufficient K supply from the soil but K-AL values of soils that were fertilised with BWA were significantly higher than soils of unfertilised control treatments. MinN + BWA treatments had poor establishment due to local pH increase and initial P deficiency, but leaching or denitrification of NO 3 -N was avoided so that the treatments still resulted in vigorous plant growth {{towards the end of the}} season.

A recent technique was proposed by United Utilities plc {{for the production}} of organomineral fertilisers (OMF) from biosolids granules which adds additional nitrogen to the biosolids’ nutrients to form a balanced <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> The aim of this research was to determine the effects in cereal and grass crops of using organomineral fertilisers (OMF) made from nutrients-enriched biosolids granules and to contribute towards the understanding of nutrient management and dynamics in agricultural systems. The research included soil incubation, glasshouse, lysimeters and field studies which used winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). A theoretical model was developed for fertiliser particle distribution studies which required the determination of key physical properties of the products. Two OMF formulations have been suggested: OMF 10 and OMF 15 which have the following NPK compositions: 10 : 4 : 4 and 15 : 4 : 4 respectively. These were suggested for use in grassland as well as arable cropping. The particle trajectory model showed that the particle size range for OMF 10 and OMF 15 should be between 1. 10 and 5. 50 mm and between 1. 05 and 5. 30 mm in diameter respectively. Cont/d.

40|$|Chive is a {{perennial}} herb, growing also natural in Finland. Commercial {{production of the}} herb is very small in our country, but large amounts of chive are imported. This fact has aroused interest in investigating the opportunities of producing chive using modern cultivation techniques. Effects of cultivar, plastic mulch as ground cover and fertilisation on yield were studied in field experiments over three years. In the experiments, the most productive cultivars or populations (a Finnish population “Hankoniemi”, a Dutch population “Tavallinen” and a German cultivar ‘Grolau’) produced 10 – 20 % higher yields than the less productive cultivars. There were no clear differences in the yield quality between the cultivars. Black plastic mulch was effective in increasing yield, controlling weeds and maintaining soil moisture. For fertilisation, the experiments revealed the high nutrient demand of chive. After the basic soil fertilisation, weekly fertigation with a <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> at a higher nitrogen dose (10 - 15 kg ha - 1 N per week) resulted in higher biomass production than fertigation with nitrogen alone and/or a half nitrogen dose. In the years following the planting, the annual uptakes in yield were 185 - 200 kg ha - 1 for nitrogen, 17 - 20 kg ha - 1 for phosphorus, and 120 - 140 kg ha - 1 for potassium in the most intensively fertilised treatment producing the highest yield. The results show that chive is feasible for commercial production with modern cultivation techniques...|$|E

Soil management history was established with a single application of LaBC® (50 [*]t[*]ha− 1 wet weight equivalent) with or without inorganic <b>fertiliser</b> (<b>NPK)</b> prior to growing annual ryegrass for 5 cycles. In cycle 6 there was no residual nutrient effect of the original application of LaBC® {{but there was a}} residual liming effect of the previously applied LaBC®. A nutrient effect of reapplied LaBC® in plant growth cycle 6, had little residual benefit in cycle 7.

Kohlrabi samples (GIGANT hybride) for the analysis have been taken from an experimental field established in Mosnita, near Timisoara. In the experimental field to kohlrabi have been administrated three doses of synthetic <b>fertilisers</b> <b>NPK</b> N 0 P 0 K 0 N 30 P 30 K 30, (200 kg/ha NPK) N 60 P 60 K 60 (400 kg/ha NPK) and N 120 P 60 K 60 (400 kg/ha NPK + 180 kg/ha ammonium nitrogen) and one dose of organic fertilisers (organic compost - 30 t/ha). The nitrate and nitrite content in kohlrabi was done from aqueous solution after spectrophotometric detection using the rapid tests AQUA MERCK and the Spectrophotometer SQ 118 at a wavelength of 515 and 525 nm for nitrate and nitrites. The experimental {{results show that the}} nitrate content, in samples taken from the Timis County we registered values above maximum limit allowed for kohlrabi. The highest nitrate content (2180 ppm) was registered to variant V 4 where the used mineral fertiliser dose was N 120 P 60 K 60.

40|$|Nutrient {{status in}} soil {{is crucial for}} the growth and {{development}} of plants which indirectly or directly affect the ecophysiological functions of resident soil microorganisms. Soil methanogens and methanotrophs can be affected by soil nutrient availabilities and plant growth, which in turn modulate methane (CH 4) emissions. Here, we assessed whether deficits in soil-available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) modulated the activities of methanogens and methanotrophs in a long-term (20  year) experimental system involving limitation in either one or both nutrients. Results showed that {{a large amount of}} CH 4 was emitted from paddy soil at rice tillering stage (flooding) while CH 4 flux was minimum at ripening stage (drying). Compared to soils amended with <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatment, the soils without P input significantly reduced methane flux rates, whereas those without K input did not. Under P limitation, methanotroph transcript copy number significantly increased in tandem with a decrease in methanogen transcript abundance, suggesting that P-deficiency-induced changes in soil physio-chemical properties, in tandem with rice plant growth, might constrain the activity of methanogens, whereas the methanotrophs might be adaptive to this soil environment. In contrast, lower transcript abundance of both methanogen and methanotrophs were observed in K-deficient soils. Assessments of community structures based upon transcripts indicated that soils deficient in P induced greater shifts in the active methanotrophic community than K-deficient soils, while similar community structures of active methanogens were observed in both treatments. These results suggested that the population dynamics of methanogens and methanotrophs could vary along with the changes in plant growth states and soil properties induced by nutrient deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Potato {{crops are}} {{susceptible}} to various insect pests including the aphid Myzus persicae (Hemiptera, Aphididae) and the beetle Diabrotica speciosa (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae). Induced resistance through silicon treatment of plants represents a potential strategy in pest management. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effects of silicic acid on the development, productivity and level of infestation by beetles and aphids following foliar application to potato plants cultivated in the presence of organic compost or chemical fertiliser. Four experimental groups were studied, namely, plants cultivated in soil supplied with organic compost (30 t/ha) and either treated or non-treated with 0. 5 % silicic acid, and plants cultivated in soil supplied with <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (4 : 14 : 8; 4 t/ha) and either treated or non-treated with 0. 5 % silicic acid. The number of aphids and beetles detected on the leaves and the number of lesions caused by the beetles were evaluated. The height and the stem diameter of the plants were determined 60 days after the emergence and the productivity was determined 95 days after the planting of the seed potatoes. The results demonstrated that there were no interactions between silicic acid treatment and way of cultivation. Moreover, the incidence of beetles and aphids was not influenced by weekly application of silicon, and neither were the development and the productivity of plants. Although the development and productivity of organically cultivated plants were inferior to those grown in the presence of chemical fertiliser, plants cultivated on organic compost were less susceptible to attack by beetles...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant saucers are an {{important}} larval habitat for Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus in peridomestic situations. Because NPK fertilisers inplant containers tend to enhance the oviposition of these species, we investigated the effects of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis, spinosad, pyriproxyfen and diflubenzuron larvicides in combination with fertiliser on the adult emergence and fecundity of the mosquitoes coming from plant saucers in controlled greenhouse experiments. NPK + larvicide (NPK-LAV) treatments were tested on Ae. aegypti. Each treatment was compared with water and with fertiliser alone on {{a total of five}} houseplants and their saucers. The fertilising treatment was renewed every 30 - 45 days. RESULTS: With less than 5 % imaginal emergence, the NPK + spinosad 0. 5 % treatment remained effective for 30 days. Both NPK + pyriproxyfen 0. 1 % and NPK + diflubenzuron 0. 25 % were effective for 45 days. The average number of eggs laid in the three treatments was similar to the NPK treatment, indicating that spinosad, pyriproxyfen and diflubenzuron did not alter the attraction effect of the fertiliser on egg laying. NPK + pyriproxyfen and NPK + diflubenzuron also had ovicidal activity and {{an important}} impact on the fecundity of the Ae. aegypti female imagos and the fertility of their eggs. CONCLUSION: The addition of <b>NPK</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to insecticides can increase larval control of Aedes mosquitoes. This innovative measure for personal protection, which is harmless for both humans and animals, would be an additional support for the community-based actions led by the institutional services for vector control...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensive}} {{use of chemicals}} worked as a catalyst to shift the production frontier but the most critical factor of maintaining a clean environment was totally ignored. The present study attempts to estimate the environmental efficiency of rice production by employing the translog stochastic production frontier approach. The data are collected from five major Basmati rice growing districts (Gujranwala, Sheikupura, Sialkot, Hafizabad, and Jhang) of Punjab in 2006. Chemical weedicides and nitrogen are treated as environmentally detrimental inputs. The mean technical efficiency index is sufficiently high (89 percent) but the environmental efficiency index of chemical weedicides alone is 14 percent while the joint environmental efficiency index of chemical weedicides and nitrogen is 24 percent implying that joint environmental efficiency is higher than chemical weedicide alone. It indicates that substantial reduction (86 percent) in chemical weedicide use is possible with higher level of productivity. Moreover, {{it is likely to}} contribute a considerable decrease in environmental pollution which is expected to enhance the performance of agriculture labour. The reduction in chemical weedicides will save Rs 297 per acre and Rs 1307. 3 million over all from the rice crop in Punjab, improving the profitability of rice growing farmers by the same proportion. Empirical analysis indicates that reduction in environmental pollution together with higher level of profitability in rice production is achievable.

40|$|The {{history of}} tea {{development}} in Tanzania {{from the early}} part of this century to the present is summarised. Average yields of made tea from well managed estates in the Mufindi district have increased from around 600 kg ha- 1 in the late 1950 s to 3000 kg ha- 1 at the present time: by comparison, yields from smallholder farms have remained much lower, averaging only 400 - 500 kg ha- 1. There have been a large number of technical, economic and other changes over the last 30 to 40 years. The removal of shade trees, the use of herbicides, the application of <b>NPK</b> compound <b>fertilisers,</b> the introduction of irrigation (on some estates) and changes in harvesting policy have all contributed to the increases in yield. Financial and infrastructural problems have contributed to the low yields from many smallholders and others, and have limited the uptake of new technology. The contribution of research is reviewed, from the start of the Tea Research Institute of East Africa in Kenya in 1951, through to the development of the Marikitanda Tea Research Centre in Amani in 1967; the Ngwazi Tea Research Unit in Mufindi (1967 to 1970, and from 1986), and lastly the Kifyulilo Tea Research Station, also in Mufindi in 1986. The yield potential of well fertilized and irrigated clonal tea, grown at an altitude of 1800 m, is around 6000 kg ha- 1. This potential is reduced by drought, lack of fertilizer, bush vacancies and inefficient harvesting practices. The corresponding potential yields at high (2200 m) and low (1200 m) altitude sites range from 3000 - 3500 kg ha- 1 up to 9000 - 10000 kg ha- 1 and are largely a function of temperature. The opportunities for increasing yields of existing tea, smallholder and estate, are enormous. Tea production in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania is about to expand rapidly. Good, appropriate research is needed to sustain this development over the long term, and suggestions on how best this is done in order to assist the large scale producers as well as the smallholders, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Soil is the {{fundamental}} element in agriculture and is affected {{in a variety of}} ways. Besides other things, the long-term application of mineral and organic fertilisers can significantly influence the topsoil pool of nutrients, organic carbon content and pH. Within the scope of longterm field experiments in Praha-Ruzyně, we evaluated the effect of six fertiliser treatments - unfertilised Control, farmyard manure (FYM), cattle slurry (CAT), cattle slurry amended with straw from previous cereals (CAT+STR), mineral <b>fertiliser</b> (<b>NPK)</b> and NPK amended with FYM (NPK+FYM) on a topsoil pool of nutrient content, organic carbon content (Cox) and pH between the years 2001 and 2012. In the selected period, the fertiliser treatment did not influence the N and Cox content (ranging from 0. 126 % to 0. 143 %). Phosphorus and potassium were significantly higher in the NPK+FYM treatment (109. 82 and 279. 27 mg/kg, respectively), while calcium and magnesium were significantly lower in the NPK treatment (2, 973 and 134. 95 mg/kg, respectively). Application of mineral fertilisers significantly decreased the value of pH, influencing the Ca and Mg topsoil concentrations. Organic fertilisers cannot provide a sustainable amount of nutrients to generate high yields in a short time, but release their nutrients slowly and the range of nutrients is wider. Mineral fertilisers, if not amended with organic fertilisers, can provide huge doses of nutrients, which can be quickly reused for high yields, but negatively influence the pH value, resulting in a decrease in the pool of Ca and Mg...|$|R
