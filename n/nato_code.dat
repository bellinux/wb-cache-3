5|$|Field Marshal {{has been}} the highest rank in the British Army since 1736. A five-star rank with <b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> OF-10, it is {{equivalent}} to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force (RAF). A Field Marshal's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward's Crown. Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life, though on half-pay when not in an appointment. The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries (when all former holders of the rank were deceased). After the Second World War, it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (later renamed Chief of the General Staff) to the rank on his last day in the post. Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of all the British Armed Forces, were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment.|$|E
25|$|T-72AK (Ob'yekt 176K): Command {{version of}} T-72A. In <b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> T-72AK was {{represented}} by three different designations: T-72AK1, T-72AK2 and T-72AK3 which represented the company command version, battalion command version and regiment command version.|$|E
25|$|One of the Dunay radar (<b>NATO</b> <b>Code</b> : Dog House) {{phased array}} radar systems was located at Naro-Fominsk. This system is {{comparable}} to the US's PAVE PAWS radars of the Sentinel and Safeguard ABM programs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>NATO</b> rank <b>code</b> is OF-2.|$|R
50|$|As the {{structure}} of Polish rank names substantially differs from the English one, it seems more appropriate to give the U.S. or U.K. equivalent ranks, based on the common <b>NATO</b> <b>codes,</b> rather than to provide a literal translation {{which can lead to}} numerous misinterpretations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>NATO</b> rank <b>code</b> is OF-1 (junior).|$|R
25|$|Radar {{systems were}} tested with Duna-3 single {{direction}} search radar and the Dunay-3U omni-direction 360-degree search radar, designed by V. P. Sosulnikov and A. N. Musatov, respectively. A more advanced system of radars were included, the Don-2N System; {{consisting of the}} 6000km long-range early warning systems, (<b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> names Pill Box and Hen House), and the 2800km short-range target acquisition radars (NATO codenames Dog House and Cat House).|$|E
25|$|The Type 052C {{destroyer}} (<b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> name Luyang II class, or Lanzhou class {{after the}} lead ship) is {{a class of}} destroyer built by China. It features a four array phased array radar for 360-degree coverage. The radar is {{used in conjunction with}} vertically launched HHQ-9 long-range air defence missiles. The Type 052C was the first warship in the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force to have true long-range fleet air defence capability.|$|E
25|$|In the Polish Army rank {{insignia}} system {{there are}} two grades of sergeant: sierżant (OR-6 in <b>NATO</b> <b>code)</b> and starszy sierżant (OR-7). The rank first appeared in Henryk Dąbrowski's Polish Legions in Italy in the late 18th century. Both ranks {{are used in the}} infantry, armoured forces, air force. In the cavalry the equivalent is wachmistrz (literally wachtmeister). In the artillery the equivalent is ogniomistrz (literally firemaster). In the Polish Navy, the equivalent is bosman (literally boatswain).|$|E
50|$|The <b>NATO</b> rank <b>code</b> {{is mostly}} OF-3.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} U.S. {{military}} usually uses O-1 to O-10 to symbolize officers, {{and not the}} <b>NATO</b> <b>codes</b> of OF-1 to OF-10 in which all subaltern officers are classed as OF-1 (O-1 and O-2 in US). O-11 is sometimes used for the U.S. OF-10 ranks, but is not official.|$|R
50|$|This article {{presents}} the insignia and {{ranks of the}} Brazilian military. These ranks originate from those adopted upon Brazil's independence from Portugal in 1822. Nowadays they are defined by Act no. 6880 of December 9, 1980. The following ranks show Brazil's military insignia and its corresponding <b>NATO</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the BMP-3 or Obyekt 688M {{can be traced back}} to the Obyekt 685 light tank {{prototype}} with 100mm gun 2A48-1 from 1975. This vehicle did not enter series production, but the chassis, with a new engine, was used for the next-generation infantry combat vehicle Obyekt 688 from A. Blagonravov's design bureau. The Ob. 688 weapons configuration—an externally mounted 30mm gun and twin Konkurs ATGM launcher—was rejected; instead the new 2K23 armament system was selected. The resulting BMP-3 was developed in the early 1980s and entered service with the Soviet Army officially in 1987. It was shown for the first time in public during the 1990 Victory Day parade and was given the <b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> IFV M1990/1.|$|E
25|$|T-72MK (T-72M(K)): Export {{version of}} T-72AK. It is a command vehicle for {{battalion}} commanders and has additional radio equipment including the R-130M radio, AB-1-P/30-M1-U generator and a TNA-3 navigation system. The main external difference is a 10m telescopic antenna stowed under {{the rear of}} the stowage box during travel. An additional antenna base for this telescopic antenna is mounted {{on the left side of}} the turret. Because of the additional equipment the number of round for the 125mm tank gun had to be lowered from 44 to 38. In <b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> T-72MK was represented by three different designations: T-72MK1, T-72MK2 and T-72MK3 which represented the company command version, battalion command version and regiment command version.|$|E
500|$|In the film, Jacob is told by Michael {{that the}} horrific events he {{experienced}} on his final day in Vietnam were {{the product of}} an experimental drug called [...] "the Ladder", which was used on troops without their knowledge. At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, <b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> for a deliriant and hallucinogen known as 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the Pentagon. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was Martin A. Lee's book , but noted that [...] "nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ — a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit maniac behavior — was used on U.S. troops." [...] However, CNN has reported on declassified documents showing that the U.S. Army tested BZ and other [...] "psycho-chemical" [...] agents on human subjects at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland from 1955 to 1975.|$|E
50|$|MiG-17s {{first saw}} combat in 1958 in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis and later {{proved to be}} an {{effective}} threat against more modern supersonic fighters of the United States in the Vietnam War. It was also briefly known as the Type 38 by U.S. Air Force designation prior to the development of <b>NATO</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|T-72K: Command {{version of}} T-72 [...] "Ural" [...] with an {{additional}} R-130M radio. Company command versions were fitted with two R123M/R-173 additional radios and also carried a 10m telescopic mast. Battalion and regiment command versions were fitted with two R123M/R-173 additional radios and the R-130M that uses the 10m mast when its erected. In <b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> T-72K was represented by three different designations: T-72K1, T-72K2 and T-72K3 which represented the company command version, battalion command version and regiment command version.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, all of {{the former}} Allies pursued further {{research}} on the three new nerve agents developed by the Nazis: tabun, sarin, and soman. [...] Over the following decades, thousands of American military volunteers were exposed to chemical agents during Cold War testing programs, {{as well as in}} accidents. (In 1968, one such accident killed approximately 6,400 sheep when an agent drifted out of Dugway Proving Ground during a test.) The U.S. also investigated a wide range of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral chemical incapacitating agents including psychedelic indoles such as LSD [...] and marijuana derivatives, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, was assigned the <b>NATO</b> <b>code</b> BZ and was weaponized {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s for possible battlefield use. Alleged use of chemical agents by the U.S. in the Korean (1950–53) conflict has never been substantiated.|$|E
2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, LeMay clashed {{again with}} U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Defense Secretary McNamara, arguing {{that he should}} be allowed to bomb nuclear missile sites in Cuba. He opposed the naval {{blockade}} and, {{after the end of the}} crisis, suggested that Cuba be invaded anyway, even after the Soviets agreed to withdraw their missiles. Kennedy secretly agreed to remove US missiles from Turkey and Italy. Unknown to the US, the Soviet field commanders in Cuba had been given authority to launch nuclear weapons under their controlthe only time such authority was delegated by higher command. They had at least 20 nuclear warheads for medium-range R-12 Dvina (<b>NATO</b> <b>Code</b> SS-4 Sandal) ballistic missiles capable of reaching US cities (including Washington DC), each carrying a one megaton warhead (equivalent to 50 Hiroshima bombs), and nine tactical nuclear missiles. [...] A Soviet submarine flotilla in the area commanded by Kapitan (later Vice Admiral) Vasili Arkhipov had nuclear torpedoes. [...] Because a US Navy surface flotilla was harassing the Soviet submarines with small depth charges, both the flagship's captain and its Zampolit, believing that war had started, voted to launch their nukes. [...] But Captain Arkhipov, a veteran of the K-19 disaster, voted to wait and see, thus averting World War III. If the Soviet officers on land and at sea had chosen to launch, many millions of US citizens could have been killed. The ensuing SAC retaliatory thermonuclear strike would have killed roughly one hundred million Soviet citizens. Kennedy refused LeMay's requests, and the naval blockade was successful.|$|E
