5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon <b>negotiation,</b> {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates a <b>negotiation.</b> For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A <b>negotiation</b> can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how <b>negotiation</b> goes.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative <b>negotiation</b> approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative <b>negotiation.</b> Such <b>negotiation</b> can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|Marion Little {{examines}} theoretical frameworks {{related to}} NVC. The influential interest-based model for conflict resolution, <b>negotiation,</b> and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard <b>Negotiation</b> Project in the 1980s {{appears to have}} some conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based <b>negotiation,</b> based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.|$|E
40|$|Of the {{numerous}} studies conducted on <b>negotiations,</b> {{almost all of}} them have focused on distributive <b>negotiations.</b> The study of integrative <b>negotiations</b> (compared with the study of distributive <b>negotiations)</b> has been relatively neglected {{due to the lack of}} (a) conceptual clarity about the nature of integrative <b>negotiations,</b> (b) a theoretical frame-work, (c) a procedure for engaging in integrative ne gotiations, and (d) limitations of the existing research. Integrative <b>negotiations</b> may be seen as a cooperative process and distributive <b>negotiations</b> as a competitive process. Thus, social interdependence theory provides the framework for clarifying the nature of integrative <b>negotiations</b> and operationalizing a procedure for its use. There have been a series of studies on in-tegrative <b>negotiations</b> that validate the link between social interdependence theory and integrative <b>negotiations,</b> expand the number of dependent variables that are in-cluded in the research on integrative <b>negotiations,</b> and increase the generalizability of the research on integrative <b>negotiations.</b> Subsuming integrative <b>negotiations</b> under social interdependence theory enables researchers to define and refine more precisely the concept of integrative <b>negotiations,</b> summarize the existing research on integra...|$|R

5|$|The work on Integrative <b>Negotiation</b> Consensus Building and the Mutual Gains Approach {{provide a}} helpful {{theoretical}} framework {{for developing the}} theory of urban design management. <b>Negotiation</b> theory provides a useful framework for merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of the built environment. Interests, a key construct in <b>negotiation</b> theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of Roger Fisher and William Ury (1981), Getting to yes, advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.|$|E

5|$|A plan {{to upgrade}} the {{waterways}} to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats {{led to the formation}} of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1million, in addition to the cost of acquiring the canals from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5million and to purchase the four canals either by <b>negotiation,</b> or by compulsory purchase if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted <b>negotiation</b> and legal battles that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of the canals, and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some further developments took place.|$|E
