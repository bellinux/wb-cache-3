5000|$|... "The {{story is}} just so bizarre that you need {{something}} {{to remind you that}} I'm <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>this</b> stuff <b>up.</b> So it seemed important to me to put in those clippings because you reach the part of the story where you go, 'Come on he's got to have gone off the rails with this.' Turn the page and there is indeed an article confirming it, which is why, in terms of writing the script, I hewedvery close to the facts. The story is already extraordinary enough." [...] —Screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski placed newspaper clippings into physical copies of the script to remind people it was a true story. With Collins as the inspiration, Straczynski said he was left with a strong desire [...] "to get it right"; he approached it more like [...] "an article for cinema" [...] than a regular film. He stuck close to the historical record because he felt the story was bizarre enough that adding too many fictional elements would call into question its integrity. Straczynski claimed that 95% of the script's content came from the historical record; he said there were only two moments at which he had to [...] "figure out what happened", {{due to the lack of}} information in the records. One was the sequence set in the psychopathic ward, for which there was only limited after-the-fact testimony. Straczynski originally wrote a shorter account of Collins' incarceration. His agent suggested the sequence needed development, so Straczynski extrapolated events based on standard practice in such institutions at the time. It was at this stage he created composite character Carol Dexter, who was intended to symbolize the women of the era who had been unjustly committed. Straczynski cited his academic background, including majors in psychology and sociology, as beneficial to writing the scenes, specifically one in which Steele distorts Collins' words to make her appear delusional. Straczynski worked at making the dialogue authentic, while avoiding an archaic tone. He cited his experience imagining alien psyches when writing Babylon 5 as good practice for putting himself in the cultural mindset of the 1920s.|$|R

5000|$|Russell {{became known}} for her deadpan humour, {{including}} her disbelieving emphasis of the absurd in well accepted stories and her mockery of pretension. For example, in her humorous analysis of Wagner's Ring cycle, she began by noting that the first scene {{takes place in the}} River Rhine: [...] "In it!!" [...] After pointing out that a character in the Ring Cycle is the first woman that Siegfried has ever met who is not his aunt, she pauses and declares, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up,</b> you know!" [...] This phrase also became the title of her autobiography, published in 1985. At the end of her monologue she sings the Rhinemaidens' leitmotif and declares, [...] "You're exactly where you started, 20 hours ago!" [...] Besides her Ring and Gilbert and Sullivan parodies, Russell was famous for other routines, including [...] "Wind Instruments I Have Known", and parodies of Lieder ("Schlumpf"), French art songs ("Je ne veux pas faire l'amour" [...] and [...] "Je n'ai pas la plume de ma tante"), English folk songs ("I Wish I Were a Dicky-Bird" [...] and [...] "Oh How I Love the Spring"), and English music-hall songs ("I'm Only A Faded Rose"); even stretching to blues and jazz ("(I Gave You My Heart and You Made Me) Miserable").|$|E
5000|$|Redbird Smith's son Stokes {{objected to}} his father's known reverence for (but not worship of) Jesus and the posthumous {{adoption}} of Jesus into the Keetoowah Society in 1936. Stokes Smith rejected this position in 1955: [...] "A very weird thing happened, politically speaking, in 1955. It {{had to do}} with Jesus Christ's membership in the Keetoowah Society (and no, we are <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>up).</b> The Nighthawks at the Redbird Smith Stomp Grounds were in civil strife. Stokes Smith, Redbird's youngest, was Chief. Before Redbird died, he told his people to incorporate the worship of Christ into Nighthawk religion. In 1936, the Keetoowah Society amended its constitution to recognized Christ. While Stokes had acquiesced and signed the measure, he and other elders were unhappy. William Lee Smith, current Nighthawk Chief at Stokes Smith's Grounds, says his father, Stokes, took the fire, wampum and pipe, and left the original grounds, but left part of the fire. The Redbird Grounds people then joined the UKB, realizing they could worship Christ and be Keetoowahs, and have the advantages of political recognition all at the same time, and God would not mind. Thereafter, Stokes' followers refused to recognize either the UKB or his other relatives at Redbirds, although Redbird is still an object of veneration. Some Keetoowah elders's say it was actually an adoption of Jesus into the Society and not an edict for the worship of Jesus.|$|E

In a solo performance/lecture Prof Vida L Midgelow eats her words, ingests knowledge, animates {{her dead}} self and dances everywhere and nowhere, whilst speaking about improvisation and the un/disciplinary in an {{ever so slightly}} ridiculous set of circumstances in which she struggles to stay on script and often fails to achieve the planned outcome. What am I? she asks. What is the potential of improvisation? What are the recurring features of improvisation in dance performance? What are the critical, fluid, emergent and situated modes of knowledge that are operating within an improvised context? What am I? she asks, What if improvisation cannot be known? What if improvisation is not a thing but an unseen process? For, as a generative, relational and temporal activity - improvisation is embedded in ‘the ways we work’ (Ingold 2007 : 3). Through leaky excessiveness disciplinary bounds are broken, as improvisation is understood here as un/disciplinary practice that proceeds toward a productive (un) knowing. I am. I am three trillion cells (as Hay would say) A dancer The coffee I drank this morning A frog The sound of feet that pass along the corridor Between 3 to 7 seconds behind or maybe ahead of myself I forget I am a person trying to forget in order to remember Am trying to be here With you, with me.
