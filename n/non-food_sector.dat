The subject was defined by the author in cooperation with Mr. Robert Maier, executive manager for non-food and brand, and Ms. Silvia Carazo Soto, manager for the product range development in the Lidl <b>non-food</b> <b>sector.</b> The present study has two major purposes: Firstly, to investigate how customers perceive the non-food products and sector at Lidl and secondly, to identify what characteristics they value and would like to see improved in the Lidl stores. The goal of this present study is to determine various proposals to optimize the <b>non-food</b> <b>sector</b> of Lidl stores in order to increase customer satisfaction and sales. Data and information material for this research were gathered through the author’s mentors, colleagues, meetings, an empirical survey, internal company presentations, the company homepage, the university’s EBSCO online research database, various business press as well as scientific publications. In the first part, a theoretical background on the subject as well as company insights into the non-food division is provided. These show that the spending power of consumers has increased, consumers are becoming progressively demanding and that Lidl is faced by strong competitors on the food retail market.

Substantial research effort is focused on pathogen detection and control, with detailed risk management available for many plant diseases. Risk can be assessed using analytical techniques that account for disease pressure both spatially and temporally.

Instead, risk-management strategies need to account more fully for intuitive and normative responses that act to balance conflicting interests between stakeholder organizations concerned with plant diseases within the managed and natural environments. Modes of effective engagement between policy makers and stakeholders are explored in the paper, together with an assessment of such engagement in two case studies of contemporary non-indigenous diseases in one food and in one <b>non-food</b> <b>sector.</b> Finally, a model is proposed for greater integration of stakeholders in policy decisions...|$|E

Alongside its traditional involvement in the agro-food, the biomass has nowadays opened new vistas in the <b>non-food</b> <b>sector.</b> Indeed, original products and structures, potentially biodegradable, are proposed as substitutes for conventional petrochemical derivatives.

Using a regression model, the paper econometrically tests the hypothesis that the speed of the post-crisis recovery in retail turnover can be explained by the debt levels accumulated in the pre-crisis period. The results of the analysis indicate the negative correlation between variables, which means that the countries that had the lowest levels of accumulated private debt, on average experienced the fastest recovery of retail turnover in the post-crisis period, and vice versa. The weaker correlation has been found in case of retail sales of food, beverages and tobacco products, which leads us to the conclusion that its consumption was not mainly financed by borrowing and, also, that its recovery does not depend primarily on the level of household debt. The analysis for the <b>non-food</b> <b>sector</b> indicated a very high dependence of this type of consumption on household debt, which remains one of the main impediments to its recovery...|$|E
40|$|Footprint {{analysis}} {{reveals the}} appropriation of land resources from a consumer’s perspective. We here present a novel hybrid land-flow accounting method for the calculation of land footprints, employing a globally consistent top-down approach and combining physical with environmental economic accounting. Physical accounting tracks food products from ‘field to plate’ and non-food from ‘field to industrial use’ using the large harmonized FAO data to track biomass flows and related land use in physical volumes (tons of biomass). Environmental-economic accounting is used to further track non-food commodities in monetary values to final consumption. The hybrid methodology has been applied annually between 1995 and 2010 for 21 regional markets globally and including major economies separately (e. g. USA, China, India). Per capita extents and composition of cropland footprints vary widely across the world. Detailed results for Germany and the EU 28 highlight the higher land demand of livestock-based diets compared to crop-based diets, the growing integration in international markets, and the growing importance of the <b>non-food</b> <b>sector</b> since 2000. Today the land footprint of each Germany citizen appropriates on average 2693 m 2 cropland (about one half for livestock-based diets, one quarter for crop-based diets and one quarter for non-food products). Additional 1655 m 2 of grassland per capita are used for the consumption of ruminant livestock products. Germany is a major and increasing trading partner with current net ‘cropland imports’ of 10. 6 Mha. Overall, half of Germany’s 22 Mha cropland footprint relies on domestic cultivation and half on land resources abroad. Albeit large uncertainties in the calculation of grassland footprints, results point towards Germany being a significant net importer of grassland embedded in ruminant livestock products...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{development}} depends highly in {{the allocation}} of developing funds -through development policies- among the various sectors of regional economies. In order to safeguard the most efficient use of investments analytical tools visualizing {{the economy as a}} whole in the form of a general equilibrium should be adopted. In this paper the role of agro-food sectors and agriculture in regional economic growth is examined. Despite the diminishing contribution of agriculture and agro-food sectors in the formation of an economy’s gross output and employment, their indirect influence upon the rest of the economy most of the times is not completely cast up. It is evidence that over the last two decades the share of agriculture in Greece’s GDP is substantially dropped. This fact many times used as a guide to support decisions in directing regional developing funds far from agriculture. On the other side, food sector’s share in processing industries is growing and its contribution and interrelation with other sectors has not been well assessed. Thus in the present paper, the indirect contribution of agro-food sectors in a region’s economy is measured and compared to non-agricultural sectors. Linkage relationships and interdependencies between food and non-food sectors are sought and their role in strengthening the regions growth is contemplated. The identification of such relationships is very important, as the path to development in some regions is very sensitive to sectoral interdependencies. To accomplish the aforementioned objectives, an Input-Output framework was employed in a regional level (Thessalia, Greece). Utilizing an employment based Location Quotient (LQ), developed by Flegg et al (1995) -the FLQ- the national I-O table is regionalized for the Greek (NUTS 2) region. The regionalization procedure was performed by following the hybrid GRIT technique. Employing the regional I-O table, linkage coefficients, that identify the dynamics of key sectors, were estimated. In addition the regional output generated due to food sector and <b>non-food</b> <b>sector</b> activity traced out to compare the relative dynamics. Results clearly demonstrate that the nexus of food non-food sectors is determinant in regional growth plans and the particular interdependencies, in every particular region, must carefully considered. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper employs an {{integrated}} CGE-microsimulation approach {{to analyze the}} poverty effects of tariff reduction. The {{results indicate that the}} tariff cuts implemented between 1994 and 2000 were generally poverty-reducing, primarily through the substantial reduction in consumer prices they engendered. However, the reduction is much greater in the National Capital Region (NCR), where poverty incidence is already lowest, than in other areas, especially rural, where poverty incidence is highest. Tariff cuts lower the cost of local production and bring about real exchange rate depreciation. Since the <b>non-food</b> manufacturing <b>sector</b> dominates exports in terms of export share and export intensity, the general equilibrium effects of tariff reduction is an expansion of this sector and a contraction in the agricultural sector. This, in turn, leads to an increase in the relative returns to factors, such as capital, used intensively in the <b>non-food</b> manufacturing <b>sector</b> and a fall in returns to unskilled labor. As rural households depend more on unskilled labor income, income inequality worsens as a result. Dynamic CGE model, trade liberalisation, poverty, inequality, Senegal...|$|R
50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, {{depending on the type of}} filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with feed augers, toothed wheel feed systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some <b>non-food</b> <b>sectors.</b> Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.|$|R

In particular, we focus {{on the extent to which}} primary agricultural sectors are insulated from the broader macroeconomic effects of the crisis and consequently the limit of the agrofood sectors’ stabilising role within the wider economy. The results have broad implications for neighbouring Mediterranean EU economies given similarities in the relative size and structure of primary agriculture, and in the macroeconomic difficulties they face. Comparing with a status quo (i. e., no crisis) baseline, we estimate that the conditions of the crisis lead to a cumulative contraction of 10 per cent in Spanish agricultural activity by 2015, with concomitant reductions in real farming incomes of 17 %. Notwithstanding, in accordance with previous studies and a priori expectations, this contraction is notably smaller than in <b>non-food</b> <b>sectors.</b> Comparing between agricultural activities, those with smaller land cost shares exhibit greater supply responsiveness, particularly rice, raw sugar and intensive livestock sectors.

Fourteen pre-selected evaluators through triangular tests were trained and monitored for a period of four months. Two monitoring methods selected the evaluators: overall perfor-mance was assessed at a significance level of 0. 05 using ANOVA; And then line graphs were used to reveal the performance and eventual problems of agreement of the evaluators {{in the use of the}} evaluation scale. The results obtained with the use of these methodologies concomitantly for the monitoring were relevant and helped the selection of the evaluators with a smaller margin of error.

Because we were still gaining more insights from every interview after an intermediate data analysis, we assumed that we had not yet reached saturation level (Glaser and Strauss 1967) in the data, and invited further top 25 OC retailers from sector-specific rankings (i.e., the top 60 fashion retailers, top 5 in consumer electronics, and top 10 in DIY; see also LZ.net 2014 and Hübner et al. 2013 b).

30|$|The {{challenges}} are similar when items are not shipped from the outlets, but reserved online by a customer {{and picked up}} at the store afterwards (click-and-reserve), as the IT requirements and the picking efforts are identical. Only the packing of a parcel is not required. Therefore, only about one-fifth of the OC retailers currently use this concept. However, click-and-reserve is expected to grow in importance, as it offers also several advantages compared to click-and-collect. It enables shorter order-to-delivery cycles than click-and-collect, as the desired goods can be picked up by customers immediately. Furthermore, click-and-reserve reduces the average transportation costs compared to click-and-collect. However, picking costs are higher at the outlets than at the DC. Click-and-reserve ultimately results in better product availability as orders can be supplied from both inventories at the DC and at stores. While click-and-reserve has been tested in most of the <b>non-food</b> <b>sectors,</b> it is only used to a very limited extent at present in fashion retailing because of several availability challenges. First, the high variation in cuts and colors leads to very few items being available in stores. This limits the number of available units for online reservations, since customers at the store may simultaneously be trying on these items or may have put them into their shopping basket. Second, items may be misplaced by store customers and their current location in the store might not be detectable with affordable effort.|$|R

40|$|A complex coacervate is a co-assembled soft {{material}} with numerous potential practical applications {{in food and}} <b>non-food</b> <b>sectors.</b> It results from the interaction of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in solution leading to a liquid-liquid phase separation.

A better knowledge of the mechanism of formation and stabilization of such system is essential to design material with optimized technological properties. In most heteroprotein coacervates studied up to now, the protein molar ratio in the coacervate was constant in the whole domain of formation of the coacervate and {{it was suggested that}} it corresponds to the molar ratio of an identified heteroprotein building unit. Surprisingly, in the case of -lactoglobulin(-LG) /lactoferrin(LF) system, the molar ratio in -LG/LF coacervates increased from 4 to almost 8 when the -LG/LF molar ratio in the mixing solution increased suggesting the coexistence of different building units with different -LG/LF molar ratio. By combining protein quantification, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and solid NMR measurements in the coacervates and docking simulation we suggest that -LG/LF coacervates are formed from 3 different building units with different -LG/LF molar ratio. Change in the proportion of these building units in the coacervates give a plausible explanation of the observed change in -LG/LF molar ratio in the coacervate when changing protein molar ratio in the mixing solution...|$|R

Additionally, philosophy about health and nutrition, as well as environmental stewardship could be logically adopted by organics. These additions could strengthen the ethical impact of certification, especially with regards to animal derived food products (like eggs, meat, and milk).

As palm has the most important oil yield among oilseed crops, future development of tropical oils is a major issue for the world market over the next years. There will be a growing food demand coming from areas in deficit of oilseed products (China, South Asia, Africa, etc.) these countries experience rapid demographic growth and increase in per capita consumption of oils and fats due to income growth during the last decade.

Dans cet article, après avoir traité dans une première partie la situation actuelle et les évolutions récentes sur les marchés internationaux des principales huiles végétales, on abordera dans une deuxième partie un certain nombre d’éléments sur les évolutions récentes et historiques des prix de ces produits en relation avec ceux du complexe « matières grasses » et plus généralement de l’ensemble des grands produits agricoles mondiaux. Dans une dernière partie, on s’intéressera plus spécifiquement à certaines perspectives à moyen terme concernant à la fois les possibilités de productions mondiales et les hypothèses de demande sur les principaux débouchés de l’alimentation humaine et du non alimentaire...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} extent of {{macroeconomic}} convergence among the countries {{that make up the}} CFA Franc zone. The analysis addresses the following issues: (i) Do the CFA Franc zone countries differ in the ways they respond to macroeconomic shocks?; (ii) To what extent has real exchange rate misalignment in individual member states differed over 1960 - 99 ? There is a school of thought that the only devaluation {{in the history of the}} Franc zone, in January 1994, was implemented for the sake of the larger economies. This part of the thesis determines whether there is an empirical basis for this claim; (iii) Following a shock to inflation, how do member states of the Franc zone differ in terms of persistence in food and non-food price inflation?;Chapters 1 - 3 review the background of the Franc zone. Chapters 4 - 6 are empirical studies, each addressing a separate perspective, as listed above. To address the first issue, we apply the method of Blanchard and Quah (1989) in order to identify and estimate a structural VAR model appropriate for a small open economy. By decomposing the variance of the macroeconomic shocks in this way, the method extends the atheoretic VAR analysis and uses economic theory and time-series analysis to determine the sources of disturbances to economic variables in Chapter 4. Next, defining real exchange rate misalignment as the percentage deviation of the actual from the estimated equilibrium value, Chapter 5 estimates the degree of misalignment in the real exchange rate for twelve individual member states of the Franc zone. Chapter 6 investigates the degree of inflation persistence in the food and <b>non-food</b> <b>sectors</b> of thirteen individual Franc zone countries; for robustness of our estimates, we avoid the knife edge I(0) / I(1) classification and make use of three semi-parametric methods [Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983), Phillips (1999 a,b) and Robinson (1995 a) ] of estimating the fractional integration parameter in an ARFIMA (p. d. q) model.;Findings from all three perspectives provide substantial evidence of some heterogeneity among the macroeconomies of the Franc zone countries. The research findings suggest that the conduct of uniform policy, such as monetary policy, within the monetary union by the central bank is likely to result in some net losers and net beneficiaries...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the debate on environmental labelling by exploring the potential of economic value as a functional unit (FU) for the environmental labelling of food and other consumer products. We used life cycle inventory (LCI) data for organic and conventional pigs and broiler chickens from the public French AGRIBALYSE LCI database and the CML 2001 method to calculate impacts per ton of animal live weight at the farm gate, per hectare (ha) of land occupied and per 1000 Euro of animal live weight. We also examined the relationship between carbon footprint (CF) and price for 24 food product groups representative of French food consumption. When using the FU live weight, organic animals had larger impacts than conventional animals. Per ha of land occupied, organic animals had smaller impacts than conventional animals, but production was lower. Per 1000 Euro of value, organic animals had similar or lower values for eutrophication, lower values for climate change and higher or similar values for land occupation. These results illustrate that the choice of FU is crucial when comparing products from highly efficient conventional systems to products from less intensive organic systems. For the 24 food product groups CF per product mass was positively correlated with product price; CF per product economic value was not correlated with product price. This suggests that a rebound effect may occur: consumers that choose foods with lower CFs per mass will tend to spend less money on food, leaving them with more money to buy other products which may compensate the reduced food CF. This type of correlation has not been observed for <b>non-food</b> <b>sectors</b> of the economy. Nevertheless, the FU economic value is attractive, as it considers product quality through the product's price. An economic-value-based FU will be more favourable to systems producing products of superior quality. More generally, an economic-value-based FU is well suited for environmental labelling of consumer products. A consumer has a certain budget to spend; an economic-value-based FU may guide the consumer towards reduced impacts per Euro spent. We recommend the use of an FU based on economic value for the environmental labelling of food and other consumer products. This FU will be a complement to currently used FUs. It will guide consumers towards lower impacts for a given expenditure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
