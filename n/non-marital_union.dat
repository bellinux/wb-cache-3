Thus they lose out, when compared to married couples, on the married couples' tax relief, a system which can decrease a couple's tax liability. The married couples' tax relief has the fullest effect when {{the structure of the}} spouses' contribution to the total is significantly asymmetric. It pinpoints the provisions that reduce the effectiveness of the married couple's tax allowance: the graduated relief and the minimum payment threshold. Marriage can then result in financial loss. Myriade, a microsimulation model, shows that <b>non-marital</b> <b>union</b> offers the most possibilities for people in the lowest income brackets. Simulating the marriage of unmarried couples shows a small advantage to marriage: this is mostly explained by the asymmetry in resources and a lower standard of living, both lower in unmarried couples. : Cohabitees, Married Couples, Income Tax System...|$|E

40|$|Austria has {{traditionally}} strong regional differentials in non-marital fertility which correspond to differential rates of marriage during first pregnancy. But in all regions {{the tendency to}} marry in case of pregnancy has declined over the past years. This paper will use the data of the Austria 1996 FFS to study the question from two angles: first, we look at changing marriage patterns and study whether <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> are likely to develop into an alternative or a precursor to marriage in Austria. Next, we reconstruct the biographies of all unmarried women who had a first pregnancy. We study the timing and quantum of monthly marriage rates after {{the beginning of the}} pregnancy, and to what degree they depend on socioeconomic factors.

40|$|The {{number of}} people who have ever {{experienced}} a divorce, or a split up of a <b>non-marital</b> <b>union,</b> is rising every year. It is well known that union dissolution has a disruptive effect on the housing careers of those involved, often leading to downward moves on the housing ladder. Much less is known about the geographies of residential mobility after union dissolution. There are reasons to expect that those who experienced a union dissolution are less likely to move over longer distances, which could negatively influence the spatial flexibility of the labour force. This study contributes to the existing literature by investigating the occurrences of moves, distances moved and the destinations of moves after union dissolution. The paper also contributes to the literature by not only investigating the effect of divorce, but also splitting up, and repartnering on mobility.

50|$|In Italy, where Roman Catholicism had a {{historically}} strong presence, cohabitation {{is not as}} common as in other countries of Europe, yet it has increased in recent years. There are significant regional differences, with <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> being {{more common in the}} North of the country than in Southern Italy. A study published in 2006 found that long term cohabitation was still novel to Italy, though more common among young people. As of 2015, the share of births outside of marriage was 28.7%, but this varied by statistical regions as follows: Central Italy (33.8%), Northeast Italy (33.1%), Northwest Italy (31.3%), Insular Italy (24.2%), and South Italy (20.3%).|$|R
40|$|Since census {{information}} is primarily collected {{with respect to}} heads of households, information for children is (except for the basic characteristics of age, sex and citizenship) typically not directly tabulated. If one is interested, e. g., in {{the question of what}} proportion of children lives with married parents, this is not directly visible from the tabulation of married couples by the number of children. First, one must change the basis for analysis, i. e., transform the children who are treated as an attribute of the heads of households to become the basic units of analysis and make the characteristics of their households their attributes. This is a fairly simple transformation of data which gives a very different perspective of social conditions of children. The data show, for instance, that only 23 percent of all children live as single children, whereas 49 percent of all parents with children in the household have only one child. While the mean number of children per woman (period TFR) is presently at 1. 4 children in Austria, the average Austrian child lives in a household of 2. 9 children. Another surprising figure is that despite increasing proportions of <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> (80 percent of new couples start living together as <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions),</b> high nonmarital fertility rates (more than 25 percent), and significant divorce rates (more than 30 percent), more than 80 percent of all Austrian children still live together with two parents who are married. The reason for this fact, which sharply contrasts the general public perception, is that the fertility of married women is still much higher than that of unmarried women, and a high proportion of <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> are transformed into marriages after they have children. For more than two decades, demographers have known that family sizes of children and family sizes of women are different (Preston, 1976), but this issue has not yet been picked up by the broader social sciences. Only a more recent emphasis on childhood research is stimulating social scientists {{to pay more attention to}} the fact that indeed the world looks rather different from the children's perspective than from the adult's. But since most statistical tools and tabulations still focus around the head of the household, who by definition is an adult, a reorientation of the statistical focus is necessary in order to arrive at appropriate statistics concerning the experiences of children. This volume attempts to make a first step by transforming the data of the most recent Austrian census in a way that will more adequately describe the living conditions of the younger generation...|$|R

30|$|If {{married and}} {{cohabiting}} fathers differ {{in terms of}} their involvement in childcare, the diffusion of <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> could have important consequences for children, since the role of paternal involvement in children’s development is crucial (Aldous and Mulligan 2002; Bronte-Tinkew et al. 2008). Activities connected with daily basic childcare are obviously not exhaustive of the multiple dimensions of paternal involvement (engagement, accessibility, responsibility, 1 see Lamb et al. 1987 and Lamb 2000) and are not even exhaustive of all the direct father-child interactions examined through the engagement component. However, for babies aged 0 – 3 [*]years, they account for {{a large part of the}} children’s needs and are of the upmost importance in terms of the development of warm and rich father-child relationships. Moreover, the father’s involvement in these activities, which are traditionally attributed to the mother, is assumed to ease the mother’s workload.|$|R

A multilevel, multiprocess, competing-risks model allows for multiple cohabitations per woman and endogeneity of fertility status. We find that cohabiting couples’ response to impending parenthood {{and the presence of}} children changed over time. In particular, the proportion of cohabiting couples who married before a birth decreased and, in the 1970 cohort only, the risk of dissolution declined during pregnancy.

40|$|Abstract Aspirations, {{along with}} attainments, play an {{important}} role in shaping wellbeing. Early in adult life women are more likely than men to fulfill their material goods and family life aspirations; their satisfaction in these domains is correspondingly higher; and so too is their overall happiness. Material goods aspirations refer here to desires for a number of big-ticket consumer goods, such as a home, car, travel abroad and vacation home. In later life these gender differences turn around. Men come closer than women to fulfilling their material goods and family life aspirations, are more satisfied with their financial situation and family life, and are the happier of the two genders. An important factor underlying the turnaround in fulfillment of aspirations for material goods and family life is probably the shift over the course of the life cycle in the relative proportion of women and men in marital and <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions...</b>|$|R
30|$|This study offers new {{information}} regarding Italian father’s involvement with very young children: it examines {{whether or not}} married and cohabiting fathers are differently involved in the daily basic childcare that is traditionally attributed to the mothers and, if so, whether the differences are due {{to the type of}} couple per se or to specific characteristics of the family. Daily basic childcare represents a partial dimension of the multiple components characterizing parental involvement. However, since it can be of primary importance both for improving father-child relationships and for easing the mother’s workload, this topic is worthy of examination: perhaps this is especially worthy of consideration in a country such as Italy, where <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> have only recently started spreading and where fathers are traditionally minimally involved in childcare duties. Daily basic childcare was considered both as a whole and via some specific activities that were selected for their different level of primary care levels. In addition, potential differences among married fathers were also examined, distinguishing between those who entered directly into marriage and those experiencing pre-marital cohabitation.|$|R

30|$|The {{existing}} literature highlights two possible mechanisms that explore how the father’s marital status could influence {{his involvement in}} childcare. One main explanation {{of the differences in}} paternal involvement between married and cohabiting fathers is related to what we can call the “de-institutionalization perspective”, which relates to the concept of the “incomplete institutionalization” of cohabiting couples explored by some authors (see, for example, Baxter 2005 and Kuperberg 2012). According to this theory, the legal bond and public commitment of marriage (the “enforceable trust”, see Cherlin 2004) define the roles of the individuals as parents and spouses, thus establishing, in particular, a joint investment in children by both partners (Townsend 2002); at the opposite, <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> lack institutionalization (Nock 1995), which may imply ambiguity in terms of the father’s parental role. Thus, married fathers would be characterized by a greater investment (both in terms of material resources and childcare) in their children than unmarried fathers, given the stronger institutional structure of marriage as opposed to cohabitation (Hofferth and Anderson 2003; Anderson et al. 2007; Berger et al. 2008). Alternatively, some authors suggest that cohabiting fathers might be more highly involved in their children’s care than married fathers are because they are motivated to demonstrate their commitment to their child and to their partner (Cabrera et al. 2011; Perry et al. 2012). In this sense, the less institutional condition of unwed resident fathers could push them to represent themselves well as potential marriage partners (the “commitment perspective”).|$|R
40|$|Background : There {{has been}} a rapid spread of non-marital childbearing in the Czech Republic {{during the last two}} decades. At the same time, the low birth weight rates of {{children}} born to married and unmarried mothers have converged. Objective : The goal is to explain the diminishing gap in low birth weight. Two explanations are assessed: the changing selection of unmarried mothers from disadvantaged socio-demographic groups, and increasing social support for unmarried mothers. Methods : Data from birth register are analysed. Marital status (married vs. unmarried) disparities in low birth weight are modelled using logistic regression. Further analyses are then performed with a detailed measurement of partnership status. This detailed variable is partially missing and is thus supplemented with multiple imputation. Results : The main explanation for the narrowing gap between the outcomes of children born to married and unmarried mothers is the increasing social support for unmarried mothers. Unmarried motherhood has become less detrimental to a child's birth weight net of maternal demographic characteristics. The decline in selection from disadvantaged socio-demographic groups has also contributed to the convergence. However, the convergence of birth weight trends towards marital children seems to refer mostly to children of partnered mothers, with children of single mothers lagging behind. Conclusions : The positive trends in the health of non-marital children are interpreted as being the result of the increasing institutionalisation of parenthood in <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions.</b> However, this does not apply to unpartnered motherhood, which continues to represent a health disadvantage...|$|R
40|$|Background : A {{large body}} of {{research}} has compared relationship satisfaction and quality in cohabiting versus married relationships. Despite increased recognition of couples in living apart together (LAT) relationships, very little research has examined the experiences of couples in LAT relationships compared to co-residential unions. Objective : Our aim is to develop knowledge about the experiences of different union types by investigating relationship satisfaction of people in LAT, cohabiting, and marital relationships. We differentiate those with intentions to marry for cohabiters, and those with intentions to marry or live together in LAT relationships. We also examine differences by gender and country. Methods : Using data from Wave 1 of the Generations and Gender Survey in France, Germany, Australia, and Russia (n = 9, 604), OLS regressions are estimated to investigate a) differences in relationship satisfaction across relationship types, and b) across countries. Results : Married people have {{the highest levels of}} relationship satisfaction. People in <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> with intentions to marry or live together are significantly more satisfied than those without marriage or cohabitation intentions. Those in LAT relationships with no intentions to live together have the lowest levels of relationship satisfaction.

40|$|The {{recent years}} have seen {{increase}} in the phenomenon of <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> also in a country such as Italy which is characterized by traditional family behaviours. The present paper aims to study {{the extent to which}} marriage and cohabitation differ in the division of household labour within the couple with data from the nationally representative survey “Family and Social Subjects” conducted in Italy in 2003. The article examines the differences between currently married and currently cohabiting couples in their household labour allocation, distinguishing the heterogeneous groups of cohabitations and marriages according to the experience of previous unions. This allows identification of couples in different stages of their life course and to better characterize differences across couples. Results suggest that, on the one hand, cohabiting couples present more equal arrangements than married ones. Household labour time is, indeed, shared more equally among cohabitations than among marriages, and this is due to fewer hours spent by cohabiting women in household tasks than by their married counterparts. On the other hand, the experience of previous unions does not necessarily mean more equal allocation of household labour in the current union. Having experienced previous unions for married individuals means a more equal allocation of household labour than among married couples in their first unions; however, the same result does not hold for cohabitations. Unions before marriages are predominantly premarital cohabitations and, thus, the patterns established in the cohabitation period are carried over into marriage; in contrast, cohabitations with previous unions are predominantly cohabitations following the end of a previous marriage and, thus, they probably represent particularly selected couples...|$|R
30|$|This {{topic is}} of {{particular}} interest in a context such as Italy. Even if occurring later than in other European regions (Kiernan 2002), <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> have become increasingly common also in this country (Salvini and De Rose 2011). As a consequence, out-of-wedlock births have dramatically increased, passing from 8.9 % in 1997 to 24.8 % in 2012 (Italian Statistical Yearbook 2001, 2015). However, the percentage remains lower compared to many other European countries. For example, in 2012, the percentage of out-of-wedlock births is higher than 40 % in countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, and even higher than 50 % in countries such as Sweden, Norway, and France (Eurostat Demographic Statistics 2). The fact that cohabitation is less common is often associated both with lower social acceptance and less legal acknowledgement of cohabitation (and this, indeed, is the case in Italy 3). Thus, we cannot exclude that cohabiting fathers might feel their role substantially different from that of married fathers, with implications on their parental behaviour. For example, some authors suggest that, where the cohabitation is less “marriage like”, cohabiting couples are a self-selected group aiming to breaking the traditional gendered division of family labour, including that of childcare (Ono and Yeilding 2009). In addition, Italy is a particularly interesting context for investigation also due to its gender system, which is characterized by a low level of involvement of fathers in childcare (Smith Koslowski 2008; Tanturri 2012; Neilson and Stanfors 2014). Typically, Italian mothers carry the main responsibility for these tasks. In fact, the last few decades have shown a progressive reduction in the gender imbalance in childcare between parents. However, these changes have not evenly affected all types of childcare and the mothers continue to carry the main responsibility in daily basic care (Istat 2016). Therefore, this study offers an opportunity to examine the differences in tasks characterized by a persistent gender gap for cohabiters and married fathers living in a context where cohabitation is not yet regarded as an equivalent of, or as a substitute for, marriage.|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} {{previous}} studies, however, this study sheds further light {{on how the}} selection process influences the fathers’ behaviour regarding childcare as a whole. Obviously, given the cross-sectional structure of our data, we cannot fully address the selection issue but at least some points can be highlighted. Firstly, the higher levels of basic childcare of cohabiting fathers seem to depend on both {{the age of the}} child (early infancy) and on the specific conditions of the couple (first child and a short union duration), which, in turn, are associated with higher involvement by the fathers. In particular, it seems that a significant aspect of the higher involvement of cohabiting fathers is “explained” by the fact that <b>non-marital</b> <b>unions</b> are, on average, shorter than marriages are (as shown in Table  1). Interestingly, this result is consistent with Stratton’s (2004) findings in terms of the couple’s specialization in housework. She reported a positive association between the duration of the relationship and a specialization in housework and interpreted this as an evidence of her theory about uncertainty: the longer the relationship is, the more secure the couple has become in a more specialized division of labour in the home. It could be that the theory of uncertainty holds even in the case of childcare. A second finding is that even a higher level of childcare involvement for fathers who entered marriage after a period of cohabitation depends on a selection process, but in this case, the differences are due both to some parental characteristics (the parents’ education and employment status) and to the geographical context (area of residence). Higher educational levels make fathers more {{aware of the importance of}} their care for child development and well-being; similarly, couples where the mother is involved in paid work are forced into a more egalitarian gendered division of family labour. However, we cannot exclude that these structural characteristics absorb, at least partly, potential differences with respect to preferences and attitudes that make these parents more prone to breaking the traditional roles around the household division of labour. Thus, cohabiting couples who then marry may even be selected for their values and orientations.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of exogamy and endogamy among immigrants are considered important indicators of social {{integration in the}} host society. The goal {{of this paper is}} to analyze the patterns of union formation among ex-Yugoslav of the first and second generation in Sweden. The study analyzes both marriages and <b>non-marital</b> childbearing <b>unions.</b> The longitudinal data (1990 - 2012) stem from the STAR compilation of the Swedish register data. The data cover the entire population residing in Sweden. The main analysis is based on discrete-time multinomial logistic regression. The results show that the length of stay in Sweden is positively associated with the likelihood of a union with a native Swedish person and negatively associated with the likelihood of an endogamous partner choice. A stronger exposure to ex-Yugoslav immigrants (measured as the share of ex-Yugoslavs in the municipality) implies a higher likelihood of endogamous union and a lower likelihood of a union with a native. University educated ex-Yugoslavs are the most likely to enter a union with a native, with the association being more pronounced among women. The patterns of intermarriage among ex-Yugoslavs largely resemble those identified in previous studies on native-immigrants marriages in Europe. One exception is that the propensity for endogamy is somewhat more pronounced among women. In order to obtain a more finegrained picture of the causal mechanisms behind the results reported in this study, it will be necessary to conduct additional research, combining quantitative and qualitative methods...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The broad aim of {{the first part of the}} study is to provide {{insights}} into the perspectives and behaviour of sexually active individuals and couples with regard to the prevention of unwanted pregnancy and HIV/AIDS in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A combination of qualitative and quantitative data is used: focus group discussions, a survey of individuals and couples and in-depth interviews. The study found that knowledge of family planning is virtually universal. Most men and women approve of family planning as a method of fertility regulation, although women are more likely than men to report using a method of family planning. Family planning is seen as the woman's domain and as a result, the wife often takes the initiative in using a method of family planning, sometimes without her husband's knowledge. With regard to HIV, awareness is also virtually universal among men and women. Despite this, there is much resistance to condom use especially in marital unions. Condoms are more likely to be used in <b>non-marital</b> than marital <b>unions.</b> However, there are some encouraging indications that condom use in marital unions is occurring and the wife's risk perception is a major factor influencing use. In the second part of the study, the emphasis shifts from the perspectives of individuals to the role of services. The broad aim of this part of the study is to consider how health services are responding to the needs of sexually active men and women by obtaining information from providers and clients. The study found that while condom promotion is an important component of integrated services, it is not consistently undertaken by providers. Moreover, in most health facilities, clients are only usually offered services for which they present at the health facility. Clients feel that they would benefit from additional information that will protect them against the dual risks of unwanted pregnancy and STIs/HIV.
