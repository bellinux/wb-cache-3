5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone.</b> In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone.</b> After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Nakajima {{once again}} {{participated in the}} Junior League in June 2007, {{finishing}} in third place for his block with four points, behind Hijikata and Kondo. The league was won by American wrestler Chris Sabin, setting up a title match between Sabin and Nakajima on August 26, 2007, in which Nakajima was victorious. On September 1, 2007, Nakajima challenged Pro Wrestling Noah's Takeshi Morishima for his ROH World Championship in the main event of a Kensuke Office show, putting up a good fight but losing in the end. On September 19, 2007, Nakajima was pinned in a tag team match by visiting luchador Silver King, who then challenged Nakajima to a future junior heavyweight title match. The match was made official for October 18, 2007 at All Japan's 35th anniversary show; on October 8, 2007, Nakajima suffered a fractured <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> in his right hand, forcing him off of several shows on the tour, though he defended the title as scheduled. When the match came, Nakajima and Silver King fought to a no contest, forcing PWF commissioner Hiroshi Hase {{to hold up the}} title belt, although Nakajima remained the official champion. Katsuhiko then took time off to nurse his injured hand.|$|E
5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone,</b> itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E
50|$|The Geist {{classification}} {{divides the}} accessory <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> into three types.|$|R
50|$|The dorsal cuboideonavicular {{ligament}} is a fibrous bundle {{connecting the}} dorsal {{surfaces of the}} cuboid and <b>navicular</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Plantar cuboideonavicular {{ligament}} is a fibrous {{band that}} connects the plantar surfaces of the cuboid and <b>navicular</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> is {{supported}} by several ligaments above, below, and on the side. One of these ligaments is the impar ligament, which attaches the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> to the coffin bone (distal phalanx). Cartilage lies between the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> and the coffin joint, {{as well as between}} the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> and the DDF tendon. The navicular bursa - a small sac that protects the DDF and <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> from abrasion as the tendon slides over the area - lies between the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> and the DDF tendon.|$|E
25|$|In navicular {{suspensory}} desmotomy, the ligaments {{supporting the}} <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> are severed. This makes the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> more mobile, and thus reduces {{the tension of}} the other ligaments. It is successful {{about half of the}} time.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small pastern bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs {{down the back of}} the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> before attaching {{to the back of the}} coffin bone. The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|E
5000|$|Stress {{fractures}} can {{be described}} as a very small sliver or crack in the bone; and are sometimes referred to as [...] "hairline fractures". Stress fractures most frequently occur in weight-bearing bones, such as the tibia (bone of the lower leg), metatarsals, and <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> (bones of the foot). Less common are fractures to the femur, pelvis, and sacrum.|$|R
50|$|Throughout his racing career, Charter Party was {{hindered}} by injury {{problems related to}} the <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> in his feet. Although he was noted {{for his ability to}} sustain a fast gallop over extended distances he was prone to making mistakes in his jumping and often failed to complete the course.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that standing can also increase the chance of navicular disease (such as a horse that spends {{most of the day}} in a stall with little turnout, as with some racehorses and show horses). Blood flow to the hoof decreases when the horse is not in motion. The horse is also constantly applying pressure to the <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> (which is intermittent as the horse moves).|$|R
25|$|Another main {{factor is}} the tension placed on the ligaments that support the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone.</b> Some experts believe that the {{degenerative}} process begins with excess tension placed on these ligaments, causing strain and inflammation. Inflammation from strain of the impar ligament can decrease blood flow {{to and from the}} <b>navicular</b> <b>bone,</b> as the major blood vessels supplying the bone run up and down this area. If the ligament continues to be strained, it can thicken and permanently reduce blood flow to the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because veins {{are more}} easily {{compressed}} than arteries, {{blood flow to the}} bone would be less obstructed than blood flow from the bone. This would cause a buildup of pressure within the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone.</b> The <b>navicular</b> <b>bone,</b> in response to both the increased pressure and overall decreased blood supply, would absorb mineral from its center.|$|E
25|$|Cartilage erosion may {{progress}} {{to the point}} that the bone underneath will become exposed. With the cartilage no longer present to protect it, the navicular bursa and DDF tendon may become damaged by the constant rubbing against the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone.</b> Navicular bursitis (inflammation of the navicular bursa) may occur, even if cartilage damage is not severe. This is probably due to the friction between the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> and the DDF tendon from compression.|$|E

40|$|Symptomatic {{accessory}} tarsal navicular typically {{develops in}} young athletes. 6, 10, 13 The symptoms are exaggerated during exercise or walking, affecting the sports perform-ance of adolescent athletes. Nonoperative treatment con-sisting of rest and a shoe insert is usually {{effective in reducing}} the symptom, but it is often {{a waste of time}} for young elite athletes. Surgical resection of the accessory tarsal navicular, as described by Kidner, 3 is indicated when the symptoms persist for a long time. 1, 4, 10, 13 However, the surgical procedure often creates a defect in the poste-rior tibial tendon at its attachment to the primary navicu-lar. Bone union of the primary and accessory <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> during the natural course of development has been reported, 14 but such bone union rarely occurs in young active athletes, in our experience. We performed percuta-neous drilling of the accessory navicular synchondrosis to induce or to accelerate bone union between the primary and accessory <b>navicular</b> <b>bones.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the results of percutaneous drilling in a series of young athletes suffering from the symptomatic type II accessory tarsal navicular...|$|R

De Williams ran a further 864 km to Darwin before learning that she had broken both <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> in her feet and that surgery would be required.|$|R
25|$|With {{the long}} toe, low heel {{conformation}} can come contracted heels (narrowing of the heel) which further compresses the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> along with sheared heels adding more stress to the tendons and navicular bones.|$|E
25|$|Heel pain is {{very common}} in horses with navicular syndrome. Lameness may begin as mild and intermittent, and {{progress}} to severe. This {{may be due to}} strain and inflammation of the ligaments supporting the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone,</b> reduced blood flow and increased pressure within the hoof, damage to the navicular bursa or DDF tendon, or from cartilage erosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{first factor}} is {{compression}} of the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> under the DDF tendon {{and the back}} of the small pastern bone. Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less springy and shock-absorbing. It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, and to suggest similar therapeutic regimes.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionExhaustive {{biometric}} {{data of the}} talus and the <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> have not {{been reported in the}} classical anatomy treatises. HypothesisThe radiographic measurements, being variable according to the X-ray beam inclination, have no real value. This biometric analysis aimed to specify the characteristics of the constitutive bone components of the talonavicular joint. Material and methodsThis anatomic study investigated the biometry of the talus and the <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> separated from anatomic specimens with no previous disease history from adult subjects whose sex was unknown. It was completed by in situ dissection and evaluation of talonavicular and talocalcaneal joints conducted to gain an understanding of the bone specimens in three dimensions. The measurements were taken using a highly precise measuring tape and a comparator providing the length and the width of the articular surfaces. The comparator determined the surface pattern and the radii of curvature in the two main axes. ResultsThe results emphasize the variations in the bone specimens. Three morphotypes emerged, which had never been identified before. Discussion and conclusionThese {{biometric data}} make up a database designed to improve clinical exploration. They can be used as landmarks for fundamental comparative research between all the bone structures of the hindfoot and thus provide a logical classification of the different pathological conditions and a reasoned adaptation of therapeutic protocols.

50|$|The {{talonavicular}} and calcaneocuboid joints (i.e. {{between the}} talus and <b>navicular</b> <b>bones,</b> and the calcaneus and cuboid bones) form the so-called {{transverse tarsal joint}} or Chopart's joint. It has two axes of motion. Inversion and eversion occur about a longitudinal axis oriented 15 degrees upward from the horizontal plane and 9 degrees medially from the longitudinal axis of the foot. Flexion and extension occur primarily about an oblique axis oriented 52 degrees upward from the horizontal plane and 57 degrees anteromedially (forward-inward). In vitro talonavicular motion is 7 degrees flexion-extension and 17 degrees pronation-supination; while calcaneocuboid motion is 2 degrees flexion-extension and 7 degrees pronation-supination.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Studbook {{inspection}} (SBI) data of 20 768 German Warmblood mares and radiography results (RR) data of 5102 Hanoverian Warmblood {{horses were}} used for genetic correlation analyses. The scores {{on a scale from}} 0 to 10 were given for conformation and basic quality of gaits, resulting in 14 SBI traits which {{were used for}} the correlation analyses. The radiographic findings considered included osseous fragments in fetlock (OFF) and hock joints (OFH), deforming arthropathy in hock joints (DAH) and distinct radiographic findings in the <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> (DNB) which were analyzed as binary traits, and radiographic appearance of the <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> (RNB) which was analyzed as a quasi-linear trait. Genetic parameters were estimated multivariately in linear animal models with REML using information on 24 448 horses with SBI and/or RR records. The ranges of heritability estimates were h 2 = 0. 14 − 0. 34 for the RR traits and h 2 = 0. 09 − 0. 50 for the SBI traits. Negative additive genetic correlations of rg = − 0. 19 to − 0. 56 were estimated between OFF and conformation of front and hind limbs and walk at hand, and between DNB and hind limb conformation. There were indications of negative additive genetic correlations between DAH and all SBI traits, but because of low prevalence and low heritability of DAH, these results require further scrutiny. Positive additive genetic correlations of rg = 0. 37 − 0. 52 were estimated between OFF and withers height and between OFH and withers height, indicating that selection for taller horses will increase disposition to develop OFF and OFH. Selection of broodmares with regards to functional conformation will assist, but cannot replace possible selection against radiographic findings in the limbs of young Warmblood riding horses, particularly with regards to OFF...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{bone and}} articular morphology of the talus and navicular in clinically diagnosed flatfeet and evaluated their potential contribution to talo-navicular joint instability. We used CT images to develop 3 D models of talus and <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> of 10 clinically diagnosed flatfeet and 15 non-flatfeet. We quantified their global bone dimensions, inclination and {{dimensions of the}} articular surfaces and their curvatures. Additionally, ratios of six talar and navicular dimensions were calculated. The values for these parameters were then compared between both groups. In flatfeet, the talar head faced more proximal and its width was larger compared to non-flatfeet. Also the navicular cup faced more proximal and its depth was significantly increased. Furthermore, we observed a more protruding talar head compared to the navicular cup {{in the control group}} with the articular surface depth being relatively larger for the navicular cups when compared to the talus in flatfeet. The ratio of the talar and navicular articular surface height was decreased in flatfeet, suggesting increased height of navicular cups relative to the articulating talar heads. Our results show that flatfoot deformity is associated with morphological changes of talar and navicular articular surfaces that can favor medial arch collapse and forefoot abduction...|$|R
500|$|The {{anatomy of}} the forelegs begin at the scapula. This is the {{shoulder}} in which provides the ease of movement as it is connected to various bones surrounding it such as the cervical vertebra (a section of the spine). The next bone is the humerus which leads onto the radius below. The radius is then connected to {{the bones of the}} knee. The carpus is located at front of the knee and the pisiform is the back of the knee. Below the knee is the cannon bone which is also known as the 3rd metacarpal. 55 million years ago when the Eohippus existed, the cannon bone used to be the 3rd toe of the foot. It's fusion took place in order to increase height and power of the limb. Behind the cannon bone are the splint bones. The splint bones are also known as the 2nd and 4th metacarpal and fused 25 - 35 million years ago {{during the time of the}} Miohippus. They provide extra strength and support of the cannon bone and used to be the 2nd and 4th toes of the foot. Below the cannon bone is the fetlock joint in which lays a structure if many bones. Firstly are the sesamoid bones that act as part of the system that allows the leg to drop as pressure is applied and spring back up as pressure is released. Below this is the proximal phalanx also known as the long pastern which is followed by the middle phalanx (short pastern). Below these bones are the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> and the distal phalanx. the distal phalanx can be known as the coffin bone or the pedal bone. Below the <b>navicular</b> <b>bone</b> is the navicular bursa.|$|E

40|$|Syndactyly type II (synpolydactyly (SPD)) is an {{autosomal}} dominant condition with typical abnormalities of the distal parts of both {{upper and lower}} limbs. We report here a previously undescribed phenotypic feature of people with severe hand and foot deformities who were born to two affected parents. This is the first example of SPD subjects manifesting a very distinctive phenotype, suggesting {{that they must be}} homozygous for this condition. The typical characteristic clinical features in these subjects are as follows: (1) short hands with wrinkled fatty skin and short feet; (2) complete soft tissue syndactyly involving all four limbs; (3) polydactyly of the preaxial, mesoaxial, and postaxial digits of the hands; (4) loss of the normal tubular shape of the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones, so as to give polygonal structures; (5) loss of the typical structure of the cuboid and all three cuneiform bones while the talus calcaneus and <b>navicular</b> <b>bones</b> remain intact; (6) large bony islands instead of metatarsals, most probably because of cuboid-metatarsal and cuneiform-metatarsal fusions; and (7) severe middle phalangeal hypoplasia/aplasia as well as fusion of some phalangeal structures that are associated with the loss of normal phalangeal pattern. We report seven subjects with this phenotype from three different branches of a very large SPD pedigree exhibiting the same phenotype with minimal variation. In mice, the Polysyndactyly (Ps) mutation shows a pattern of synpolydactyly very similar to that of human SPD, suggesting that they may well be homologous mutations.
