40|$|To {{identify}} the signaling mechanisms and components {{that are involved}} in regulation of a promoter for a gene involved in a secondary pathway I studied the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>alkaloid</b> biosynthetic pathway using various N. tabacum tissues. Nicotine and tropane alkaloids are widely known to be synthesized predominantly in the roots of species that produce pyrrolinium ring containing alkaloids. Putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of these alkaloid secondary products and earlier studies have indicated that PMT gene expression is restricted to root tissue in Solanaceae plants. To further elucidate the factors that govern the regulation of alkaloid synthesis, expression patterns dictated by the 5 '-flankin...|$|E

40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies suggest}} that women who smoke have lower {{endogenous}} estrogen than nonsmokers. To explore the possible link between cigarette smoking and decreased endogenous estrogens, we have {{examined the effects of}} constituents of tobacco on estrogen production in human choriocarcinoma cells and term placental microsomes. In choriocarcinoma cell cultures, nicotine, cotinine (a major metabolite of nicotine), and anabasine (a minor component of cigarette tobacco) all inhibited androstenedione conversion to estrogen in a dose-dependent fashion. Removal of nicotine, cotinine, and anabasine from the culture medium resulted in the complete reversal of the inhibition of aromatase. In the choriocarcinoma cell cultures, a supraphysiologic concentration of androstenedione (73 microM) in the culture medium blocked the inhibition of aromatase caused by nicotine, cotinine, and anabasine. In preparations of term placental microsomes, nicotine, cotinine, and anabasine inhibited the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. Kinetic analysis demonstrated the inhibition to be competitive with respect to the substrate. These findings suggest that some <b>nicotinic</b> <b>alkaloids</b> directly inhibit aromatase. This mechanism may explain, in part, the decreased estrogen observed in women who smoke...|$|R
40|$|Small {{peptides}} play {{important roles}} in the signalling cascades that steer plant growth, development and defence, and often crosstalk with hormonal signalling. Thereby, they also modulate metabolism, including the production of bioactive molecules that are of high interest for human applications. Yew species (Taxus spp.) produce diterpenes such as the powerful anticancer agent paclitaxel, the biosynthesis {{of which can be}} stimulated by the hormone jasmonate, both in whole plants and cell suspension cultures. Here, we identified Taximin, as a gene encoding a hitherto unreported, plant-specific, small, cysteine-rich signalling peptide, through a transcriptome survey of jasmonate-elicited T. baccata suspension cells grown in two-media cultures. Taximin expression increased in a coordinated manner with that of paclitaxel biosynthesis genes. Tagged Taximin peptides were shown to enter the secretory system and localize to the plasma membrane. In agreement with this, the exogenous application of synthetic Taximin peptide variants could transiently modulate the biosynthesis of taxanes in T. baccata cell suspension cultures. Importantly, the Taximin peptide is widely conserved in the higher plant kingdom {{with a high degree of}} sequence conservation. Accordingly, Taximin overexpression could stimulate the production of <b>nicotinic</b> <b>alkaloids</b> in Nicotiana tabacum hairy root cultures in a synergistic manner with jasmonates. In contrast, no pronounced effects of Taximin overexpression on the specialized metabolism in Medicago truncatula roots were observed. This study increases our understanding of the regulation of Taxus diterpene biosynthesis in particular and plant metabolism in general. Ultimately, Taximin might increase the practical potential of metabolic engineering of medicinal plants...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A low {{loading of}} a quinine-derived squaramide {{efficiently}} catalyzes the triple-domino Michael/aza-Henry/ cyclization reaction between 1, 3 -dicarbonyl compounds, β-nitroolefins, and aldimines to provide tetrahydropyridines bearing three contiguous stereogenic centers in good yields, excellent enantiomeric excesses, {{and up to}} high diastereomeric ratios. The tetrahydropyridine ring belongs to a widespreadsubstructure in naturally occurring compounds and some synthetic bioactive molecules. 1 The tetrahydropyridine I is an aroma compound generated from the Maillard reaction (Figure 1). 2 Arecoline II is a <b>nicotinic</b> acid based <b>alkaloid</b> possessing a stimulating effect due its agonistic influence on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. 3 Betanin III, a plant pigment, is another natural product containing a tetrahydropyridine unit used as a food additive. 4 The synthetic tetrahydropyridine derivative I...|$|R
30|$|In our study, AA {{belonging}} to the glutamate family showed a strong positive accumulation in response to drought in both, shoots and roots, with the highest log 2 FC observed for proline (4.9 -log 2 FC) followed by arginine (4.1 -log 2 FC), the intermediate ornithine (3.8 -log 2 FC) and glutamate (2.2 -log 2 FC). In contrast to these AA, glutamine showed a positive accumulation (3.1 -log 2 FC) mainly in roots (Fig.  3). Increased levels were also observed for other metabolites related to the family, such as GABA (2 -log 2 FC) and urea (2.6 -log 2 FC). AAs {{belonging to}} the aspartate family overall increased under drought in both, shoots and roots, with asparagine increasing the most (5.5 -log 2 FC), followed by threonine (3.7 -log 2 FC), lysine (3.3 -log 2 FC), aspartate (3.2 -log 2 FC) and methionine (2.7 -log 2 FC). Interestingly, aspartate, asparagine and the lysine-related metabolite hydroxylysine showed a relatively higher accumulation in roots than in shoots (Fig.  3). The latter, for example, accumulated up to 4.2 -log 2 FC in roots, while it was only up to 1.7 -log 2 FC in shoots. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) presented similar positive accumulations in both tissues under stress (leucine: 2.1 -log 2 FC, valine: 2.2 -log 2 FC, isoleucine: 2.9 -log 2 FC). Within the serine family, serine showed a positive (2.8 -log 2 FC) accumulation in shoots and roots, while the intermediate O-acetyl serine (OAS) increased in roots (2.2 -log 2 FC) but decreased in shoots (− 1.4 -log 2 FC), especially in the intolerant genotypes IR 64 and IR 74 (Fig.  3). Among the aromatic AA, only phenylalanine showed a consistent accumulation (2.2 -log 2 FC) under drought in all genotypes and tissues, while changes in tryptophan were genotype specific with high accumulation in shoots of the tolerant genotypes (> 3 -log 2 FC) but in roots of the intolerant genotypes (> 2 -log 2 FC). Tissue-specific accumulation under stress was also observed for three amino sugars (N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-galactosamine and N-acetyl-mannosamine) which increased specifically in drought stressed shoots (up to 1.9 -log 2 FC). In contrast, the pyridine <b>alkaloids</b> <b>nicotinic</b> acid increased (1.9 -log 2 FC) and pyridoxamine decreased (− 1.2 -log 2 FC) specifically in roots.|$|R
