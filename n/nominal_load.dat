In particular two different design solutions have been analyzed, both patent pending, one characterized by a conformal contact of two conic surfaces {{and the other one}} by a non-conformal contact between a cone and a sphere. Pressure distribution, contact width and von Mises equivalent stress have been calculated and employed as comparison parameters. Two different loading conditions have been considered: <b>nominal</b> <b>loads</b> and <b>nominal</b> <b>loads</b> plus undesired effects. Also deviations from the nominal geometry, obtained from profile detection of 40 samples, have been introduced for considering a real-like case.

40|$|Induction {{machines}} {{usually have}} a reduced efficiency when supplied with non linear currents. Most of the induction machines are not used at <b>nominal</b> <b>loading,</b> but at a 60 % loading rate. In the paper it will be shown that derating factors for induction motors fed with nonlinear currents, like the NEMA MG 1 or the IEC 60034 - 17, are correct for <b>nominal</b> <b>loading.</b> At lower loading these derating factors can underestimate the losses. The measurements shown in this paper indicate that for low loading percentages, the phase angles of the harmonics have a significant influence on the peak induction and therefore the saturation level of the induction machine. For low loading rates the constant losses, including the magnetization losses, are the dominant losses. For a correct estimation of the losses for motors working at low loading conditions, the phase of the harmonics {{has to be taken}} in account...|$|R

A two area power system comprises power generations from hydro, thermal and gas sources in area- 1 and power generations from hydro and thermal sources in area- 2. All the power generation units from different sources {{are equipped with}} speed governors. A continuous time transfer function model of the system for studying dynamic response for small load disturbances is presented. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) automatic generation control scheme is applied only to power generations from thermal and gas sources and power generation from hydro source is allowed to operate at its scheduled level with only speed governor control. The two area power system is simulated for different <b>nominal</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain the optimal PID gains for various cases using integral squared error plus integral time absolute error (ISE+ITAE) performance index for fitness evaluation.

40|$|HIPed (Hot Isostatically Pressed) {{silicon nitride}} ball blanks were lapped from {{diameter}} 13. 255 mm to diameter 12. 7 mm by a novel eccentric lapping machine. A maximum {{material removal rate}} of 68 μm/hour has been achieved under a <b>nominal</b> lapping <b>load</b> of 43 N/ball. It {{was found that the}} material removal rate was increasing almost linearly with the lapping load within this load range. When the lapping load was higher than 43 N/ball, the material removal rate started to drop and the lapped ball roundness error started to increase. At the highest <b>nominal</b> lapping <b>load</b> of 107 N/ball, surface and subsurface damages were found on the lapped balls. Because of eccentric loading effect, the actual load on individual ball could be 25 ~ 28 % higher than the <b>nominal</b> lapping <b>load.</b> The surface residual stresses of lapped balls under different lapping loads were measured, and {{it was found that the}} lapping load had less effect than previous HIP process. Rolling contact fatigue tests were conducted on balls lapped at <b>nominal</b> <b>loads</b> of 43 N/ball and 107 N/ball. No failure occurred on the ball lapped at 43 N/ball after 138 million stress cycles. Ball lapped at 107 N/ball was failed after 13. 3 million stress cycles with a shallow spall with flat bottom inside.
