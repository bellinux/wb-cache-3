25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (<b>non-synchromesh)</b> transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension was leaf spring, tracks by vertical volute spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic, steering manual, without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|E

50|$|Heavy-duty {{transmissions}} {{are almost}} always <b>non-synchromesh.</b> One argument is synchromesh adds weight that could be payload, is {{one more thing to}} fail, and drivers spend thousands of hours driving so can take the time to learn to drive efficiently with a <b>non-synchromesh</b> transmission. Heavy-duty trucks driven frequently in city traffic, such as cement mixers, need to be shifted very often and in stop-and-go traffic. Since few heavy-duty transmissions have synchromesh, automatic transmissions are commonly used instead, despite their increased weight, cost, and loss of efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Some {{clutches}} are {{not designed}} to slip; torque may only be transmitted either fully engaged or disengaged to avoid catastrophic damage. An {{example of this is}} the dog clutch, most commonly used in <b>non-synchromesh</b> transmissions.|$|E
50|$|All Mules had three-speed manual, <b>non-synchromesh</b> {{transmissions}} with two-speed transfer cases, {{and were}} four-wheel drive vehicles.All Mules except the A5 variants had four-wheel steering.Only the A5 variants had electric ignition as standard.They had no suspension {{aside from the}} low-pressure tires and the seat cushions.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{flexibly}} {{mounted in the}} chassis to reduce vibration and a freewheel device was fitted to help gear changing on the <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox and save fuel, a 15% improvement in economy was claimed. The freewheel {{would continue to be}} a feature of some Rovers until 1959.|$|E
50|$|The chassis had a rigid {{front axle}} {{supported}} by half-elliptic springs and a live rear axle with Austin 7-like quarter-elliptics, allowing the chassis side members to finish {{ahead of the}} rear axle. The three-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox was mounted in unit with the engine and transmitted power to the worm gear final drive via a torque tube. The electrical system was 6 volts.|$|E
5000|$|The chassis {{featured}} half elliptic {{leaf springs}} {{front and rear}} with beam axles. The front-mounted flat-twin engine produced [...] and drove the rear wheels through a three speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox. In 1950 the engine was updated to give [...] and synchromesh was fitted to the top ratio. This improved the top speed to 53 mph. The 10 in drum brakes were operated mechanically using a Girling system.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{heavy vehicle}} {{transmission}} condition for a license class HC, HR, or MC test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission; a driver's license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission. To have the condition removed, a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with <b>non-synchromesh</b> transmission (constant mesh or crash box).|$|E

5000|$|Semi-automatic {{transmissions}} {{have also}} {{made their way into}} the truck and bus market in the early 2000s. Volvo offers its I-Shift on its heavier trucks and buses, while ZF markets its ASTronic system for trucks, buses and coaches. In North America, Eaton offers the [...] "AutoShift" [...] system which is an add-on to traditional <b>non-synchromesh</b> manual transmissions for heavy trucks. These gearboxes have a place in public transport as they have been shown to reduce fuel consumption in some specific cases.|$|E
5000|$|Design of {{the vehicle}} began at the White Motor Company, based in Cleveland, in 1937. It had [...]25 in face-hardened armor, {{full-time}} four-wheel drive (with no way to disengage it), four-speed manual constant-mesh (<b>non-synchromesh)</b> transmission (with one reverse gear) and two-speed transfer case, leaf spring suspension, manual steering, and (unusual for the period) vacuum-assisted (power) brakes. The wheelbase was 131 in, tread 65.25 in. The wheels were 8.5 in wide, 20 in diameter, and used standard 12-ply military non-directional tires. Fuel capacity was 30 gal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded by {{engineer}} Geoffrey Taylor in Surbiton, Surrey, and produced its first automobile in 1929. Alta's first vehicle was a sports car powered by a 1.1L engine, featuring an aluminium block, wet liners, and shaft-driven twin overhead camshafts, which Taylor designed himself. It was offered in naturally aspirated or supercharged form giving [...] A choice of four speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> or pre-selector gearboxes was available. These were mounted on a low-slung chassis frame with open two- or four-seat bodies. Thirteen were made, of which five are thought to survive.|$|E
5000|$|This 2-door {{sports car}} used a smaller {{version of the}} 6-cylinder {{overhead}} camshaft, crossflow engine which now had a capacity of 1086 cc with a bore of 57 mm and stroke of 71 mm and produced [...] at 5500 rpm. It was previously fitted in the 1930 Wolseley Hornet and the 1931 MG F-type Magna. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox. The chassis was a narrower version of that used in the K-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs all round with rigid front and rear axles.|$|E

The chassis was based on the one used in the 1928 Morris Minor with lowered suspension using half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction disk shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and bolt on wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 78 inches (1980 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm).|$|E
50|$|Even though {{automobile}} and light truck transmissions are now almost universally synchronized, transmissions for heavy trucks and machinery, motorcycles, and for dedicated racing are usually not. Non-synchronized transmission designs {{are used for}} several reasons. The friction material, such as brass, in synchronizers is more prone to wear and breakage than gears, which are forged steel, and {{the simplicity of the}} mechanism improves reliability and reduces cost. In addition, the process of shifting a synchromesh transmission is slower than that of shifting a <b>non-synchromesh</b> transmission. For racing of production-based transmissions, sometimes half the teeth on the dog clutches are removed to speed the shifting process, at the expense of greater wear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a further {{development}} of the 1271 cc 6-cylinder KD series overhead camshaft engine used in the K-type and originally used in the 1930 Wolseley Hornet. Modifications {{were made to the}} cylinder block and head and fitted with twin SU carburettors it produced [...] at 5500 rpm, a near 25% improvement. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox. The car had a wheelbase of 96 inches (2439 mm) and a track of 45 inches (1143 mm). Semi elliptic leaf springs, wider and longer than those used on previous cars, were fitted all round and the body was mounted to the chassis using rubber pads.|$|E
50|$|All MGBs from 1962 to 1967 used a four-speed {{manual gearbox}} with a <b>non-synchromesh,</b> straight-cut first gear. Optional {{overdrive}} was available. This gearbox {{was based on}} that used in the MGA with some minor upgrades {{to cope with the}} additional output of the larger MGB engine. In 1968 the early gearbox was replaced by a full synchromesh unit based on the MGC gearbox. This unit was designed to handle the 150net bhp of the three-litre engine of the MGC and was thus over-engineered when mated with the standard MGB B-Series engine. The same transmission was used in the 3.5-litre V8 version of the MGB-GT-V8. An automatic three-speed transmission was also offered as a factory option, but was unpopular.|$|E
50|$|A {{constant-mesh}} transmission {{offers several}} advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the dog clutch {{is designed for}} the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, the dog clutch is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of the engaging parts are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a <b>non-synchromesh</b> transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Third, a constant-mesh transmission can easily use helical gears which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fourth, a constant-mesh transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.|$|E
5000|$|The Series 1 cars, {{which are}} by far the most valuable, {{essentially}} fall into two categories: Those made between 1961 and 1964, which had 3.8-litre engines and <b>non-synchromesh</b> transmissions, and those made between 1965-1967, which increased engine size and torque by around 10%, added a fully synchronised transmission, and also provided new reclining seats, an alternator in place of the prior generator, an electrical system switched to negative earth, and other modern amenities, all while keeping the same classic Series 1 styling. The 4.2-litre Series 1 E-Types also replaced the brake servo of the 3.8-litre with a more reliable unit. [...] "The 4.2 became the most desirable version of the famous E-Type due to their increased power and usability while retaining the same outward appearance as the earlier cars." ...|$|E
5000|$|The first 12/50s were {{produced}} in late 1923 for the 1924 model year. The cars from this {{first year of}} production were designated SA and SB, and had a 1496 cc 4-cylinder overhead valve engine in a chassis with a wheelbase of 108.5 in for the SA, and 112.5 in for the SB. The engines of these early cars were carried in a subframe bolted to the relatively slender ladder chassis. The SA usually carried two-seat bodywork, typically the Super Sports 2/3-seater nicknamed [...] "duck's back" [...] because of its pointed rear end, said to resemble that of a duck. The SA and SB 12/50s were built with (twin shoed) brakes on the rear wheels only. All the 12/50s had a four speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox with right hand change. The cars were right hand drive.|$|E
50|$|The MG J-type is {{a sports}} car that was {{produced}} by MG from 1932 to 1934. This 2-door sports car used {{an updated version of}} the overhead camshaft, crossflow engine, used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 and previously fitted in the MG M-type Midget of 1929 to 1932, driving the rear wheels through a four-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox. The chassis was from the D-Type with suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers all round with rigid front and rear axles. The car had a wheelbase of 86 inches (2184 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). Most cars were open two-seaters, but a closed salonette version of the J1 was also made, and some chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders. The open cars can be distinguished from the M type by having cut-away tops to the doors.|$|E
5000|$|The car used a tuned short-stroke (73 mm) {{version of}} the bevel gear driven {{overhead}} camshaft engine from the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor and a new crankshaft producing [...] at 6400 rpm. It could from 1932 be had with the crossflow head to be seen later on the MG J-type and a Powerplus supercharger version was also available with [...] at 6500 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox. The chassis was new and {{took the form of}} a ladder frame with tubular cross members and passed under the rear axle. The suspension used half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and centre lock wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 81 inches (2057 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm).|$|E
5000|$|The car {{used the}} M-Type 847 cc engine that {{was derived from}} the {{overhead}} camshaft engine from the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor producing [...] at 4500 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox with a four-speed gearbox was an option on later cars. The chassis came from the C-Type and took the form of a ladder frame with tubular cross members and passed under the rear axle. The suspension used half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and centre lock wire wheels, the brakes were cable operated with eight-inch (203 mm) drums. At 84 inches (2134 mm), 86 inches (2184 mm) after the first 100 cars, the wheelbase was longer than the C-Type to cater for the larger body, but the track remained the same at 42 inches (1067 mm).|$|E
5000|$|Looking {{for a car}} to {{fill the}} gap between the M-Type Midget and the 18/80, MG turned to another of the engines that had become {{available}} from William Morris's acquisition of Wolseley. This was the 1271 cc 6-cylinder version of the overhead camshaft engine used in the 1929 MG M type Midget and previously seen in the 1930 Wolseley Hornet and had dummy side covers to disguise its origins. Fitted with 1 in twin SU carburettors it produced [...] at 4100 rpm at first, later increased to [...] by revising the valve timing. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox of ENV manufacture. The chassis was a 10 in longer version of the one from the MG D-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers all round with rigid front and rear axles. Wire wheels with 4.00 x 19 tyres and centre lock fixing were used. The car had a wheelbase of 94 in and a track of 42 in.|$|E
50|$|The MG P-type is {{a sports}} car that was {{produced}} by MG from 1934 to 1936. This 2-door sports car used {{an updated version of}} the overhead camshaft, crossflow engine, used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 and previously fitted in the J-type Midget of 1932 to 1934, driving the rear wheels through a four-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox. The chassis was a strengthened and slightly longer version of that used in the J-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs all round with rigid front and rear axles. Steering was initially by a Marles Weller and later a Bishop Cam system. The two-seat car had a wheelbase of 87 inches (2210 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). Most cars were open two seaters, but streamlined Airline coupé bodies were also made. The P-type was also available as a four-seater, a car that suffered from a lack of power and poor rear ground clearance. Whereas J, K and L-type MGs differentiated between versions with the use of numbers, with 1 indicating a four-seater (i.e., J1) and 2 a two-seater (i.e., J2), {{this was not the case}} with the P-type (or its six-cylinder sister, the N-type Magnette), and there is no clue to the type in the name.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrari's {{response}} {{for the new}} Italian Gran Tursimo Internazionale championship in 1951 was the road/race Ferrari 212. Twenty-seven short-wheelbase competition versions called Export, some with increasingly popular gran turismo-style berlinetta coupé coachwork, were produced for enthusiasts (Ferrari called the very first example 212 MM) while the road verson was called Inter. The Ferrari 212 Export featured long-range fuel tanks, high compression pistons and triple Weber 32 DCF carburettors; power was 170 bhp from the 2600cc Gioacchino Colombo-designed 'short-block' V12 engine, evolved from the earlier Ferrari 166 (2000cc) and 195 (2300cc). All versions came with the standard Ferrari five-speed <b>non-synchromesh</b> gearbox and hydraulic drum brakes. [...] All 1951 Ferraris shared a double tube frame chassis design evolved from the 166. Double-wishbone front suspension with transverse leaf spring, and live rear axle with semi-elliptic leaf springs and radius rods were employed. The Ferrari 212 Export (212 MM) gran turismo berlinetta (chassis no. 0070M) debuted in first-place overall at the April 1951 Coppa Inter-Europa, driven by Luigi Villoresi, and in June (chassis no. 0092E) was first in the Gran Turismo category at the Coppa della Toscana driven by Milanese Ferrari concessionaire and proprietor of Scuderia Guastalla, Franco Cornacchia. The 212 Export continued to serve Ferrari well in the Sports and GT categories until replaced by the 225 S, and although it would later be overshadowed by the internationally famous 250 GT, the 212 Export was an important model in the successful line of Colombo-engined V12 GT cars that made Ferrari legendary.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{particular}} note is {{that the}} innovative aluminum Buick-built 215 in³ (3.5 L) V8 was optional in the Tempest in 1961 and 1962. (This also had {{first appeared in the}} LeSabre.) It is estimated that just 3,662 Tempests were ordered with the 215 engine, or about 1% of production. This motor produced, in its various incarnations, from [...] despite weighing just 330 lb installed. The Pontiac 215 blocks are distinct from other Buick 215 blocks because in addition to the factory Buick markings they were hand-stamped at the Pontiac plant with the Vehicle Identification Numbers of the individual cars they were installed in. Thus, in 1961 all Pontiac 215 blocks begin [...] "161P"; the 1962 cars, [...] "162P". Further code numbers told whether the car had an automatic or manual transmission. In 1961, this would have been either a three-speed column-shifted manual with a <b>non-synchromesh</b> first gear or a two-speed automatic controlled by a small lever on the dash {{to the right of the}} ignition. This automatic—called [...] "TempesTorque" [...] in company literature but unmarked on the unit itself until 1963—was a type of Powerglide similar to, but sharing very few parts with, the one in the Chevrolet Corvair. (The next year, a floor-mounted, fully synchronized four-speed manual was added.) At its introduction, the Tempest was only available as a four-door pillared sedan and as a Safari station wagon. A pair of two-door coupes, one of which was named LeMans, were added at the end of 1961, both in the 1961 body style.|$|E
