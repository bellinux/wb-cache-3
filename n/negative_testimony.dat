60|$|But let us {{now turn}} to an {{instance}} apparently not very dissimilar to this. Mankind were wrong, it seems, in concluding that all swans were white: are we also wrong, when we conclude that all men’s heads grow above their shoulders, and never below, {{in spite of the}} conflicting testimony of the naturalist Pliny? As there were black swans, though civilized people had existed for three thousand years on the earth without meeting with them, may there not also be “men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders,” notwithstanding a rather less perfect unanimity of <b>negative</b> <b>testimony</b> from observers? Most persons would answer No; it was more credible that a bird should vary in its color, than that men should vary in the relative position of their principal organs. And {{there is no doubt that}} in so saying they would be right: but to say why they are right, would be impossible, without entering more deeply than is usually done, into the true theory of Induction.|$|E
60|$|The debt thus exonerated of {{so great}} a weight of its odium, and {{otherwise}} reduced from its alarming bulk, the agents {{thought they might}} venture to print {{a list of the}} creditors. This was done {{for the first time in}} the year 1783, during the Duke of Portland's administration. In this list the name of Benfield was not to be seen. To this strong <b>negative</b> <b>testimony</b> was added the further testimony of the Nabob of Arcot. That prince[62] (or rather Mr. Benfield for him) writes to the Court of Directors a letter[63] full of complaints and accusations against Lord Macartney, conveyed in such terms as were natural for one of Mr. Benfield's habits and education to employ. Amongst the rest he is made to complain of his Lordship's endeavoring to prevent an intercourse of politeness and sentiment between him and Mr. Benfield; and to aggravate the affront, he expressly declares Mr. Benfield's visits to be only on account of respect and of gratitude, as no pecuniary transaction subsisted between them.|$|E
60|$|I {{have noticed}} two main evils in philosophizing. The first is, {{the absurdity of}} {{demanding}} proof for the very facts which constitute the nature of him who demands it,--a proof for those primary and unceasing revelations of self-consciousness, which every possible proof must pre-suppose; reasoning, for instance, 'pro' and 'con', concerning {{the existence of the}} power of reasoning. Other truths may be ascertained; but these are certainty itself (all at least which we mean by the word), and are the measure of every thing else which we deem certain. The second evil is, that of mistaking for such facts mere general prejudices, and those opinions that, having been habitually taken for granted, are dignified with the name of common sense. Of these, the first is the more injurious to the reputation, the latter more detrimental to the progress of philosophy. In the affairs of common life we very properly appeal to common sense; but it is absurd to reject the results of the microscope from the <b>negative</b> <b>testimony</b> of the naked eye. Knives are sufficient for the table and the market;--but for the purposes of science we must dissect with the lancet.|$|E

40|$|The {{launching}} and {{establishment of a}} social problem: An analysis of the debate on Swedish national level gymnastics in Dagens Nyheter 2012 - 2013 In 2012 Sweden’s largest daily newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, published a number of articles {{on the state of}} affairs in Swedish national level gymnastics. In these articles, ex-gymnasts, coaches, parents and physicians stepped forward and testified about recurrent wrongdoings and abuse against young (particularly) female gymnasts. In response to the criticism, the accused coaches and representatives of the Swedish Gymnastics Federation downsized or dismissed the criticism as inaccurate. This being said, and using discursive psychology and a qualitative design, this article sheds light upon this debate – by viewing it as a struggle between a hegemonic discourse of ”the goodness” of sports, on the one hand, a number of unfavorable and <b>negative</b> <b>testimonies</b> of the state of affairs in Swedish national level gymnastics on the other. More concretely, this struggle has been analyzed with regard to the discursive and rhetoric resources the involved parties’ used to pursue their claims about the state of affairs in Swedish national level gymnastics and the impact these resources had for their credibility and legitimacy. Questions were: Who is entitled ”to spell out” their view on the state of affairs within Swedish national level gymnastics? What is mediated and how? How are descriptions and accounts about reality constructed as credible and factual? It is concluded that social problems are launched via co-production; in this process, the gymnastics community, the research community, single individuals, and the media – were co-actors.   Sociologisk Forsknings digitala arkiv</p...|$|R
40|$|Archilochus’ {{life and}} the lethal effects of his poetry are legendary. Lycambes, having promised his {{daughter}} Neoboule in marriage to Archilochus, breaks his oath. Archilochus writes venomous iambics against Lycambes and his daughters who commit suicide out of shame. Because obscene, base, and potentially murderous subject matter were apparently ubiquitous in the poetry of Archilochus, he developed {{a reputation for being}} a lewd, slanderous, dangerous poet. The negative reception of Archilochus’ poetry was more prevalent than the positive one based on the quantity of <b>negative</b> <b>testimonies</b> to Archilochus and his reputation as an iambic poet. 1 A comparison of citations of Archilochus to fragments of his poetry which survive in papyri suggest that citations of Archilochus misrepresent his work. He wrote in the genre of blame poetry using poetic devices to make his rebukes an art form rather than pure slander. Above all, he was not merely an iambic poet; some of his poetry is martial in content. Archilochus was noteworthy for his innovations in and ‘refinement’ of different meters. In contrast to the conventions of later poetry, Archilochus’ meter does not restrict his subject matter. His tetrameters can be ‘iambic’ in nature. His iambic trimeter {{does not have to be}} invective. Thus, when looking at fragments of Archilochus’ work in iambic trimeter (or any other meter), it is necessary to keep in mind that meter does not necessarily correspond with subject matter or poetic genre [...] . Chapter 1 of this paper looks at the negative attitudes toward Archilochus and his poetry through the lens of Plato’s Republic [...] . Chapter 2 presents the opposing opinion expressed in the testimonies to Archilochus in a similar way to Chapter 1 [...] . Chapter 3 examines the corpus of Archilochus as fragments in order to support the interpretation of Archilochus’ style and content offered in the first chapter...|$|R
6000|$|Apparently by {{this time}} Captain Porteous had began to doubt the propriety of his own conduct, and the {{reception}} he met with from the magistrates was such as to make him still more anxious to gloss it over. He denied that he had given orders to fire; he denied he had fired with his own hand; he even produced the fusee which he carried as an officer for examination; it was found still loaded. Of three cartridges which he was seen to put in his pouch that morning, two were still there; a white handkerchief was thrust into the muzzle of the piece, and re-turned unsoiled or blackened. To the defence founded on these circumstances it was answered, that Porteous had not used his own piece, but had been seen to take one from a soldier. Among the many {{who had been killed}} and wounded by the unhappy fire, there were several of better rank; for even the humanity of such soldiers as fired {{over the heads of the}} mere rabble around the scaffold, proved in some instances fatal to persons who were stationed in windows, or observed the melancholy scene from a distance. The voice of public indignation was loud and general; and, ere men's tempers had time to cool, the trial of Captain Porteous took place before the High Court of Justiciary. After a long and patient hearing, the jury had the difficult duty of balancing the positive evidence of many persons, and those of respectability, who deposed positively to the prisoner's commanding his soldiers to fire, and himself firing his piece, of which some swore that they saw the smoke and flash, and beheld a man drop at whom it was pointed, with the <b>negative</b> <b>testimony</b> of others, who, though well stationed for seeing what had passed, neither heard Porteous give orders to fire, nor saw him fire himself; but, on the contrary, averred that the first shot was fired by a soldier who stood close by him. A great part of his defence was also founded on the turbulence of the mob, which witnesses, according to their feelings, their predilections, and their opportunities of observation, represented differently; some describing as a formidable riot, what others represented as a trifling disturbance such as always used to take place on the like occasions, when the executioner of the law, and the men commissioned to protect him in his task, were generally exposed to some indignities. The verdict of the jury sufficiently shows how the evidence preponderated in their minds. It declared that John Porteous fired a gun among the people assembled at the execution; that he gave orders to his soldiers to fire, by which many persons were killed and wounded; but, at the same time, that the prisoner and his guard had been wounded and beaten, by stones thrown at them by the multitude. Upon this verdict, the Lords of Justiciary passed sentence of death against Captain John Porteous, adjudging him, in the common form, to be hanged on a gibbet at the common place of execution, on Wednesday, 8th September 1736, and all his movable property to be forfeited to the king's use, according to the Scottish law in cases of wilful murder.* ...|$|E

50|$|With no useful {{information}} {{coming from his}} sources, the investigation turned to former schoolmates and employers, encountering no information. No <b>negative</b> <b>testimony</b> came from those interviewed and the police concluded that he was most likely influenced by desperation brought forth by debt. Millan and Duffy pressures César Carmona, {{an old friend of}} Gerena and godfather of one of his daughters, who insisted that he would only do something like this for the benefit of a cause that he considered worthy, and let them know that he strongly supported Puerto Rican independence. Further into the interrogation, he noted that Gerena had asked for his pickup truck the night before the heist but the request did not go trough. This alarmed the authorities, who mistrusted Carmona due to a past of arrests related to political activism and requested a polygraph test which was negative. In October, with no further leads, Millan and Duffy went to Carmona's house, only to be told to come back with a warrant. Months later, while Carmona was facing an unrelated legal case, Millan and Duffy tried to convince him to talk about Gerena in exchange for the charges being dropped. This tactic failed when the charges were dropped and the agents offered him Gerena's bounty instead, which he also declined. Both the police and Wells Fargo were hounded by hoaxers trying to impede their progress and mock the authorities, with the company eventually closing its local operation.|$|E
40|$|Retouching {{glass plate}} negatives was a {{practice}} that emerged {{about the same time}} as the glass plate negative itself. How was photography being retouched in the early 20 th century? Today there are generally available known digital tools. A hundred years ago, the retouching was done by hand, by the photographer, or by specific professionals that don’t distance themselves, in technical demand, of the arts of drawing and painting. But the retouching was invisible in the final object, because the changes were done on the negative. Its contemporary books, in the form of manuals, are a window to the past telling us about the techniques and materials used. Existing archive collections of photographic glass plate <b>negatives</b> are <b>testimony</b> to the expertise of photographers and the practical use of those books. The present work will show examples of tools and materials used for retouching of photographic glass plate negatives, taking as an example a portrait collection at the Photographic Archive of Lisbon. Also some considerations are done about the conservation of retouched glass plate negatives in archive collections. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

It would, in fact, be unworthy of serious refutation, except for the general and natural belief that deliberate and reiterated assertions must have some foundation.|$|R
60|$|The {{flying fish}} are {{fish out of}} water in a {{somewhat}} different and more transitory sense. Their aërial excursions are brief and rapid; they can only fly a very little way, and have soon to take once more for safety to their own more natural and permanent element. More than forty kinds of the family are known, in appearance very much like English herrings, but with the front fins expanded and modified into veritable wings. It is fashionable nowadays among naturalists to assert that the flying fish don't fly; that they merely jump horizontally out of the water with a powerful impulse, and fall again as soon as the force of the first impetus is entirely spent. When men endeavour to persuade you to such folly, believe them not. For my own part, I have seen the flying fish fly--deliberately fly, and flutter, and rise again, and change the direction of their flight in mid-air, exactly after the fashion of a big dragonfly. If the other people who have watched them haven't succeeded in seeing them fly, that is their own fault, or at least their own misfortune; perhaps their eyes weren't quick enough to catch the rapid, though to me perfectly recognisable, hovering and fluttering of the gauze-like wings; but I have seen them myself, and I maintain that on such a question one piece of positive evidence is a great deal better than a hundred <b>negative.</b> The <b>testimony</b> of all the witnesses who didn't see the murder committed is as nothing compared with the single testimony of the one man who really did see it. And in this case I have met with many other quick observers who fully agreed with me, against the weight of scientific opinion, that they have seen the flying fish really fly with their own eyes, and no mistake about it. The German professors, indeed, all think otherwise; but then the German professors all wear green spectacles, which are the outward and visible sign of 'blinded eyesight poring over miserable books.' The unsophisticated vision of the noble British seaman is unanimously with me on the matter of the reality of the fishes' flight.|$|R
5000|$|Of the Apology for Origen {{only the}} first book is extant, in a Latin version made by Rufinus. It begins with {{describing}} the extravagant bitterness of the feeling against Origen. He {{was a man of}} deep humility, of great authority in the Church of his day, and honoured with the priesthood. He was above all things anxious to keep to the rule of faith that had come down from the Apostles. The soundness of his doctrine concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation is then vindicated by copious extracts from his writings. Then nine charges against his teaching are confronted with passages from his works. Saint Jerome stated in his De Viris illustribus that there were two apologies - one by Pamphilus and another by Eusebius. He discovered his mistake when Rufinus's translation appeared in the height of the controversy over Origen, and rushed to the conclusion that Eusebius was the sole author. He charged Rufinus, among other things, with palming off under the name of the martyr what was really the work of the heterodox Eusebius, and with suppressing unorthodox passages. As to the first accusation there is abundant evidence that the Apology was the joint work of Pamphilus and Eusebius. Against the second may be set the <b>negative</b> <b>testimony</b> of Photius who had read the original; [...] "Photius, who was severe to excess towards the slightest semblance of Arianism, remarked no such taint in the Apology of Origen which he had read in Greek." [...] The canons of the alleged Council of the Apostles at Antioch were ascribed by their compiler (late fourth century) to Pamphilus.|$|E

40|$|The {{advertising}} {{industry is}} a human enterprise at its core, constantly relying on and affecting human thoughts and behaviors. Advertisements for products and services reflect cultural messages and the values that shape our daily lives. This two-part article first offers a literature review {{of the effect of}} antismoking ads on teenagers’ behavior and attitudes towards smoking across Western, English-speaking societies within a cultural psychology framework. Then, it applies the themes from this literature review in presenting the results of a qualitative study exploring how employees at gyro, a business-to-business advertising agency, incorporate cultural thinking into their advertising process. Conclusions drawn in my review indicate that visceral <b>negative</b> and personal <b>testimonies</b> appealing to the emotions of a teenage audience positively affect youth and discourage them from smoking across cultures. Moreover, the digital age is transforming youth culture because adolescents are increasingly interacting by sharing posts and photos online via social media. Consequently, stronger reliance on online communication can extensively impact communities by closing some of the major cultural gaps. The review indicates that youth antismoking advertising evolves as a subculture {{in much the same way}} that larger cultures do. The qualitative study complements this underlying cultural evolution by demonstrating that advertisers actually do use methods of advancing culture in their work. In fact, the study reveals that culture is central to the creative advertising process. For instance, advertisers adjust the content of a message depending on whether a client is asking for a global, national, or regional campaign, in order to appeal to the right audience and deliver interesting and emotional experiences. Advertisers use tools, drawing from cultural psychology, to make their messages maximally effective and attractive. It is important to understand culture in order to create connections between societies around the globe within the world of advertising...|$|R
