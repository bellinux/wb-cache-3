25|$|The primary mode of {{informing the}} quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and {{wetlands}} of the U.S. is through the National Water Quality Inventory Report. Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress {{as a means to}} inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes. The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act. The report is organized into two major sections; Section 1 shows <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> each type of water body, with causes and sources identified. Section 2 summarizes recommendations on improvement of water resource management.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{education}} is a major policy challenge facing the Maldives. The country achieved the first generation objective of providing universal access to basic education through rapid expansion of enrollment. As is frequently the case with such countries, the second generation challenge is to provide education of adequate quality. Evidence {{from a variety of}} sources shows that education quality in the Maldives is weak, and needs urgent improvement. Learning outcomes in both primary and secondary education are modest. <b>National</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> learning outcomes at Grade 4 and Grade 7 show that learning levels are unsatisfactory. The low average scores suggest that learning levels in both primary education and lower secondary education are weak. There are several dimensions of education quality which Maldivian policy makers consider to be of vital importance. Among these, the quality of school teachers is central to the improvement of education quality. Hence, the Ministry of Education (MOE) is concerned to develop the skills, motivation and performance of teachers. A second key policy initiative is the establishment of a sound quality assurance framework for the school system. The MOE has developed a quality assurance mechanism, which now needs to be pilot tested, refined and scaled up throughout the country. A third strategic policy initiative is the development of a system <b>of</b> regular <b>national</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> learning outcomes, which can then feed into policy formulation and program development. These three strategic policy initiatives are discussed in the subsequent sections of this report...|$|R

40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the quality of}} an educational system through <b>national</b> <b>assessments,</b> {{it is not only}} important to look at the average performance of students. One should also check whether there are no systematic differences between the schools in the number of students reaching the attainment targets. In case such differences exist, it is important to investigate whether these differences covary with certain student, classroom, or school characteristics. For this purpose, background questionnaires are administered to the students, the parents, and the teachers of the schools participating in the Flemish <b>national</b> <b>assessment.</b> In the present paper, the results of multilevel analyses <b>of</b> some recent <b>national</b> <b>assessments</b> will be discussed.
