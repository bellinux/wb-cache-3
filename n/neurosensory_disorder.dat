30|$|Although the {{previous}} studies reported good results concerning ND in IAN transposition surgery, the methods for evaluating ND differed, {{and most of}} the studies did not fully describe the evaluation procedure. The evaluation of ND of the IAN can be performed by purely subjective (questionnaire), relatively objective (static light touch, 2 -point discrimination, etc.), and purely objective methods (trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential, blink reflex method, etc.). It is well known that there are discrepancies in the assessment results for nerve impairment between the subjective and objective methods. In the present study, only one patient complained of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorder,</b> while five out of six patients had ND if assessed by the objective method (SW test and Highet grading).|$|E

This review focuses on conservative treatments, more specifically on treatments with medical devices. Two modes of action, enhancement of circulation and counter stimulation, are introduced. Medical devices that use enhancement of circulation as their mechanism of action are whole body vibration, pneumatic compression, and near-infrared light. Medical devices that use counter stimulation include {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} and the vibration Relaxis pad. The clinical utility of the Relaxis pad and its place in therapy is proposed. Keywords: whole body vibration, pneumatic compression, near-infrared light, conservative treatment, RLS/WED ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hearing {{impairment}} (HI) is {{the most}} prevalent <b>Neurosensory</b> <b>disorder</b> which is heterogenous and can also occur due to environmental causes. The majority of hearing deficiencies are of genetic origin affecting about 60 % of the HI cases. A novel gene DFNB 59 encodes pejvakin has been recently shown to cause deafness. This study aims to determine the frequency of DFNB 59 gene mutations in coding region the gene in Bushehr province. Methods: In this descriptive experimental study, we investigated the presence of DFNB 59 gene mutations in Exons (2 - 7) of the gene in 80 deaf subjects. DNA was extracted using standard phenol –chloroform method. The screening of gene mutations was performed by PCR-SSCP/HA procedure. Finally, the possible mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. Results: In all, 9 polymorphisms 793 C>G were found in 80 non-syndromic, genetic hearing loss subjects studied. However no DFNB 59 gene mutation was identified. Conclusion: We conclude that the association of DFNB 59 gene mutations with hearing loss is very low in samples studie...|$|E
40|$|Neurosensory {{responses}} of hearing and balance are mediated by receptors in specialized neuroepithelial sensory cells. Any {{disruption of the}} biochemical and molecular pathways that facilitate these responses can result in severe deficits, including hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Hearing is affected by both environmental and genetic factors, with impairment of auditory function being the most common <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorder</b> affecting 1 in 500 newborns, as well as {{having an impact on}} the majority of elderly population. Damage to auditory sensory cells is not reversible, and if sufficient damage and cell death have taken place, the resultant deficit may lead to permanent deafness. Cochlear implants are considered {{to be one of the}} most successful and consistent treatments for deaf patients, but only offer limited recovery at the expense of loss of residual hearing. Recently there has been an increased interest in the auditory research community to explore the regeneration of mammalian auditory hair cells and restoration of their function.

40|$|Current {{treatments}} for hearing loss, {{the most common}} <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorder,</b> do not restore perfect hearing. Regeneration of lost organ of Corti hair cells through forced cell cycle re-entry of supporting cells or through manipulation of stem cells, both avenues towards a permanent cure, require a more complete understanding of normal inner ear development, specifically the balance of proliferation and differentiation required to form and to maintain hair cells. Direct successful alterations to the cell cycle result in cell death whereas regulation of upstream genes is insufficient to permanently alter cell cycle dynamics. The Myc gene family is uniquely situated to synergize upstream pathways into downstream cell cycle control. There are three Mycs that are embedded within the Myc/Max/Mad network to regulate proliferation. The function of the two ear expressed Mycs, N-Myc and L-Myc were unknown {{less than two years}} ago and their therapeutic potentials remain speculative. In this review, we discuss the roles the Mycs play in the body and what led us to choose them to be our candidate gene for inner ear therapies. We will summarize the recently published work describing the early and late effects of N-Myc and L-Myc on hair cell formation and maintenance. Lastly, we detail the translational significance of our findings and what future work must be performed to make the ultimate hearing aid: the regeneration of the organ of Corti...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} 3. 0 T MRI in the prognosis of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) sensory disorders after mandibular third molar extraction, in the early post-operative period. Methods: 343 IANs were examined before and 3 days after surgery. Two radiologists evaluated {{the course of the}} nerve and the relative signal intensity (RSI). Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to {{evaluate the}} interobserver (k[*]=[*] 0. 891) and intra-observer variability (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 927; 0. 914, respectively). The IANs were divided into four groups on the basis of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorders</b> recovery time. ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences among the RSIs of the four groups, and multiple comparisons were performed with Tukey's range test. Results: No differences in the course of IANs were found before and after surgery. In 280 IANs, no iatrogenic paraesthesia was found (Group A). 63 IANs showed a neurosensory impairment. 38 IANs showed recovery of post-operative paraesthesia at 3 -month follow-up (Group B). 16 IANs showed a full recovery of iatrogenic paraesthesia at 6 -month follow-up (Group C). Seven IANs displayed a full recovery at 12 -month follow-up and two IANs showed persistence of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorders</b> at 18 -month follow-up (Group D).

Methods In a 3 -year follow up study, the occurrence of neurosensory symptoms and reduced work ability, and the response to quantitative sensory testing (grip force, manipulative dexterity, touch sensation) were investigated in 249 HTV-exposed workers and 138 healthy controls. Among the HTV-exposed workers, the sensory outcomes were related to measures of daily vibration exposure expressed in terms of 8 -hour energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration magnitude [A(8) ]. To calculate A(8), the acceleration magnitudes of vibration were weighted by means of four alternative frequency weightings of HTV. Results The occurrence of neurosensory symptoms, reduced work ability, and abnormalities of sensory tests was greater among the HTV-exposed workers than the controls. Among the HTV-exposed workers, the deterioration of neurosensory outcomes and the reduction of work ability increased on par with the measures of vibration exposure.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the interference of radiographic {{factors in the}} appearance of sensory deficit related to inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) after third molars (3 Ms) removal. METHODS: A prospective, double-blind, observational, unicentric study was performed with 126 patients submitted to a surgical procedure of lower 3 Ms removal in the period from March to October/ 2011. Collected data included gender, age, eruption stage of 3 Ms, position/angle of 3 Ms (Pell-Gregory and Winter classifications, respectively), presence/absence of radiographic signs of 3 Ms proximity with the inferior alveolar canal and surgical technique. Occurrence evaluation of the IAN injury {{was performed on the}} seventh postoperative day through pin-prick, two-point discrimination and brush directional stroke tests. RESULTS: Predominant radiographic signs were: narrowing of the inferior alveolar canal (68. 25 %), darkening of root (46. 82 %) and diversion of the canal (31 %). None of the patients presented sensory loss. Sixty-one (48. 41 %) of the cases had at least one or two radiographic signs of proximity with NAI. Forty-seven (37. 3 %) had 3 or more signs, and 18 (14. 29 %) did not have any radiographic signs of proximity to mandibular canal.

40|$|Deafness in spontaneously {{occurring}} mouse mutants {{is often}} associated with defects in cochlea sensory hair cells, opening an avenue to systematically identify genes critical for hair cell structure and function. The classical semidominant mouse mutant varitint-waddler (Va) exhibits early-onset hearing loss, vestibular defects, pigmentation abnormalities, and perinatal lethality. A second allele, VaJ, which arose in a cross segregating for Va, shows a less severe phenotype. By using a positional cloning strategy, we identify two additional members of the mucolipin gene family (Mcoln 2 and Mcoln 3) in the 350 -kb VaJ minimal interval and provide evidence for Mcoln 3 as the gene mutated in varitint-waddler. Mcoln 3 encodes a putative six-transmembrane-domain protein with sequence and motif similarities to the family of nonselective transient-receptor-potential (TRP) ion channels. In the Va allele an Ala 419 Pro substitution occurs in the fifth transmembrane domain of Mcoln 3, and in VaJ, a second sequence alteration (Ile 362 Thr) occurring in cis partially rescues the Va allele. Mcoln 3 localizes to cytoplasmic compartments of hair cells and plasma membrane of stereocilia. Hair cell defects are apparent by embryonic day 17. 5, assigning Mcoln 3 an essential role during early hair cell maturation. Our data suggest that Mcoln 3 is involved in ion homeostasis and acts cell-autonomously. Hence, we identify a molecular link between hair cell physiology and melanocyte function. Last, MCOLN 2 and MCOLN 3 are candidate genes for hereditary and/or sporadic forms of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorders</b> in humans...|$|R
40|$|Dental-skeletal {{anomalies}} {{are treated}} by combining orthodontic treatment with orthognathic surgery. This mainly involves performing sagittal osteotomy of the mandibular branch.

The aim {{of this study was to}} make a clinical evaluation of the efficacy of low intensity laser therapy in the neurosensory recovery of tissues after sagittal osteotomy of the mandible. A group of twelve patients with the need of surgical correction of their dental-skeletal anomaly underwent orthognathic surgery with bilateral mandibular sagittal osteotomy. Patients were treated unilaterally and blinded with a low intensity infrared GaAlAs laser of 808  nm, and compared with the contralateral site as a control group, following the course of the inferior dental nerve. The parameters used were of 100  mW of power, irradiation of 3. 6  W/cm 2, 2. 8  J of energy per point, an energy density of 100  J/cm 2, to 28  s in each point with a distance of 1  cm between points.

40|$|Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} {{is one of}} the most common <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorders</b> in humans. The {{incidence}} of SNHL is estimated to be 1 in 500 - 1000 newborns. In more than half of these patients, the hearing loss is associated with genetic causes. In Japan, genetic testing for the patients with SNHL using the Invader assay to screen for 46 mutations in 13 deafness genes was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for inclusion in social health insurance coverage in 2012. Furthermore, from August 2015, this genetic testing has been expanded to screen for 154 mutations in 19 deafness genes using targeted genomic enrichment with massively parallel DNA sequencing combined with the Invader assay and TaqMan genotyping. For this study we analyzed 717 unrelated Japanese hearing loss patients. The total allele frequency of 154 mutations in 19 deafness genes was 32. 64 % (468 / 1434) and the total numbers of cases associated with at least one mutation was 44. 07 % (316 / 717). Among these, we were able to diagnose 212 (30 %) patients, indicating that the present screening could efficiently identify causative mutations in hearing loss patients. It is noteworthy that 27 patients (3. 8 %) had coexistent multiple mutations in different genes. Five of these 27 patients (0. 7 %, 5 / 717 overall) were diagnosed with genetic hearing loss affected by concomitant with responsible mutations in more than two different genes.

40|$|Although the {{essentiality}} of zinc {{for plants}} and animals {{has been known for}} many decades, the essentiality of zinc for humans was recognized only 40 years ago in the Middle East. The zinc-deficient patients had severe immune dysfunctions, inasmuch as they died of intercurrent infections {{by the time they were}} 25 years of age. In our studies in an experimental human model of zinc deficiency, we documented decreased serum testosterone level, oligospermia, severe immune dysfunctions mainly affecting T helper cells, hyperammonemia, <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorders,</b> and decreased lean body mass. It appears that zinc deficiency is prevalent in the developing world and as many as two billion subjects may be growth retarded due to zinc deficiency. Besides growth retardation and immune dysfunctions, cognitive impairment due to zinc deficiency also has been reported recently. Our studies in the cell culture models showed that the activation of many zinc-dependent enzymes and transcription factors were adversely affected due to zinc deficiency. In HUT- 78 (T helper 0 [Th 0] cell line), we showed that a decrease in gene expression of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and IL- 2 receptor α (IL- 2 Rα) were due to decreased activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in zinc deficient cells. Decreased NF-κB activation in HUT- 78 due to zinc deficiency was due to decreased binding of NF-κB to DNA, decreased level of NF-κB p 105 (the precursor of NF-κB p 50) mRNA, decreased κB inhibitory protein (IκB) phosphorylation, and decreased Iκκ. These effects of zinc were cell specific. Zinc also is an antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory actions.

40|$|Background/objective: Oral {{health is}} an {{integral}} part of the general health and well-being of the elderly. Compromised oral health can have a negative impact on food intake that leads to a deterioration in nutritional status. This study aimed to explore, for the first time in Lebanon, the relationship between oral health and nutritional status in a population of elderly patients newly admitted to a hospital. Methods: A comprehensive survey was administered to 115 persons aged 70 years and older. They were admitted during 3 consecutive months to various wards of the Rafic Hariri University Hospital (RHUH; Beirut, Lebanon), which is the largest public hospital in Lebanon. Medical, socioeconomic, anthropometric, and dietary data were collected. Nutritional status was assessed by the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and oral health was assessed by the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI), a tool that evaluates an individual's self-perception of oral health status. This was followed by an examination of the oral cavity to count the remaining teeth, to record the presence and status of dentures, and to assess xerostomia. Results: The prevalence of undernutrition was 6. 1 %, with the additional risk of malnutrition observed in 37. 4 %. More than 50 % of individuals in need of dental care (i. e., a GOHAI score >  14) were at risk of nutritional deficits. A negative self-perception of oral status was significantly associated with a risk of nutritional deficit, but the risk disappeared after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disorders,</b> and chronic diseases. Conclusion: Our results strongly demonstrate the importance of oral care within the elderly Lebanese population to reduce the risk of malnutrition and improve oral health-related quality of life...|$|R

MÉTODOS: Estudo {{longitudinal}} de prematuros OBJECTIVE: To determine chronological and corrected ages at {{acquisition of}} motor abilities up to unaided walking in very low weight preterms {{and to determine}} up to what point {{it is necessary to}} use corrected age. METHODS: This was a longitudinal study of preterms with birth weight < 1, 500 g and gestational age < 34 weeks, free from neurosensory sequelae, selected at the high-risk infants follow-up clinic at the Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in Botucatu, Brazil, between 1998 to 2003, and assessed every 2 months until acquisition of unaided walking. RESULTS: Nine percent of the 155 preterms recruited were excluded from the study, leaving a total of 143 patients. The mean gestational age was 30 ± 2 weeks, birth weight was 1, 130 ± 222 g, 59 % were female and 44 % were small for gestational age. Preterms achieved head control in their second month, could sit unaided at 7 months and walked at 12. 8 months' corrected age, corresponding to the 4 th, 9 th and 15 th months of chronological age. There were significant differences between chronological age and corrected age for all motor abilities.

Frequently these patients report provoked pain on contact or with attempted intercourse, {{commonly referred to}} as provoked vestibulodynia (PVD). Despite the burden of this condition, little is known about its potential etiologies including pelvic floor muscular dysfunction and mucosal components. This knowledge would be beneficial in developing targeted therapies including physical therapy. Objective: To explore the relative contribution of mucosal versus muscle pain sensitivity on pain report from intercourse among women with PVD. Design: In this proof of concept study, 54 women with PVD underwent a structured examination assessing mucosal and pelvic muscle sensitivity. Methods: We examined three mucosal sites in the upper and lower vestibule. Patients were asked to rate their pain on cotton swab palpation of the mucosa using a 10 -point visual analog scale. Muscle pain was assessed using transvaginal application of pressure on right and left puborectalis, and the perineal muscle complex. The Gracely pain scale (0 – 100) was used to assess the severity of pain with intercourse, with women rating the lowest, average, and highest pain levels; a 100 rating the highest level of pain. Results: The lower vestibule’s mucosa 5. 81 (standard deviation = 2. 83) was significantly more sensitive than the upper vestibule 2. 52 (standard deviation = 2. 6) (P< 0. 01) on exam. However, mucosal sensitivity was not associated with intercourse pain, while muscle sensitivity was moderately associated with both average and highest intensity of intercourse pain (r=- 0. 46, P= 0. 01 and r=- 0. 42, P= 0. 02), respectively. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that mucosal measures alone may not sufficiently capture the spectrum of clinical pain report in women with PVD, which is consistent with the empirical success of physical therapy in this population.
