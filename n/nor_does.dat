According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle.

5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was {{a supporter of the}} cult of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E
5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E

5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the growth on Gram-negative bacteria, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. <b>Nor</b> <b>does</b> it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E

It does not include membranophones that are, for example, a part of Western style orchestras, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> it include trap sets and other common membranophones used in popular music recordings of many genres across the world.

5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). <b>Nor</b> <b>does</b> he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E

In 1859, after the Jewish community in Galaţi fell victim to a pogrom, he spoke out against Antisemitic blood libel accusations: [...] "Jews do not eat children in England, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> they in France, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> they in Germany, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> they do so wherever humans have become humans.
