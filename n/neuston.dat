50|$|<b>Neustons,</b> broadly defined, {{are made}} up of some species of fish (see flying fish), beetles (see whirligig beetle), protozoans, {{bacteria}} and spiders (see fishing spider and diving bell spider). Collembola in the genera Podura and Sminthurides are almost exclusively neustonic, while Hypogastrura species often aggregate on pond surfaces. A water strider, Gerris, is a common example of an insect that supports its weight on water's surface tension. By extension, the term may also refer to non-organismal floating aggregations (see, e.g., Great Pacific Garbage Patch).|$|R
40|$|A new {{classification}} of Collembola and Protura life forms is proposed. Each eco-morphological life form group is morphologically and ecologically characterized, allowing Collembola {{to be classified}} into two main groups: A - atmobionts, and B - edaphobionts. Group A comprises four subgroups: a) macrophytobionts, b) microphytobionts, c) xylobionts, and d) <b>neustons.</b> Group B {{is divided into three}} subgroups: a) epigeonts, b) hemiedaphobionts, and c) euedaphobionts. Hemiedaphobionts comprise two subclasses according to their size and occurrence in the soil profile. Euedaphobionts are divided into three classes (large, medium, small) and six subclasses according to presence or reduction of the furca (with furca versus furca missing or reduced). Protura belong to the medium and small size subclasses of euedaphobionts. Former life form systems of Collembola are discussed. The proposed system facilitates the use of Collembola in a more comprehensive way for ecological studies...|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{disintegration}} {{means that the}} plastic particulate {{in much of the}} affected region is too small to be seen. In a 2001 study, researchers (including Charles Moore) found concentrations of plastic particles at 334,721 pieces per km2 with a mean mass of 5,114 grams (11.27 lbs) per km2, in the <b>neuston.</b> Assuming each particle of plastic averaged 5 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm, this would amount to only 8 m2 per km2 due to small particulates. Nonetheless, this represents a high amount with respect to the overall ecology of the <b>neuston.</b> In many of the sampled areas, the overall concentration of plastics was seven times greater than the concentration of zooplankton. Samples collected at deeper points in the water column found much lower concentrations of plastic particles (primarily monofilament fishing line pieces).|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} nets and related {{instrumentation}} has been deployed on CalCOFI cruises over the years. {{many of these}} {{have been developed for}} use by the CalCOFI program. Oblique tows using a bongo net are employed to sample for micronekton, mesozooplankton and ichthyoplankton. Vertical tows for icthyoplankton and mesozooplankton are conducted using a Pairovet and PRPOOS nets. Finally, surface tows with a Manta net are used to sample <b>neuston.</b> Supplementary sampling focuses on collection of juvenile and small fish via trawling techniques. This includes using a Modified Isaacs Kidd Net, a Matsuda Oozeki Hu trawl (MOHT), and the Nordic rope trawl.|$|E
50|$|The Great Pacific garbage patch {{has one of}} {{the highest}} levels known of plastic {{particulate}} suspended in the upper water column. As a result, it is one of several oceanic regions where researchers have studied the effects and impact of plastic photodegradation in the neustonic layer of water. Unlike organic debris, which biodegrades, the photodegraded plastic disintegrates into ever smaller pieces while remaining a polymer. This process continues down to the molecular level.As the plastic flotsam photodegrades into smaller and smaller pieces, it concentrates in the upper water column. As it disintegrates, the plastic ultimately becomes small enough to be ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near the ocean's surface. In this way, plastic may become concentrated in <b>neuston,</b> thereby entering the food chain.|$|E

50|$|Net-based {{surveys are}} less {{subjective}} than direct observations but are limited regarding {{the area that}} can be sampled (net apertures 1-2 m and ships typically have to slow down to deploy nets, requiring dedicated ship's time). The plastic debris sampled is determined by net mesh size, with similar mesh sizes required to make meaningful comparisons among studies. Floating debris typically is sampled with a <b>neuston</b> or manta trawl net lined with 0.33 mm mesh. Given the {{very high level of}} spatial clumping in marine litter, large numbers of net tows are required to adequately characterize the average abundance of litter at sea. Long-term changes in plastic meso-litter have been reported using surface net tows: in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in 1999, plastic abundance was 335 000 items/km2 and 5.1 kg/km2, roughly an order of magnitude greater than samples collected in the 1980s. Similar dramatic increases in plastic debris have been reported off Japan. However, caution is needed in interpreting such findings, because of the problems of extreme spatial heterogeneity, and the need to compare samples from equivalent water masses, which is to say that, if an examination of the same parcel of water a week apart is conducted, an order of magnitude change in plastic concentration could be observed.|$|E
50|$|Leptasterias hexactis is {{dioecious}} {{with individuals}} being either male or female. In Puget Sound, reproduction takes place between November and April. The eggs have yolks and between 50 and 1500 are laid, {{depending on the}} size of the female. They are fertilized by sperm that has been discharged into the water column by males. The female then holds the eggs with her tube feet in a mass near her mouth, arching her body up as she broods them. She is unable to eat at this time and clings to the rock as best she can with the remaining tube feet though it may be only the tips of the arms that are available to hold her in place. While the eggs are being brooded, she tends them and keeps them clean. They are lecithotrophic and consume the yolks of their eggs as they develop. After about 40 days the eggs begin to hatch into juveniles, miniature starfish with truncated limbs. These continued to be brooded by the mother for a few weeks before setting off independently on their own. If breeding has taken place in an aquarium, they can be seen crawling over the glass, and sometimes floating on the surface of the water as <b>neuston.</b> They will become mature in about 2 years.|$|E
40|$|The distribution, abundance, and {{characteristics}} of <b>neuston</b> plastic in the North Pacific, Bering Sea, and Japan Sea were studied during the 4 -year period 1985 - 88 at 203 <b>neuston</b> stations encompassing ca. 91, 000 m 2 of sampling. The highest total density of <b>neuston</b> plastic was 316, 800 pieces/km 2 at lat. 35 " 59 'N, long. 152 "OO'E in Transitional Water east of Japan. The highest total concentration of <b>neuston</b> plastic was 3, 491. 8 g/km 2 at lat. 40 " 00 'N, long. 171 ' 30 'E near the Subarctic Front in the central North Pacific. miscellaneous line fragments (21. 7 % of all stations), Styrofoam (12. 8 %), polypropylene line fragments (7. 4 %), miscellaneous or unidentified plastic (7. 4 %), and raw pellets (5. 9 %). Plastic fragments were recorded at 52. 2 % of all stations and at 88. 3 % of those stations with plastic. The highest densities (number per square kilometer) and concentrations (gram per square kilometer) of <b>neuston</b> plastic occurred in Japan Sea/nearshore Japan Water, in Transitional Water, and in Subtropical Water. Densities of <b>neuston</b> plastic in Subarctic Water and Bering Sea Water were low.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study was conducted}} that characterized the algae within the <b>neuston,</b> ca 2 mm below the surface, and the algae {{in the water column}} from two freshwater habitats.

The pond <b>neuston</b> was dominated by chlorophytes, with total algal abundance ranging seasonally from 0. 6 to 59. 6 × 10 - 3 cells ml- 1 compared to water column algal concentrations of 4. 1 to 40. 4 × 10 - 3 cells ml- 1. The lake was dystrophic, with diatoms the most common and abundant species, with the <b>neuston</b> algal abundance ranging from 0. 09 to 1. 31 × 10 - 3 cells ml- 1, and the water column algae from 0. 19 to 2. 70 × 10 - 3 cells ml- 1.

40|$|<b>Neuston</b> {{includes}} {{animals and}} plants inhabiting the surface layer of the water column. The neustonic area is an accumulation zone for bacteria, organic molecules but also terrestrial debris. The surface layer is also the air/water exchange region. Therefore, neustonic organisms are directly exposed to several constraints such as wind stress and turbulence. The present study aims to characterize the zooneuston in terms of abundance and biodiversity and to evaluate the impacts of wind stress on neustonic abundance. Zooneustonic and zooplanktonic (depth of 5 meters) samples were collected twice a month between 30 th August 2011 and 10 th July 2012 in Calvi Bay, Corsica. Zooneustonic biodiversity was high and, notably, twenty-eight copepod genera were identified. Among these copepods, several organisms, belonging to the Pontellidae family, were much more frequent in <b>neuston</b> than in underlying plankton and their abundance depended on wind direction. Taxon-specific trends in seasonal abundance variation were present. For example, individuals of the Acantharia Lithoptera spp. were found in summer whereas the Pontellidae Anomalocera patersoni appeared in winter. Overall, our data provide a first step towards a better knowledge of <b>neuston</b> community structure in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E

Sampling of the <b>neuston</b> and plankton of Sequim Bay, Washington was conducted on 18 - 19 August 1983 at four hour intervals. <b>Neuston</b> samples (upper 50 um) were collected using a recently developed glass plate collector. Plankton from 0. 4 m and 1. 5 m was collected in submerged polyethylene bottles. Samples were analyzed spectrophotometricaliy for photosynthetic pigment concentrations (chlorophylls a, b, c, total carotene and phaeopigments). The presence and density of each taxon of microalga was enumerated microscopically. The <b>neuston</b> community exhibited greater densities and lower species diversities (1 - Simpson's Diversity Index) than did the plankton community. Nocturnal decreases of species diversity were observed in microlayer samples whereas diversity remained relatively constant at 0. 4 m and 1. 5 m. Several species, Ceratium furca, Peridinium brevipes, and Prorocentrum micans demonstrated diel patterns of increased mid-day densities in the microlayer. All photosynthetic pigment concentrations (mg pigments m⁻³ seawater) were depleted in microlayer samples and concentrations increased with depth. Chlorophyll a per individual was lowest in the microlayer and highest at 1. 5 m depth. Carotene : chl a ratios were highest in the microlayer and lowest at 1. 5 m depth. Changes observed in the surface microlayer over the sampling period appeared to be independent of the tidal cycle. However, changes at 0. 4 m and 1. 5 m depth were directly affected by the tidal changes. A "red-tide" dinoflagellate bloom persisted {{during the course of this}} study. Therefore, this data is indicative of changes occurring during a short-term, sporadic environmental condition in Sequim Bay, Washington.

The frequencies of occurrence of plastic colour-types in birds are compared with those of particles collected at sea in <b>neuston</b> trawls.

Quantitative and qualitative differences in the composition of <b>neuston</b> species were recorded in selected sub-layers of the chemically stratified sea surface microlayer. The non-linear regression equation was applied in a mathematical model of the diurnal fluctuations of nutrients and organic matter. Two maxima and two minima were found in the diurnal cycle of nutrient concentrations and organic suspensions in sub-layers of different thickness selected from the sea surface. The first maximum, expressed by the proliferation of phytoneuston, lasted from the very early morning till mid-morning. The second maximum occurred in the afternoon. The chlorophyll a concentration, and ATP and <b>neuston</b> abundance declined markedly around noon, when the biologically-damaging radiation dose increased, compelling the downward migration of organisms. At the same time, the photo-oxidation of dissolved organic matter intensified and the concentrations of inorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus rose. A shift (up to 2 h) between the maximum and minimum <b>neuston</b> concentration in these sea surface layers was indicative of phototaxis occurring within the entire surface microlayer and in the underwater layer. After sunset the decline in phytoneuston abundance could be related to zooplankton grazing as well as to respiratory breakdown...|$|E
40|$|The <b>neuston,</b> i. e. the fauna inhabiting {{the upper}} layer of oceans and seas, is {{strongly}} influenced by the occurrence of floating patches composed of detached coastal seaweed fragments. Ephemeral floating seaweeds harbour a diverse fauna originating from attached seaweeds, the strandline of beaches, the surrounding and underlying water column, the seafloor or the air.

During this study, different aspects of raft-associated ecology were addressed. The results demonstrate that the habitat formed by floating seaweeds is very complex. Although the presence of floating seaweeds in the <b>neuston</b> can, to a certain degree, be seasonally predicted (storms, seasonal release of fertile structures), the habitat that they form is still very patchy and unstable.

The association behaviour of the encountered species and their (optimal) use of the transient resources offered by floating seaweeds can, in certain circumstances, result in the passive dispersal of associated fauna to new, and distant locations by means of rafting.

Our results suggest that Ophiocoma scolopendrina adults occupy a higher position in the food web than Ophiomastix venosa and mainly feed on <b>neuston.</b> In contrast, O. venosa adults feed on the alga Sargassum densifolium and on organic matter associated with sediment. Free juveniles and symbiotic juveniles of O. venosa have intermediate d 13 C values between both adult species.

40|$|Island environments {{drastically}} {{modify the}} hydrodynamics of ocean currents and generate strong vertical turbulence. This {{leads to an}} upward transport of nutrient-rich waters, thus increasing the biomass of plankton in these oceanic marine environments. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the biomass and density of the zooneuston communities in relation to the upper and lower layers (epi-/hyponeuston), the nycthemeral variation (day/night), the currents in relation to the island (downstream vs upstream), and the distance from the island, focusing on the spatial variability. Samples were taken in July and August 2010 with a David-Hempel <b>neuston</b> net (Hydro-Bios) with a mesh size of 500 µm. Twenty-one taxa were recorded. The most abundant taxa were Copepoda, Chaetognatha, Teleostei (eggs) and Hydrozoa. This is the first record of phoronid larvae for the waters of the Tropical Atlantic. For both layers, density and biomass were significantly higher at night. Density and biomass were always significantly higher in the upper (epineuston) layer than in the lower (hyponeuston) layer. This was probably due to a zooneuston aggregation at the surface and massive vertical migration from deep waters at night, leading to increased abundances at night in both <b>neuston</b> layers...|$|E

40|$|The <b>neuston</b> can {{be defined}} as ‘those plants and animals inhabiting the surface film of the sea’. The living {{conditions}} in the upper layer of oceans and seas are considerably different from those in deeper layers. Consequently, the neustonic zone forms a restricted ecological niche inhabited by a wide range of permanent or temporaryinhabitants, which are adapted to a stressful way of life in a region of a high organic matter supply. The distribution of neustonic organisms is mainly influenced by vertical migration and temporal and spatial variation. Additionally, winds, currents and the presence of floating objects can give rise to local accumulations of neustonic organisms. Of special interest is the neustonic community associated with the permanently floating seaweed Sargassum, which is abundantly found in the Sargasso Sea. Floating mats of these seaweed species significantly contribute to the primary production in the neustonic zone of the North Atlantic and consequently support a diverse community of marine organisms that use the seaweeds as food source, shelter, foraging grounds or surface for attachment. Next to the permanently floating Sargassum, the <b>neuston</b> is also strongly influenced by the occurrence of smaller, and usually ephemeral floating patches composed of detached coastal seaweed fragments. Ephemeral floating seaweeds harbour a diverse fauna originating from attached seaweeds, the strandline of beaches, the surrounding and underlying water column, the seafloor or the air. These organisms colonise the seaweeds for various reasons, usually including the provision of shelter, food or attachment substrate. The association behaviour of these organisms and their use of the resources offered by floating seaweeds potentially have important ecological consequences, like the possibility of passive dispersal of associated fauna to new, distant locations by means of rafting. The overall aim of this PhD study was to assess the ecological impact of floating seaweeds as ephemeral habitats and potential rafts in the North Sea. Because the information about the <b>neuston</b> and floating seaweed clumps in the North Sea was, up till now, very scarce, different aspects of raft-associated ecology were addressed. The results of this PhD thesis demonstrate that the habitat formed by floating seaweeds is very complex. Although the presence of floating seaweeds in the <b>neuston</b> can, to a certain degree, be seasonally predicted (storms, seasonal release of fertile structures), the habitat that they form is still very patchy and unstable. Consequently, most species found in association with ephemeral floating seaweed patches are opportunistic of nature. However, some species display a higher level of adaptation to this habitat than other species, which is manifested in the reproduction by continuous brooding in Idotea baltica, the diet consisting of seaweed-associated macrofauna in Cyclopterus lumpus and the behavioural shift towards surface pecking and dipping in Sterna hirundo. The association behaviour of the encountered species and their (optimal) use of the transient resources offered by floating seaweeds potentially have important ecological consequences, like for example the passive dispersal of associated fauna to new, distant locations by means of rafting. The process of rafting strongly depends on the longevity of the seaweed raft, which is in turn significantly influenced by temperature and grazing pressure.

40|$|Tidal marsh {{wetlands}} {{provide important}} foraging habitat {{for a variety}} of estuarine fishes. Prey organisms include benthic–epibenthic macroinvertebrates, neustonic arthropods, and zooplankton. Little is known about the abundance and distribution of interior marsh macroinvertebrate communities in the San Francisco Estuary (estuary). We describe seasonal, regional, and site variation in the composition and abundance of <b>neuston</b> and benthic–epibenthic macroinvertebrates that inhabit tidal marsh channels, and relate these patterns to environmental conditions. We also describe spatial and temporal variation in diets of marsh-associated inland silverside, yellowfin goby, and western mosquitofish. Fish and invertebrates were sampled quarterly from October 2003 to June 2005 at six marsh sites located in three river systems of the northern estuary: Petaluma River, Napa River, and  the west Delta. Benthic/epibenthic macroinvertebrates and <b>neuston</b> responded to environmental variables related to seasonal changes (i. e., temperature, salinity), as well as those related to marsh structure (i. e., vegetation, channel edge). The greatest variation in abundance occurred seasonally for <b>neuston</b> and spatially for benthic–epibenthic organisms, suggesting that each community responds to different environmental drivers. Benthic/epibenthic invertebrate abundance and diversity was lowest in the west Delta, and increased with increasing salinity. Insect abundance increased during the spring and summer, while Collembolan (springtail) abundance increased during the winter. Benthic/epibenthic macroinvertebrates dominated fish diets, supplemented by insects, with zooplankton playing a minor role. Diet compositions of the three fish species overlapped considerably, with strong selection indicated for epibenthic crustaceans—a surprising result given the typical classification of Menidia beryllina as a planktivore, Acanthogobius flavimanus as a benthic predator, and Gambusia affinis as a larvivorous surface-feeder. Fish diets were influenced by position along the estuarine gradient and season. Overall, our data show that local-scale site effects and marsh position within the estuary influence invertebrate community composition and abundance. Additionally, we show that restoring marsh ecosystems can subsidize fishes similarly to reference marshes. We, thus, recommend that managers focus on the ability of restoring marshes to produce food subsidies for target species when planning and designing tidal marsh restoration projects, especially those targeted for food web support. ...|$|E

However, some species display {{a higher level of}} adaptation to this habitat than other species, which is manifested in the reproduction by continuous brooding in Idotea baltica, the diet consisting of seaweed-associated macrofauna in Cyclopterus lumpus and the behavioural shift towards surface pecking and dipping in Sterna hirundo. The association behaviour of the encountered species and their (optimal) use of the transient resources offered by floating seaweeds potentially have important ecological consequences, like for example the passive dispersal of associated fauna to new, distant locations by means of rafting. The process of rafting strongly depends on the longevity of the seaweed raft, which is in turn significantly influenced by temperature and grazing pressure. In favourable conditions, seaweed rafts can potentially cover great distances, carrying with them rafting fauna that are able to survive a long journey in the <b>neuston...</b>|$|E
40|$|On the {{afternoon}} of November 5, 1965 during strong north-northwest winds, Porpita, Velella, Physalia, G!aucus, Lepas, Fiona, and three species of Ianthina were blown onto the north beach of the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory. In the Laboratory with an ample supply of running sea water, many of these animals lived for several days and I was able to observe their feeding preferences and rates. On {{the basis of these}} obervations and the reports of other workers it is possible to construct a preliminary diagram of the <b>neuston</b> food web...|$|E
40|$|The pelagic harpacticoid copepod Microsetella rosea inhabits {{the cold}} waters along the {{temperate}} southern coast of Chile, where its population biology and ecological {{role in the}} <b>neuston</b> are unknown. During a CIMAR 16 Fiordos cruise realized in the Magellan Region, 26 neustonic samples were collected to analyze the abundance, spatial distribution of copepodits and oceanographic conditions (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen). M. rosea copepodits, the most abundant holoneustonic taxa (30 % of total abundance), were present at all sampled stations and were 0. 5 times more abundant than calanoids. These copepodits inhabited waters ranging between 6. 5 - 8. 5 degrees C and salinity of 26 - 33, with maximum abundances (1, 000 - 10, 000 ind/ 5 min horizontal drag) at means of 7. 2 +/- 0. 6 degrees C and salinities of 30. 7 +/- 0. 9. Froward Cape, Almirantazgo Sound, and Inutil Bay stations accounted for 65 % of total M. rosea abundance, whereas Beagle Channel stations present the lowest abundances (< 4 %). The entire sampling area was as an oxygenated estuary (7. 4 +/- 0. 4 mL L- 1). Given the abundance and recurrence of M. rosea in the Magellanic <b>neuston,</b> future research should assess the ecological functions of this species. Finally, M. rosea {{could also be used}} as a biotracer for processes of aggregation in other estuarine neustonic communities of southern Chile...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The sea-surface microlayer is the {{boundary}} layer between {{the water of}} the oceans and the atmosphere occupying approximately “ 1000 micrometer” uppermost part of the sea-surface microlayer (SML) (Liss and Duce, 1997). Nutrients and pollutants are known to be concentrated in the SML compared to the water column. The unique physical and chemical features of the SML may provide a habitat for a large number and diverse groups of <b>neuston</b> (microorganisms living in the SML) such as ciliates and phytoplankton. However, these microorganisms in the SML may be exposed to the higher concentrations of nutrients and pollutants, compared to the water column, probably affecting their diversities and species composition. The diversity and species composition of the ciliates and phytoplankton were assessed in the sea-surface microlayer (SML) and sub-surface layer during an experiment at three locations in the outer Oslofjord during July 2009. Verdens Ende was expected to have low amounts of nutrients and oil pollution. Ferjeodden (a harbor) and Bustangen (close to a farm) were expected to have elevated concentrations of oil and nutrients, respectively. The results showed that there were variations in the number of individuals of ciliates and phytoplankton between replicates collected from each habitat and location. Measures of diversity indicated that there were not any differences in ciliate and phytoplankton between the SML and the sub-surface layer and between the SML samples at the three locations. The ciliate and phytoplankton species compositions in the two layers were not significantly different but separations were observed between the two layers. Significant differences were found in ciliate and phytoplankton species compositions in the SML samples from the three locations. Oligotrich ciliates and diatoms were identified as the most responsible taxonomic groups contributing to separations between <b>neuston</b> and plankton and between the <b>neuston</b> at the three locations. Adaptation to eutrophication, oil pollution, and ultraviolet radiation (UVR), predator pressure reduction and food availability could be possible explanations for this observation. Finally, species composition could not be related to the environmental factors (temperature and salinity) because the environmental factors did not vary substantially at the three locations...|$|E
