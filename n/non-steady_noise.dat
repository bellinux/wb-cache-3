40|$|It is {{clarified}} that Leq {{is available}} for slowly fluctuating noise what is called fluctuating noise. But the evaluation method of rapidly fluctuating noise, for example, impulsive or intermittent noise, is not yet established. In this experiment, three periodically non-steady noises-triangular, sinusoidal and rectangular noises-were used as test stimuli, the factors of level fluctuation-repetition rate (RR) and range of level fluctuation (W) -were set up widely from fluctuating noise to impulsive and intermittent noise, and PSE (point of subjective equality), which was steady noise level equivalent to <b>non-steady</b> <b>noise</b> on noisiness, was searched for by constant method. The relation between PSE and fluctuation factors was investigated to obtain fundamental data to evaluate general non-steady noises on noisiness. The results and discussions are summerized as follows. 1) The PSEs of periodically triangular, sinusoidal and rectangular noises are significantly affected by RR and W. 2) Triangular and sinusoidal noises indicate similar tendency on noisiness and their PSEs can be represented by L_eq {{and the effect of}} level fluctuation, which is indicated as a function of RR and W by equation (4). 3) The PSEs of rectangular noises are larger than those of triangular and sinusoidal noises...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate disturbance and noisiness of periodically <b>non-steady</b> <b>noises</b> in four task conditions. Totally 326 subjects participated in experiments. There were two main variables : the range of level fluctuation was from 0 to 40 dB and the repetition rate varied from 0. 25 to 4 Hz. The noises were exposed at two levels, 60 and 70 dB Leq. Task conditions were articulation test, intelligibility test, calculation, and reading, and their exposure durations were respectively about 6, 8, 3, 2. 5 minutes. The task performance was investigated and the relation between disturbance or noisiness and performance was also discussed. The conclusions are summarized as follows. 1) In task conditions in which task performance is significantly affected by noises, disturbance and noisiness are influenced considerably by performance and have high correlation with it. 2) In task conditions in which task performance is not significantly affected by noises, disturbance and noisiness increase with range of level fluctuation. 3) In the same conditions as 2), the effect of repetition rate was not reasonably found, but consistently disturbance or noisiness tends to rise at 1 Hz {{in the case of}} triangular noises and ã€€drop at 1 Hz in rectangular noises. 4) It is considered that the complex effect of repetition rate as mentioned above is contributed by the interference of concentration on task and the rhythm of task exept for the effect of fluctuation factors...|$|R
