5|$|In 1992, London annexed <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> {{township}} of Westminster, a large, primarily {{rural municipality}} directly {{south of the}} city, including the police village of Lambeth. With this massive annexation, London almost doubled in area again, adding several thousand more residents. In modern day, London stretches south to the boundary with Elgin County, north to the Town of Arva and Fanshawe Lake, west to Komoka, and East to Nilestown and Dorchester.|$|E
5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing. All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily useless, though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E
5|$|Although Rajakumari, Radha and Ranjan reprised {{their roles}} in the Hindi version, Radha and Ranjan's {{characters}} were renamed. Radha's character (Veerasimhan) was Veer Singh in the Hindi version, and Ranjan's character (Sasankan) was renamed Shashank. Of the other cast members, N. S. Krishnan, T. A. Madhuram, T. E. Krishnamachari, Pottai Krishnamoorthy and N. Seetharaman appeared only in the Tamil version, and Yashodhara Katju and H. K.

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a career}} milestone, Suter played in his 1,000th NHL game on October 25, 2000, scoring a goal in a 3–1 {{victory over the}} Columbus Blue Jackets. He said the {{achievement}} {{meant a lot to}} him given both the ailments he overcame and that he was dismissed by critics as unlikely to play in the NHL when he was drafted in 1984. Suter finished the regular season with 34 points, but missed <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> playoffs after suffering a concussion in the Sharks' first post-season game.|$|E
5|$|Six {{people were}} killed in the Dominican Republic and another {{fourteen}} in Haiti. Three were killed in Jamaica, which also suffered US$310million of damage—the heaviest in the Caribbean. The most severe damage there was to the agricultural sector; <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> banana crop was destroyed. Global aid organizations contributed to the subsequent recovery effort; immediate life-saving needs were met within days, but the damage to Jamaica's infrastructure and economy took much longer to repair. With loans and grants from the local government, the European Union, and the United Nations, normality was restored by the following summer.|$|E

Large mammals found in the national forest include black bear, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, gray fox, Columbian black-tailed deer (mule deer), and elk. River otters inhabit most streams. Other mammals include ringtails, raccoons, skunks, jackrabbits, martens and many squirrel and rat species including northern flying squirrel. Several species of bats are also found in the watershed, little brown bats being the most common. The area around Trinity Lake has a significant nesting bald eagle population.|$|E
5|$|The {{second novel}} in the Alexis Carew series, Mutineer, by J. A. Sutherland, takes <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> {{account of the}} mutiny, down to the gasket being a source of {{contention}} for Midshipman Carew, {{and puts it in}} a science fiction setting involving a futuristic HMS Hermione under the command of a Captain Neals. In the novel, Carew takes the place of Midshipman Casey. Neals demonstrates his cruelty in the same fashion as Pigot. Neals orders Carew to kneel and beg for forgiveness, and he disrates her and has her flogged when she refuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Patagosaurus {{is not very}} well known, with a 2003 {{revision}} by Oliver Rahut determining only a few jaws are certainly referrable to it, as opposed to <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> skull. MPEF-PV 1670 shows what the morphology of the adult or subadult skull was like, while MACN CH 933 represents a juvenile individual. Based upon how broad, high and short the adult articulated mandibles of Patagosaurus are, its snout would have been short, high and broad as well, a typical feature of most sauropods.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> DuMont film archive was destroyed, several {{surviving}} DuMont {{shows have}} been released on DVD. A large number of episodes of Life Is Worth Living have been saved, and they are now aired weekly on Catholic-oriented cable network, the Eternal Word Television Network, which also makes a collection of them available on DVD (in the biographical information about Fulton J. Sheen added {{to the end of}} many episodes, a still image of Bishop Sheen looking into a DuMont Television camera can be seen). Several companies that distribute DVDs over the Internet have released a small number of episodes of Cavalcade of Stars and The Morey Amsterdam Show. Two more DuMont programs, Captain Video and His Video Rangers and Rocky King, Inside Detective, have had a small amount of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming.|$|E
5|$|Because Ariel, like Uranus, orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side {{relative}} to its rotation, its northern and southern hemispheres face either directly towards or directly away from the Sun at the solstices. This means it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle; just as Earth's poles see permanent night or daylight around the solstices, so Ariel's poles see permanent night or daylight for half a Uranian year (42 Earth years), with the Sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the 1986 southern summer solstice, when <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> northern hemisphere was dark. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. A number of such events occurred in 2007–2008, including an occultation of Ariel by Umbriel on 19 August 2007.|$|E
5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including Oberon) {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> northern hemisphere was in darkness. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. One such event, which lasted for about six minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1940, {{ships of}} the RAN, {{at the request}} of the Admiralty, began to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea to take part in the Battle of the Mediterranean against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. In September 1939, the Admiralty and the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board agreed to deploy the RAN Destroyer Flotilla outside the Australia Station; the five ships of what was to become known as the Scrap Iron Flotilla arrived at Malta in mid-December. HMAS Sydney {{deployed}} in May 1940 and was later joined by Hobart. When Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, the Australian warships made up five of the twenty-two Allied destroyers and one of the five modern light cruisers on station in the Mediterranean. The RAN then offered the services of Australia to the Admiralty, and was accepted. When Australia arrived in the Mediterranean, the RAN had sent <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> combat fleet to the Northern Hemisphere, leaving Australia open to possible attack.|$|E
