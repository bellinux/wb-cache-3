5|$|Later {{on in the}} Song dynasty {{the compass}} was used with {{maritime}} navigation. Several decades after the Wujing Zongyao was written, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD) wrote of the first truly magnetized compass <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> his book Dream Pool Essays (1088 AD). With a more efficient compass magnetized by lodestone, the thermoremanence compass fell out of use. The later maritime author Zhu Yu soon wrote of the magnetic needle compass {{as a means to}} navigate at sea, in his book Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD.|$|E

Switchblades replaced swords, feasts and balls became drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo committed suicide by hypodermic <b>needle.</b> <b>In</b> 1997, the Folger Shakespeare Theatre produced a version set in a typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt's death while in class at school.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a <b>needle.</b> <b>In</b> modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the <b>needle.</b> <b>In</b> some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|The oldest park {{located in}} the city is the Krantiman Park, located across the {{historic}} St. Thomas Church. The park {{was built in the}} 19th century and was then known as Company Bagh.

5|$|The Battle of the Nile {{remains one}} of the Royal Navy's most famous victories, and has {{remained}} prominent in the British popular imagination, sustained by its depiction in a large number of cartoons, paintings, poems, and plays. One of the best known poems about the battle is Casabianca, which was written by Felicia Dorothea Hemans in 1826 and describes a fictional account of the death of Captain Casabianca's son on Orient. Monuments were raised, including Cleopatra's <b>Needle</b> <b>in</b> London. Muhammad Ali of Egypt gave the monument in 1819 in recognition of the battle of 1798 and the campaign of 1801 but Great Britain did not erect it on the Victoria Embankment until 1878. Another memorial, the Nile Clumps near Amesbury, consists of stands of beech trees purportedly planted by Lord Queensbury at the bequest of Lady Hamilton and Thomas Hardy after Nelson's death. The trees form a plan of the battle; each clump represents the position of a British or French ship. A similar arboreal memorial is thought to have been planted near Alnwick by Nelson's agent Alexander Davison. The Royal Navy commemorated the battle with the ship names HMS Aboukir and HMS Nile, and in 1998 commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle with a visit to Aboukir Bay by the modern frigate HMS Somerset, whose crew laid wreaths in memory of those who lost their lives in the battle.|$|E
40|$|Background: Pneumothorax is a {{very rare}} but serious {{complication}} associated with acupuncture and dry needling around the thoracic region. Physiotherapists and other health practitioners {{should be aware of}} the risks associated with <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> this region and should take care to minimize the possibility of an iatrogenic pneumothorax. Findings: An awareness of the signs and symptoms of a pneumothorax is necessary for practitioners using acupuncture and dry <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> the thoracic region. Understanding the normal anatomy and its variants can minimize risk associated with <b>needling</b> practices <b>in</b> this region. Various technique modifications are suggested so that the pleura or lungs are avoided while using acupuncture or dry <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> the thoracic region. Discussion/Conclusion: Acupuncture and dry <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> this region administered by well-trained physiotherapists and other health practitioners is very safe; however, to maximize safety therapists should consider the relevant anatomy and not practise using advanced acupuncture and dry needling techniques without adequate competency-based training.

50|$|Counting: The players met up at a farm at {{the foot}} of a {{mountain}} in the Southern Alps and split into three groups. Each groups task involved counting - one group had to count sheep, another <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> a haystack, and another baby chicks. Each team needed to get their count exactly right to win the challenge, and each wrong guess cost $1,000 from the kitty. The sheep teams first guess of 599 sheep was correct. The chick team first guessed 596, 601, and 600 before giving their correct answer, which was also 599. Upon reuniting with the host in a cabin, the two teams learned that there were 599 <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> the haystack that the other players had to count. The host radioed them and told them that if they would simply guess whether there were more or less than 600 <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> the haystack, they could quit counting and come inside. This guess would be worth $10,000 if correct, and would take away $10,000 if incorrect. After submitting a guess that there were 176 <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> the haystack, they decided to gamble and correctly guessed that there were less than 600 <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> the haystack, winning $6,000 (after penalties for wrong guesses).|$|R

25|$|Abortive therapies for {{migraine}}s may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or {{may require}} stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first {{be treated with}} acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemitic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan, a medication which mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{clinical}} experience with brachial plexus block in both peacetime and wartime surgery was extensive, and {{new approaches to}} this technique began to be described. For example, In 1946, F. Paul Ansbro {{was the first to}} describe a continuous brachial plexus block technique. He secured a <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> the supraclavicular fossa and attached tubing connected to a syringe through which he could inject incremental doses of local anesthetic. The subclavian perivascular block was first described by Winnie and Collins in 1964. This approach became popular due to its lower risk of pneumothorax compared to the traditional Kulenkampff approach. The infraclavicular approach was first developed by Raj. In 1977, Selander described a technique for continuous brachial plexus block using an intravenous catheter secured in the axilla.|$|E

25|$|True north, concept of: The Song Dynasty (9601279) {{official}} Shen Kuo (10311095), {{alongside his}} colleague Wei Pu, improved the orifice {{width of the}} sighting tube to make nightly accurate records of the paths of the moon, stars, and planets in the night sky, for a continuum of five years. By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; {{this was due to}} the precession of the Earth's rotational axis. When making the first known experiments with a magnetic compass, Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as magnetic declination, and wrote that the compass <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> fact pointed towards the magnetic north pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a critical step in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.|$|E
