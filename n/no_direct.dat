50|$|In any {{directed}} bipartite graph, all cycles have {{a length}} that is divisible by two. Therefore, <b>no</b> <b>directed</b> bipartite graph can be aperiodic. In any directed acyclic graph, it is a vacuous truth that every k divides all cycles (because there are <b>no</b> <b>directed</b> cycles to divide) so <b>no</b> <b>directed</b> acyclic graph can be aperiodic. And in any directed cycle graph, {{there is only}} one cycle, so every cycle's length is divisible by n, the length of that cycle.|$|R

5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though <b>no</b> <b>direct</b> link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E

30|$|In [28], the topologies switch {{periodically}} {{and some}} nodes are pinned {{all the time}} though the topologies contain <b>no</b> <b>directed</b> spanning tree. In this paper, all the topologies switch aperiodically and there exist no two topologies simultaneously which is different from jointly connected graphs [35]. Moreover, no node is pinned when the topologies contain <b>no</b> <b>directed</b> spanning tree and the pinned nodes are dependent on the topologies. Our method is more reasonable than [28].|$|R

A digraph G is called m-free if G has <b>no</b> <b>directed</b> cycles of length at most m.
