Wise completed two valid lifts, the maximum of which was 150kg, and finished in eleventh place.|$|E

However, Wood pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephanie and the attempted murder of Christopher. He also pleaded guilty to stealing £84,000 from clients.|$|E
5|$|According to Kamal Haasan, when Mahendra narrated {{the story}} of Moondram Pirai to him, Haasan listened to Mahendra for about twenty minutes before {{accepting}} the role of Cheenu. The role of Bhagyalakshmi was initially offered to Sripriya, who could <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> role due to her prior commitments, before Sridevi was chosen for it. Poornam Vishwanathan was cast as the school headmaster, while Silk Smitha, who had done around 20 films by then and was considered only for performing item numbers, was cast as the headmaster's sexually excited wife.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} the changed circumstances, the Archbishop of Goa, by a provision issued on 20 February 1795, appointed Minguel José Louis Mendes interim vicar {{of the four}} sub-districts of Mangalore, Barcoor, Onore and Moolki. Some other priests also came to Canara with the new vicar. Those from Goa retained their old prejudices and could <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> rule of Tipu, openly advocating rebellion against him, writing offensive letters and making offensive speeches. As a result, in 1797, the brief repite enjoyed by the Christians ceased and their persecution recommenced.|$|E

5|$|Basta's {{soldiers}} accompanied Sigismund to Tokaj. Before long, {{he went to}} Prague to beg for RudolphII's mercy. He {{received the}} incolatus (or the right to own lands in Bohemia) in 1604. After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, but he did <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, {{saying that he had}} no information about the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor's offer.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> domain method.|$|E

A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated Christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> theology therein or that Christ was the only son of God.|$|E
5|$|Finnish-German {{relations}} cooled {{after the}} National Socialists rose {{to power in}} 1933—Finns admired Imperial Germany, not the radical and anti-democratic Nazi regime. Finnish conservatives did <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> state violence and anti-church policies of the Nazis. Still, there was sympathy for German aims to revise the Treaty of Versailles, although the official Finnish policy was reserved, especially after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Finland even recalled its ambassador for a short period. Finnish Nazis and ultranationalist parties such as the IKL achieved only minor support in several elections, especially {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Mäntsälä rebellion in 1932.|$|E

They were impressed and asked Škoda for a quote to repair them. The Hungarians did <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> price, but Škoda fixed them for free once the Hungarians had bought a license to build the medium 40M Turán I tank in August 1940. The tanks were returned to Hungary in March 1941 and were used for training through 1943.|$|E

As late as 1947 there were still 2,000 in Northern Irish camps. The last of the evacuees did not see the Rock again until 1951.|$|E
5|$|In October 1588 the Diet {{proposed}} {{to declare the}} sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania. He did <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> offer, mainly {{because he did not}} want to expel his confessor, Alfonso Carillo. The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not to resist the Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.|$|E
5|$|It was {{suggested}} that she would run for senator for the Buenos Aires Province at the 2017 midterm elections, but her former minister Florencio Randazzo wanted to run for those elections as well. Refusing to run in primary elections, Kirchner asked for a shared ticket as a condition to run for senator. Randazzo did <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> proposal. The FPV was renamed as the Citizen's Unity Party at the province and registered as a coalition of minor parties only, leaving the PJ out of it. As a result, both parties would run to the elections as unrelated parties.|$|E

A resident of the land, Mrs Saitch of Home Farm, had her tenancy cancelled on 29 September and was paid compensation by the military until 25 March 1921, although the authorities did not believe her worthy.|$|E
