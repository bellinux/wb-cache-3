Out of the stars observed, a list of faint blue stars was constructed by Milton L. Humason and Fritz Zwicky in 1947, with their blue hue suggesting a relatively high effective temperature. The 29th star on their list, HZ 29, was found to have the most peculiar spectrum out of the set. It displayed an absence of hydrogen lines, but broad, diffuse lines of neutral (non-ionized) helium. This was interpreted as a hydrogen-deficient white dwarf. In 1962, this star was observed with a photoelectric detector and was found to vary in magnitude over a period of 18 minutes. The light curve of the variation displayed a double sinusoid pattern. Later, a flickering behavior was observed, which suggested a mass transfer.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} Faraday {{rotation}} measure (RM) {{due to the}} Galactic magnetic field (GMF) toward high Galactic latitudes. The RM arises from the global, regular component {{as well as from}} the turbulent, random component of the GMF. We model the former based on observations and the latter using the data of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. For a large number of different GMF models, we produce mock RM maps around the <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles</b> and calculate various statistical quantities with the RM maps. We find that the observed medians of RMs toward the <b>north</b> and south <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles,</b> ∼ 0. 0 ± 0. 5 rad m^- 2 and ∼ + 6. 3 ± 0. 5 rad m^- 2, are difficult to explain with any of our many alternate GMF models. The standard deviation of observed RMs, ∼ 9 rad m^- 2, is clearly larger than that of simulated RMs. The second-order structure function of observed RMs is substantially larger than that of simulated RMs, especially at small angular scales. We discuss other possible contributions to RM toward high Galactic latitudes. Besides observational errors and the intrinsic RM of background radio sources against which RM is observed, we suggest that the RM due to the intergalactic magnetic field may account for a substantial fraction of the observed RM. Finally we note that reproducing the observed medians may require additional components or/and structures of the GMF that are not present in our models. Comment: To appear in ApJ.

The reduced VPF measured from the 2 dFGRS is in excellent agreement with the paradigm of hierarchical scaling of the galaxy clustering moments. The accuracy of our measurement is such that we can rule out, at a very high significance, popular models for galaxy clustering, including the lognormal distribution. We demonstrate that the negative binomial model gives a very good approximation to the 2 dFGRS data over a wide range of scales, out to at least 20 h- 1 Mpc. Conversely, the reduced VPF for dark matter in a LambdaCDM universe does appear to be lognormal on small scales but deviates significantly beyond ≈ 4 h- 1 Mpc.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the detection of}} non-Gaussianity in the 4 -year COBE data reported by Pando, Valls-Gabaud & Fang (1998), using a technique based on the discrete wavelet transform. Their analysis {{was performed on the}} two DMR faces centred on the <b>North</b> and South <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles</b> respectively, using the Daubechies 4 wavelet basis. We show that these results depend critically on the orientation of the data, and so should be treated with caution. For two distinct orientations of the data, we calculate unbiased estimates of the skewness, kurtosis and scale-scale correlation of the corresponding wavelet coefficients in all of the available scale domains of the transform. We obtain several detections of non-Gaussianity in the DMR-DSMB map at greater than the 99 per cent confidence level, but most of these occur on pixel-pixel scales and are therefore not cosmological in origin. Indeed, after removing all multipoles beyond ℓ = 40 from the COBE maps, only one robust detection remains. Moreover, using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of obtaining such a detection by chance is 0. 59. We repeat the analysis for the 53 + 90 GHz coadded COBE map. In this case, after removing ℓ > 40 multipoles, two non-Gaussian detections at the 99 per cent level remain. Nevertheless, again using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of obtaining two such detections by chance is 0. 28. Thus, we conclude the wavelet technique does not yield strong evidence for non-Gaussianity of cosmological origin in the 4 -year COBE data. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures.
