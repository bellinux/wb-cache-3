5|$|I. ottingeri, {{described}} by Peter Galton and James A. Jensen in 1979, is a <b>nomen</b> dubium based on teeth from the possibly Aptian-age lower Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description is ambiguous, leaving much room for interpretation, and they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a <b>nomen</b> dubium, and Fries's description as <b>nomen</b> confusum, and advocated the abandonment of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E

In 1848, van Haren <b>Noman</b> established its first bookshop in a small rented room on Buiten Nieuwpoort Straat (now Jalan Pintu Besar Selatan). Not long after, van Haren <b>Noman</b> acquired larger premises on Binnen Nieuwpoort Straat (now Jalan Pintu Besar Utara).|$|R

5|$|Allosaurus sibiricus was {{described}} in 1914 by A. N. Riabinin {{on the basis of}} a bone, later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal, from the Early Cretaceous of Buryatia, Russia. It was transferred to Chilantaisaurus in 1990, but is now considered a <b>nomen</b> dubium indeterminate beyond Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Cetiosauriscus longus: In 1990, John Stanton McIntosh {{recombined}} Cetiosaurus longus as {{a species}} of Cetiosauriscus. This classification is not accepted and Cetiosauriscus longus is a junior objective synonym of Cetiosaurus longus because it cannot be proven to possess any characteristic autapomorphies of Cetiosauriscus. In 1993, Charig found the species to be a <b>nomen</b> dubium.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Maaibre Sheshi is {{the best}} attested ruler of the Second Intermediate Period {{in terms of the}} number of {{artefacts}} attributed to him, with 396 seals and two seal impressions showing his <b>nomen</b> or prenomen. This figure is three times higher than the 123 seals attributed to the next best attested king of the period, Yakbim Sekhaenre.|$|E

50|$|<b>Noman</b> {{was once}} a very {{powerful}} warlord who went to Anacrea 200 years ago, entered the Garden, founded the Noble Warriors and wrote their Rule. He first appears in <b>Noman</b> and reveals himself to Seeker through a mirror. He also gives Seeker advice and explains more about the experiment. It is later revealed that <b>Noman</b> was once the Assassin and that when went into the Garden 200 years ago, {{it was he who}} killed the All and Only in his quest for knowledge. <b>Noman</b> is also Seeker but grown much older.|$|R
5|$|Diracodon laticeps was {{described}} by Marsh in 1881, from some jawbone fragments. Bakker resurrected D. laticeps in 1986 as a senior synonym of S. stenops, although others note that the material is not diagnostic and is only referable to Stegosaurus sp., making it a <b>nomen</b> dubium.|$|E
5|$|I. major, {{a species}} named by Justin Delair in 1966, based on {{vertebrae}} from the Isle of Wight and Sussex originally described by Owen in 1842 {{as a species}} of Streptospondylus, S. major, is a <b>nomen</b> dubium.|$|E
5|$|I. orientalis, {{described}} by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1952, {{was based on}} poor material, but a skull with a distinctive arched snout that {{had been assigned to}} it was renamed Altirhinus kurzanovi in 1998. At the same time, I. orientalis was considered to be a <b>nomen</b> dubium because it cannot be compared to I. bernissartensis.|$|E

Reema and Meera believe them and fall in love with them.|$|R
50|$|Seeker after Truth is {{the protagonist}} of the Noble Warriors Trilogy and he turns 16 at the {{beginning}} of Seeker. He discovers that he has power without limits which he uses to kill the savanters. By the end of <b>Noman,</b> he has killed all of the savanters and he also discovers that himself, Jango and <b>Noman</b> are all the same person, and that he is the Assassin, just as <b>Noman</b> was 200 years ago.|$|R
5|$|The {{second issue}} is whether the name should be Leopoldia. In 1819 Herbert had {{proposed}} Leopoldia as a <b>nomen</b> provisorium (provisional name) for the same taxon as he called Hippeastrum in 1821. Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated (i.e. became the correct name), this was overlooked, and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia {{was used for the}} genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name Leopoldia was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species, allied to Muscari. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both Hippeastrum and Leopoldia, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert's Hippeastrum and Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Hippeastrum Herb. is now a <b>nomen</b> conservandum (conserved name), i.e. the correct name regardless {{of the fact that it}} does not have priority over Leopoldia.|$|E
5|$|This list {{of dinosaurs}} is a {{comprehensive}} listing of all genera that have ever {{been included in the}} superorder Dinosauria, excluding class Aves (birds, both living and those known only from fossils) and purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (<b>nomen</b> dubium), or were not formally published (<b>nomen</b> nudum), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered dinosaurs. Many listed names have been reclassified as everything from birds to crocodilians to petrified wood. The list contains 1513 names, of which approximately 1190 are considered either valid dinosaur genera or nomina dubia.|$|E
5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a <b>nomen</b> dubium.|$|E
50|$|Ammara <b>Noman</b> {{was born}} to Muslim parents in 1981 in peshawar, khyber pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. She is married to <b>Noman</b> sheikh, couple have four children. She was married {{at a very young}} age and only has High school diploma.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853, Kolff {{was made}} a partner of the new company, {{and the name of}} the firm was changed to Van Haren <b>Noman</b> & Kolff. In 1858, van Haren <b>Noman</b> {{returned}} to the Netherlands and the firm became G. Kolff & Co.|$|R
5000|$|In Jango, it is {{mentioned}} that <b>Noman</b> lived on Anacrea over 200 years ago. Nothing {{has been said}} of his death but one of Seeker's teachers said that <b>Noman</b> left them to [...] "submit himself to his final test. He was never seen again".|$|R
5|$|After {{examining}} the holotype in London, Hershkovitz instead placed the {{species in the}} genus Oryzomys in 1948. He remarked {{that it was an}} especially distinctive member of that genus, and hence classified it in its own subgenus Micronectomys. J. Hernández-Camacho described a second species of Micronectomys, Oryzomys (Micronectomys) borreroi, from Colombia in 1957. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated O.dimidiatus in another publication and conceded that his name Micronectomys was a <b>nomen</b> nudum ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Micronectomys remains a <b>nomen</b> nudum. Hershkovitz also noted that while O.dimidiatus resembles a juvenile Nectomys in external anatomy, it is otherwise similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). He accepted O.borreroi as an Oryzomys, but did not think it closely related to O.dimidiatus. Six years later, Alfred Gardner and James Patton instead suggested that O.borreroi was a Zygodontomys, and in his 1991 review of that genus Robert Voss confirmed that it is the same as Zygodontomys brunneus.|$|E
5|$|Another taxon that Czerkas {{assigned}} to the pterosauria and named Utahdactylus was reviewed by Dr. Chris Bennett. Bennett found multiple misidentifications of bones and inconsistencies between Czerkas' diagrams and the actual fossils. Bennett found the specimen to be an indeterminate diapsid and criticized the previous authors for publishing a species name when no diagnostic characters below the class level could be verified. He made Utahdactylus a <b>nomen</b> dubium.|$|E
5|$|D. lacustris ("of the lake") is a <b>nomen</b> dubium, {{named by}} Marsh in 1884 based on {{specimen}} YPM 1922 found by Arthur Lakes, {{consisting of the}} snout and upper jaw of a smaller animal from Morrison, Colorado. These remains are now {{believed to have been}} from an immature animal, rather than from a separate species. In 2015, it was concluded that the specimen actually belonged to Camarasaurus.|$|E
5000|$|In 1602, {{during the}} British ship Concords {{exploration}} of Cape Cod, Captain Bartholomew Gosnold named <b>Nomans</b> Land [...] "Marthas Vineyard" [...] after his eldest daughter, Martha. However, {{the name was}} later transferred to the larger island currently known as Marthas Vineyard, which is located northeast of <b>Nomans</b> Land.|$|R
50|$|<b>Noman</b> Çelebicihan Battalion (Батальйон імені Номана Челебіджіхана, <b>Noman</b> Çelebicihan Batalyonı, Numan Çelebicihan Taburu) is a Crimean Tatar {{volunteer}} battalion {{named after}} <b>Noman</b> Çelebicihan, {{the base of}} the battalion will be in Kherson region bordering Crimea. Crimean Tatar battalion reportedly has received assistance from Turkey. The battalion is set to help the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine in the region bordering Crimea. The battalion emerged from participants in the 2015 activist-led blockade of Crimea that stopped Ukrainian cargo from reaching the Crimean peninsula. The battalion is planned to include 560 people.|$|R

He then did a TV serial from PTV Quetta Centre. He then appeared in many different roles, including negative roles in the dramas Rihaee and Ullu Baraye Farokht Nahi. He then appeared in film Ramchand Pakistani (2008) where he romanced Nandita Das. <b>Noman</b> Ijaz hosted a TV comedy show on PTV Home. [...] In 2012, <b>Noman</b> Ijaz received a Pride of Performance award from the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari.|$|R
5|$|In 1901 Baron Franz Nopcsa renamed Laelaps trihedrodon Cope 1877 into Megalosaurus trihedrodon. In {{the same}} {{publication}} Nopcsa renamed Poekilopleuron valens Leidy 1870 into Megalosaurus valens; this probably represents fossil material of Allosaurus. In 1902, Nopcsa named Megalosaurus hungaricus {{based on two}} teeth found in Transylvania, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The specimens, MAFI ob. 3106, were later lost. It represents an indeterminate theropod. In 1903, Louis Dollo named Megalosaurus lonzeensis based on a manual claw found near Lonzee in Belgium. He had first reported this claw in 1883, {{and as a result}} some sources by mistake indicate this year as the date of the naming. It perhaps represents a member of the Noasauridae, or an indeterminate member of the Coelurosauria. In 1907/1908, von Huene renamed Streptospondylus cuvieri Owen 1842, based on a presently lost partial vertebra, into Megalosaurus cuvieri. This is today seen as a <b>nomen</b> dubium, an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. In 1909, Richard Lydekker named Megalosaurus woodwardi, based on a maxilla with tooth, specimen BMNH 41352. This is today seen as a <b>nomen</b> dubium, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Goodwin {{and colleagues}} {{considered}} Ornatotholus a juvenile S. validum, therefore a junior synonym. In 2000, Robert M. Sullivan referred S. edmontonensis and S. brevis to the genus Prenocephale (until then only {{known from the}} Mongolian species P. prenes), and found {{it more likely that}} S. bexelli belonged to Prenocephale than to Stegoceras, but considered it a <b>nomen</b> dubium (dubious name, without distinguishing characters) due to its incompleteness, and noted its holotype specimen appeared to be lost. In 2003, Thomas E. Williamson and Thomas Carr considered Ornatotholus a <b>nomen</b> dubium, or perhaps a juvenile Stegoceras. In a 2003 revision of Stegoceras, Sullivan agreed that Ornatotholus was a junior synonym of Stegoceras, moved S. lambei to the new genus Colepiocephale, and S. sternbergi to Hanssuesia. He stated that the genus Stegoceras had become a wastebasket taxon for small to medium-sized North American pachycephalosaurs until that point. By this time, dozens of specimens had been referred to S. validum, including many domes too incomplete to be identified as Stegoceras with certainty. UALVP 2 is still the most complete specimen of Stegoceras, upon which most scientific understanding of the genus is based.|$|E
5|$|In his 1962 Ph.D. thesis, Clayton Ray {{considered}} O.hammondi to be {{most closely}} related to Megalomys, which includes giant rats from the Caribbean, and classified it {{as a member of}} the subgenus Megalomys of genus Oryzomys. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated the species in another publication and noted that his name Macruroryzomys was a <b>nomen</b> nudum ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Macruroryzomys remains a <b>nomen</b> nudum. Hershkovitz rejected any relationship between O.hammondi and Nectomys or O.aphrastus and instead argued that O.hammondi was closely similar to Megalomys and may be close to the ancestor of Megalomys. In 1982, Steadman and Ray mentioned the animal in passing under the name Macruroryzomys hammondi and reaffirmed its relationship to Megalomys. In the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World, Guy Musser and Michael Carleton listed O.hammondi as an Oryzomys of obscure affinities, but suggested that it may be related to Megalomys.|$|E
