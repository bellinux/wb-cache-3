5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E

25|$|The common-law {{elements}} of burglary often vary between jurisdictions. The common-law definition has been expanded in most jurisdictions, {{such that the}} building <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dwelling or even a building in the conventional sense, physical breaking is not necessary, the entry {{does not need to}} occur at night, and the intent may be to commit any felony or theft.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} two {{structurally}} equivalent formal definitions of quasigroup. One defines a quasigroup as a set with one binary operation, and the other, from universal algebra, defines a quasigroup as having three primitive operations. The homomorphic image of a quasigroup defined with a single binary operation, however, <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> quasigroup. We begin with the first definition.|$|E

25|$|The {{image of}} a continuous, {{injective}} function from R2 to higher-dimensional Rn {{is said to be}} a parametric surface. Such an image is so-called because the x- and y- directions of the domain R2 are 2 variables that parametrize the image. A parametric surface <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> topological surface. A surface of revolution can be viewed as a special kind of parametric surface.|$|E
25|$|Like a manifold, an orbifold is {{specified}} by local conditions; however, {{instead of being}} locally modelled on open subsets of Rn, an orbifold is locally modelled on quotients of open subsets of Rn by finite group actions. The structure of an orbifold encodes not only that of the underlying quotient space, which <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> manifold, but also that of the isotropy subgroups.|$|E
25|$|Expansion {{of humans}} and {{technological}} progress has usually resulted {{in some form of}} environmental devastation, and destruction of ecosystems and their accompanying wildlife.

25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopes {{are often}} used in electron diffraction mode. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are that the specimen <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single crystal or even a polycrystalline powder, and also that the Fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the phase problem faced by the X-ray crystallographers after obtaining their X-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or polycrystalline powder.|$|E
25|$|British Prime Ministers {{have never}} been elected {{directly}} by the public. A Prime Minister <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> party leader; David Lloyd George was not a party leader during his service as prime Minister during World War I, and neither was Ramsay MacDonald from 1931 to 1935. Prime Ministers have taken office because they were members of either the Commons or Lords, and either inherited {{a majority in the}} Commons or won more seats than the opposition in a general election.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule any {{candidate}} {{for a position on}} a committee of the union must also be a workplace representative, in order to retain the connection with workplaces. However retired members may hold branch positions; until a rule change in 2005, retired members wishing to hold a position other than Branch Secretary needed the NEC's consent. A further exception is made for the equalities committees where a committee member is expected to be in employment but <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> representative.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} generalist aphid and scale predators and {{incidental}} substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types. This makes {{some of them}} particularly valuable as agents in biological control programmes. Determination of specialisation <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> trivial matter, though; for example the larva of the Vedalia ladybird Rodolia cardinalis is a specialist predator on a few species of Monophlebidae, in particular Icerya purchasi, {{which is the most}} notorious of the cottony cushion scale species. However, the adult R. cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.|$|E
25|$|In Charismatic and Pentecostal communities, anointing of {{the sick}} is a {{frequent}} practice and {{has been an important}} ritual in these communities since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Some Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing and so there is often great expectation or at least great hope that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislation}} {{provided for}} {{two levels of}} courts: a number of Local Courts to established in each of Malawi's 27 districts, mainly in rural areas and District Appeals Local Courts, one in each district, to hear appeals from the Local Courts. Further appeals may {{be made to the}} High Court, to which both types of Local Courts are subordinate. Each local court and District Appeals Local Court would be headed by chairperson, who <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lawyer, but with a reasonable standard of education, proficiency in English and adequate knowledge of the customary law and language of the area that the court serves. Local Courts also have assessors to advise on local customary law. Assessor must be at least 50 years old. The Local Courts would have no jurisdiction over civil cases involving title to or ownership of customary land, property inheritance involving the guardianship of infants, issues of witchcraft or about a chief's title. This is to help limit possible corruption. Complaints have been made that the Local Courts, popularly called Traditional Courts are charging excessive court fees to settle disputes.|$|E
