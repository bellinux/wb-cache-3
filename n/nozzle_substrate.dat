40|$|The present {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} the cold spray process examines the gas and particle dynamics {{both inside and outside}} the nozzle in the context of improving particle deposition. In the first part of the investigation, the one-dimensional isentropic relations coupled with the drag force acting on a particle is employed in a parametric study of the nozzle performance. Next, the addition of a barrel section to the end of the nozzle is proposed and shown to be more efficient in some cases than using the diverging section of the nozzle for particle acceleration. Finally, the effect of nozzle wall friction is incorporated to assess the amount of deviation from the isentropic model. The gas and particle dynamics between the <b>nozzle</b> and <b>substrate</b> during the steady cold spray process is the focus of the second part of the investigation. An underexpanded and overexpanded nozzle is employed to accelerate the particles and the operating conditions were set to those used in the validation cases. The particle impact statistics are extracted to provide information on the particle impact speed, angle and location. The particles are also tracked during their flight between the <b>nozzle</b> and <b>substrate</b> to characterise their response to changes in the gas flow. It was found that the variation in particle speed across the embedded shock structures became minimal as the diameter increased. For particles with a Stokes number greater than one, the nozzle exit velocity may be used as an approximation of the impact speed. A theoretical model is also proposed for calculating the particle impact speed using the nozzle exit conditions. The deployment of the shock tube in cold spray is a recent innovation in which a planar shock is released into the ambient air towards a substrate while the particles are injected across the wake of the shock. Although the process suffers from a number of practical limitations, monodisperse particles are used to compare the impact speed produced by steady and unsteady cold spray processes. It was found that this process also offers a mean of studying the shock formation process in underexpanded impinging jets. The shock speeds were selected such that either a shock diamond or Mach disk is reproduced in the impingement region characteristic of a moderately and highly underexpanded jet. Although the unsteady cold spray process requires a much lower driving pressure to produce the impact speeds found during the steady process, there are several practical limitations associated with it...|$|R

Interestingly, it is realized that the bubble volume expansion rate follows a cyclic behavior for the <b>substrate</b> <b>nozzles</b> while it shows a smooth decrease after an initial increase for the needle nozzles. Force balance analysis suggests that fluctuations in the substrate are related to the rapid increase of the attaching inertial force at the initial stages of bubble formation.

The results also show that bubbles emerge earlier on top of the substrate than on the needle but the initial bubble volume is smaller in the former case. However, the bubble expansion rate is larger for the substrate than for the needle and as a result the final bubble volume is similar for both cases.

The results show the size decreases with the frequency and voltage, but increases with the duty ratio. A minimum width line of 92 渭m is obtained when applied voltage, voltage frequency, duty ratio, <b>nozzle</b> tip to <b>substrate</b> distance and flow rate are set to be 2450 V, 40 %, 70 Hz, 1 mm and 100 渭l/h, respectively. When exposed to NH 3 gas, electrohydrodynamic printed polyaniline lines have a rapid response time to NH 3. A minimum concentration of about 300 ppm of NH 3 can be detected. 漏 2012 IMechE...|$|R
40|$|Micro/nano-scale {{manufacturing}} Electrohydrodynamic jet printing Manufacturing process System design/integration a b s t r a c t This paper {{discusses the}} design and integration of a desktop system for electrohydrodynamic jet (E-jet) printing. E-jet printing is a micro/nano-manufacturing process that uses an electric field to induce fluid jet printing through micro/nano-scale nozzles. This enables better control and resolution than traditional jet-printing processes. The printing process is predominantly controlled by changing the voltage poten-tial between the <b>nozzle</b> and the <b>substrate.</b> The push to drive E-jet printing towards a viable micro/nano-manufacturing process {{has led to the}} design of a compact, cost effective, and user friendly desktop E-jet printing system. The hardware and software components of the desktop system are described in the paper. Experimental results are presented to validate the performance of the system. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
