40|$|ABSTRACT. To each {{quadratic}} number field K {{and each}} quadratic polynomial f with K-coefficients, one can associate a finite directed graph G (<b>f,</b> <b>K)</b> whose vertices are the K-rational preperiodic points for f, and whose edges reflect {{the action of}} f on these points. This paper has two main goals. (1) For an abstract directed graph G, classify the pairs (<b>K,</b> <b>f)</b> such that the isomorphism class of G is realized by G (<b>f,</b> <b>K).</b> We succeed completely for many graphs G by applying a variety of dynamical and Diophantine techniques. (2) Give a complete description of the set of isomorphism classes of graphs that can be realized by some G (<b>f,</b> <b>K).</b> <b>A</b> conjecture of Morton and Silverman implies that this set is finite. Based on our theoretical considerations and a wealth of empirical evidence derived from an algorithm that is developed in this paper, we speculate on {{a complete list of}} isomorphism classes of graphs that arise from quadratic polynomials over quadratic fields. 1...|$|R

Taussky and Wielandt [Proc. Amer. Math.

In this thesis we discuss relations involving <b>f</b> <b>k</b> (X, Y; σ) where X, Y Ɛ L and 1 ≤ k ˂ n. We show: 1. If F is infinite and if for each X Ɛ L there exists σ so that <b>f</b> <b>k</b> (<b>A,</b> X; σ) = 0 where 1 ≤ k ˂ n, then A is a scalar transformation. 2. If F is algebraically closed, a necessary and sufficient condition that there exists a basis of V with respect to which the matrices of A and B are both in block upper triangular form, where the blocks on the diagonals are either one- or two-dimensional, is that certain products X 1, X 2 …X r belong to the radical of the algebra generated by A and B over F, where X i has the form f 2 (A, P(A,B); σ), for all polynomials P(x, y). We partially generalize this to the case where the blocks have dimensions ≤ <b>k.</b> 3. If <b>A</b> and B generate L, if the characteristic of F does not divide n and if there exists σ so that <b>f</b> <b>k</b> (<b>A,</b> B; σ) = 0, for some k with 1 ≤ k ˂ n, then the characteristic roots of B belong to the splitting field of g k (w; σ) = w 2 K+ 1 - σ 1 w 2 K- 1 + σ 2 w 2 K- 3 - …. +(- 1) K σ <b>K</b> w over <b>F.</b> We use this result to prove a theorem involving a generalized form of property L [cf.

Two extreme models of accretion are investigated.

Condensates formed in this homogeneous accretion model include several phases such as whitlockite, alkali feldspars, and apatite minerals which are found in chondrites. In the other extreme complete isolation of newly formed condensates from prior condensates and gases occurs due to a time scale for accretion that is short relative to the time required for nebular cooling or dissipation. The condensates produced in this heterogeneous accretion model include alkali sulfides, ammonium halides, and ammonium phosphates. None of these phases are found in chondrites.
