The pump flows were maintained at nominal rates of 90, 100, and 120 ml · kg- 1 · min- 1 for 1 week each, with the order varying from experiment to experiment. A total of 30 incremental exercise tests were performed on five animals. No significant changes in mean aortic pressure were observed during nonpulsatile perfusion at the three <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> rates of nonpulsatile flow either before or during exercise. The systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly during exercise (from 705 ± 22 to 547 ± 81 dyne · sec · cm- 5, p < 0. 01, and from 604 ± 25 to 510 ± 15 dyne · sec · cm- 5, p < 0. 05, at <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> rates of 100 and 120 ml · kg- 1 · min- 1, respectively).

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} multi–inventory systems in presence of uncertain demand. We assume that i) demand is unknown but bounded in an assigned compact set and ii) the control inputs (controlled flows) {{are subject to}} assigned constraints. Given a long–term average demand, we select a <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> that feeds such a demand. In this context, {{we are interested in}} a control strategy that meets at each time all possible current demands and achieves the <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> in the average. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for such a strategy to exist and we characterize the set of achievable flows. Such conditions are based on linear programming and thus they are constructive. In the special case of a static flow (i. e. a system with 0 –capacity buffers) we show that the strategy must be affine. The dynamic problem can be solved by a linear-saturated control strategy (inspired by the previous one). We provide numerical analysis and illustrating examples...|$|R

They control, among other things, the new nozzles’ flow rate by comparison with the <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> rate. When the deviation exceeds a set limit, the nozzles are rejected. A survey carried out among three manufacturers made it possible to determine the manufacturing tolerances and limits that manufacturers impose upon themselves. The flow rates of 1565 new nozzles collected on the market from these manufacturers were measured on a device developed for this study. Different statistical tests assessed the performances and characteristics of the products. The quality standards announced by the manufacturers were not checked for every nozzle. On average, 20 % of the new nozzles exceeded the manufacturing tolerances. The average flow rate of the nozzle sets equalled the <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> rate.

40|$|Filter holders and {{continuous}} air monitors (CAMs) are used {{extensively in the}} nuclear industry. It is important to minimize leakage in these devices and in recognition of this consideration, a limit on leakage for sampling systems is specified in ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999; however the protocol given in the standard is really germane to measurement of significant leakage, e. g., several percent of the sampling flow rate. In the present study, a technique for quantifying leakage was developed and that approach {{was used to measure}} the sealing integrity of a CAM and two kinds of filter holders. The methodology involves use of sulfur hexafluoride as a tracer gas with the device being tested operated under dynamic flow conditions. The leak rates in these devices were determined in the pressure range from 2. 49 kPa (10 In. H 2 O) vacuum to 2. 49 kPa (10 In. H 2 O) pressure at a typical flow rate of 56. 6 L/min (2 cfm). For the two filter holders, the leak rates were less than 0. 007 % of the <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> rate. The leak rate in the CAM was less than 0. 2 % of the <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> rate. These values are well within the limit prescribed in the ANSI standard, which is 5 % of the <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> rate. Therefore the limit listed in the ANSI standard should be reconsidered as lower values can be achieved, and the methodology presented herein can be used to quantify lower leakage values in sample collectors and analyzers.

40|$|Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) is a pool type 5 MW {{research}} reactor. It {{is assumed}} that external objects or debris that may fall down to reactor core cause obstruction of coolant flow {{through one of the}} fuel assemblies. Thermal hydraulic analysis of this event, using the RELAP 5 system code has been studied. The reported transient is related to the partial and total obstruction of a single Fuel Element (FE) cooling channel of 27 FE equilibrium core of TRR. Such event constitutes a severe accident for this type of reactor since it may lead to local dryout and eventually to loss of the FE integrity. Two scenarios are analysed to emphasize the severity of the accident. The first one is a partial blockage of an average FE considering four different obstruction levels: 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 97 % of <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> area. The second one is an extreme scenario consisting of total blockage of the same FE. This study constitutes the first step of a larger work which consists of performing a 3 -D simulation using the Best Estimate coupled code technique. However, as a first approach the instantaneous reactor power is derived through the point kinetic calculation included in the RELAP 5 code. Main results obtained from the RELAP 5 calculations are as following: 1. In the case of flow blockage under 97 % of the <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> area of an average FE, only an increase of the coolant and clad temperatures is observed without any consequences for the integrity of the FE. The mass flow rate remains sufficient to cool the clad safely. 2.

The implications {{connected to the}} problem are multiple and disparate, from fire-safety to rocket propulsion. In condition of normal gravity, on Earth, an opposing-flow due to buoyancy is always present. The present work {{is focused on the}} interaction between this natural convective flow and the aerodynamic boundary layer generated by a forced-flow blown over thin cellulosic or PMMA fuel sheets. A wind tunnel was used to generate flow velocities in the range of 0 - 100 cm/s and blow it against the spread of a laminar flame over the solid fuel samples. Experiment were ran in a vertical downward and in a horizontal configuration to change the angle of gravity respect to the spread direction and hence the importance of the buoyancy-generated flow. Results showed, for constant <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> velocity, a decreasing spread rate during the flame motion along the sample. This can be related to a flow residence time reduction due to the increasing velocity actually seen by the flame embedded in the boundary layer. From the spread rate results also an approximate evaluation of the buoyant flow velocity inside the wind tunnel was performed. In both configurations the distance from the sample leading edge at which the flame experienced extinction was found to increase with the free-stream velocity. Comparing horizontal and downward spread, extinction distance was found to be generally larger in the second case but the difference was appreciable only for high <b>nominal</b> <b>flow</b> velocities...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} flow of reactor coolant pump (RCP) {{is much more}} complex than the flow of a general mixed-flow pump due to high temperature, high pressure, and large flow rate. The pressure pulsation that is induced by rotor-stator interaction (RSI) has significant effects on the performance of pump; therefore, it is necessary to figure out the distribution and propagation characteristics of pressure pulsation in the pump. The study uses CFD method to calculate the behavior of the flow. Results show that the amplitudes of pressure pulsation get the maximum between the rotor and stator, and the dissipation rate of pressure pulsation in impellers passage is larger than that in guide vanes passage. The behavior is associated with the frequency of pressure wave in different regions. The flow rate distribution is influenced by the operating conditions. The study finds that, at <b>nominal</b> <b>flow,</b> the flow rate distribution in guide vanes is relatively uniform and the pressure pulsation amplitude is the smallest.
