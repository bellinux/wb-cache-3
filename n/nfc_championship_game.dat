5|$|In 1995, Favre won {{the first}} of his three AP MVP awards. Favre led the Packers to an 11–5 record, Green Bay's best record in nearly thirty years. Favre passed for a career-high of 4,413yards, 38 touchdowns, and {{recorded}} a quarterback rating of 99.5, which was the highest of his career until he recorded a rating of 107.2 during the 2009 season. Favre also tied an NFL record by passing for at least two touchdowns in twelve consecutive games, a feat he accomplished over the 1994–1995 seasons. The Packers advanced to the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> after upsetting the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Game. The Packers lost the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> to the Dallas Cowboys, marking the third year in a row the Packers season was ended by the Cowboys in the playoffs. Favre helped the Packers advance farther in the playoffs than any other Packer team since 1967, which was the season the Packers last won the championship in Super Bowl II.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} San Francisco 49–3 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs, then Washington 17–0 in the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game.</b> The Giants {{advanced to}} play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI in front of 101,063 fans at the Rose Bowl. After falling behind 10–9 at halftime, they came back to beat the Broncos 39–20. Simms was named the game's MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, the Giants {{defeated the}} Packers 37–20. Manning threw for 330 {{yards and three}} touchdowns, {{two of them to}} wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. This earned the Giants a spot in the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> against the San Francisco 49ers. They won that game in overtime, 20–17 with Lawrence Tynes scoring the game-winning field goal as he did four years earlier in the same game against the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
50|$|Four <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> {{have been}} held at the stadium.|$|R
25|$|The Packers {{have won}} three <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games.</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championships</b> {{did not exist}} until after the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.|$|R
25|$|The Giants {{have won}} five <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games,</b> {{including}} two in overtime in 2007 and 2011.|$|R
5|$|Chicago {{finished}} {{the season with}} an NFC best 13–3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 27-24 in the divisional round of the playoffs, and the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> to advance to Super Bowl XLI. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive. They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.|$|E
5|$|In {{the playoffs}} the Giants, {{who were the}} top seed in the conference ahead of the Bears, {{defeated}} the San Francisco 49ers {{for the second consecutive}} year in the playoffs by a score of 49–3. They then disposed of their division rivals, the Washington Redskins, in the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> 17–0. In the Super Bowl, behind Simms' 88% pass completion percentage and their strong defense, the Giants overcame a 10–9 halftime deficit and scored thirty second half points while allowing only ten more and defeated the Broncos 39–20.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Bears {{started out}} their post-season with a 27–24 {{win over the}} Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they {{defeated}} the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game.</b> Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since 1985. Thomas Jones finished {{the game with a}} franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|From the 1988 to the 1993 seasons, the 49ers {{played in}} {{five out of}} six <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games,</b> winning Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV. But after head coach George Seifert's team lost two {{consecutive}} <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>games</b> to the Dallas Cowboys in 1992 and 1993, San Francisco brought in several veteran free agents to strengthen their defense. Among the players signed were defensive linemen Richard Dent (the MVP of Super Bowl XX), Charles Mann, Rhett Hall, and Rickey Jackson; linebackers Ken Norton Jr. and Gary Plummer; and cornerback Deion Sanders.|$|R
50|$|Barnes {{retired after}} an 11-year career, {{where he was}} part of 8 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> and 3 Super Bowls. He is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best special teams players in Dallas Cowboys history.|$|R
50|$|January 13, 1997: Mark Brunell of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Kerry Collins of the Carolina Panthers {{appeared}} on the cover as their respective teams advance to the AFC and <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games.</b> Both teams lost.|$|R
5|$|Mitchell {{made his}} first two career starts in week {{seventeen}} and in a wild card playoff game win against the Buccaneers. He did not record any receptions in either game. Against the Chicago Bears in a divisional playoff game win on January 19, Mitchell caught two passes for 14yards. In the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> against the Rams on January 27, Mitchell caught one pass for twoyards. A pass intended for him on a fourth-down play was intercepted by Rams defensive back Aeneas Williams to clinch the win for St. Louis. Mitchell finished the season with 21 receptions for 283yards and one touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 team {{not only}} posted their first winning record, but earned {{a playoff spot}} by winning the NFC Central {{division}} title. The playoff spot was secured in the final week in a rain-sodden game against the Kansas City Chiefs, with the only score being a 19-yard field goal by Neil O'Donoghue. They then recorded their first-ever playoff win by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles behind Bell's 142 yards rushing. Tampa Bay hosted the 1979 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> the following week, but lost 9–0 to the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> was a National Football League (NFL) {{game played}} on January 17, 1999, to {{determine}} the National Football Conference (NFC) champion for the 1998 NFL season. The visiting Atlanta Falcons defeated the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings 30–27 in sudden death overtime to win their first conference championship and advance to the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance. As {{a result of their}} loss, the Vikings were eliminated from the playoffs and became the first team {{in the history of the}} NFL to compile a regular season record of 15–1 and not win the Super Bowl.|$|E
50|$|The Dome hosted five NFC playoff games, {{including}} the 1999 and 2001 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games,</b> {{both of which}} the Rams won. The previous franchise, the St. Louis Cardinals, never hosted a playoff game in their history with the city (1960-1987).|$|R
5000|$|After retiring, {{he worked}} as a {{sideline}} reporter with Pat Summerall and John Madden as the lead crew. He worked the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> in 1999 and 2000. [...] He became a broadcaster for The NFL on FOX in 2001 with Scott Graham.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, he {{was left}} {{unprotected}} by the Cowboys in Plan B free agency and was signed by the Denver Broncos. He decided to retire during training camp that season, after playing for 10 years in the NFL and also in three <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>games.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Falcons lost 34–19 to the Denver Broncos {{two weeks}} later in Super Bowl XXXIII. Neither the Falcons nor the Vikings reached the Super Bowl again until the 2016 NFL season, when the Falcons lost in {{overtime}} to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. Although the game long stood as the proudest {{moment in the history}} of the Falcons franchise, the 1998 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> has been remembered for the effect it had on the Vikings players and their fan base, as it is seen by some sportswriters as one of the most devastating losses in NFL history.|$|E
5|$|The Super Bowl is {{an annual}} American {{football}} game that determines {{the champion of}} the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is {{the conclusion of the}} NFL playoffs. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand, usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums. Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (<b>NFC)</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Harris {{to injury}} after the twelfth {{game of the}} season coincided with a decline in {{defensive}} performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9). After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> were held below 21 points.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Board of Selectors {{selected}} Covert to the NFL All-Decade Team. With Covert on the team, the Bears won six NFL Central Division {{titles and}} played in three <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>games,</b> {{along with the}} Super Bowl win.|$|R
50|$|Practicing against Bob Lilly {{since his}} rookie year, helped him become a Pro Bowler and {{solidified}} an offensive line that won 2 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> and 1 Super Bowl. He was nicknamed Johnny Nightlife by his teammates, {{because of his}} thirst for the nightlife.|$|R
50|$|Johnson {{played in}} the NFL for 10 seasons, {{catching}} 193 passes for 3,091 yards and 28 touchdowns. He appeared in 5 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> and 2 Super Bowls. He also tied the Super Bowl records for most fumble recoveries in one game and most career fumble recoveries (2).|$|R
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the excitement that surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's most {{significant}} play, according to Philadelphia media and fans, came on January 11, 2004, in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Packers. Late in the game, with the Eagles losing by three points and facing a 4th and 26 situation, Mitchell caught a 28-yard {{pass for a}} first down. The Eagles tied the score on the same drive and won the game in overtime. Mitchell had another catch for nineyards in the game. In the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> on January 18 against the Carolina Panthers, he caught four passes for 38yards in the loss. Mitchell had 35 catches for 498yards and two touchdowns in 2003.|$|E
5|$|After an offseason of speculation, Favre officially {{signed with}} the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009. He {{would go on to}} have a {{landmark}} season in which he surpassed former Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall for consecutive starts at one position, with 291, became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat every one of the league's 32 franchises since the NFL first expanded to 32 franchises in 2002, surpassed Dan Marino's previous record for four-touchdown games, and was named to his 11th Pro Bowl. The Vikings finished 12-4 and advanced to the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game,</b> ultimately losing in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl XLIV champion New Orleans Saints. Despite the loss, Favre set playoff records for pass completions and passing yards previously held by Joe Montana.|$|E
50|$|For {{thirteen}} seasons, Wright played {{more than}} 200 games, started at right tackle in six <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>games,</b> and played in five Super Bowls, winning two of them: (VI, XII). He earned his {{first of four}} All-Pro honors in 1971 and was voted that same year to the first of six straight Pro Bowls.|$|R
5000|$|Baker {{has been}} the public address {{announcer}} for the Philadelphia Phillies since 1972 and was the Philadelphia Eagles PA announcer from 1985 to 2014.

25|$|For {{this year}} only, the {{starting}} {{times for the}} Conference <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> were changed from the then-customary 12:30p.m. and 4:00p.m. EST to 1:30p.m. and 5:00p.m. EST. This was to accommodate {{the fact that the}} Denver Broncos and San Francisco 49ers hosted the AFC and <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> in the Mountain Time Zone and Pacific Time Zone, respectively—thus avoiding a locally played game at 9:30a.m. PST or 10:30a.m. MST.|$|R
5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever draft choice of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game.</b> However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro {{selection}} {{and went to}} the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16½ sacks. The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman {{of the year by the}} Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro. The Rams advanced to the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game,</b> losing 14-10 to the Minnesota Vikings.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 1998. The {{strength}} of the team during the season was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense continued to struggle. Dave Brown had been released before the season and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. However, neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl-caliber play. Before the 1999 season, the Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins had been the first–ever draft choice of the Carolina Panthers, and in his second season, {{led them to the}} <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game.</b> However, problems with alcohol abuse, conflicts with his teammates, and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Although many people questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a $16.9 million contract, Accorsi was confident in Collins' abilities.|$|E
50|$|For {{this year}} only, the {{starting}} {{times for the}} Conference <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> were changed from the then-customary 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST to 1:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST.

25|$|Despite never {{being in}} the same division, the Giants and 49ers have {{developed}} a heated rivalry over the years. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs (including two <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games,</b> both won by New York) since 1982, which is the most of any two teams in that span. The Giants lead the overall series 20–19, but the postseason series is tied, 4–4.|$|R
50|$|During {{his four}} {{seasons with the}} Cowboys, the team played in two <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>games</b> and competed in Super Bowl X against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In 1977, Hughes left to join Tommy Hudspeth's staff with the Detroit Lions, but after Hudspeth was fired {{at the end of}} the season, Hughes re-joined Dick Nolan, who had been named head coach of the New Orleans Saints.|$|R
