40|$|This work aims {{to give a}} {{comprehensive}} view of <b>magnetic</b> <b>state</b> stability and transformations in PZT-film/FeGa-dot multiferroic composite systems due to the combining effects of size, shape and interfacial coupling strain. It is found that the stable <b>magnetic</b> <b>state</b> of the FeGa nanodots {{is not only a}} function of {{the size and shape of}} the nanodot but also strongly sensitive to the interfacial coupling strain modified by the polarization state of PZT film. In particular, due to the large magnetostriction of FeGa, the phase boundaries between different <b>magnetic</b> <b>states</b> (i. e., in-plane/out-of-plane polar states, and single-/multi-vortex states) of FeGa nanodots can be effectively tuned by the polarization-mediated strain. Fruitful strain-mediated transformation paths of <b>magnetic</b> <b>states</b> including those between states with different orderings (i. e., one is polar and the other is vortex), as well as those between states with the same ordering (i. e., both are polar or both are vortex) have been revealed in {{a comprehensive}} view.

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} on {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations of magnetic transitions in cobalt rings of size (diameter, width and thickness) comparable to the exchange length of cobalt. Magnetization measurements were performed for two sets of magnetic ring arrays: ultra-small magnetic rings (outer diameter 13 nm, inner diameter 5 nm and thickness 5 nm) and small thin-walled magnetic rings (outer diameter 150 nm, width 5 nm and thickness 5 nm). This is the first report on the fabrication and magnetic properties of such small rings. Our calculations suggest that if the magnetic ring's sizes are comparable to, or smaller than, the exchange length of the magnetic material, then only two <b>magnetic</b> <b>states</b> are important - the pure single domain state and the flux closure vortex <b>state.</b> The onion-shape <b>magnetic</b> <b>state</b> does not arise.

Such approach has a significant predictive power and might serve {{as a guide to}} new experimental works. As we will discuss {{in the course of this}} work, it also gives an important insight to the underlying physics behind the experimentally observed phenomena. We start by applying our method to investigate properties of a generic multiferroic material.

Then we focus our attention to particular multiferroic - BiFeO 3 - and reproduce its <b>magnetic</b> <b>states</b> with all of their essential features.

Using phenomenological (micromagnetic) theory, a comprehensive {{survey of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>states</b> and reorientation transitions {{has been carried out}} for multilayer systems with even number of ferromagnetic sub-layers and magnetizations in the plane. In two-layer systems (N= 2) the phase diagrams in dependence on components of the applied field in the plane include "swallow-tail" type regions of (metastable) multistate co-existence and a number of continuous and discontinuous reorientation transitions induced by radial and transversal components of the applied field. In multilayers (N > 4) noncollinear states are spatially inhomogeneous with magnetization varying across the multilayer stack. For weak four-fold anisotropy the <b>magnetic</b> <b>states</b> under influence of an applied field evolve by a complex continuous reorientation into the saturated state. At higher anisotropy they transform into various inhomogeneous and asymmetric structures. The discontinuous transitions between the <b>magnetic</b> <b>states</b> in these two-layers and multilayers are characterized by broad ranges of multi-phase coexistence of the (metastable) states and give rise to specific transitional domain structures.

Parallel strains are shown to lead to two cooperative effects that favor the emergence of itinerant magnetism: enhancement of the DOS of the resonant defect states in the region of the Fermi level and tuning of the Fermi level to the maximum of the related DOS peak. A perpendicular strain is likewise shown to enhance the DOS of the defect states, but it also effects a detunig of the Fermi level that shifts away from the maximum of the DOS of the defect states, which inhibts the emergence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>states.</b> As a result, under biaxial strains the stabilization of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>state</b> depends on the relative magnitudes of the two components of strain.
