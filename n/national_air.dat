5|$|The Akutan Zero was {{destroyed}} during a training accident in February 1945. While the Zero was taxiing for a take-off, a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver lost control and rammed into it. The Helldiver's propeller sliced the Zero into pieces. From the wreckage, William N. Leonard salvaged several gauges, which he {{donated to the}} National Museum of the United States Navy. The Alaska Heritage Museum and the Smithsonian <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> and Space Museum also have small pieces of the Zero.|$|E

5|$|Air traffic {{services}} for all UK airspace {{is provided by}} <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> Traffic Services (NATS), which also provides air traffic control at 15 airports. The largest airport operator is BAA Limited, owner of six UK airports including London Heathrow airport. In some cases airport ownership {{is in the hands}} of local government authorities rather than private businesses, and the largest UK owned operator, Manchester Airports Group, operator of Manchester Airport, Bournemouth Airport, East Midlands Airport, and Humberside Airport, is owned by a consortium of 10 Manchester area local authorities. Whilst the number of airports in the UK runs into hundreds, many are smaller aerodromes dealing with general aviation rather than air transport. In terms of the latter, statistics are collected from 59 main airports, and the largest concentration of services is located in the London and South East of England areas.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, in the {{capacity}} as an engineering advisor, Verville joined General Billy Mitchell and his aide, Lieutenant Clayton Bissell, on their sailing trip to Europe in December 1921. The three men toured France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and England in order {{to check on the}} European progress of aviation. From their research they produced a 206-page report, which was published as an U.S. Army Air Service Information Circular. General Mitchell asked Verville to incorporate some of the European developments they had observed and to produce a plane for the U.S. Army Air Service's participation in the upcoming 1922 <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> Races.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Verville {{left the}} {{government}} service to co-found the Buhl-Verville Aircraft Company with the Buhl family in Detroit. On March 29, 1927, Buhl {{was awarded the}} first Approved Type Certificate for its Buhl-Verville CA-3 Airster (i.e. A.T.C. No. 1) issued by the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce on March 29, 1927. There were a total of 20 of this aircraft manufactured and it broke a number of speed and endurance records, placing {{at the top of}} the Ford National Reliability Air Tour and the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> Races. Verville was the chief designer from the company's founding in 1925 until 1927.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Air France {{signed a}} letter of {{agreement}} to donate a Concorde to the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> and Space Museum in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, Air France honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is {{on display at the}} Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{veterans}} groups {{engaged in}} a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> and Space Museum (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The last survivor of its crew, Theodore Van Kirk, died on July 28, 2014, {{at the age of}} 93.|$|E
