40|$|Operators of {{telecommunications}} networks, network systems manufacturers and policy markers have placed their hopes on ISDN for {{a stable and}} brilliant telecommunications future. However, <b>non-voice</b> <b>service</b> providers, customer premises equipment manufacturers and large users fear that the envisaged network approach will not serve their future requirements. Telecommunications networks will have a strategic importance in national economic development. It {{is important not to}} constrain that development by tying them to an inappropriate and inflexible network structure. In this article the uncertainties of the ISDN network are reviewed, questions are raised and the evolution of the network is examined, {{from the perspective of the}} actors involved in the sector: large users, equipment manufacturers, policy makers and service providers. ...|$|E
5000|$|Like India's KPO industry, the Philippine KPO {{sector has}} evolved along similar lines. Starting with contact center {{services}} and low-value back office work like data entry and IT maintenance, {{the country is}} now considered an established destination for animation and design and content/publishing KPO services (Sathe and Aradhana, Sourcingmag.com). Back office and <b>non-voice</b> <b>services</b> contributed $1.1 billion in revenues to the country's outsourcing sector in 2009. Former IBPAP executive director for information research Gillian Virata said that the Philippine KPO industry {{is expected to reach}} the same market size as the voice service sector by 2015-2016. <b>Non-voice</b> <b>services</b> are already growing at a faster rate than traditional voice services.|$|R
40|$|In a frequency-division/demand-assigned multiple-access (FD/DAMA) architecture, each mobile {{subscriber}} {{must make a}} connection request to the Network Management Center before transmission for either open-end or closed-end services. Open-end services are for voice calls and long file transfer and are processed on a blocked-call-cleared basis. Closed-end services are for transmitting burst data and are processed on a first-come first-served basis. This paper presents the signalling design and architecture for <b>non-voice</b> <b>services</b> of an FD/DAMA mobile satellite network. The connection requests are made through the recently proposed multiple channel collision resolution scheme which provides a significantly higher throughput than the traditional slotted ALOHA scheme. For <b>non-voice</b> <b>services,</b> {{it is well known}} that retransmissions are necessary to ensure the delivery of a message in its entirety from the source to destination. Retransmission protocols for open-end and closed-end data transfer are investigated. The signal structure for the proposed network is derived from X- 25 standards with appropriate modifications. The packet types and their usages are described in this paper...|$|R

50|$|The {{evolution}} of the mobile phone as the foremost multi-media device has long been predicted, but take-up has mostly been quite disappointing. The mobile phone {{has turned out to}} be a complex distribution platform for <b>non-voice</b> <b>services,</b> both from a technology and a business model point of view, in addition to the physical limitations of its small size. Many attempts have been made to overcome these limitations with limited success. But for various reasons, it has proven difficult to transfer concepts from market to market as well as from one device to the other.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, the number of mobile phone {{subscriptions}} has risen from 12 million to more than six billion. 75 % {{of the world has}} access to a mobile phone and the developing world is now more mobile than the developed world. However, the growth of <b>non-voice</b> <b>services</b> on these mobiles for the Base of the Pyramid users is still at the start of its growth curve. Drawing from a study of 50 case studies in financial services, this paper examines how the innovation for financial services was organized using a framework of six elements. It shows the importance of government support (both as regulator and as (launching) customer), the need for trust delivered by expansion of existing strong brands, embeddedness by using local agents and capacity building of these agents and the customers. © 2013 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|Strategic {{telecommunication}} development {{direction in}} Croatia {{has to be}} expected in three segments. The first relates to {{the achievement of the}} appropriate subscriber density of the basic telecommunication service – telephony (GTP), the second is in the modernization and application of new technologies of the telecommunication network (IDN, ISDN), and the third refers to the introduction of the wide range of new telecommunication services. Review and systematization of the telecommunication services is the main topics of the paper. A group of voice services and possibilities and <b>non-voice</b> <b>services</b> have been analyzed. In the paper there has also been discussed the problem of service integration from the exploitation viewpoint, technical and technological solutions as well as the commercial attractiveness.

40|$|NTT DoCoMo, Japan's premier mobile {{communications}} company, {{continues to}} raise the bar in innovation, setting the pace {{for the development of}} wireless communications in the 21 st century. The company has been heralded as a model for wireless innovation, expanding into <b>non-voice</b> <b>services,</b> wireless internet, and data and video, among others. On November 12, 2002, the Center on Japanese Economy and Business, together with the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information (CITI) and the student-run Japan Business Association (JBA), cosponsored a distinguished lecture featuring Dr. Keiji Tachikawa, President and CEO of NTT DoCoMo. In his presentation, Dr. Tachikawa described a wireless strategy for the new century. He examined the creation of highly efficient corporations and the importance of new business models, looking at the impact of wireless communication on culture and society.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the policies of}} the EC aiming towards a coordinated introduction of an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) in all member countries by 1993. ISDN originally {{was supposed to be a}} new telecommunications network that eventually would replace the old telephone network. ISDN is " [...] . a network, in general evolving from a telephone IDN (Integrated Digital Network), that provides end-to-end digital connectivity to support a wide range of services, including voice and <b>non-voice</b> <b>services,</b> to which users have access by a limited set of standard multipurpose user-network interfaces" (CCITT). In this paper I will argue that the ISDN activities of the EC are somewhat trapped between the attempt to liberalize the so far closed and fragmented European telecommunications markets on the one hand and the aim to build up a strong independent European telecommunications industry and a European wide telecommunications network on the other hand. ISDN therefore cannot fulfil the expectations of the Commission...|$|R
40|$|Mobile Data Services (MDS) {{encompass}} all <b>non-voice</b> value-adding <b>services</b> accessible through mobile networks. The {{adoption and}} mass acceptance of MDS {{has been a}} subject of discourse among academics and practitioners alike, especially when taking into consideration the non-unitary path that MDS adoption patterns have followed {{in different parts of}} the world. In view of this observation, our study draws upon the Triandis theory of explaining human behaviour, which is adjusted to fit the particularities of MDS. We offer preliminary evidence for the legitimacy of introducing the Triandis model by analyzing empirical data collected through a largescale survey (N= 365), which was conducted in Greece as part of the fifth Worldwide Mobile Data Services Survey. Results corroborate the model’s capacity to discriminate MDS users from non-users and open up research opportunities for further applying it in cross-cultural surveys of MDS adoption. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2009. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 43). As a market leader, GrameenPhone Ltd. is continuously coming up with new ideas regarding its products and services. Recently, the company is mainly focusing on the after sales <b>services,</b> <b>non-voice</b> <b>services</b> {{and the quality of}} all the services. Because, the company knows in near future, voice based services will reach to the maturity stage which will make the business growth constant to some extents. Hence, the company is trying to maintain the leading position by providing and maintaining the quality services. These attributes are working as a building block to increase GP’s service value. Hence through this internship report, I have tried to find the relationship between customer satisfaction and the service quality. Comprehensive information was taken from CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index) and SQA (Service Quality Assurance). The results of week- 38 to week- 45 were picked to analyze. MS Excel and various charts were used to analyze data. The analyzed information shows that there is a gap between customer satisfaction and the service quality provided by the customer managers. Though the GP subscribers are aware about GP services, but they are not fully satisfied with those services. Most of them are dissatisfied because of the high call rate. Now making subscribers satisfied will be the great challenge for the company. GP has to build a quality service line through various services like providing information proactively to the customers. Increased customer satisfaction status will raise the service value of GP, increase subscribers usages rate result increase revenue for GP. Now Grameenphone Ltd. has to consider the GAP minimization and maintain alignment with service offering and service quality to maintain the target level of CSI. Otherwise, in the long run new services innovation will not give its ultimate success. Farzana Chowdhury 43 pagesB. Business Administratio...|$|R
40|$|Third {{generation}} mobile {{systems are}} seen as the technology to bring new broadband services to the mobile user. This paper discusses UMTS/GPRS technologies applying to tactical communication networks. A {{detailed description of the}} 3 G technologies is provided, and their application in Military Environments is studied in depth. The paper discusses the introduction of new services into Military- networks, which is improving tactical effectiveness, while also dealing with major improvements in spectrum efficiency, capability and functionality compared with today's <b>non-voice</b> mobile <b>services.</b> The schemes and mechanisms for controlling the traffic in order to achieve the per-hop behavior is still an open problem in the Military wireless environment. GPRS and UMTS can provide military with access to many different demanding tactical services. Nevertheless, in order to preserve the unique characteristics of military systems, a number of vital issues have to be carefully addressed, including security mechanisms and fraud detection. Thus, the UMTS/GPRS tactical network is a challenge for the military telecommunication. It will provide a massive boost to mobile data usage and usefulness. Although, many problems are still not solved, for instance effective radio access schemes and traffic management, the information that can be transfer in this tactical network environment are very useful except for the communications and for the command and control systems. © 2004 IEEE...|$|R
