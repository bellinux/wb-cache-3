40|$|Radioactive {{substances}} {{are often}} {{released to the}} environment {{in the form of}} particles. The determination of their chemical composition is a key factor for overall understanding of their environmental behaviour. The aim of this investigation was to identify the source of one single radioactive “hot” particle found on a sandy beach and to understand its fate in the environment and human body fluids. As the particle was supposed to be analyzed for its dissolution behaviour in the human being after ingestion, it was necessary to gain as much information as possible on the chemical and isotopic composition by means of <b>non</b> – <b>destructive</b> analysis such as SEM, SIMS, µ-XRF and µ-XANES beforehand. In this paper, an overview of the different <b>non</b> – <b>destructive</b> methods applied for analysis of this particle and the results obtained is given.

40|$|Abstract – A {{collection}} of AlSi 7 closed cell foams of densities between 500 kg/m 3 and 1300 kg/m 3 were produced following the powder metallurgical route [1, 2]. On the one hand, thermal conductivity {{of the samples}} has been measured {{by means of the}} transient plane source (TPS) technique [3, 4]. Values obtained showed the increase of thermal conductivity values with density. On the other hand, the TPS technique has been tested as a tool to detect in-homogeneities derived from the manufacturing process. The results obtained have proved the ability of this method to detect these in-homogeneities, and its possible use as a <b>non</b> – <b>destructive</b> quality control method...|$|R

40|$|CMOS image sensors {{are capable}} of very {{high-speed}} <b>non</b> - <b>destructive</b> readout, enabling many novel applications. To explore such applications, we designed and prototyped an experimental high speed imaging system based on a CMOS digital pixel sensor (DPS). The experimental system comprises a PCB that has the DPS chip interfaced to a PC via three I/O cards supported by an easy to use software environment. The system is capable of image acquisition at rates of up to 1, 400 frames/sec. After describing the DPS chip and experimental imaging system,we present two applications: dynamic range extension and optical flow estimation. These applications rely on the DPS's ability to perform nondestructive readout of multiple frames at high-speed...|$|R

The combination of these techniques provides an indication of what is happening within cells, both at the microscopic and macroscopic level.

40|$|The {{constraints}} on mass and size imposed on pico- and nanosatellites drive spacecraft designers to seek fabrication methods allowing {{a large degree}} of integration. From a configuration point of view, as sizes decrease the notion of subsystems vanishes, the structural interfaces become unique {{and need to be}} custom-made. This paper describes the integration concept of the SwissCube pico-satellite with special focus on the state-of-the art structural machining process. It also presents a new soldering technique for solar arrays. Both technologies are well suited for pico- to small- satellite applications and introduce flexibility in the design process. The first part will introduce the configuration of the SwissCube and present the advantages of wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) to manufacture the satellites primary structure. This technique, used for the SwissCube pico-satellite, has allowed the manufacture of a complex lightweight monoblock frame that serves as primary as well as secondary structure. The frame is one of the lightest in the CubeSat community while its rigidity is very high as shown by FEA and vibration tests. The second part will focus on a new bonding technique for solar arrays. So far the common technique for solar array bonding consisted of attaching solar cells with silicon or epoxy adhesives. In the frame of the SwissCube project, an innovative assembly approach of solar cells has been investigated. It consists of soldering solar cell on a printed circuit board panel with a process of brazing. Environmental tests have been successfully performed to evaluate the reliability of this process. <b>Non</b> <b>destructives</b> tests were also done to evaluate the quality of the solder pads...|$|R

The main goal is the assessment of a starting point for a damage tolerant concept during the design and certification phases of the Blackshape BS 115 airplane, with respect to EASA CS VLA & CS 23 Regulations. This approach has been carried out starting from an initial literary review as far as the way of modeling composites fractures is concerned. Further on, three finite element models have been generated and implemented in order to simulate defects occurring during manufacturing and service phases.

40|$|In the 1990 s {{a number}} of {{anthropomorphic}} sculptures (“menhir sta tues”) of ignimbritic rock, were found into {{the walls of the}} Nuragic tower of Arasseda - Allai (Sardinia, Italy). They had probably belonged to a nearby Aeneolithic sanctuary (III millennium BC) and they were reused as a building material by the Nuragics dur ing the II millennium BC. Some of these megaliths have been removed from the proto - historic site and are now exposed at the Archaeological Museum of Laconi. Also an ancient quarry of volcanic blocks, which was probably used in the Prehistoric Age, has been discovered in the same area where the Nuraghe and the sculptures had been found. An autoptic and instrumental multi - technique approach has been carried out on 10 geological samples collected from the local volcanic stone of the Monte Ironi geological unit. On the geological material (two samples from Arasseda quarry and eight from other points of the outcrop) we have used a macroscopic survey and chemical analytical techniques such as ED - XRF by conventional and <b>non</b> - <b>destructive</b> approaches both, ICP - OES, and ICP - MS. This study has allowed us to determine the geochemical intra - source variability of the lithic raw material. Furthermore, the mineralogical investigation by X Ray Diffraction and the ICP data on geological samples have led to a definition of some t echnological properties of local geo - source. After testing the uniformity between the results of all geochemical techniques, on three sculptures from Arasseda, according to conservative requirements we have achieved only <b>non</b> - <b>destructive</b> fluorescence measur ements and autoptic observations.
