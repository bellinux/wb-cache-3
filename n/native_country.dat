30|$|The {{second and}} most studied theme {{relates to the}} driving factors {{explaining}} the dental tourism decision. Several studies have identified that affordable cost and convenient access to dental care are main reasons for a growing popularity of dental tourism [4, 6, 8, 10, 11]. Moreover, the low-cost airline travel models have also facilitated this growth. Other reasons include the combination of dental treatment with some leisure activity [5, 10]. Also, many travellers are motivated by their strong connection with a destination country. This is especially the case of immigrants who travel back to <b>native</b> <b>countries</b> for dental services [44]. Communications with relatives, friends and other connection are the main sources of motivation. Moreover, language and social–cultural connections between tourists and their <b>native</b> <b>countries</b> are important motivation {{to encourage them to}} experience the dental service in their <b>native</b> <b>countries</b> [6 – 8, 45]. In terms of demotivating factors, Barrowman et al. [10] point out that the lack of accountability and regulation of this type of service in the host country are the main concerns, particularly when complications occur.|$|R
