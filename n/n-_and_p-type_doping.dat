Photoemission spectroscopy investigations show that depending on the metal used for the contact formation the chalcogen passivation reduces the interaction between metals and GaAs(1 0 0).

The chalcogenide like layer {{on top of the}} GaAs is disrupted and the metals react with the GaAs bulk, resulting in the formation of Na–As and Mg–As compounds. Concerning the barrier heights a general trend is observed, in that the barrier heights are smaller and larger for chalcogen passivated <b>n-</b> <b>and</b> <b>p-type</b> <b>doped</b> substrates, respectively, compared to the barrier heights on non-passivated surfaces.

The effect of light soaking on the passivation performance of a-Si:H i-layers of varying thicknesses are evaluated.

Surprisingly these properties are not affected as expected by light soaking. The measured injection level dependence of the effective surface recombination velocity is modeled by considering recombination through amphoteric defects, characteristic of a-Si:H. Finally, heterojunction devices incorporating the thinnest passivation layer show maximum open circuit voltage (VOC) as high as 713 mV. A best solar cell conversion efficiency of 17. 6 % with a VOC of 705 mV is achieved on small area cell on flat n-type wafer.

A crucial point concerning {{the application of}} CoSb_ 3 is to understand and control its defect chemistry. To reveal the native conductivity behavior of nonstoichiometric CoSb_ 3, we investigated the intrinsic point defects in CoSb_ 3 using density functional theory. We found CoSb_ 3 is p-type in either Co or Sb rich regions of phase stability. Interstitial Co (Co_i) and interstitial Co-pair (Co_(i-p)) are the dominant point defects in the Co rich region. However, Co_(i-p) {{will be difficult to}} form because the formation temperature of Co_(i-p) is much lower than the synthesis temperature of CoSb_ 3. The unexpected acceptor nature of the Co_i or Co_(i-p) defects is explained by the breakage of multiple Sb_ 4 -rings. Co vacancy (Co_v) is found to be the p-type defect in the Sb rich region.

The band inversion effects are clearly observed on the <b>n-</b> <b>and</b> p-Si samples {{in the presence of a}} dielectric silica overlayer and on the p-GaN sample due to variation of the illuminating laser energies Moreover, the extent of the dopant dependent XPS peak shifts of the <b>n-</b> <b>and</b> p-Si samples are assessed after correction of their surface photovoltage values. A laser patterned silicon wafer with a high-power near infrared fiber laser is also investigated.

Electrical parameters of CdS thin film are extracted by dynamic XPS with and without photoillumination. The photo-dynamic XPS technique has also provided useful information by disentanglement of processes; charging/discharging, photoconductivity, and surface photovoltage.

Furthermore, the variation in $S$ with surface state density and bulk doping level is found {{to be the result of}} Fermi level unpinning rather than a change in the intrinsic surface recombination velocity. It is concluded that $S$ depends on $P$ throughout the experimentally accessible range of excitation powers and therefore that no instrinsic value can be determined.

40|$|With {{the recent}} rapid {{development}} of GaN based optoelectronic devices, a full {{understanding of the}} dynamics of fundamental optical transitions in GaN epilayers and quantum wells becomes increasingly important. In this paper, the dynamics of fundamental optical transitions, probed by picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (PL), in GaN and InGaN epilayers, Jn,Ga 1 N/GaN and GaN/A 1 Ga 1 N multiple quantum wells (MQWs) are reviewed. For GaN epilayers, optical transitions in <b>n-</b> <b>and</b> <b>p-type</b> (Mg <b>doped)</b> <b>and</b> semi-insulating GaN epilayers are discussed. Time-resolved PL results on the fundamental optical transitions in these materials, including the impurity-bound excitons and free excitons transitions, are summarized. For MQWs, recombination dynamics of optical transitions in both In,,Ga 1 N/GaN and GaN/AlGa 1 N MQWs grown by different methods (MOCVD vs. MBE) are compared with each other as well as with GaN and InGaN epilayers to extrapolate the mechanisms and quantum efficiencies of the optical emissions in these structures. The implications of these results on device applications, in particular on the blue LEDs and laser diodes as well on the lasing mechanisms in GaN blue lasers, are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fluorinated {{chemistry}} {{in chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) of silicon carbide (SiC) with SiF 4 as Si precursor {{has been shown to}} fully eliminate the formation of silicon clusters in the gas phase, making SiF 4 an interesting Si precursor. However, before a fluorinated CVD chemistry can be adopted, the effect of fluorine on the dopant incorporation must be understood since dopant incorporation is of paramount importance in semiconductor manufacturing. Here, the authors present dopant incorporation studies for n-type doping with N using <b>N-</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>p-type</b> <b>doping</b> with Al using TMAl in fluorinated CVD of homoepitaxial SiC. The precursors used were SiF 4 as Si precursor and the source of F together with CH 4 as C precursor. The authors find {{that it is possible to}} control the doping in SiC epitaxial layers when using a fluorinated CVD chemistry for both <b>n-</b> <b>and</b> <b>p-type</b> materials using the C/Si ratio as in standard SiC CVD. However, large area doping uniformity seems to be a challenge for a fluorinated CVD chemistry, most likely due to the very strong Si-F and Al-F bonds. (C) 2017 American Vacuum Society.

40|$|N-p-n Si/SiGe/Si heterostructures {{have been}} grown by a disilane (Si 2 H 6) gas and Ge solid sources {{molecular}} beam epitaxy system using phosphine (PH 3) and diborane (B 2 H 6) as <b>n-</b> <b>and</b> <b>p-type</b> in situ <b>doping</b> sources, respectively. Adopting an in situ doping control technology, the influence of background B dopant on the growth of n-Si emitter layer was reduced, and an abrupt B dopant distribution from SiGe base to Si emitter layer was obtained. Besides, higher n-type doping in the surface region of emitter to reduce the emitter resist can be realized, {{and it did not}} result in the drop of growth rate of Si emitter layer in this technology.
