These 'paraphyletic' sequencing strategies certainly result in growing volumes of sequence data, but these in turn are dominated by the <b>n-ary</b> <b>relations</b> between genomes obtained from systematic comparison, classification, and network inference. In the worse case, relations can grow geometrically while the genomes grow arithmetically.
