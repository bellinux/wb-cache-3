50|$|Kasar {{characters}} {{also have}} big eyes, <b>noses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouths.</b> The hand {{positioning of the}} kasar characters is upward. Kasar characters can be monstrous looking, have skin troubles, and look masculine. Halus characters have small eyes, <b>noses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouths</b> with almost no facial hair. The head and face are pointed downward. The lips of a halus character are thin and show white uniformed teeth. In paintings, the right hand is usually active, and the left hand remains motionless. One of Bhima’s most important features assigned to only him is his right thumb, which ends {{in a very long}} curved nail as his weapon, this is a magical implication.|$|R
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a {{medium-sized}} species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown to gray. It is larger and darker than Paratriaenops auritus and P.furculus. Among living Triaenops species, it {{is smaller than}} T.persicus and T.afer, but somewhat larger than T.parvus. The extinct Triaenops goodmani, which is known only from three mandibles (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped noseleaf (a group of fleshy structures around the <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth),</b> T.menamena has the trident structure characteristic of Triaenops and Paratriaenops: three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In T.menamena, the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in Paratriaenops. The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches on the inner side. The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6mm long. The wing membrane is dark and translucent {{and the end of}} the tail usually projects from the uropatagium (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305mm (10.6 to 12.0in).|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{categories}} of diving mask: The half mask covers the eyes and nose, and the full face mask covers eyes, <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth,</b> and therefore includes {{a part of the}} breathing apparatus. The half mask is described here.|$|E
25|$|In analogy, the {{inhalable dust}} {{fraction}} is {{the fraction of}} dust entering <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> which may be deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract. The thoracic fraction is the fraction that enters the thorax and is deposited within the lung's airways. The respirable fraction is what is deposited in the gas exchange regions (alveoli).|$|E
50|$|Of especial note were {{fragments}} of clay ears, <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouths,</b> with holes {{indicating that they}} were connected by strings. These are thought be part of grave masks as they were found in a stone-lined pit tomb on the site. These artifacts were given the status of Important Cultural Properties by the national government in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|Flight Attendants on Air Canada Flight 797 (Sergio Benetti, Judi Davidson, Laura Kayama) used {{procedures}} {{which were}} not specifically taught in training such as moving passengers {{to the front of}} the aircraft to move them away from the fire and smoke, and passing out towels for passengers to cover their <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouths</b> with while the cabin was filling with smoke.|$|R

25|$|The Ghostface costume is {{the outfit}} {{worn by the}} main antagonists of the Scream franchise, {{consisting}} of a rubber white mask with black eyes, <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> and a black, cloth-like material, hooded-robe with faux-tatters draping from the arms and a spiked-trim {{to the base of}} the outfit. In the movie, the costume is considered common and easily purchasable making identifying the buyers difficult and creating the possibility for anyone to be the killer.|$|E
25|$|Most {{recreational}} {{scuba diving}} is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece {{to supply the}} breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth,</b> and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers {{are more likely to}} use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Courtney {{suffered}} a skull fracture on June 12, 1915 while traveling by train {{with his team}} to the 1915 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta. The train lurched and his head struck one of the berths. At first {{he did not think}} anything about the incident, but he started hemorrhage from his <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth.</b> He refused to consult a doctor and continued to get his team ready for the regatta. On race day, he was confined to bed and returned to Ithaca, New York where the skull fracture was diagnosed. Courtney would sue New York Central for $75,000 for his injuries.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{portrait}} {{head had}} its own patina according to Gordine's vision of her sitter. When interviewed by the BBC in 1972 Gordine commented that [...] "when you do portrait busts of somebody you do their <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> - but it is nothing. You have to imagine what they are like inside and bring out their inner feeling {{and then put it}} in a form".|$|R
5000|$|The Moxie dolls are {{reminiscent}} of Bratz, having the distinct pop on/off feet and long hair, but with features consisting of large eyes <b>and</b> proportioned <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouths</b> fitting to their head-size. Moxie Girls were meant to replace Bratz, given that Mattel sued MGA over the original design. However, Bratz returned to the market in August 2010. No new products have been released since 2014.|$|R

25|$|Polysomnography in {{diagnosing}} OSA {{characterizes the}} pauses in breathing. As in central apnea, pauses {{are followed by}} a relative decrease in blood oxygen {{and an increase in}} the blood carbon dioxide. Whereas in central sleep apnea the body's motions of breathing stop, in OSA the chest not only continues to make the movements of inhalation, but the movements typically become even more pronounced. Monitors for airflow at the <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> demonstrate that efforts to breathe are not only present but that they are often exaggerated. The chest muscles and diaphragm contract and the entire body may thrash and struggle.|$|E
25|$|In a 2014 study Hartley {{and colleagues}} at the University of York {{reported}} that impressions of the traits of approachability, youthfulness/attractiveness and dominance can be formed {{in as little as}} 100 milliseconds, from measurable characteristics such as the shape of and the spacing around the eyes, <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth.</b> it was found that first impressions of social traits, such as trustworthiness or dominance, are reliably perceived in faces. Physical facial features were objectively measured from feature positions and colours. A neural network was the used to model factor the dimensions of approachability, youthful-attractiveness and dominance. 58% of the variance in raters’ impressions was accounted for by a linear model.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} size and extreme {{immobilization}} some casts, particularly {{those used in}} or before the 1970s, the popular term full body cast {{is something of a}} misnomer. The popular and media-driven conception of a massive cast encasing all four limbs, the trunk, and the head – sometimes leaving only small slits for the eyes, <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> – is a true rarity in recorded medical history, and this type of large scale cast appears more commonly in various Hollywood movies and on television shows. The term body cast (or full body cast) is sometimes casually used by laymen to describe any of a number of body and/or spica casts, from a simple body jacket to a more extensive hip spica.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, the Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, {{using the}} pen name Gabriel Linde, {{published}} a science-fiction novel called Den okända faran (The Unknown Danger), {{in which he}} describes a race of extraterrestrials: [...] "...the creatures did not resemble any race of humans. They were short, shorter than the average Japanese, and their heads were big and bald, with strong, square foreheads, <b>and</b> very small <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouths,</b> <b>and</b> weak chins. What was most extraordinary about them were the eyes—large, dark, gleaming, with a sharp gaze. They wore clothes made of soft grey fabric, and their limbs seemed {{to be similar to}} those of humans." [...] The novel, aimed at young readers, included illustrations of the imagined aliens.|$|R

25|$|Zygomycosis is the {{broadest}} term {{to refer to}} infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota {{has been identified as}} polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (<b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth)</b> cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection. These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where people have open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter.|$|E
25|$|The next match saw Edge {{defending}} the World Heavyweight Championship against Rey Mysterio. Throughout the match, Edge worked on Mysterio's injured biceps, affecting Mysterio's offense. However, Mysterio retaliated, delivering a Tornado DDT on Edge for an unsuccessful pin attempt. Later in the match, Mysterio executed a 619 on Edge, but couldn't capitalize {{due to his}} biceps. He then attempted a Springboard Splash, but Edge speared Mysterio in mid-air, and pinned him, retaining the title. After the match, The Big Show made a surprise return to WWE, where he cut a promo on his recent weight loss (over 108 pounds) and future plans of becoming a champion again. After doing so, The Big Show began taunting professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who was in attendance and Mysterio's close friend. As Big Show threatened to chokeslam Mysterio, Mayweather jumped over the security wall and entered the ring to confront Big Show. Show then got on his knees to allow Mayweather to punch him, which Mayweather did {{with a combination of}} punches, bloodying The Big Show from the <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth.</b> Mayweather and his crew fled the ring, and then through the crowd, where Shane McMahon stopped The Big Show from chasing them.|$|E
500|$|Tartakovsky {{has said}} the {{character}} Dexter was designed [...] "as an icon"—his body is short and squat and his design is simple, with a black outline and relatively little detail. Since {{he knew that he}} was designing the show for television, he purposely limited the design to a certain degree, designing the <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth,</b> for instance, in a Hanna-Barbera style to animate easily.|$|E

Andy - whose voice has changed and finger and toenails have become claws - confirms her suspicions: he is the spawn of Satan. Andy forces Cora to bow down to him, but she then embraces and quickly tells her son the reason she went into hiding. The two hold each other as their bones crack and blood seeps from their <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouths</b> until they die.|$|R
