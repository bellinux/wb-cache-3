5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is listed}} as being a species of least concern by the IUCN, on account of its large range and stable population, with <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{significant}} decline.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they were similar to turtles. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> shelled Dicynodon, and recent more complete fossils show that they looked more like Hippopotamus.|$|E
60|$|There were <b>no</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> struggle, <b>no</b> {{overturned}} chairs or disarranged furniture. The grate {{was full}} of fluttering ashes of burnt paper, and the easy chair near the fire had evidently been used. On the floor was a handkerchief, a little morsel of lace. Anna saw it, {{and for the first}} time found herself trembling.|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} kinematic linkage of {{the landing}} gear assembly of an aircraft was analyzed. Fractographic features suggest that the linkage has failed by tensile overload. The material of the linkage {{was found to be}} Cr-Mn steel. There were <b>no</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> delayed failure such as fatigue. The reason for excessive load on the linkage in question has to be established and corrective measures incorporated to prevent the recurrence of similar failure...|$|R
40|$|Examination {{revealed}} {{that both the}} cone bearings sent for investigation had mechanical damages at localized regions on the cage. The damages were caused by impact with a solid object. With the information provided, {{it was not possible}} to establish what exactly had caused the damage. The hardness and the microstructure of the bearing elements were found satisfactory and there were no abnormalities in the bearings. Also, there were <b>no</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> heat effects...|$|R
5|$|Mitcham Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. Mitcham is {{believed}} to be the world's oldest cricket club as there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> club being founded before 1685. Croydon, Dartford and London had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{has a very}} large range of 9,650,000km2 (3,700,000mi2), and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 17–31million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54–124million individuals. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> serious decline in numbers, so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> direct Norwegian rule in {{the area}} other than a few brief occupations {{although}} the written record is weak and no contemporary records of the Norse period from the Outer Hebrides exist. It is however known that Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers {{there may have been}} more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly due to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis and Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
50|$|After exercise, {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that taking an ice bath may reduce delayed onset muscle soreness, but <b>no</b> good <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other benefit.|$|R
25|$|Some popular myths {{have argued}} that the {{original}} forms of these symbols indicated their numeric value through the number of angles they contained, but <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> exists <b>of</b> <b>any</b> such origin.|$|R
5000|$|Archaeological {{evaluation}} trenching in 1989 found <b>no</b> clear <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> surrounding quarry ditch {{which would}} normally have been excavated to provide {{material for a}} covering barrow. Iron Age activity was found close by.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E
5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> kind of property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of Sulla, but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E

50|$|According to Godwin, James or John Cary, {{bishop of}} Lichfield and Goventry, succeeded bishop Gatrik in Exeter; {{but there is}} <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>any</b> more than <b>of</b> his having been bishop of Lichfield and Coventry.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that crop circles {{may be the result of}} extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> crop circle being created by any of these causes.|$|E
25|$|Claims of {{the healing}} and supernatural powers of crystal skulls have no support in the {{scientific}} community, which has found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> unusual phenomena associated with the skulls nor any reason for further investigation, other than the confirmation of their provenance and method of manufacture.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Jevons has justly and acutely {{remarked that}} [...] "we do not know, {{and there is}} <b>no</b> {{external}} <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> description which leads us to suppose, that the Iliad was ever expanded" [...] (J. H. S, vii. 291-308).|$|R
25|$|Some {{note the}} object in the drawing bears an uncanny {{similarity}} to the WW2 German design, the Horten Ho 229, sometimes further claiming it was captured German technology being tested. But there is <b>no</b> historical <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> kind supporting this.|$|R
25|$|Most of what {{is known}} about Sentinelese {{material}} culture is based on observations during contact attempts in the late 20th century. The Sentinelese maintain an essentially hunter-gatherer society, obtaining their subsistence through hunting, fishing, and collecting wild plants; there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> agricultural practices.|$|E
25|$|The RSS {{has been}} banned again, after the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, when the {{government}} of the time considered it a threat to the state. The ban was subsequently lifted in 1993 when <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> unlawful activity was found by the tribunal constituted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.|$|E
25|$|In November 1957 Plummer caused uproar on the Conservative benches of the House of Commons by {{accusing the}} {{government}} of leaking changes to the Bank of England interest rate to the Daily Telegraph and Financial Times.

25|$|Many {{instances}} of plain velars occur in roots that have <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> of the putative environments that trigger plain velars and no obvious {{mechanism for the}} plain velar to have {{come in contact with}} any such environment; as a result, the comparative method requires three series to be reconstructed.|$|E
25|$|While the Dacians worshiped local divinities, {{there is}} <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> Dacian deity {{entering}} the Roman pantheon of gods, {{and there is}} <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> Dacian deity worshiped under a Roman name. It is conjectured that the Dacians lacked an anthropomorphic conception of deity, and that the Thraco-Dacian religion and their art was characterized by aniconism. Dacian citadels dated to the reigns of Burebista and Decebalus have yielded no statues in their sanctuaries. With {{the destruction of the}} main Dacian sacred site during Trajan's wars of conquest, no other site took its place. However, there were other cult sites of local spiritual significance, such as Germisara, which continued to be used during the Roman period, although religious practices at these sites were somewhat altered by Romanization, including the application of Roman names to the local spirits.|$|E
25|$|In 7th century England, it is said, Catholic {{churches were}} built so {{that on the}} very feast day of the saint in whose honor they were named, Mass could be offered on an altar while {{directly}} facing the rising sun. However, various surveys of old English churches found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> such general practice.|$|E
50|$|Cupping {{is poorly}} {{supported}} by scientific evidence. In their 2008 book Trick or Treatment, Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst write that <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> exists <b>of</b> <b>any</b> beneficial effects <b>of</b> cupping for <b>any</b> medical condition. A 2011 review found tentative evidence for pain but nothing else.|$|R
