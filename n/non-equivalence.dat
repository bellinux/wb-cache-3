30|$|The {{comparative}} {{safety assessment}} {{plays a major}} role in the whole risk assessment approach as it aims to identify differences between the GMO and its non-GM comparator due to either intended or unintended effects of the genetic modification [1, 3, 34]. Not only the differences between the GMO and the non-GM comparator need to be assessed, but also the so-called ‘equivalence limits’ need to be defined [5]. In general, when setting equivalence limits, the variability between commercial crop varieties is used [5]. In this context, reference to the LoC concept is implicitly made by stating that ‘any significant differences or <b>non-equivalences</b> need to be followed up by an assessment of their biological or toxicological relevance, taking safety limits into account’ [5]. EFSA thereby clearly recognises that the results of the comparative safety assessment are also relevant for the LoC concept, because statistically significant differences and <b>non-equivalences</b> may indicate unintended effects due to the genetic modification [3].|$|R

40|$|A Study of English Translations of Greek Cypriot Poetry is {{the first}} paper to venture an {{in-depth}} analysis of English translations of Greek Cypriot Poetry. The study {{is divided into three}} main sections. The first section (Chapter 2 and part of Chapter 3) is the summary of the major translation issues, presented here in binary form, such as translatability versus untranslatability, faithful versus unfaithful, and so on, and which establishes the groundwork for the analysis of the second section. The second section (Chapter 4) consists mainly of an in-depth analysis {{in the form of a}} comparative critique, carried out only on those translations which have parallel versions. These are studied from the point of view of equivalence. The analysis is based on the premise that wrong rendering even of a single word can sometimes hinder “dynamic equivalence,” that is, equivalence of similar effect on the TL reader and that at times it can even produce a discordant or out of context interpretation because of the resultant <b>non-equivalence.</b> For the purposes of the analysis, this part is divided into five subsections, loosely following Baker’s (1992) divisions. These are: <b>non-equivalence</b> at word level - where the focus is on single words; <b>non-equivalence</b> above word level - where the focus is widened to cover collocations, fixed expressions and idioms; grammatical <b>non-equivalence</b> - where the scope of reference covers areas, such as pronouns, tenses, and so on, as well as word order; pragmatic <b>non-equivalence</b> - which examines cases of disrupted coherence; formal <b>non-equivalence</b> - which deals with rhymed poetry only and approaches it from the aesthetic point of view. In each of these subsections, the cases of <b>non-equivalence</b> are placed into categories and each particular case of <b>non-equivalence</b> is compared with the other parallel version(s), discussed, defended or rejected, indicating the more successful rendition. The third section (Appendices 2, 3 and 4) comprises the first complete record of translated Greek Cypriot poetry into English, namely, a catalogue of all the Cypriot poets; the titles of their poems in translation; reference to all the translators of their poems; reference to the publications where these translations have been found; a list of poems that have more than one translation version.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{equivalence}} {{is believed to}} be a central issue in translation although its definition, relevance, and applicability within the field of translation theory have caused heated controversies. Several theories on the concept of equivalence have been elaborated within this field in the past fifty years. For example, Vinay and Darbelnet (1995), Jakobson (1959), Nida and Taber (1982), Catford (1965), House (1977), and Baker (1992). Indeed, “Equivalence” has provided a useful theoretical and pragmatic foundation for translation processes. However, the notion of equivalence has also been criticized as “asymmetric, directional, subject-less, unfashionable imprecise and ill-defined” (Bolaños, 2005; Snell-Hornby, 1988; Nord, 1997). This paper argues that if equivalence is the essence of translation, <b>non-equivalence</b> constitutes an equally legitimate concept in the translation process. The rationale for this position is that languages articulate or organize the world differently because “languages do not simply name existing categories, they articulate their own” (Culler, 1976, p. 21). Further, <b>non-equivalence</b> in translation is discussed and substantiated by evidence and examples in the process of translating from Arabic into English, a point that has not been adequately discussed in researches dealing with equivalence. Many researchers have discussed equivalence in translating mainly from English into Arabic (Ghazala, 2004). These two languages belong to two different cultures and hence, provide good evidence for the possibility of translating what is sometimes referred to as “untranslatable” due to <b>non-equivalence</b> or lack of equivalence. For example, Arabic is rich in culture-specific terms and concepts that have no equivalents in English. Yet, these terms can be translated into English using one of the strategies suggested for translating <b>non-equivalence</b> to convey their conceptual and cultural meanings to the English speaking readers (Baker, 1992). In such cases, I argue that equivalence or translating using equivalence is not necessarily the best strategy, i. e., it does not produce a meaningful rendering of the source term [ST] into the target term [TT]. Rather, purposefully using <b>non-equivalence</b> results in a “better” translation. <b>Non-equivalence</b> becomes more relevant than equivalence. In other words, “non-equivalence” becomes more equivalent than “equivalence. ” It is a better strategy in these cases. Hence, it is quite legitimate to discuss <b>non-equivalence</b> and its applicability in translating culture-specific terms and concepts including idioms, metaphors and proverbs...|$|E

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to test for equivalence of measurements across groups to guarantee that comparisons of regression coefficients or mean scores of a latent factor are meaningful. Unfortunately, when tested, many scales display <b>non-equivalence.</b> Several researchers have suggested that <b>non-equivalence</b> {{may be used as}} a useful source of information as to why equivalence is biased and proposed employing a multilevel structural equation modeling (MLSEM) approach to explain why equivalence is not given. This method can consider a latent between-level factor and/or single contextual variables and use them to explain items’ <b>non-equivalence.</b> In the current study we show that this method may also be useful for social science studies in general and for survey research and sociological comparative studies in particular when one fails to establish cross-group equivalence.

Scholars of comparative politics continue to venture into more and more jurisdictions across longer stretches of time. Some cross-national datasets contain the universe of independent states since 1800, and cross-national survey projects now include much of the developed and developing worlds. The benefits of this expansion are clear: added cases can produce more variation in variables of interest, provide more powerful tests of extant theory, and illuminate empirical puzzles that lead to new theories. However, comparative inquiry grinds to halt if scholars cannot develop comparable concepts and measures across diverse national and historical contexts. This is true whether the purpose of comparative inquiry is descriptive or inferential. If an observed attribute is a product of not only the underlying construct but also a measurement irregularity particular to time or place, then inferences are compromised. Thus the importance of equivalent measurement, the challenge we address in this paper. 2 Concern about measurement <b>non-equivalence</b> is not new.

40|$|During {{the last}} thirty years, {{one of the most}} popular {{research}} topics in international trade has been the <b>non-equivalence</b> among policy instruments such as specific and ad valorem import tariffs, voluntary export restraints and import quotas. The <b>non-equivalence</b> principle was shown to hold under revenue/rent seeking behavior (Vousden, 1990), under uncertainty (Young and Anderson, 1982), and in the presence of retaliation (Melvin, 1986; Syropoulos, 1994). Furthermore, it has been shown that different policy instruments have different effects on the stability of world prices (Zwart and Blandford, 1989) in addition to having different effects on the quality/composition of imports (Falvey, 1979; Das and Donnefeld, 1987). Perhaps the best known case of <b>non-equivalence</b> is the one described by Bhagwati (1965, 1969) where domestic production is controlled by a monopolist. For a given volume of imports, an import tariff generates a lower domestic price and less deadweight loss than an import quota. Casual empirical evidence from developing and developed countries alike indicates that highly distorted prices, resulting from trade and domestic taxes, provide consumers and firms the necessary incentives to engage in various types of illegal activities usually referred to as smuggling. In spite of the prevalence oft his by-product of government intervention, it is often ignored for policy analysis purposes.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the enantiomeric purity of chiral carboxylic acids requires a reagent to give acceptable NMR chemical shift <b>non-equivalence</b> {{with a wide range}} of substrate acids. Extensive studies of the behaviour of N-mono- methyl, N,N-dimethyl and cyclic amines as chiral solvating agents led to the finding that 1, 2 diphenyl- 1, 2 -diaminoethane can induce substantial non- equivalence in the diastereomeric salts of chiral a-phenyl and a-halo carboxylic acids. The diastereoisomeric complexes of the diamine with primary carboxylic acids (RCH(_ 2) CO(_ 2) H) presents an unusual case in which the internally enantiotopic methylene protons are rendered internally diasteretopic by an external non-covalently bonded reagent. Investigations of the physical parameters determining <b>non-equivalence</b> (stoichiometry, concentration, temperature and substrate enantiomeric purity), combined with NOE observations of the diastereomeric pairs and the crystal structure of the mono- hydrobromide salt were used to suggest the structure for the conformation responsible for shift <b>non-equivalence.</b> The zero valent platinum complex, 3 - 0 -isopropylidene- 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 1, 4 - bis(diphenyl-phosphino) butane-platinum(0) -ethene (DlOP-Pt-ethene) was shown to be a versatile chiral derivatising agent for electron poor and strained η(^ 2) -donors. This was demonstrated by the enantiomeric purity determinations for alkynes, enones and norbornene derivatives. The crystal structure of DIOP-Pt-ethene was determined and found to be similar to the palladium analogue. If the achiral rhodium complex rhodium(I) -acetylacetone-diethene undergoes a reaction with 2 equivalents of a suitable chiral η(^ 2) -donor, it will result in the formation of 4 stereoisomers, two meso forms and a pair of enantiomers. The diasteroisomers should display chemical shift <b>non-equivalence</b> in the NMR spectrum of the product, reflecting the enantiomeric purity of the η(^ 2) -donor (self recognition).
