5|$|President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{established}} NASA in 1958 with {{a distinctly}} civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.|$|E

5|$|The {{center was}} a part of the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA), a United States federal agency founded to promote {{aeronautical}} research. Cooperative students at NACA took part in a program that combined work and study, providing a way for them to fund their college degrees while gaining experience in aeronautics. Lunney graduated from college in June 1958, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace engineering.|$|E
5|$|Despite being heavily {{involved}} {{with both the}} Relief Society and the National Council of Women, Spafford remained focused on special education and social work. Spafford served {{as a member of}} the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> to the White House Conference on Aging. She was the vice president of the American Mothers Committee and Advisory Board. Spafford was the first female member of the Board of Governors of the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City. She also served as a member and an officer of the board of directors of National Association for Practical Nurses.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Purdue, Armstrong {{decided to become}} an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base, which was later redesignated as the ‘‘NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center’’ in 2014. Although the committee had no open positions, it forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong began working in March 1955. Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted a couple of months, and by July 1955 he had returned to Edwards AFB for a new job.|$|E

5|$|McCormack {{retired from}} the Air Force in 1955, {{and became the first}} head of the Institute for Defense Analysis, a {{non-profit}} research organization to provide advice and support to the Department of Defense's scientific and technological research efforts formed by ten universities. In 1958 he became vice president for industrial and governmental relations at MIT. He originated the proposal that the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics be used as the basis for a new space agency, which eventually became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.|$|E
5|$|Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and {{the first}} person to walk on the Moon. He was also an {{aerospace}} engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|On graduation, Kraft {{accepted}} {{a job with}} the Chance Vought aircraft company in Connecticut. He had also sent an application to the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA), a government agency whose Langley Research Center was located in Hampton, Virginia; Kraft considered it to be too close to home, but applied as insurance. On arrival at Chance Vought he was told that he could not be inducted without his birth certificate, which he had not brought with him. Annoyed by the bureaucratic mindset of the company, he decided to accept the offer from NACA instead.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{disappointed}} when President Truman backed New York Governor W. Averell Harriman—a close associate of DeSapio—for the 1952 Democratic presidential nomination. She supported Adlai Stevenson {{for president in}} 1952 and 1956, and urged his renomination in 1960. She resigned from her UN post in 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became President. She addressed the Democratic National Convention in 1952 and 1956. Although she had reservations about John F. Kennedy for his failure to condemn McCarthyism, she supported him for president against Richard Nixon. Kennedy later reappointed her to the United Nations, where she served again from 1961 to 1962, and to the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Peace Corps.|$|E
5|$|With the {{competition}} lost, {{the development of}} the XSBF-1 came to an end; the sole prototype was assigned to Naval Air Station Anacostia, where it had been tested, for use as a liaison aircraft and hack. In addition, the XSBF was used by the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics' Langley Research Laboratory as part of the facility's work on aeronautical research. During its time at Anacostia, the aircraft was involved in three accidents, one each in 1937, 1938 and 1939; after the first two accidents, it was repaired. The third accident—on May 25, 1939—resulted in the death of the pilot; the XSBF-1 was no longer considered worth returning to flight status, and the aircraft was officially stricken from the Navy inventory in July 1939.|$|E

5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 1938, Bush was {{appointed}} to the <b>National</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of NASA. Its chairman Joseph Sweetman Ames became ill, and Bush, as vice chairman, soon had to act in his place. In December 1938, NACA asked for $11 million to establish a new aeronautical research laboratory in Sunnyvale, California, to supplement the existing Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. The California location was chosen for its proximity to some of the largest aviation corporations. This decision was supported by the chief of the United States Army Air Corps, Major General Henry H. Arnold, and by the head of the navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, who between them were planning to spend $225 million on new aircraft in the year ahead. However, Congress was not convinced of its value, and Bush had to appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 5, 1939. It was a frustrating experience for Bush, since he had never appeared before Congress before, and the senators were not swayed by his arguments. Further lobbying was required before funding for the new center, now known as the Ames Research Center, was finally approved. By this time, war had broken out in Europe, and the inferiority of American aircraft engines was apparent, in particular the Allison V-1710 which performed poorly at high altitudes and had to be removed from the P-51 Mustang in favor of the British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The NACA asked for funding to build a third center in Ohio, which became the Glenn Research Center. Following Ames's retirement in October 1939, Bush became chairman of the NACA, with George J. Mead as his deputy. Bush remained a member of the NACA until November 1948.|$|E
