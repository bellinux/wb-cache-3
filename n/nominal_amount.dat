5|$|Members of {{the current}} and {{previous}} Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the five most-nominated writers, with additional nominees possible {{in the case of}} ties. Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Writers become eligible once they have a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a <b>nominal</b> <b>amount.</b> While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined as someone who has had a written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.|$|E

25|$|The {{monetary}} reform {{had a positive}} impact on the money circulation: it reduced the <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> of money catering to payment transactions, it simplified the calculation of the population for goods and services, and accounting operations could performed with and without cash. There was a return to the familiar monetary system.|$|E
40|$|In intertemporal choice {{experiments}} {{people usually}} choose between smaller-sooner and larger-later amounts of money. That is, they make tradeoffs {{in terms of}} <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts.</b> Yet the factor governing intertemporal tradeoffs in the marketplace is usually the interest rate. In this study, we tested whether two major phenomena that occur when trading off <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts,</b> excessive discounting and the hyperbolic-interval effect, would also occur when trade-offs are made in terms of interest rates. They don’t. In a large-scale (N= 1, 960) internet study of Spanish consumers who made intertemporal tradeoffs for money, tradeoffs {{described in terms of}} <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> induced high discount rates and a considerable hyperbolic-interval effect (replicating earlier studies). However, when they were described as both amounts and interest rates, discount rates were much lower, and there was no effect for how finely the interval was partitioned. When the tradeoffs were described as interest rates only, discount rates were even lower, and the hyperbolic-interval effect was reversed. Thus, some of the most-cited results in intertemporal choice research are unique to a specific way of eliciting discount rates...|$|R

When an independent review denied tariff increases to compensate for the flood damages, SAUR withdrew from the contract in October 2001. In December it sold its shares for a <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> to Águas de Portugal. Subsequently FIPAG and AdeM renegotiated the contracts, obtaining higher fees and improvements in the specification of service obligations and procedures.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue price}} at which investors buy the bonds {{when they are}} first issued will {{typically}} be approximately equal to the <b>nominal</b> <b>amount.</b> The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or {{there is a high}} probability of default on the bond).|$|E
500|$|Legally, women's {{rights were}} limited. [...] They {{were barred from}} {{political}} participation, and Athenian women were not permitted to represent themselves in law, though it seems that metic women (a metic was a resident alien; free, but without the rights and privileges of an Athenian citizen) could. [...] They were also forbidden from conducting any economic transactions worth more than a <b>nominal</b> <b>amount.</b> [...] However, it seems that this restriction was not always obeyed. [...] Especially in poorer families, women would have worked to earn money, and would also {{have been responsible for}} household tasks such as cooking and washing clothes.

500|$|In the 1960s, {{the tallest}} mast {{in the region}} at [...] above ground level, the Mendip UHF {{television}} transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill near Wells, {{one of the highest}} points of the Mendips. The transmitter's antenna rises to almost [...] above sea level. Since 2003, arguments have raged over plans to erect a wind turbine near Chewton Mendip. The proposal was initially rejected by Mendip District Council, which enjoyed the support of a range of local groups and organisations, {{on the grounds that the}} environmental impact on the edge of the AONB outweighed the <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> of electricity which would be generated. In April 2006, however, a planning enquiry gave Ecotricity permission to build a 102m (335ft) turbine during the following year.|$|E
500|$|Dodd {{insisted the}} only reason he left the SEC was due to the [...] "140 Rule", which allowed colleges to over-recruit. The 140 Rule stated a college program could only have 140 {{football}} and basketball players on scholarship at any one time, but the teams were still allowed to sign up to 45 players a year. Therefore, if a school recruited its full allotment of players each year it would exceed the 140 maximum even with normal attrition. Dodd would sign about 30-32 football players a year to meet the guidelines, but the other schools in the SEC were offering 45 scholarships a year, and most were allotting all but a <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> to football. Players not good enough to fall under the 140 Rule had their scholarships withdrawn before the end of each year by the other schools. Dodd insisted the recruiting of athletes by this method amounted to nothing more than a tryout for a scholarship. Dodd would not allow any of the football players choosing Tech to be dismissed from Tech, because they were not the best players. Dodd said, [...] "it is not the recruit's fault for not making the squad, it was the coaches' fault for misjudging their talents." [...] If a recruit came to Tech, he would stay on a football scholarship until he graduated.|$|E

Different <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts,</b> 12 and 80 nm, of Ge 0. 96 Mn 0. 04 were grown on Si (0 0 1) substrates at 250 degrees C using solid source molecular beam epitaxy. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) indicates that Mn diffuses toward the surface during the growth. The room-temperature ferromagnetism is observed for the as-grown and annealed films. Magnetic moment versus temperature curves are correlated with the structural properties. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The {{trend towards}} larger pessimism is {{considerably}} stronger {{here than in}} the expectations concerning AOW benefits. Tax reforms such as abolishing the preferential tax treatment of many early retirement arrangements (announced in 2005 and implemented in 2006) may justify increasing pessimism in 2006 - 2007. Since the financial and economic crisis, many pension funds {{have decided not to}} compensate their clients for inflation and recently some of them have even announced that they have to lower <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts,</b> which may well explain the increasing pessimism {{in the second half of}} the period. As before, there are no systematic differences between the 10 and 20 years groups.|$|R

2500|$|One of his responsa {{concerns}} {{the use of}} wine in the Jewish community during the Prohibition era. The Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on January 16, 1920, declared that [...] "the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within... the United States... for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited." [...] The subsequent Volstead Act defined [...] "intoxicating liquors" [...] and provided for several exceptions, one of which as for sacramental use. The Christian Church was able to successfully regulate the use of ceremonial wine. The clergy could easily monitor the <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> of sacramental wine that each worshipper drank, especially because it was usually drunk only in Church and only on Sundays (for the communion or Eucharist ceremony).|$|E
5000|$|Proponents of {{nationalization}} {{asserted that}} the original contracts held between an oil-producing country and an oil company were unfair to the producing country. Yet without the knowledge and skill brought into the country by the international oil companies, the countries {{would not have been}} able to even get the oil. Contracts, which could not be altered or ended in advance of the true end date, covered huge expanses of land and lasted for long durations. Nationalist ideas began once producing countries realized that the oil companies were exploiting them.

5000|$|These regime {{types are}} {{particularly}} susceptible to outbreaks {{of armed conflict}} and unexpected or adverse changes in leadership. Despite its popular usage, anocracy lacks a precise definition. Anocratic regimes are also loosely defined as part democracy and part dictatorship, or as a [...] "regime that mixes democratic with autocratic features". Another definition classifies anocracy as [...] "a regime that permits some means of participation through opposition group behavior but that has incomplete development of mechanisms to redress grievances". Scholars have also distinguished anocracies from autocracies and democracies in their capability to maintain authority, political dynamics, and policy agendas. Similarly, these regime types have democratic institutions that allow for <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> of competition.|$|R
25|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1654, Spinoza {{and his younger}} brother Gabriel (Abraham) ran the family {{importing}} business. The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps {{as a result of the}} First Anglo-Dutch War. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors. In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).|$|R
2500|$|The issuer has {{to repay}} the <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> on the {{maturity}} date.

The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term of up to 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable).

The rent goes to the Grant-in-aid, provided by the Government for the maintenance of the Occupied Royal Palaces. The rent is based on the current rate for commercially rented properties at Kensington Palace, and is recorded in the overall figures for commercial rents in the Grant-in-aid annual report.

50|$|In India, public {{hospitals}} (called Government Hospitals) {{provide health care}} free {{at the point of}} use for any Indian citizen. These are usually individual state funded. However, hospitals funded by the central (federal) government also exist. State hospitals are run by the state (local) government and may be dispensaries, peripheral health centers, rural hospital, district hospitals or medical college hospitals (hospitals with affiliated medical college). In many states (like Tamil Nadu) the hospital bill is entirely funded by the state government with patient not having to pay anything for treatment. However, other hospitals will charge <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> for admission to special rooms and for medical and surgical consumables. The fees in {{public hospitals}} for these rooms is up to 900 rupees.|$|R
5000|$|For instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, {{and private}} jet, {{there is still}} {{consideration}} on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave {{the value of a}} peppercorn to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, [...] "for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration." ...|$|R

60|$|One anecdote of {{the former}} Duke of Sutherland will show the spirit which has {{influenced}} the family in their management of the estate. In 1817, when there was much suffering on account of bad seasons, the Duke of Sutherland sent down his chief agent {{to look into the}} condition of the people, who desired the ministers of the parishes to send in their lists of the poor. To his surprise it was found that there were located on the estate {{a number of people who}} had settled there without leave. They amounted to four hundred and eight families, or two thousand persons; and though they had no legal title to remain where they were, no hesitation was shown in supplying them with food in the same manner with those who were tenants, on the sole condition that on the first opportunity they should take cottages on the sea shore, and become industrious people. It was the constant object of the duke to keep the rents of his poorer tenants at a <b>nominal</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for setting the {{currencies}} at parity with the pre-war price was the prevailing opinion at that time that deflation was not a danger, while inflation, particularly the inflation in the Weimar Republic, was an unbearable danger. Another reason was that those who had loaned in <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> hoped to recover the same value in gold that they had lent. Because of the reparations that Germany had to pay France, Germany began a credit-fueled period of growth in order to export and sell enough goods abroad to gain gold to pay the reparations. The U.S., as the world's gold sink, loaned money to Germany to industrialize, which was then the basis for Germany paying back France, and France paying back loans to the U.K. and the U.S. This arrangement was codified in the Dawes Plan.|$|R

In 1965, it {{was reported in the}} Opelousas Daily World that the sanitary cotton industry in the United States was worth US$60 million (US$460.4 million in 2016 CPI-adjusted dollars). Around this time, there was industry concern that sanitary products using nylon, labeled as cotton balls, were going to crowd out cotton balls actually containing cotton, harming cotton-exporting regions.
