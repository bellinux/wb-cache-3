5|$|The {{region was}} governed under {{a number of}} {{different}} names between 1880 and 1960. The area was Upper River from 1880 until 18 August 1890, when it was renamed French Sudan, with its capital at Kayes. On 10 October 1899, French Sudan was divided, with the southern cercles joining coastal colonies, and the rest split into two administrative areas called Middle <b>Niger</b> and Upper Senegal. In 1902, the region again was organized as a unified colony under the name Senegambia and <b>Niger</b> (Sénégambie et <b>Niger).</b> The name changed again in 1904 to Upper Senegal and <b>Niger</b> (Haut Sénégal et <b>Niger).</b> Finally, in 1921, the name changed back to French Sudan (Soudan Français).|$|E

50|$|<b>Niger's</b> {{agricultural}} and livestock sectors are {{the mainstay of}} all but 18% of the population. 14% of <b>Niger's</b> GDP is generated by livestock production (camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population.

5|$|Nigersaurus {{was named}} and {{described}} {{in more detail}} by Sereno and colleagues only in 1999, based on remains of newly found individuals. The same article also named Jobaria, another sauropod from <b>Niger.</b> The genus name Nigersaurus ("Niger reptile") is a reference to the country where it was discovered, and the specific name taqueti honours Taquet, who was the first to organise large-scale palaeontological expeditions to <b>Niger.</b> The holotype specimen (MNN GAD512) consists of a partial skull and neck. Limb material and a scapula found nearby were also referred to the same specimen. These fossils are housed at the National Museum of <b>Niger.</b>|$|E
5|$|The addax inhabits arid regions, semideserts {{and sandy}} and stony deserts. They even occur in {{extremely}} arid areas, {{with less than}} 100mm annual rainfall. They also inhabit deserts with tussock grasses (Stipagrostis species) and succulent thorn scrub Cornulaca. Formerly, the addax was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; but today the only known self-sustaining population {{is present in the}} Termit Massif Reserve (<b>Niger).</b> However, there are reports of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (<b>Niger)</b> and Bodélé (Chad). Rare nomads may be seen in north <b>Niger,</b> southern Algeria and Libya; and the antelope is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there are no confirmed sightings. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and <b>Niger.</b> It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, 3,434 tonnes {{of uranium}} were {{extracted}} from the Arlit mines and exported to France via truck to the seaport at Cotonou, Bénin. At its peak in the 1980s, 40% of <b>Niger's</b> uranium production came from Arlit, and uranium represented 90% of <b>Niger's</b> exports (by value). A major modern road, known as the Uranium Highway, has been built to transport uranium south, but it has bypassed many towns along the way (In-Gall for example) and has radically changed <b>Niger's</b> transportation system.|$|R

5|$|Endemic to Africa, the bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, <b>Niger,</b> Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Formerly widespread in western, central and eastern Africa, its present range extends from Senegal {{in the west to}} Ethiopia in the east. Among the three reedbuck species, bohor reedbuck is the most widespread in Tanzania. Its status in Burundi, Eritrea, Ghana and Togo is uncertain, while it is rare in <b>Niger</b> and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus {{is known}} from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located in <b>Niger.</b> It {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} found vertebrates in the formation. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. Nigersaurus lived in what is now <b>Niger</b> about 115 to 105 million years ago, during the Aptian and Albian ages of the mid-Cretaceous. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone).|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was complex, often {{with three or}} more usurpers in existence at once. Septimius Severus and Pescennius <b>Niger,</b> both rebel generals declared to be emperors by the troops they commanded, clashed {{for the first time}} in 193 AD at the Battle of Cyzicus, in which <b>Niger</b> was defeated. However, it took two further defeats at the Battle of Nicaea later that year and the Battle of Issus the following year, for <b>Niger</b> to be destroyed. Almost as soon as Niger's userpation had been ended, Severus was forced to deal with another rival for the throne in the person of Clodius Albinus, who had originally been allied to Severus. Albinus was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Britain and, crossing over to Gaul, defeated Severus' general Virius Lupus in battle, before being in turn defeated and killed in the Battle of Lugdunum by Severus himself.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other {{agricultural}} {{projects in}} French West Africa, the French Sudan irrigation project initially relied on families voluntarily resettling along lines {{established by the}} colonial authority. Unable to attract enough volunteers, the colonial authorities began to try forced resettlement to the cotton project. The Office du <b>Niger</b> was founded in 1926 as the main organization facilitating planned, irrigated agricultural projects. Farmers resisted forced resettlement and petitioned for permanent land rights to the irrigated land (which was usually held as property of the Office du <b>Niger).</b> Despite these efforts, a significant cash crop economy did not develop in the French Sudan.|$|E
