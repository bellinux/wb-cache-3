40|$|THELITERATURE OF CHEMISTRY {{is perhaps}} the best {{organized}} and documented in all the physical sciences. The many bibliographies, treatises, abstracting journals and review serials, and indexes are excellent tools for locating information in the literature. Methods for searching the chemical literature have been up-dated, expanded and accelerated {{by means of the}} current awareness or alerting services and information retrieval systems that have been developed in the last decade, Changes in the basic methods of handling scientific and technical information are providing new tools to meet information needs of chemists and chemical engineers. Materials are available in whatever form best suits the userâ€™s needs-printed pages, microfilm, <b>notched</b> <b>cards,</b> or computer-searchable tapes. Chemistry and chemical engineering literature is growing in a steady and predictable way. The annual rate of production is doubling every 7. 5 years. l The need for new and better communication between scientists and faster searching of the literature has resulted not only in new types of bibliographic tools but also in the establishment of information centers for the dissemination of information among scientists...|$|E
25|$|The {{user can}} {{designate}} most full-size SD cards as read-only {{by use of}} a sliding tab that covers a <b>notch</b> in the <b>card.</b> The miniSD and microSD formats do not support a write protection notch.|$|R
50|$|The PCI {{connector}} {{is defined}} as having 62 contacts {{on each side of}} the edge connector, but two or four of them are replaced by key <b>notches,</b> so a <b>card</b> has 60 or 58 contacts on each side. Pin 1 is closest to the backplate. B and A sides are as follows, looking down into the motherboard connector.|$|R
50|$|Interactive {{multi-access}} {{keys are}} a high-tech descendent of polyclaves ("card keys"). Historically various styles of encoding features of species (such as flower color) on punch cards were used. Holes or <b>notches</b> in these <b>cards</b> {{would allow the}} user to choose cards based on characters observed in a specimen until only one card remained, yielding a tentative identification.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{kinds of}} {{superimposed}} code {{can be seen}} as a Bloom filter implemented with physical edge-notched cards. An example is Zatocoding, invented by Calvin Mooers in 1947, in which the set of categories associated with a piece of information is represented by <b>notches</b> on a <b>card,</b> with a random pattern of four notches for each category.|$|R

[...] Pin 1 is closest to the backplate. [...] B and A sides are as follows, looking down into the motherboard connector.|$|R
2500|$|Typical PCI cards {{have either}} {{one or two}} key notches, {{depending}} on their signaling voltage. Cards requiring 3.3volts have a notch 56.21mm from the card backplate; those requiring 5volts have a notch 104.47mm from the backplate. [...] "Universal cards" [...] accepting either voltage have both key <b>notches.</b> This allows <b>cards</b> to be fitted only into slots with a voltage they support.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the card}} didn't succeed in {{dropping}} {{there was a}} [...] "magic wand" [...] similar to a pencil available to solve the problem. [...] One feature of this device was {{the potential for a}} [...] "double drop", where two cards would drop at once, due to a break in a <b>notch</b> on one <b>card,</b> or, more commonly, a card being held by one rod being dislodged by the adjacent card dropping, usually cards 000 (the deck directory card) and 001 which resulted in the necessity of recreating the directory. This would result in a high pitched noise with which operators were very familiar and could hear even outside the computer room, and damage to the cards. These were called [...] "screamers", while the opposite problem, cards that wouldn't drop, were called [...] "hangers".|$|R
25|$|The {{first version}} of {{conventional}} PCI found in consumer desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33MHz bus clock and 5V signalling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating <b>notch</b> in the <b>card.</b> Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to preventing accidental insertion of 5V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of conventional PCI, called PCI-X (PCI Extended) operated at frequencies up to 133MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An internal connector for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became {{the responsibility of the}} PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).|$|R
40|$|Vibro-tactile {{displays}} convey messages {{by presenting}} vibration to the user's skin. In recent years, {{the interest in}} and application of vibro-tactile displays is growing. Vibratory displays are introduced in mobile devices, desktop applications and even in aircraft [1]. Despite the growing interest, guidelines {{on the design of}} vibro-tactile displays are still lacking. Existing guidelines are mainly concerned with passive displays, such as Braille labels on controls, nibs on keyboards and <b>notches</b> on smart <b>cards</b> [2, 3, 4]. In this paper we focus on active displays, either consisting of a single vibrating element (used in for example mobile phones and computer mice) or numerous elements (used in for example active Braille displays and body suits [5, 6]). This paper discusses a first set of guidelines, dealing with the basic vibro-tactile parameters. The set is mainly derived from neurophysiological and psychophysical data. The guidelines indicate the relevant parameters as well as possible pitfalls. As such they can serve as a point of departure for interface designers. Important expansions of the set can come from user evaluation studies and examples of best practices...|$|R
