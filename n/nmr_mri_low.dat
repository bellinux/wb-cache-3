40|$|Conventional nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) are fundamentally challenged by the insensitivity that stems from the ordinarily low spin polarization achievable in even the strongest NMR magnets. However, by transferring angular momentum from laser light to electronic and nuclear spins, optical pumping methods can increase the nuclear spin polarization of noble gases by several orders of magnitude, thereby greatly enhancing their NMR sensitivity. This dissertation is primarily concerned with the principles and practice of optically pumped {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (OPNMR). The enormous sensitivity enhancement afforded by optical pumping noble gases can be exploited to permit a variety of novel NMR experiments across many disciplines.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the case}} of motors and generators, the {{benefits}} of using high temperature superconducting (HTS) coils can be represented by the reduction of 50 % in both losses and sizes compared to conventional machines. However, {{it is hard to}} establish quench detection and protection devices for the HTS coils applied to the rotors of motors and generators. So, the stability of the coils is lower than for the quiescent coils applied to <b>NMR,</b> <b>MRI</b> and so on. Therefore, it is important to improve the self-protection ability of HTS coils. We have studied the methods to improve the self-protection ability of HTS coils by removing the layer-to-layer insulation and inserting metal tape instead of the electrical insulation. The operating current in the non-insulated HTS coil was bypassed into the transverse direction by the generated normal region because of their electrical contact among the winding. In this study, we examined the method to control the current bypassing on layer-to-layer for controlling the inductance of the non-insulated HTS coil. The current bypassing properties on non-insulated HTS coil wound with 2 G wires will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{influence}} of a magnetic property of a ferromagnetic shield on design of a high field magnet, which generates high magnetic field with high homogeneity, such as <b>NMR</b> and <b>MRI,</b> is described. The <b>NMR</b> and <b>MRI</b> magnets often need the magnetic shield to protect an environment and to reduce a stray magnetic field. An iron shield used as a general magnetic shield typically has a nonlinear magnetic property. In magnetic analysis for the magnet design, {{we have to take}} into account the nonlinearity of the magnetic property of iron to compute the accurate magnetic field, since the ferromagnetic shield is exposed to so high magnetic field. That is, the iron is saturated in high magnetic field. So far the design of the high field magnets with the ferromagnetic shield exposed to over 2 T has been less reported. Recently, it was reported that the nonlinear magnetic properties of iron were measured at high magnetic fields over 2 T. The difference among the magnetic fields of the high field magnets with the ferromagnetic shield, computed by the finite element method with a few magnetization curves, is investigated...|$|R
40|$|Second-generation {{high-temperature}} superconducting (HTS) tapes {{have been}} examined for applications, such as <b>NMR,</b> <b>MRI,</b> and accelerators. Each of these applications requires a precise magnetic field profile. However, screening currents induced while charging an HTS magnet degrade its magnetic field quality. Techniques to reduce the screening current effect have been proposed in the literature. One of the means to reduce screening currents is to apply an AC magnetic field using a “shaking magnet. ” The shaking effect enhances the quality of magnetic field by allocating the screening currents inside HTS tapes. Although some experiments to study the shaking field effect were reported, the current distribution inside HTS tapes {{has not yet been}} clarified by simulation. This paper presents the simulation results for an AC magnetic field applied to a REBCO tape to reduce the influence of screening currents. In addition, we investigated the influence of the angle of applied AC magnetic field at the magnet center. The area of negative current density is also shown. From the simulation results, we conclude that a shaking field applied at an angle between 10 and 30 deg. is effective to reduce the screening current effect...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) {{is a very}} {{powerful}} tool for the structure determination of biomolecules and natural compounds, for the study of tissue extracts or intact tissues, and for the obtainment of detailed three-dimensional maps of the human body and organs. In the field of biomedicine, the two areas of NMR are represented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and by the multi-branched Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), where MRS is the acronym utilised in place of <b>NMR.</b> <b>MRI</b> uses the strong signal from water protons (1 H) to provide detailed anatomical maps and has proven to be an indispensable tool for both researchers and clinicians, but its specificity in defining the pathology is limited to only some diseases. NMR spectroscopy in its one- and two-dimensional version can be utilised to detect and assign the resonances observed in in-vitro extracts and ex-vivo biopsy samples, helping in disentangling the complex spectral pattern due to signal overlapping. This represent {{the first step in the}} individuation of the NMR biochemical markers representative of the healthy or pathological state of the tissue or organ. The results can then utilised at diagnostic and prognostic level in in-vitro and rx-vivo analyses. They also provide the rationale basis for the interpretation of in-vivo MRS studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn <b>NMR</b> or <b>MRI</b> {{of complex}} materials, {{including}} biological tissues and porous materials, magnetic susceptibility differences within the material result in local magnetic field inhomogeneities, {{even if the}} applied magnetic field is homogeneous. Mobile nuclear spins move though the inhomogeneous field, by translational diffusion and other mechanisms, resulting in decoherence of nuclear spin phase more rapidly than transverse relaxation alone. The objective {{of this paper is}} to simulate this diffusion-mediated decoherence and demonstrate that it may substantially reduce coherence lifetimes of nuclear spin phase, in an anisotropic fashion. We do so using a model of cylindrical pores within an otherwise homogeneous material, and calculate the resulting magnetic field inhomogeneities. Our simulations show that diffusion-mediated decoherence in a system of parallel cylindrical pores is anisotropic, with coherence lifetime minimised when the array of cylindrical pores is perpendicular to B 0. We also show that this anisotropy of coherence lifetime is reduced if the orientations of cylindrical pores are disordered within the system. In addition we characterise the dependence on B 0, the magnetic susceptibility of the cylindrical pores relative to the surroundings, the diffusion coefficient and cylinder wall thickness. Our findings may aid in the interpretation of <b>NMR</b> and <b>MRI</b> relaxation data...|$|R

Methods extending beyond Stejskal and Tanner's design, such as double diffusion encoding (DDE) <b>NMR</b> and <b>MRI,</b> may provide novel quantifiable metrics that are less easily inferred from conventional diffusion acquisitions. Despite the growing interest on the topic, the terminology for the pulse sequences, their parameters, and the metrics that {{can be derived from}} them remains inconsistent and disparate among groups active in DDE. Here, we present a consensus of those groups on terminology for DDE sequences and associated concepts. Furthermore, the regimes in which DDE metrics appear to provide microstructural information that cannot be achieved using more conventional counterparts (in a model-free fashion) are elucidated. We highlight in particular DDE's potential for determining microscopic diffusion anisotropy and microscopic fractional anisotropy, which offer metrics of microscopic features independent of orientation dispersion and thus provide information complementary to the standard, macroscopic, fractional anisotropy conventionally obtained by diffusion MR. Finally, we discuss future vistas and perspectives for DDE. Magn Reson Med, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
