50|$|Uranium was {{extracted}} at two phosphate {{plants in}} the central Florida district from 1952 to 1961, and at seven plants during the period 1976-1998. The average uranium recovery was about 0.9 pounds U3O8 per metric ton of P2O5. However, uranium recovery is feasible only from the process that produces double superphosphate; most phosphate is processed into <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> a process not amenable to uranium recovery.|$|E
40|$|The {{tremendous}} domestic {{reserves of}} phosphate rock {{together with the}} large annual production of <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> from phosphate rock have made {{the recovery of the}} small amounts of uranium (0. 01 to 0. 02 percent) in phosphate rock during the production of superphosphate an important problem. At current superphosphate production rates there exists a uranium potential of approximately 1000 tons per year...|$|E
40|$|The {{enhanced}} {{need for}} food items is receiving more importance {{due to a}} gradual increase in the world population and, in this scenario, fertilizers play {{a very important role}} in agriculture. In this study, the production of the <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> was investigated with a continuous chamber method by adding potassium chloride to a mixture of Hibin apatite and Kingisepp phosphorite. In the experiments, the following parameters were selected: The concentration of sulfuric acid (54 – 66 % (w/w)), the stoichiometric norm of sulfuric acid (100, 107, 110, 114 % (w/w)), the ratio of apatite/phosphorite in the mixture of phosphate (95 / 5, 90 / 10, 85 / 15, 80 / 20, 75 / 25, 70 / 30, 65 / 35, 60 / 40, 55 / 45, 50 / 50 (w/w)), potassium chloride/the mixture of phosphate (1 / 50, 2 / 50, 3 / 50, 4 / 50, 5 / 50 (w/w)), and the reaction time (2 – 8 min). It was observed that by adding potassium chloride to a low-grade phosphorite and using it to substitute a fraction of high-grade apatite in the <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> production not only resulted in a high-quality product but also eliminated the waiting period for the maturation of superphosphate in the storage. The objective {{of this study was to}} produce a <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> fertilizer by using a continuous chamber method in order to accelerate the production process and to reduce the environmental pollution caused by fluoride gases by eliminating the maturation time in the storage...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to develop an economical process for making nitrogenous fertilizers from ammonia and cellulosic waste materials such as corncobs, cornstalks, and oat hulls. In this endeavor, two different methods were investigated;One method was based on hydrolysis of the hemicelluloses in these materials with dilute solutions of mineral acids or salts followed by ammoniation with anhydrous ammonia of the hydrolysate. With corncobs, when 8. 25 percent sulfuric acid and a liquid/solid ratio of 2. 0 was used for hydrolysis, and ammoniation was carried out slightly above room temperature, a product was obtained containing 7. 4 percent total nitrogen of which 4. 2 percent was organic nitrogen (Product A), With the same hydrolysis conditions and an ammoniation temperature of 249 °C, a product was obtained containing 9. 5 percent nitrogen of which 56 percent was organic nitrogen (Product B). In Product A, 86. 4 {{percent of the total}} nitrogen was water-soluble, and in Product B only 17. 6 percent was water-soluble. <b>Normal</b> and concentrated <b>superphosphates</b> or dilute phosphoric acid in the hydrolysis step did not result in as much organic nitrogen an sulfuric acid;The second method involved the ammoniation of the cellulosic materials with anhydrous ammonia. By this process, a product containing 4. 6 percent total nitrogen was obtained with corncobs at a temperature or 300 °C (Product C). In this product, all the nitrogen was organic and none of it was water-soluble;Small-scale engineering equipment for producing Product A was built and tested. Products were made which were essentially the same as those prepared on a laboratory scale;An evaluation of Products A, B, and C as fertilizer materials was made. Tests were made to determine chemical stability, hygroscopicity and caking characteristics. These tests showed that Products A, B, and C could be used in mixed fertilizers. Greenhouse plant-growth tests were carried out. Product A proved to be better than Milorganite, a commercial nitrogen fertilizer made from sewage, and was almost an good as ammonium sulfate, Products B and C did not compare well with Product A ammonium sulfate, or Milorganite in the plant-growth tests; however, under different conditions of a longer growing season, these two products might be better;A preliminary cost analysis indicated that Product A might compete with ammonium sulfate and could easily undersell Milorganite;It is recommended that further pilot plant work be carried out on the production of Product A...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of grinding on the acidulation of phosphate rock. Bench-scale work was carried out in a one quart, laboratory ball mill made of stainless steel. The mill was equipped with a heating chamber so that the material could also be dried in the mill;The results from this work indicated that a <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> product suitable for commercial use could be obtained within an hour after the addition of the first acid. The product had low moisture and low free acid contents, and under suitable conditions, granular form. The mixing action of the balls resulted in good heat transfer during drying with little danger of overheating the product. Consequently, the drying air temperature had little effect on the product except in the rate of production. The reaction was sufficiently rapid in the mill so that no preliminary grinding period was necessary before the drying operation was started. Low acidulation ratios resulted in low conversions as in any <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> process. Low acid concentrations were more conducive to a rapid reaction between the rock and acid. Below an acid strength of about 55 percent, however, there was no further advantage in dilution;The favorable results of the bench-scale work led to the construction of a pilot plant to determine whether the process could be carried out on a larger scale and on a continuous basis. The process was built around a heated tube mill with a stainless steel lining and a feeding mechanism. Heating was indirect. The acid and rock were fed into one end of the mill and product taken from the other;Successful pilot plant operation showed that the bench-scale results could be duplicated on a larger scale and on a continuous or semicontinuous basis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the materials could be handled satisfactorily in the tube mill. Plugging and other difficulties were overcome;Finally, an economic comparison of the process with an equivalent, standard, <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> process indicated that the quick-curing process was favored. Fixed capital, production cost and working capital were estimated to be less than for a conventional, <b>normal</b> <b>superphosphate</b> process. The estimated return on investment for a conventional plant was 3. 8 percent while the equivalent quick-curing plant gave an estimated 5. 6 percent...|$|E
40|$|Florida {{phosphate}} rock and the phosphoria formations of Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming have a uranium content ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 02 per cent.
