5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The <b>next</b> <b>question</b> was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E

25|$|When the Official Opposition has {{exhausted}} {{its initial}} three questions, the lead questioners {{of the other}} officially-recognized opposition parties are permitted an initial question and one supplementary question each, in order of size. Given {{the composition of the}} current 42nd Canadian Parliament, once the Official Opposition, the Conservative Party, is finished, the <b>next</b> <b>question</b> comes from the only other officially-recognized opposition party, the New Democratic Party.|$|E

In the end of the stanza, poet questions the peddlers about what they are selling and they reply dice made from ivory and chessmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic {{to make sure they}} were listening. Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the <b>next</b> <b>question.</b> Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hot seat}} {{contestant}} had only fifteen seconds to answer {{each of the}} first five questions (100-1,000 points), thirty seconds per <b>question</b> for the <b>next</b> five <b>questions</b> (2,000-32,000 points), forty-five seconds for the <b>next</b> four <b>questions</b> (64,000-500,000 points), and fifty-five seconds for the final million-point question; the real show internationally carried a variation of this format from 2008-2010.|$|R

25|$|Double Dip (x2): This {{lifeline}} {{was introduced}} in season 3. By using this lifeline the candidate has the option to choose two answers for a single question. When this lifeline is used the timer is stopped and the candidate has to lock his/her first answer. If it is right the candidate can proceed {{to play for the}} <b>next</b> <b>question.</b> If wrong the candidate will be given a second chance to lock another answer while the timer is started again. On the use of this lifeline the candidate is not allowed to use any other lifelines. He or she is also not allowed to quit the game when this lifeline is used.|$|E
25|$|The Finals {{was played}} {{the same way}} as the Elimination Round, except with single {{contestant}}s. The contestant who had more points when time ran out won the game and played the Solo Game for a chance at a cash jackpot. In the first show of the series, in the finals, the contestant who scored blocked the other contestant and would be allowed to keep answering questions until he/she missed one. If the other contestant then guessed right, that person took control. If both contestants missed the answer, the <b>next</b> <b>question</b> was a toss-up to determine control. After the first episode, this format was abandoned and all words were played as toss-ups.|$|E

500|$|In {{the event}} that a {{contestant}} leaves and very little time remains (in the final part of an episode), a randomly selected audience member is given one chance to win $1,000 by answering the <b>next</b> <b>question</b> intended for the previous contestant (or $2,000 if the <b>next</b> <b>question</b> was on a Double Money episode). Regardless of the outcome, the audience member receives a special prize. In seasons nine and ten, the prize was {{a copy of the}} Millionaire video game; as of season eleven, audience members now receive 20 free playings for a Facebook game based on the show's format. In season thirteen, which gave this game the name [...] "Thousandaire", the question the audience player faced did not come from the previous player's stack, but was instead a separate question. Two additional audience games were also introduced and played in season thirteen: [...] "Team Millionaire", where two audience members are both presented with a single question and lock in their individual answers separately for the chance to win $500 and a bonus question with which they can double their money; and [...] "Fastest Feet", a variation of Fastest Finger which four audience members play for the chance to split $1,000.|$|E
500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment. [...] There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise. [...] The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. [...] If so, the <b>next</b> <b>question</b> is whether the patient can respond {{in a meaningful way}} to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time. [...] A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be [...] "alert and oriented times four" [...] (sometimes denoted [...] "A" [...] on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.|$|E
500|$|A much {{different}} {{origin of the}} song was told on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck {{with him for a}} bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang [...] "look at the stars". Martin went on to further explain that the word [...] "yellow" [...] has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change [...] "yellow" [...] to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word [...] "yellow" [...] just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just {{to move on to the}} <b>next</b> <b>question.</b> Martin applauded Stern saying [...] "I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'." ...|$|E

We asked about the responsibilities of participants (question 16), about the team size and the duration in months of the last project (questions 17 and 18), and finally about the type of the system developed (19). Here, we provided six suggestions with the usual classification (Web, Client/Server, Server Only, Client Only, Mobile, and Embedded).|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} month, {{a controversy}} arose after the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) {{issued a report}} calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% — a stark difference from the official figure of 18.9%, used by politicians to justify the retention or revival of the NEP. One local analyst suggested that [...] "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely the <b>next</b> <b>question</b> is, why the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present." [...] The report's methodology was criticised for using market value instead of par value for its calculations of equity, and limiting its scope to a thousand publicly listed companies. It also included government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned companies. Some, however, criticised the government, alleging that par value did not accurately reflect {{the value of the}} enterprises studied, and claimed that a portion of GLC equity should be considered Bumiputra-held. The report was later withdrawn, but the controversy continued after an independent media outlet cited a study following the government methodology that indicated Bumiputra equity had passed the 30% mark in 1997.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we seek to}} raise {{questions}} about the nature of number agreement in the grammars of young children, whether they are learning languages poor in number agreement (African American English (AAE)), relatively simple (Mainstream American English (MAE)) or inherently complex (Xhosa). At first glance, number agreement appears to be a straightforward mechanism, but that mechanism is called into question by peculiar asymmetries of production and comprehension that demand more explanation and exploration. These findings must necessarily be regarded as preliminary, and some studies are still underway to answer the <b>next</b> <b>questions...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The show's host asks each {{contestant}} {{a number}} of multiple-choice questions. Of the four options only one is correct. Players answer correctly to win an amount of money.

Players who answer question numbers five and ten correctly {{find themselves in a}} situation where their winnings are [...] "safe". This means they will not lose their winnings under any circumstances. This allows the players to hazard a guess for question six and question eleven. Players answering a question incorrectly are eliminated from the game and their winnings return to the previous [...] "safe" [...] amount.
