25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E

500|$|The Final Fantasy Legends soundtrack was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu {{and consists of}} sixteen tracks. Uematsu struggled with composition at first, as the Game Boy's sound hardware {{was different from the}} Famicom's, featuring a new stereo option, unique waveforms, and only three musical notes. Kawazu wanted the game's music to resemble that of Square's two preceding Final Fantasy titles, but Uematsu chose to develop new waveforms. Despite Game Boy's limited audio capabilities, Uematsu expressed desire to compose music for it again in 2000, though added regarding the notion of a remake [...] "it would be better to have high quality music and graphics, but we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the users enjoy the game." ...|$|E

[...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- but this is my hardest place. It's a tough place." [...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack.

Joe Russo added that the [...] "essence" [...] of [...] "Civil War" [...] was used, such as [...] "the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary" [...] being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, [...] "in a lot of ways [...] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other." [...] Executive producer Nate Moore added that [...] "it felt like it was kind of the right time" [...] to adapt [...] "Civil War" [...] given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films ( [...] , The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with [...] "world-ending experiences.

He decided to kill any microscopic organisms already present by boiling the broth until he was confident that any microorganisms present were killed.

2500|$|Similarly, Indigenous {{feminism}} is set {{apart from other}} Indigenous rights movements, such as Indigenous liberation theory, because those theories have [...] "not been attentive to the gendered ways in which colonial oppression and racism function for men and women, or to the inherent and adopted sexisms that some communities manifest." [...] There are some within Indigenous communities who choose not to identify as feminist and therefore {{distance themselves from the}} mainstream feminism. There are many reasons for this choice, however, Kim Anderson argues that ifWestern {{feminism is}} unpalatable because it is about rights rather than responsibilities, then we should all take responsibility seriously and ask if we are being responsible to all members of our societies. If we are to reject equality in favour of difference, then we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> those differences are embedded in systems that empower all members. If we see feminism as being too invested in Western liberalism and individual autonomy, then we need to ensure that our collectivist approaches serve everyone in the collective. And if we want to embrace essential elements of womanhood that have been problematic for Western feminists [...] then we have to ensure that these concepts don't get stuck in literal or patriarchal interpretations.|$|E
