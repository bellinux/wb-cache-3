40|$|International audienceThe cat shark is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} model for Chondrichthyes, an evolutionarily important sister group of the bony vertebrates that include teleosts and tetrapods. In the bony vertebrates, the first axon tracts form a highly conserved early axon scaffold. The corresponding structure has not been well characterised in cat shark and will prove a useful model for comparative studies. Using pan-neural markers, the early axon scaffold of the cat shark, Scyliorhinus canicula, was analysed. Like in other vertebrates, the medial longitudinal fascicle was the first axon tract to form from a small cluster of neurones in the ventral brain. Subsequently, additional neuronal clusters and axon tracts emerged which formed an array of longitudinal, transversal, and commissural axons tracts in the Scyliorhinus canicula embryonic brain.

Physiological studies show that disruption of the barrelettes is accompanied by conversion of functional synapses into silent synapses in the PrV. In this study, we used whole cell recordings with a paired-pulse stimulation protocol and MK- 801 blocking rate to estimate the presynaptic release probability (Pr) <b>of</b> ION central <b>trigeminal</b> afferent terminals in the PrV. We investigated Pr during postnatal development, following neonatal ION damage, and determined whether conversion of functional synapses into silent synapses after peripheral denervation results from changes in Pr.

The results from paired-pulse protocol were confirmed by MK- 801 blocking rate experiments. The nonuniform PPRs did not show target cell specificity and developmental regulation. The distribution of PPRs fit nicely to Gaussian function with a peak at ∼ 100 %.

In this study we used Nissl staining and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity to compare the human LC with that of closely related primate species, including great and lesser apes, and macaque monkeys. TH catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. The number of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons was estimated in each species using stereologic methods. In the LC of humans the mean total number of TH-ir neurons was significantly higher compared to the other primates. Because the total number of TH-ir neurons in the LC was highly correlated with the species mean volume of the medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and neocortical gray matter, we conclude that much of the observed phylogenetic variation can be explained by anatomical scaling. Notably, the total number of LC neurons in humans was most closely predicted by the nonhuman allometric scaling relationship relative to medulla size, whereas the number of LC neurons in humans was considerably lower than predicted according to neocortex and cerebellum volume. ...|$|R

Subsequent to the injection of HRP into the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, extensive cell labelling was observed bilaterally in various areas of the cerebral cortex including the cingulate, frontal, parietal and insular cortices.

Controls were injected with equivalent volumes of saline. Brainstems of 31 -day-old offspring were cryosectioned and stained with cresyl violet.

In this study, we have used an antibody and a complementary RNA probe to explore the distribution of neurons that express VR 1 in rat and in certain areas of human brain. In the rat, we observed VR 1 -expressing neurons throughout the whole neuroaxis, including all cortical areas (in layers 3 and 5), {{several members of the}} limbic system (e. g., hippocampus, central amygdala, and both medial and lateral habenula), striatum, hypothalamus, centromedian and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, reticular formation, locus coeruleus, cerebellum, and inferior olive. VR 1 -immunopositive cells also were found in the third and fifth layers of human parietal cortex.

All the 3 internal auricular nerves received contributions from the vagus. The RIAN received additional fibres from the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve</b> while the MIAN and CIAN contained fibres derived from the facial nerves. In the brainstem, collaterals from the descending fibres of the afferents were given off at all levels to the medially located spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) which extended rostocaudally from the principal <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve,</b> subnuclei oralis, interpolaris and caudalis of the SpV to C 1 or C 2 cervical segment. The greatest density of central projections was observed in the subnucleus caudalis and C 1. In the latter, the terminal field in the dorsal horn was roughly wedge-shaped, tapering off medially from lamina I towards lamina V. A somatotopic organisation was observed in the spinal trigeminal tract (SpVtr) and spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) in which the projection fibres and terminal fields of the RIAN were located lateral {{to those of the}} MIAN and CIAN. Some nontrigeminal nuclei, e. g. paratrigeminal and cuneate nuclei, nucleus X and the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the solitary tract were also labelled following HRP application to the internal auricular nerves. The localisation of the central projections of the internal auricular nerves as well as the 2 nd order neurons in some specific nuclei to which the afferent fibres project is consistent with the concept of a brainstem somatovisceral link...|$|R
40|$|Motor neurons are segmentally {{organised}} in {{the developing}} chick hindbrain, with groups of neurons occupying pairs of hindbrain segments or rhombomeres. The branchiomotor <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve</b> occupies rhombomeres 2 and 3 (r 2 and r 3), that {{of the facial nerve}} r 4 and r 5, and that of the glossopharyngeal nerve r 6 and r 7. Branchiomotor neuron cell bodies lie within the basal plate, forming columns {{on either side of the}} ventral midline floor plate. Axons originating in rhombomeres 2, 4 and 6 grow laterally (dorsally) towards the exit points located in the alar plates of these rhombomeres, while axons originating in odd-numbered rhombomeres 3 and 5 grow laterally and then rostrally, crossing a rhombomere boundary to reach their exit point. Examination of the trajectories of motor axons in odd-numbered segments at late stages of development (19 – 25) showed stereotyped pathways, in which axons grew laterally before making a sharp turn rostrally. During the initial phase of outgrowth (stage 14 – 15), however, axons had meandering courses and did not grow in a directed fashion towards their exit point. When r 3 or r 5 was transplanted with reversed rostrocaudal polarity prior to motor axon outgrowth, the majority of axons grew to their appropriate, rostral exit point, despite the inverted neuroepithelial polarity. In r 3 reversals, however, there was a considerable increase in the normally small number of axons that grew out via the caudal, r 4 exit point. These findings are discussed with relevance to the factors involved in motor neuron specification and axon outgrowth {{in the developing}} hindbrain...|$|R
