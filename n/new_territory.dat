5|$|Following {{several years}} of {{relative}} inactivity as the band maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing material for a new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to {{have come to the}} realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, noting that the music would cover <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E
5|$|In 1783, Al-Madhkur {{lost the}} islands of Bahrain {{following}} his defeat by the Bani Utbah tribe at the 1782 Battle of Zubarah. Bahrain was not <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> to the Bani Utbah; they had been a presence there since the 17th century. During that time, they started purchasing date palm gardens in Bahrain; a document shows that 81 years before arrival of the Al-Khalifa, one of the shaikhs of the Al Bin Ali tribe (an offshoot of the Bani Utbah) had bought a palm garden from Mariam bint Ahmed Al Sanadi in Sitra island.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Territories again {{rejected}} Weaver's bill, but {{approved a}} compromise measure {{that opened the}} Unassigned Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral Strip to settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; according to an 1884 Supreme Court decision, Elkv. Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the <b>new</b> <b>territory.</b> When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{fast mail}} route to the Pacific coast was {{prompted}} largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of prospectors, investors and businessmen {{made their way to}} California, at that time a <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000. The demand for a faster way to get mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the American Civil War approached.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideology}} of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal}} of obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people.

5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into <b>new</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cristóbal de Olid sailed from Mexico in January 1524, {{stopping}} off in Cuba to collect supplies {{set aside for}} him by Cortés. The governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, was an enemy of Cortés and persuaded Olid to take Honduras for himself. Olid arrived off northern Honduras in early May, some distance {{to the east of}} Puerto de Caballos. He disembarked with 360 Spaniards and 22 horses, and founded Triunfo de la Cruz, still known by this name, near the modern port of Tela. He claimed the <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> in Cortés' name, but after founding the new town he openly rejected him, {{with the support of the}} majority of his men. He then carried out a campaign of conquest in what is now western Honduras, subjugating the heavily populated towns of Naco and Tencoa, which did little to resist.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|As the {{expiry date}} of the lease neared in the 1980s, talks between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China led to {{the signing of the}} Sino-British Joint Declaration (1984), in which the whole of Hong Kong would be returned, instead of only the <b>New</b> <b>Territories.</b> This is because Hong Kong's {{shipping}} ports, reservoirs and other vital installations were all in the <b>New</b> <b>Territories.</b> Had only the <b>New</b> <b>Territories</b> been returned to China, it would also have been difficult to accommodate those <b>New</b> <b>Territories</b> residents moving to the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island.|$|R

5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the <b>new</b> <b>territory,</b> {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the <b>new</b> <b>territory.</b> The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E
5|$|In 1267, Gilbert de Clare, {{who held}} the Lordship of Glamorgan, seized the lands around the town of Senghenydd {{in the north of}} Glamorgan from their native Welsh ruler. Caerphilly Castle was built to control the <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> and Castell Coch—strategically located between Cardiff and Caerphilly—was reoccupied. A new castle was built in stone around the motte, {{comprising}} a shell-wall, a projecting circular tower, a gatehouse and a square hall above an undercroft. The north-west section of the walls was protected by a talus and the sides of the motte were scarped to increase their angle, all producing a small but powerful fortification. Further work followed between 1268 and 1277, which added two large towers, a turning-bridge for the gatehouse and further protection to the north-west walls.|$|E

5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant otter numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.|$|E
