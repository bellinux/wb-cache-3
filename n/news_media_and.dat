5|$|Tornado myths are {{incorrect}} {{beliefs about}} tornadoes, {{which can be}} attributed to many factors, including stories and news reports told by people unfamiliar with tornadoes, sensationalism by <b>news</b> <b>media,</b> <b>and</b> the presentation of incorrect information in popular entertainment. Common myths cover various aspects of the tornado, and include ideas about tornado safety, the minimization of tornado damage, and false assumptions about the size, shape, power, and path of the tornado itself.|$|E
5|$|All three {{channels}} televise {{events such}} as congressional hearings, White House press briefings and presidential speeches, {{as well as other}} government meetings including Federal Communications Commission hearings and Pentagon press conferences. Other U.S. political coverage includes State of the Union speeches, and presidential press conferences. According to the results of a survey after the 1992 presidential election, 85% of C-SPAN viewers voted in that election. The results of a similar survey in 2013 found that 89% of C-SPAN viewers voted in the 2012 presidential election. In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various <b>news</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> nonprofit organizations, including those at the National Press Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices' speaking engagements.|$|E
40|$|Scholars and {{educators}} have long hoped that media education is {{positively related to}} pro-social goals such as political and civic engagement. With a focus on measuring <b>news</b> <b>media</b> literacy with emphasis on media knowledge, need for cognition <b>and</b> <b>media</b> locus of control, this study surveyed 537 college students and found positive relationships between <b>news</b> <b>media</b> literacy <b>and</b> two political engagement measures: current events knowledge and internal political efficacy. Findings show that <b>news</b> <b>media</b> literacy is not associated with political activity, although some dimensions of <b>news</b> <b>media</b> literacy are associated {{with lower levels of}} political trust. Results help to define significant components of <b>news</b> <b>media</b> literacy <b>and</b> suggest that these components help foster positive relationships with civic and political life...|$|R
50|$|As this illegal {{activity}} became apparent, suspects {{were arrested and}} some were convicted of crimes. Some victims retained solicitors upon learning their privacy had been violated, and filed suit against <b>news</b> <b>media</b> companies <b>and</b> their agents. Some victims received financial payments for violation of privacy. Successful suits and publicity from investigative news articles led to further disclosures, including the names of more victims, more documentary evidence of wrongdoing, admissions of wrongdoing by some <b>news</b> <b>media</b> agents, <b>and</b> payments potentially related to the scandal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} the development process of a general innovation framework for an ongoing Nordic R&D project on e-business <b>and</b> <b>media.</b> It focuses on {{the current state of}} the Danish <b>news</b> <b>media</b> sector <b>and</b> the conclusions we can draw from the “Web 2. 0 activity ” of the Danish newspapers. The paper concludes that the Web 2. 0 implies the need for fundamental re-thinking of the business models of the <b>news</b> <b>media</b> sector <b>and</b> for developing a new framework for business modelling for this sector...|$|R
5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the <b>news</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet <b>news</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> {{government}} officials {{soon began to}} discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well {{and that he was}} beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges would be brought. The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet system, could be blamed on the Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E
