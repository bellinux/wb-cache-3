5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will <b>need</b> <b>special</b> powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters.

5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert <b>need</b> <b>special</b> adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E

30|$|In our study, we also {{collected}} free associations to {{the terms}} <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and disability. We found that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is associated with more negativity than disability; <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> conjures up more associations to developmental disabilities (such as intellectual disability, autism, or Down syndrome) whereas disability {{is associated with a}} broader, more inclusive set of disabilities; and <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> evokes more unanswered questions than disability. These associations again demonstrate that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is an ineffective euphemism. We propose that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is an ineffective euphemism because it is imprecise, it connotes segregation, and it implies <b>special</b> rights; <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> has become a dysphemism.|$|R
