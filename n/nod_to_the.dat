5|$|In 2012 thrash metal band Municipal Waste {{formed the}} spinoff group, Iron Reagan. The band's name pays double {{tribute to the}} 1980s with a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> group Iron Maiden who enjoyed heavy airplay on MTV during Reagan's presidency.|$|E
5|$|The W427's name is {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of factors. W is to honour the founder of HSV, Tom Walkinshaw. The 427 is simply the engine capacity in cubic inches, but it is also a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> HRT 427C, which won the 2002 and 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour motor races.|$|E
5|$|Townsend {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the band's first album {{at the same}} time he was working on SYL, spending half the week on one and half on the other. The album was engineered and mixed by Townsend and Shaun Thingvold, who has worked on many of Townsend's and Strapping Young Lad's albums. It had the working title Relationships, but was renamed Accelerated Evolution, a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> frantic pace of putting a new band together in under a year.|$|E
50|$|The episode {{received}} enormous {{praise from}} critics, with significant praise towards <b>the</b> <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> comics, Mazouz's and Monaghan's {{performance and the}} ending.|$|R
50|$|Morricone {{supplied}} music largely {{inspired by}} The Hateful Eights screenplay. The music is moody, tension-building work with music box <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italian Giallo genre.|$|R
50|$|In 1985 Rauni Mollberg {{directed}} a {{a remake of}} the film with Väinö Linna's approval. The film version follows the novel more closely - but also features obvious visual <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1955 version.|$|R
5|$|In September 2015, Marvel {{announced}} the Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, named as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe. Each guidebook is compiled by Mike O'Sullivan and the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe team, with cover art from Mike Del Mundo and Pascal Campion, and features {{facts about the}} MCU films, film-to-comic comparisons, and production stills. Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Iron Man, Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Incredible Hulk / Marvel's Iron Man 2, Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Thor, and Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger released each month from October 2015 to January 2016, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Chrysler Building is {{considered}} a leading example of Art Deco architecture. The exterior of the building has about fifty total ornaments protruding from the building's corners at five different floors in a way similar to the gargoyles of Gothic cathedrals. The corners of the 61st floor are graced with eagles, (a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bald eagle, the national bird of the United States), while the 31st-floor contains gargoyles and replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps at its corners. The building is constructed of masonry with a steel frame, as well as metal cladding, and currently contains a total of 3,862 windows on its facades.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. One advertisement claimed, likely in error, that this film {{was based on the}} play The Man of the Hour. Written by George Broadhurst, the play focused on political corruption in the form of graft, but the play itself was apparently inspired by politicians of New York. The plot of the film includes a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Women's suffrage movement, {{but it would be a}} decade before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. The character, Congressman Casey, would later be seen again in Orator, Knight and Cow Charmer. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. There are no known credits for the cast, but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910. Credits may have included Anna Rosemond, one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era. Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying two characters.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, {{the fictional}} Ohio towns of Beatosu and Goblu were {{inserted}} into that year's official state of Michigan map as <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Michigan and its traditional rival, The Ohio State University.|$|R
50|$|The opening {{titles are}} an amusing spoof of those {{featured}} in the James Bond movies, {{and there are several}} <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 007 canon throughout the film e.g. Daniel's rotating number plate and the ski chase at the film's climax.|$|R
50|$|The {{magazine}} was originally named Domestic Crude (1983 - 1985), {{a name that}} <b>nodded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> major industry of the Houston area. It was a 64-page (magazine-formatted) student-run publication, with editorial advising coming from Lopate, who also contributed work <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first issues.|$|R
25|$|In {{the series}} Kamen Rider Kiva, Dogga's race, the Franken, {{is an obvious}} <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monster, along with Kiva's Dogga form.|$|E
25|$|The dot {{replaces the}} arrow in a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> many other {{languages}} (e.g. Java, Python, etc.) that have coalesced around dot as the syntax for method invocation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, during the mid-1980s, Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed {{initiated}} a revitalization plan {{that included a}} ballpark for a new Minor League Baseball team in the city. This ballpark, named Riverside Stadium attracted the Pittsburgh Pirates, which moved the Nashua Pirates to Harrisburg. The team was renamed the Harrisburg Senators, in a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old Senators franchise.|$|E
50|$|The {{show has}} been praised for its {{positive}} impact towards the Hispanic culture, which makes numerous <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> history of Mexico and folklore, {{as well as}} the series' worthy educational values which reminds the Hispanic younger viewers the importance of their Mexican roots.|$|R
50|$|Angeltown is a 5-issue limited series {{created in}} 2005 by writer Gary Phillips and artist Shawn Martinbrough, and {{published}} by Vertigo Comics, an imprint of DC Comics. The story is told in the blaxploitation idiom, with <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detective stories of Chester Himes and Walter Mosley.|$|R
50|$|James Luceno {{wrote the}} novelization which went {{deeper into the}} events of the film and {{included}} many <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio show and the original pulp magazines, most significantly alluding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that The Shadow's true identity was Kent Allard and that 'Lamont Cranston' was just another identity he assumed.|$|R
25|$|In a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show, LACoFD officially {{changed the}} {{designation}} of the fire station {{on the grounds of}} Universal Studios from Station 60 to Station 51 in 1994, more than 20 years after the debut of Emergency! The companies at Station 60 were also changed so that this station is now indeed the home of Engine 51 and Squad 51 as well as Patrol 51.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} series {{was released on}} DVD and Blu-ray on November 26, 2013, in a collectable box shaped {{like one of the}} barrels used by Walt to bury his money. The set contains various features, including a two-hour documentary and a humorous alternate ending that features Cranston as his character from Malcolm in the Middle and Jane Kaczmarek as hers, in a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final scene from Newhart.|$|E
25|$|Laurel & Hardie (originally {{localized}} as Laurent and Strom), two mercenaries who Taloon {{can meet}} in Endor during Chapter 3. Hardie, a soldier, requests 400 Gold and simply uses a powerful physical attack each turn. Laurel, a magician, requests 600 {{and has a}} small, versatile magical repertoire along with an average physical attack which can cause paralysis. While unconnected story-wise, their naming in the DS remake is a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early-20th century comedy duo, Laurel and Hardy.|$|E
40|$|For {{voice and}} piano. Good-night little stars (I am getting drowsy). The ball (There's a ball just think). My sister Nell (My sister Nell).

Women Composers Collection...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} Steinberger {{reflects}} on the cultural meaning of the advent of cyberspace and the psychoanalytic meaning for her patients of their interactions with others in cyberspace. While she gives <b>the</b> briefest of <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creative potential of the internet, her dominant tone is sceptical, and at time alarmist...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a standalone Mothra film entitled Mothra vs. Bagan, the movie was notable for its return to a more fantasy-based, family-oriented atmosphere evocative of pre-1984 Godzilla films. Although he did not return as director, Ōmori continued his trend of incorporating Hollywood elements into his screenplay, in this case <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indiana Jones franchise.|$|R
25|$|The Federal Urban Renewal Program of the 1960s were {{supposed}} to revitalize Ybor City with new residences and businesses designed to attract tourists to “Tampa’s Latin Quarter” (a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French Quarter in New Orleans). Thousands of remaining residents were forced to move as entire blocks of old homes, business, and cigar factories were razed. Due {{to a lack of}} funds and political will, however, the replacement construction never took place, and old buildings were replaced by empty lots.|$|E
25|$|A coupe {{version of}} the Shelby Cobra {{roadster}} was introduced the following year. The Ford Shelby GR-1 concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, it showed a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1960s Shelby Daytona. The GR-1, like the Cobra, {{is based on the}} GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of Motor Trend and Car Magazine. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the Ford GT's production line after its production comes to an end.|$|E
25|$|The Society {{continued}} from 1815 as the Extern Historical Society. Among {{its members}} {{at this time}} were Isaac Butt, who tried unsuccessfully in 1832 to have the Society readmitted, Joseph Sheridan LeFanu, Thomas Davis and John Blake Dillon and many other notables of the nationalist cause. In 1843 the Society was reformed within the College after a student petition, again {{on the condition that}} no subject of current politics was debated. This provision remains in the Laws of the Hist as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past, but the college authorities have long since ceased to restrict the subjects of the society's debates.|$|E
50|$|Professor A.L.I., an {{educator}} and rapper, often {{goes by the}} alter-ego Black Steven, which he says is a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> Estevanico <b>the</b> Moor.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> how <b>The</b> Secret Storm {{began its}} story, Scott and Nora are {{killed in a}} car {{accident}} on New Year's Eve.|$|R
50|$|J. R. R. Tolkien, a {{professional}} philologist, <b>nodded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> derivation from the Dutch word for club in his 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit. There he mentions (tongue-in-cheek) {{that the game}} of golf was invented when a club-wielding hobbit knocked the head off a goblin named Golfimbul, and the head sailed {{through the air and}} landed in a rabbit hole.|$|R
25|$|The architects embraced several popular Midcentury Modern design {{features}} such as geometric forms, tilted windows, a striking brick-and-glass tower, and large-scale signage. Two stone monument signs advertising the current feature stood at the driveway entrances. Exterior brick and stone were echoed in the interior, along with wood and copper, materials that reflected Midcentury residential trends. The Terrace was situated {{at the high end}} of the site with room for 1,000 cars, a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> automobile-centric postwar culture. The warm, elegant interiors included a sunken lounge with a copper fireplace, furnished like a luxurious living room of the day.|$|E
25|$|A {{successor}} to the ZR-1 made its debut in 2001 as the Z06, giving a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high-performance Z06 version of the C2 Corvette of the 1960s. Instead of a heavy, double-overhead cam engine like in the ZR-1, the Z06 used a high-output, tuned version of the standard LS1 Corvette engine (designated LS6), which initially produced 385hp (287kW). Although its total horsepower output was {{less than that of}} the last ZR-1, the Z06 was much lighter, and could out-perform the ZR-1 in every category except top speed. It also cost substantially less money than the ZR-1. The Z06 curb weight totaled 3,118lbs.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} KTRU began in February 1967 in a {{residential}} college at Rice, Hanszen College, where several students broadcast music in the Old Section part of the dorm using an unlicensed 2 watt AM station, using the call sign KHCR (Hanszen College radio) and the wiring of a buzzer system. The next fall, the station transformed into an AM carrier current station with wires running through the steam tunnel system connecting the dormitories to a studio located {{in the basement of}} the Rice Memorial Center using the call sign KOWL, a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rice University mascot.|$|E
25|$|Whether Reed excluded, by {{accident}} or by design, {{the names of}} men that accompanied him on such a vital mission, or whether members of the Light Horse sought credit, ex post facto, for a mission {{with which they were}} not involved, is unclear. History seems to have sided with the Light Horse; most accounts of the expedition mention twelve, not seven cavalrymen. A notable exception is David Hackett Fischer’s Washington's Crossing, which—perhaps <b>nodding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discrepancy—avoids the mention of a figure.|$|R
25|$|Although {{marketed as}} a family film, it was notably darker than the creators' {{previous}} material, and incorporated several <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new age movement. The animatronics used in the film were considered groundbreaking. The primary concept artist was the fantasy illustrator Brian Froud, famous for his distinctive fairy and dwarf designs. Froud also collaborated with Henson and Oz for their next project, the 1986 film Labyrinth.|$|R
25|$|There {{were also}} the Pang Brothers from Hong Kong, who came to Thailand to make stylish movies, {{starting}} with Bangkok Dangerous and <b>the</b> <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> J-Horror, <b>The</b> Eye.|$|R
