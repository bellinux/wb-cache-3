40|$|<b>Neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> {{has been}} widely {{evaluated}} from changes in light transmission. Using direct particle counting, we demonstrated that light transmission does not accurately reflect aggregation, and showed that in contrast to previous reports, newborn neutrophils do not aggregate irreversibly. We developed a flow cytometric technique to measure the kinetics of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation,</b> including latent times for onset of aggregation, initial forward and reversal rates, and maximal extents of aggregation. The kinetics of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> were related to changes in initial cell concentration, stir speed (shear), and activator type and concentration. Physiologic activators stimulated reversible aggregation, accompanied by an exponential decay in aggregatory potential with increasing time. The fraction of occupied activator receptors was found to correspond to the fraction of maximal rates or extent of aggregation. Monoclonal antibodies were used to show that <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> is mediated by the Mac- 1 integrin (CD 11 b/CD 18). Direct measurements of aggregation have enhanced {{our understanding of the}} (patho) physiologic process of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: After activation, {{platelets}} {{adhere to}} neutrophils via P-selectin and beta 2 -integrin. The molecular mechanisms and adhesion events in whole blood exposed to venous levels of hydrodynamic shear {{in the absence}} of exogenous activation remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole blood was sheared at approximately 100 s(- 1). The kinetics of neutrophil-platelet adhesion and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> were measured in real time by flow cytometry. P-selectin was upregulated to the platelet surface in response to shear and was the primary factor mediating neutrophil-platelet adhesion. The extent of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> increased linearly with platelet adhesion to neutrophils. Blocking either P-selectin, its glycoprotein ligand PSGL- 1, or both simultaneously by preincubation with a monoclonal antibody resulted in equivalent inhibition of neutrophil-platelet adhesion (approximately 30 %) and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> (approximately 70 %). The residual amount of neutrophil adhesion was blocked with anti-CD 11 b/CD 18. Treatment of blood with prostacyclin analogue ZK 36374, which raises cAMP levels in platelets, blocked P-selectin upregulation and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> to baseline. Complete abrogation of platelet-neutrophil adhesion required both ZK 36374 and anti-CD 18. Electron microscopic observations of fixed blood specimens revealed that platelets augmented <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> both by forming bridges between neutrophils and through contact-mediated activation. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with a model in which venous levels of shear support platelet adherence to neutrophils via P-selectin binding PSGL- 1. This interaction alone is sufficient to mediate <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation.</b> Abrogation of platelet adhesion and aggregation requires blocking Mac- 1 in addition to PSGL- 1 or P-selectin. The described mechanisms are likely of key importance in the pathogenesis and progression of thrombotic disorders that are exacerbated by leukocyte-platelet aggregation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of free fatty acids on the unstimulated and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe) stimulated rabbit neu-trophil aggregation and degranulation. As previously reported, arachidonic acid was found to induce by itself an aggregatory response, and in the pres-ence of cytochalasin B, a degranulation response from the neutrophils. The aggregatory property, but not the secretory activity of arachidonic acid, was shared by oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, linoelaidic acid, and lauric acid but not by elaidic acid, caproic acid, stearic acid, and arachidic acid. In addition, several free fatty acids (oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arach-idonic acid, and linoelaidic acid) were found to inhibit the aggregatory and secretory responses of the neutrophils to the addition of f-Met-Leu-Phe. Cap-roic acid and lauric acid were found to stimulate to a small extent the aggre-gatory response of the neutrophils to f-Met-Leu-Phe and to leave unaffected their secretory response. Elaidic acid, stearic acid, and arachidic acid, on the other hand, left both stimulated responses unaffected. These results demon-strate that at least two neutrophil functions can be modulated (both positively and negatively) by free fatty acids.

40|$|Recombinant human {{surfactant}} protein D (SP-D) {{expressed in}} Escherichia coli, {{consisting of the}} head and neck regions of the native molecule, bound to all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae that were tested, but the extent of binding varied between strains of differing capsular serotypes. The recombinant protein expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris did not bind. Full-length native SP-D aggregated pneumococci in a calcium-dependent manner that was inhibited by maltose acting as a competitive sugar. The ability of SP-D to modulate the uptake and killing of pneumococci by human neutrophils was also addressed. Neither recombinant truncated SP-D nor native full-length SP-D enhanced the killing of pneumococci by human <b>neutrophils.</b> <b>Aggregation</b> of pneumococci varied not only between strains of the same multilocus sequence type and different serotypes but also between strains of the same serotype. However, use of recombinant strains in which the serotype had been changed showed that the degree of aggregation was influenced by the capsular type. Indeed, a 19 F serotype strain which was not aggregated by SP-D did exhibit aggregation when the original isogenic strain was capsule switched to capsular serotype 3. However, although our results show that SP-D is capable of aggregating most pneumococci, no correlation between the degree of aggregation and the capsule or multilocus sequence type of the pneumococcus was clearly apparent. Therefore, although the capsule serotype is not the only determinant of aggregation by SP-D, the data presented here indicate that it does have a role to play...|$|R

Clinically, the patient had delayed umbilical cord detachment, omphalitis, impaired wound healing and persistent leucocytosis.

In vitro incubation of neutrophils with recombinant human interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) showed an increase in oxygen consumption, but {{no effect on the}} expression of the LeuCAMs, or the beta chain mRNA. In vivo treatment with IFN-gamma was started. The Fc gamma RI receptor appeared on the neutrophils, the LeuCAMs remained undetectable, while the neutrophil functions remained disturbed.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> is {{mediated}} by the 132 U 1 tIfl CD 11 b/CD 18, which has limited expression on the surface membrane of resting cells but is re-cruited from intracellular organelles after cell activa-tion. We have previously found that CD 11 b/CD 18 newly translocated to the plasma membrane does not con-tribute to adhesion but must be modified to be func-tional. Because <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) is accompanied by de novo phosphorylation ofthe CD 18 cytoplasmic tail, we sought to determine whether CD 11 b/CD 18 phos-phorylation is separately regulated in the different cellular compartments.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{interactions}} between eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and neutrophils were studied. It is shown that binding of EPO to neutrophils results {{on the one hand}} in reversible inhibition of EPO peroxidase activity and, on the other, in an increased <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> and neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cell monolayers. After prolonged periods of exposure to EPO, neutrophils also show a decreased ability to exclude the vital dye erythrosin B. The reversible inhibition of EPO activity may represent a means of keeping under control the oxidative potential of EPO, while the increased <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> and adherence to endothelial cells suggest that EPO may influence at least two key events of inflammation, that is, the margination of neutrophils and/or their accumulation in the inflammatory site...|$|E
40|$|Normal human {{neutrophils}} bound an as yet unclustered mAb designated BS- 1. The Ag immunoprecipitated with BS- 1 was blotted by CD 43 mAb (and vice versa), and {{is therefore}} identical to the large sialoglycoprotein. The CD 43 Ag expression on the neutrophil surface is decreased upon neutrophil activation with the chemoattractant FMLP or with PMA. This can be (at least partially) explained by the release of CD 43 + material with an altered electrophoretic mobility into the extracellular medium of the neutrophils upon activation. Cross-linking of the CD 43 Ag with BS- 1 also invoked neutrophil activation by itself: F(ab) 2 fragments of BS- 1 -induced <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation,</b> in contrast to F(ab) fragments. Neither respiratory burst activity nor a significant rise in intracellular Ca 2 + level or actin polymerization were observed. The transient <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> response was largely CD 18 dependent, especially in the initial phase of homotypic clustering. However, a significant CD 18 -independent mechanism contributed thereafter to the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation,</b> as was further substantiated {{by the use of}} cultured T (and EBV-transformed B) cell clones of a patient with a leukocyte adhesion deficiency.

40|$|Neutrophils are {{consistently}} associated with arterial thrombotic morbidity in human clinical studies but the causal {{basis for this}} association is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that neutrophils modulate platelet activation and thrombus formation in vivo in a cathepsin G-dependent manner. <b>Neutrophils</b> enhanced <b>aggregation</b> of human platelets in vitro in dose-dependent fashion and this effect was diminished by pharmacologic inhibition of cathepsin G activity and knockdown of cathepsin G expression. Tail bleeding time in the mouse was prolonged by a cathepsin G inhibitor and in cathepsin G knockout mice, and formation of neutrophil-platelet conjugates in blood that was shed from transected tails was reduced {{in the absence of}} cathepsin G. Bleeding time was highly correlated with blood neutrophil count in wildtype but not cathepsin G deficient mice. In the presence of elevated blood neutrophil counts, the anti-thrombotic effect of cathepsin G inhibition was greater than that of aspirin and additive to it when administered in combination. Both pharmacologic inhibition of cathepsin G and its congenital absence prolonged the time for platelet thrombus to form in ferric chloride-injured mouse mesenteric arterioles. In a vaso-occlusive model of ischemic stroke, inhibition of cathepsin G and its congenital absence improved cerebral blood flow, reduced histologic brain injury, and improved neurobehavioral outcome.

This investigation was designed to study the ultrastructural and morphometric changes in the lungs of neonatal rats following the intratracheal inoculation of meconium. Seven-day-old Fischer- 344 rats (n = 24) were randomly allocated in two groups. One group was intratracheally inoculated with saline solution and the second group received homologous meconium. Neonates were euthanatized at 1, 3 and 7 postinoculation days (PID) and lungs were examined by light and electron microscopy. Saline solution did not induce any ultrastructural changes in the lung. In contrast, meconium induced deciliation, recruitment of neutrophils and pulmonary alveolar macrophages to the bronchoalveolar space, intravascular sequestration of <b>neutrophils</b> and <b>aggregation</b> of platelets at PID 1 and 3. Other ultrastructural changes at PID 1 and 3 included interstitial edema and escape of red cells and fibrin into the alveolar space and interstitium.

40|$|Acetyl glyceryl ether phosphorylcholine (AGEPC) and {{leukotriene}} B 4 (LTB 4) induce concentration-dependent <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation.</b> On a molar basis, LTB 4 {{is approximately}} 10 to 100 times more potent than AGEPC.

LTB 4 -induced aggregation is not readily reduced by the above inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, coupled with selective ion gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, shows that AGEPC stimulates neutrophils to synthesize sufficient LTB 4 to account for the AGEPC response. In addition, the rate of LTB 4 biosynthesis in response to AGEPC correlates well with the rate of AGEPC- and/or LTB 4 -induced neutrophils aggregation, and desensitization experiments indicate that AGEPC and LTB 4 cross-desensitize.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{whereby the}} human neutrophil membrane heterodimer, CD 11 b/CD 18 (Mac- 1, Mo 1), mediates neutrophil adherence is not known. We studied {{the role of}} CD 11 b/CD 18 surface expression in the promotion of neutrophil adhesiveness. We found that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore (A 23187), and FMLP caused a three- to sevenfold increase in surface expression of both CD 11 b (alpha M) and CD 18 (beta) as assayed by binding of MAbs 60. 1 (anti-CD 11 b) and 60. 3 (anti-CD 18). Increased binding of MAbs was temporally associated with the promotion of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> and adherence to cultured endothelial monolayers. Pretreatment of neutrophils with the anion channel-blocking agent, DIDS (4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid), inhibited the increased surface expression of CD 11 b and CD 18 after stimulation by PMA, A 23187, or FMLP and resulted in nearly complete inhibition of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation.</b> However, pretreatment with DIDS did not diminish either PMA-, A 23187 -, or FMLP-stimulated neutrophil adherence to endothelial monolayers. We also observed that stimulation of granule-depleted neutrophil cytoplasts by PMA, A 23187, or FMLP induced aggregation and adherence to endothelial monolayers without increasing surface expression of CD 11 b or CD 18. We conclude that the increased surface expression of CD 11 b/CD 18 that occurs after stimulation is neither sufficient nor necessary for enhanced adherence to endothelium. Moreover, though both are CD 11 b/CD 18 -dependent, the mechanisms involved in <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> {{are different from those}} involved in neutrophil adherence to endothelium...|$|E

For comparison, we also studied {{the effect of the}} PAF antagonist on <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> in vitro and on acute inflammatory responses induced by intradermally (i. d.) injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS), PAF, bradykinin and zymosan-activated plasma. <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> was assessed photometrically. Haemorrhage, oedema formation, platelet deposition and neutrophil accumulation were quantified in rabbit skin by measuring the accumulation of i. v. injected 51 Cr-labelled red blood cells (RBC), 125 I-labelled human serum albumin, 111 In-labelled platelets and 111 In-labelled neutrophils respectively. UK- 74, 505 inhibited in vitro <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> induced by PAF but not by leukotriene B 4. When injected i. v. into rabbits UK- 74, 505 suppressed oedema formation in response to i. d. PAF for up to 4 [*]h but had no effect on oedema induced by bradykinin or zymosan-activated plasma. Oedema formation, but not neutrophil accumulation, produced during the RPA reaction was significantly inhibited by i. v. UK- 74, 505. The PAF antagonist also suppressed 111 In-platelet but not 111 In-neutrophil accumulation in response to i. d. LPS. UK- 74, 505 did not affect haemorrhage or oedema formation produced during the LPS-mediated LSR. The results demonstrate that PAF is an important mediator of oedema formation, but not neutrophil accumulation, in the immune-complex mediated RPA reaction in rabbit skin. PAF also appears to be required for platelet, but not neutrophil, accumulation in response to locally injected LPS. Our studies do not suggest a role for PAF in the LPS-mediated LSR...|$|E

A Coulter counter method was employed {{for the detection}} of cell aggregation. Aggregated IgG, ovalbumin-anti-ovalbumin (OV anti-OV) immune complexes (both insoluble and soluble) and opsonized latex particles induced a significant degree of PMN aggregation which was detectable as early as 2 min after exposure of PMN to these stimuli. This aggregation was dependent on divalent cations (Ca++, Mg++). The same phagocytic stimuli furthermore significantly increased adherence of PMN to cultured human EC and serum-coated plastic. Controls consisting of native IgG, and OV anti-OV complexes prepared from Fab') 2 antibody failed to induce either aggregation or increased adherence of PMN.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analysis of the}} effects of nonlinear flow in a cone-plate viscometer. The analysis predicts that flow in the viscometer is a function of two parameters, the Reynolds number and the cone angle. Nonlinear flow occurs at high shear rates and causes spatial variations in wall shear stress, collision frequency, interparticle forces and attachment times within the viscometer. We examined the effect of these features on cellular adhesion kinetics. Based on recent data (Taylor, A. D., S. Neelamegham, J. D. Hellums, et al. 1996. Biophys. J. 71 : 3488 - 3500), we modeled <b>neutrophil</b> homotypic <b>aggregation</b> as a process that is integrin-limited at low shear and selectin-limited at high shear. Our calculations suggest that selectin and integrin on-rates lie in the order of 10 (- 2) - 10 (- 4) /s. They also indicate that secondary flow causes positional variations in adhesion efficiency in the viscometer, and that the overall efficiency is dependent not only on the shear rate, but also the sample volume and the cone angle. Experiments performed with isolated neutrophils confirmed these predictions. In these experiments, enhancing secondary flow by increasing the sample volume from 100 to 1000 microl at 1500 /s for a 2 degrees cone caused up to an approximately 45 % drop in adhesion efficiency. Our results suggest that secondary flow may significantly influence cellular aggregation, platelet activation, and endothelial cell mechanotransduction measurements made in the viscometer over the range of conditions applied in typical biological studies...|$|R

Human plasma kallikrein {{has been shown to}} stimulate <b>neutrophil</b> chemotaxis, <b>aggregation,</b> and oxygen consumption. Therefore, the ability of kallikrein to release neutrophil elastase was investigated. Neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation, and elastase release was measured by both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and an enzymatic assay using t-butoxy-carbonyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-amino methyl coumarin as the substrate. Kallikrein, 0. 1 - 1. 0 U/ml, (0. 045 - 0. 45 microM), was incubated with neutrophils that were preincubated with cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/ml). The release of elastase was found to be proportional to the kallikrein concentration. Kallikrein released a maximum of 34 % of the total elastase content, as measured by solubilizing the neutrophils in the nonionic detergent Triton X- 100. A series of experiments was carried out to determine if kallikrein was a major enzyme involved in neutrophil elastase release during blood coagulation. When 10 million neutrophils were incubated in 1 ml of normal plasma in the presence of 30 mM CaCl 2 for 90 min, 2. 75 micrograms of elastase was released. In contrast, neutrophils incubated in prekallikrein-deficient or Factor XII-deficient plasma released {{less than half of the}} elastase, as compared with normal plasma. The addition of purified prekallikrein to prekallikrein-deficient plasma restored neutrophil elastase release to normal levels. Moreover, release of elastase was enhanced in plasma deficient in C 1 -inhibitor, the major plasma inhibitor of kallikrein. This release was not dependent upon further steps in the coagulation pathway, or on C 5 a, since levels of elastase, released in Factor XI- or C 5 -deficient plasma, were similar to that in normal plasma, and an antibody to C 5 failed to inhibit elastase release. These data suggest that kallikrein may be a major enzyme responsible for the release of elastase during blood coagulation...|$|R

The results indicated that both blood- and plasma-derived sera induced similar increases in <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation.</b> Both sera also induced neutrophil adherence to cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial monolayer. The adherence increased in a time-dependent manner, producing little change after 5 minutes, and reached maximal response at 60 minutes. Full potency of the neutrophil adherence was evident with serum samples obtained after clotting time of 20 minutes but not at 5 minutes clotting time. The adherence-inducing activity of serum was gradually lost after storage at - 20 C and was abolished by 100 C treatment for 2 minutes. In contrast, heating serum to 56 C for 30 minutes did not alter the adherence-inducing activity. Both ether and aqueous fractions obtained after ether extraction of serum possessed adherence-promoting activities, indicating that multiple factors (both lipid and water soluble) were involved. Pretreatment of the endothelium with serum resulted in increased endothelial adhesiveness, but the serum pretreatment failed to induce adhesiveness to subendothelial matrix, indicating that endothelial cells play an active role in acquiring the adhesive property. Serum obtained from thrombin-generated whole blood also resulted in a modest degree of neutrophil superoxide anion generation, but this did not occur with plasma-derived serum. The results indicate that serum factors obtained by clotting blood with thrombin induce <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> and neutrophil adherence to the endothelium as well as superoxide production.

40|$|Abstract—Affinity {{regulation}} of integrin function {{plays an important}} role during both leukocyte–endothelial and leu-kocyte–leukocyte interactions. We compared the roles of Mn 2 + (Manganese) and Gd 3 + (Gadolinium) in regulating leukocyte CD 18 -integrin function. We observed that: (i) Both cations prolonged <b>neutrophil</b> homotypic <b>aggregation</b> follow-ing chemoattractant IL- 8 stimulation, with Gd 3 + being effective at doses two orders of magnitude (10 lM range) lower that Mn 2 +. (ii) While both Gd 3 + and Mn 2 + mediate homotypic cell aggregation via L-selectin and CD 18 integrins, their effects on the integrin subunits, LFA- 1 (CD 11 a/CD 18) and Mac- 1 (CD 11 b/CD 18), was different. Gd 3 + altered both LFA- 1 and Mac- 1 function, while the dominant effect of Mn 2 + was on Mac- 1. This effect of Gd 3 + on LFA- 1 function was confirmed in cell-free studies that measured the binding of recombinant ICAM- 1 to LFA- 1 immobilized on beads. (iii) Both ions augmented the binding of 327 C, an antibody that recognizes active CD 18 on human neutrophils, both in the presence and absence of exogenous IL- 8. The effects of Mn 2 + was more pronounced since it caused 3 – 4 -fold increase in mAb 327 C binding to neutrophils compared to Gd 3 + which increased antibody binding by only ~ 80 %. 327 C binding was partially reduced by Ca 2 +. Further, 327 C binding induced by Mn 2 + did not correlate tightly with cell adhesion function. (iv) In studies that monitored intracellu-lar Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i), the addition of Mn 2 + but not Gd 3 + to neutrophils altered [Ca 2 +]i levels. Overall, while both Gd 3 + and Mn 2 + stabilize high affinity CD 18 mediated cell adhe-sion, Gd 3 + affects integrin conformation while Mn 2 + may also trigger other effects...|$|R

We examined the role of P-selectin in PMN-mediated injury after reperfusion of the rabbit ear. The ear was partially amputated, and then reattached leaving the central artery and vein intact. To induce ischemia the central artery was then occluded. Treatment was at reperfusion with either saline or one of two murine P-selectin mAbs, designated PB 1. 3 and PNB 1. 6 mAb PB 1. 3 cross-reacts with rabbit P-selectin and prevents histamine-induced leukocyte rolling, whereas PNB 1. 6 does not. Using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase system P-selectin was detected in the ischemic ear, {{but not in the}} nonischemic ear. Ear volume increased to 5. 3 times baseline in the saline-treated animals (n = 8), 6. 6 times baseline in the nonblocking mAb PNB 1. 6 -treated animals (n = 2), and 3. 7 times baseline in the blocking mAb PB 1. 3 -treated animals (n = 8). Estimated tissue necrosis of the combined saline- and PNB 1. 6 -treated animals was 46 vs. 2. 7 % for the mAb PB 1. 3 -treated animals.

Using purified human blood neutrophils we confirmed the expression of CD 13 on neutrophils and its up-regulation by pro-inflammatory agonists. However, using the anti-CD 13 monoclonal antibody WM- 15 and the aminopeptidase enzymatic inhibitor bestatin we were unable to demonstrate any direct involvement of CD 13 in neutrophil polarisation or chemotaxis. In contrast, IL- 8 -mediated neutrophil migration in type I collagen gels was significantly impaired by the anti-CD 13 monoclonal antibodies WM- 15 and MY 7. Notably, these antibodies also induced significant homotypic <b>aggregation</b> of <b>neutrophils,</b> which was dependent on CD 13 cross-linking and was attenuated by phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase 1 / 2 inhibition.

In addition, small arteries revealed subtle <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation,</b> and margination along vascular endothelium, but no definitive vasculitis. The pathology of ANCA associated vasculitides results from activated neutrophils by ANCA and subsequent activation of the alternative complement cascade with endothelial injury, <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> and margination. Our findings, after the correlation between lung biopsy and renal biopsy, imply that the top differential diagnosis in the lung biopsy should be microscopic polyangiitis when diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and hemosiderosis are present in this ANCA-positive patient. 1...|$|E
40|$|Human {{neutrophils}} aggregate after stimulation {{with various}} stimuli; this response is completely absent in neutrophils from patients with {{leukocyte adhesion deficiency}} (LAD). To investigate the cellular requirements of this process a method was used in which neutrophils are separately loaded with hydroethidine (HE) and sulfofluorescein (SFDA), to give them either red fluorescence or green fluorescence. After mixing HE- and SFDA-labeled cells in a ratio of 1 : 1, the number of double-colored aggregates formed after activation was determined by analysis on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. In this way, essential information is obtained when cells of different origin are used. The formation of aggregates between neutrophils of an LAD patient and control neutrophils was thus quantified. Because <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> is dependent mostly {{on the presence of}} complement receptor type 3 (CR 3), which is not present on LAD neutrophils, this result revealed the presence of a counter-structure for CR 3 on LAD neutrophils (and hence on normal human neutrophils). In addition to the presence of these proteins on the cell surface, aggregation required continuous cell triggering as indicated by the transient aggregation induced by short-term activation of protein kinase C. This phenomenon was substantiated by the fact that energy depletion caused profound disaggregation. The present study reveals that <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> is a well-controlled process, which needs constant activation of CR 3 for a stable interaction with a constitutively expressed counter-structur...|$|E
40|$|Objective. ONO- 4057 is a {{specific}} leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) receptor antagonist which inhibits human <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation,</b> chemotaxis and degranulation induced by LTB 4.

40|$|Bloodsucking {{arthropods}} are a {{rich source}} of salivary molecules (sialogenins) which inhibit platelet <b>aggregation,</b> <b>neutrophil</b> function and angiogenesis. Here we review the literature on salivary disintegrins and their targets. Disintegrins were first discovered in snake venoms, and were instrumental in our understanding of integrin function and also for the development of anti-thrombotic drugs. In hematophagous animals, most disintegrins described so far have been discovered in the salivary gland of ticks and leeches. A limited number have also been found in hookworms and horseflies, and none identified in mosquitoes or sand flies. The vast majority of salivary disintegrins reported display a RGD motif and were described as platelet aggregation inhibitors, and few others as negative modulator of neutrophil or endothelial cell functions. This notably low number of reported disintegrins is certainly an underestimation of the actual complexity of this family of proteins in hematophagous secretions. Therefore an algorithm was created in order to identify the tripeptide motifs RGD, KGD, VGD, MLD, KTS, RTS, WGD, or RED (flanked by cysteines) in sialogenins deposited in GenBank database. The search included sequences from various blood-sucking animals such as ticks (e. g., Ixodes sp., Argas sp., Rhipicephalus sp., Amblyomma sp.), tabanids (e. g., Tabanus sp.), bugs (e. g., Triatoma sp., Rhodnius prolixus), mosquitoes (e. g., Anopheles sp., Aedes sp., Culex sp.), sand flies (e. g., Lutzomyia sp., Phlebotomus sp.), leeches (e. g., Macrobdella sp., Placobdella sp.) and worms (e. g., Ancylostoma sp.). This approach allowed the identification of a remarkably high number of novel putative sialogenins with tripeptide motifs typical of disintegrins (> 450 sequences) whose biological activity remains to be verified. This database is accessible online as a hyperlinked worksheet and displays biochemical, taxonomic, and gene ontology aspects for each putative disintegrin. It is also freely available for download (right click with the mouse) at links [URL] (web version) and [URL] (stand alone version) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hypoxia {{following}} {{traumatic brain}} injury (TBI) is a severe insult shown to exacerbate the pathophysiology, resulting in worse outcome. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of a hypoxic insult in a focal TBI model by monitoring brain edema, lesion volume, serum biomarker levels, immune cell infiltration, as well as the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -alpha (HIF- 1 α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Material and methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 73, including sham and naïve) were used. The rats were intubated and mechanically ventilated. A controlled cortical impact device created a 3 millimeter deep lesion in the right parietal hemisphere. Post injury, rats inhaled either normoxic (22 % O 2) or hypoxic (11 % O 2) mixtures for 30 minutes. The rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days post-injury. Serum was collected for S 100 B measurements using ELISA. Ex-vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to determine lesion size and edema volume. Immunofluorescence was employed to analyze neuronal death, changes in cerebral macrophage- and neutrophil infiltration, microglia proliferation, apoptosis, complement activation (C 5 b 9), IgG extravasation, HIF- 1 α and VEGF. Results: The hypoxic group had significantly increased blood levels of lactate and decreased pO 2 (p< 0. 0001, respectively). On MRI post-traumatic hypoxia resulted in larger lesion areas (p= 0. 0173) and NeuN staining revealed greater neuronal loss (p= 0. 0253). HIF- 1 α and VEGF expression was significantly increased in normoxic but not in hypoxic animals (p< 0. 05, respectively). A trend was seen for serum levels of S 100 B to be higher in the hypoxic group at 1 day after trauma (p= 0. 0868). No differences were observed between the groups in cytotoxic and vascular edema, IgG extravasation, <b>neutrophils</b> and macrophage <b>aggregation,</b> microglia proliferation or C 5 b 9 expression. Conclusion: Hypoxia following focal TBI exacerbated the lesion size and neuronal loss. Moreover, there was a tendency to higher levels of S 100 B in the hypoxic group early after injury, indicating a potential validity as a biomarker of injury severity. In the normoxic group, the expression of HIF- 1 α and VEGF was found elevated, possibly indicative of neuro-protective responses occurring in this less severely injured group. Further studies are warranted to better define the pathophysiology of post-TBI hypoxia...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic formyl methionyl {{chemotactic}} peptides {{induce the}} various manifestations ofthe respiratory burst: increased 02 consumption, {{activation of the}} hexose mono-phosphate shunt, and increased production of superoxide (02 -) and H 202. They do soalone but to a much greater extent when {{in the presence of}} cytochalasin B. Superoxidegeneration by the chemotactic peptides in the presence of cytochalasin B shows thesame relationship of structure to activity as does the stimulation of chemokinesis andchemotaxis, granule enzyme secretion, and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> by these sameagents. Carbobenzoxy-phenylalanyl-methionine, CBZ-Phe-Met, competitively inhibitsthe induced stimulation of locomotion, granule enzyme secretion, and neutrophilaggregation caused by the synthetic peptides. It also is a competitive inhibitor of O 2 - generation by the same peptides. The structure-activity and the competitive inhibitor studies lead to the conclusion that in polymorphonuclear leukocytes the chemotactic peptides induce superoxide formation and presumably the other manifestations of the respiratory burst by interacting with the same membrane receptor responsible for the stimulation of chemokinesis, chemotaxis, granule enzyme secretion, and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation.</b> The effectiveness of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, F-Met-Leu-Phe, in generating 02 - is greatly reduced but not abolished by removing calcium from the external medium. The calcium ionophore A 23187 induces 02 - generation that requires external calcium and is greatly enhanced by cytochalasin B. From these findings we hypothesize that the proximate cause of the induction of 02 - formation and other manifestations of the respiratory burst by the chemotactic peptides is the influx into the neutrophil of Ca 2 + and/or possibly Na+ previously shown to be induced by the peptides...|$|E
40|$|Background Experimental {{studies in}} vitro suggest that neu-trophils can {{modulate}} platelet function and vasomotor re-sponses. In the present study, the interactions among neutro-phils, platelets, and arterial responses to injury in vivo were assessed. Methods and Results The acute thrombotic and vasomotor responses of porcine carotid arteries to balloon injury in vivo were evaluated in {{three groups of}} animals: neutropenic pigs treated (n = 11) or not treated (n = 12) with aspirin and healthy untreated control pigs (n = 15). Neutropenia was achieved by treatment with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg, 4 days before the experiment), which decreased circulating leukocyte count by 92 % and almost abolished <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine without affecting blood plate-let count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, or whol...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophils are {{essential}} for innate immunity and inflammation and many neutrophil functions are β 2 integrin-dependent. Integrins can extend (E(+)) and acquire a high-affinity conformation with an 'open' headpiece (H(+)). The canonical switchblade model of integrin activation proposes that the E(+) conformation precedes H(+), and the two {{are believed to be}} structurally linked. Here we show, using high-resolution quantitative dynamic footprinting (qDF) microscopy combined with a homogenous conformation-reporter binding assay in a microfluidic device, that a substantial fraction of β 2 integrins on human neutrophils acquire an unexpected E(-) H(+) conformation. E(-) H(+) β 2 integrins bind intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) in cis, which inhibits leukocyte adhesion in vitro and in vivo. This endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanism inhibits <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation,</b> accumulation and inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Lymphokine (LK) preparations, {{containing}} macrophage aggregating activity, also aggregated purified neutrophils, but not blood mononuclear {{cells or}} erythrocytes. Additionally, aggregation of blood leucocytes (containing 50 %- 70 % neutrophils), from sensitized guinea-pigs, could be induced by culture of these cells with antigen, {{in a direct}} aggregation assay. Optimal measurement of direct aggregation was at 6 hr, whereas soluble neutrophil aggregating activity was produced by blood mononuclear cell cultures continuously for at least 24 hr. Sephadex fractionation showed that although macrophage and neutrophil aggregating activity was associated with molecules of mean mol. wt 50, 000, neutrophils were also aggregated by material in the 90, 000 - 225, 000 mol. wt range. LK-induced <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation,</b> like macrophage aggregation, was inhibited by colchicine, prostaglandin E 2, chlorpromazine and the glycolytic inhibitors 2 -deoxyglucose and iodoacetate...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} alpha 1 -acid {{glycoprotein}} (AAG), a naturally occurring {{human plasma protein}} and acute phase reactant of uncertain biological function, inhibits human <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> and superoxide anion generation induced {{by a variety of}} stimuli including zymosan treated serum, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and phorbol myristate acetate. Inhibition was transient, directly proportional to the glycoprotein concentration and inversely proportional to the concentration of the stimulus added. Desialyzation, resulting in the removal of {{a substantial portion of the}} molecule's negative charge, did not alter the effectiveness of AAG. Removal of the penultimate galactose residues from desialyzed AAG resulted in a slight but significant reversal of inhibition, suggesting that the heteropolysaccharide units of AAG may be important for inhibition of cellular function. We therefore suggest that the acute phase glycoprotein AAG may be a significant modulator of neutrophil as well as platelet and lymphocyte function during inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Tissue injury {{resulting}} from ischemia and reperfusion {{forms the basis}} of several important disorders including myocardial infarction, stroke, and circulatory shock. To examine the role of neutrophils in this process and {{to determine the extent}} to which injury is a consequence of reperfusion, we utilized the monoclonal antibody 60. 3, directed to CD 18, the human leukocyte adherence glycoprotein, to block intravascular <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> and neutrophil adherence to endothelium in a rabbit model of tissue ischemia and reperfusion. Antibody treatment either before ischemia or after ischemia, but prior to reperfusion, resulted in the same degree of significant protection against endothelial, microvascular, and tissue injury. We conclude that neutrophils and increased neutrophil adhesiveness are important in the development of microvascular and tissue injury after ischemia and reperfusion and that under these circumstances, injury is primarily a consequence of reperfusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hyaluronate}} on rabbit neutrophil adhesion were studied {{using a variety}} of techniques. Exogenous hyaluronate inhibited <b>neutrophil</b> <b>aggregation</b> under conditions of both turbulent flow and constant shear rate. Hyaluronate also inhibited neutrophil adhesion to glass. Inhibition was dose-dependent above 100 fig ml" 1 and a minimum molecular weight for hyalur-onate of 1 x 10 * was required. These effects were not simply the result of increased bulk viscosity of the hyaluronate-containing medium, nor did they appear to be mediated by puta-tive cell-surface receptor mechanisms. Instead, physical factors such as steric hindrance and/or changes in the interfacial free-energy exchange at the cell surface due to the unusual hydro-dynamic properties of the hyaluronate molecule were considered to be more important. Since neutrophil migration in vivo occurs through hyaluronate-rich connective tissue matrices, the relevance of these findings for processes such as inflammation and wound healing is clear...|$|E
