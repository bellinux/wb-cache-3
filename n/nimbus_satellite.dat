50|$|In 1961 Huston {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} transfer to the newly opened Goddard Space Flight Center {{to work on the}} Nimbus program. As deputy project manager he served as Mission Director for the successful launches of Nimbus 1, launched August 28,1964, Nimbus 2 on May 15, 1966, Nimbus 3 on May 14, 1969, Nimbus 4 on April 8, 1970, Landsat 1 on July 23, 1972, and Nimbus 5 on December 11, 1972. A <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellite</b> launched in 1968 failed to reach orbit.|$|E
50|$|The first {{total failure}} was {{the launch of}} a Nimbus weather {{satellite}} on May 5, 1968 when the Thor veered off course shortly {{after the start of}} the pitch and roll program and was destroyed by Range Safety. This mission was noteworthy because the satellite carried a pair of isotopic power generators known as SNAP (Systems For Nuclear Auxiliary Power). As the possibility of a launch failure had been considered during their design, the power generators were equipped with a very sturdy casing to prevent their radioactive contents from escaping into the environment. After the destruction of Nimbus-B's launch vehicle, Navy crews began an extensive search for the SNAP generators. On September 27, the <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellite</b> was located in 300 feet of water near the Santa Barbara Islands with the SNAP units nearby. They were successfully fished out of the ocean two weeks later and their protective casings found to be intact. The fuel inside them was taken out and reused in a subsequent Nimbus launch.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites</b> were second-generation U.S. robotic {{spacecraft}} {{used for}} meteorological research and development. The spacecraft {{were designed to}} serve as stabilized, Earth-oriented platforms for the testing of advanced systems to sense and collect atmospheric science data. Seven Nimbus spacecraft have been launched into near-polar, sun-synchronous orbits beginning with Nimbus 1 on August 28, 1964. On board the <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites</b> are various instrumentation for imaging, sounding, and other studies in different spectral regions. The <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites</b> were launched aboard Thor-Agena rockets (Nimbus 1-4) and Delta rockets (Nimbus 5-7).|$|R

50|$|Soon after {{satellites}} {{were first}} used for observing the atmosphere, MW radiometers {{became part of}} their instrumentation. In 1962 the Mariner-2 mission was launched by NASA in order to investigate the surface of Venus including a radiometer for water vapor and temperature observations. In following years {{a wide variety of}} microwave radiometers were tested on satellites. The launch of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer in 1978 became an important milestone in the history of radiometry. It was the first time a conically scanning radiometer was used in space; it was brought in space on board of the NASA <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellite.</b> The launch of this mission gave the opportunity to image the Earth at a constant angle of incidence that is important as surface emissivity is angular dependent. In the beginning of 1980, new multi-frequency, dual-polarization radiometric instruments were developed. Two spacecraft were launched which carried instruments of this type: Nimbus-7 and Seasat. The Nimbus-7 mission results allowed to globally monitor the state of ocean surface as well as surface covered by snow and glaciers. Today, microwave instruments like the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit AMSU, Special Sensor Microwave Imager / Sounder SSMIS are widely used not only onboard different satellites.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of its launch, the idea that {{intangible}} properties such as air pressure could be observed using a satellite orbiting hundreds of miles above the Earth was revolutionary. With each Nimbus mission, scientists broadened their ability to collect atmospheric characteristics that improved weather forecasting, including ocean and air temperatures, air pressure, and cloudiness. Beginning with the <b>Nimbus</b> 3 <b>satellite</b> in 1969, temperature information through the atmospheric column began to be retrieved by satellites from the eastern Atlantic and most of the Pacific Ocean, which led to significant forecast improvements. The global coverage provided by <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites</b> made accurate 3-5 day forecasts possible for the first time.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ability of}} the <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites</b> to detect {{electromagnetic}} energy in multiple wavelengths (multi-spectral data), in particular the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, {{made it possible for}} scientists to look into the atmosphere and tell the difference between water vapor and liquid water in clouds. In addition, they were able to measure atmospheric temperature even in the presence of clouds, a capability that allowed scientists to take the temperature in the [...] "warm core" [...] of hurricanes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites</b> {{collected}} orbital data on {{the extent}} of the polar caps in the mid-1960s, recorded in the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum. These first global snapshots of Earth's icecaps provide invaluable reference points for climate change studies. During a narrowing window of opportunity for data archaeology, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NDISC) and NASA were able to recover data that allowed the reconstruction of high-resolution Nimbus 2 images from 1966 showing the entire Arctic and Antarctic ice caps.|$|R

The LIMS instrument is a six channel, limb scanning, thermal radiometer which uses HgCdTe detectors, cooled to approximately 64 K. Measurements include ozone, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, and nitric acid. The ozone and nitric acid channels are centered at approximately 9. 6 microns and 11. 3 microns, respectively. Results from the channels are described with an emphasis on data validation. The O 3 and HNO 3 channels have demonstrated high measurement precision...|$|E

50|$|Even {{before the}} <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites</b> began {{collecting}} their observations of Earth's ozone layer, scientists had {{some understanding of}} the processes that maintained or destroyed it. They were pretty sure they understood how the layer formed, and they knew from laboratory experiments that halogens could destroy ozone. Finally, weather balloons had revealed that the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere changed over time, and scientists suspected weather phenomena or seasonal change were responsible. But how all of these pieces of information worked together {{on a global scale}} was still unclear.|$|R

Good correlation between LIMS and SBUV observations is noted in the ozone layer bounded by pressures of 31. 2 - 15. 6 mb; absolute differences are generally less than 10 percent, with similar zonal variations. Above 35 km SAGE values are systematically larger than SBUV or LIMS. The differences generally increase with height and are largest in the tropics. Finally, excellent agreement is noted to exist among the three data sets between 10 and 35 km of altitude with respect to the latitude dependence of the ozone profiles...|$|E
40|$|A {{pilot study}} of 60 lakes in Minnesota shows that LANDSAT data {{correlate}} {{very well with}} the Carlson trophic state index which is derived from measurements in the field. <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellite</b> data reveal improvement in water quality in Lake Superior since the dumping of taconite tailings stopped in 1980. A feasibility study of using color infrared photography as a near real time tool for soil and crop management in corn and soybean areas of the state generated strong interest from farmers and agribusiness firms. The state geological survey had success in the use and applications of LANDSAT images. Subtleties of changes in vegetation, soil, and topography are such that ground water presence and depth to water table are nearly always impossible to qualify except for broad scale applications. Bedrock and structural differences as shown in lineaments offer great potential for resolution of some kinds of geologic studies. A synergistic concept {{is to be used}} to search for mineral resources in the northeastern part of the state...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} the Pilot Climate Data System (PCDS) in {{examining}} the influences of short-period solar flux variations on the middle atmosphere was demonstrated. Several <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellite</b> data sets proposed for the study exist in the PCDS. Planned for retrieval through the PCDS are ozone mixing ratios and cumulative ozone profiles available from the Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer on Nimbus- 4. Also to be accessed are Nimbus- 7 data sets that will provide ozone and nitrogen dioxide mixing ratios, temperature profiles from the Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere, and ozone mixing ratio profiles from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer. Bypassing the time-consuming process of reading raw data tapes, the researchers plan to transfer the PCDS processed data to an IBM PC at Iowa State University. The IBM PC will serve as an intermediate vehicle for transferring the data to the NOAA CYBER 840 at Boulder, Colorado, where research will continue on both an eight-layer radiative-photochemical numerical model and on a nonlinear dynamical model. in this research are the FGGE and ERB data sets. These relevant data sets also reside in the PCDS. Problems associated with remote access to the PCDS were discussed in regard to all the PCDS data sets...|$|E

The satellites tested the first technology that allowed satellites to locate weather-observation stations set up in remote locations and to command the stations to transmit their data back to the satellite. The most famous demonstration of the new technology was through the record-breaking flight of British aviator Sheila Scott, who tested the Nimbus navigation and locator communication system when she made the first-ever solo flight over the North Pole in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Over a 20-year {{period from}} {{the launch of}} the first <b>satellite,</b> the <b>Nimbus</b> series of {{missions}} was the United States' primary research and development platform for satellite remote-sensing of the Earth. The seven <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellites,</b> launched over a fourteen-year period, shared their space-based observations of the planet for thirty years. NASA transferred the technology tested and refined by the Nimbus missions to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for its operational satellite instruments. The technology and lessons learned from the Nimbus missions are the heritage of most of the Earth-observing satellites NASA and NOAA have launched over the past three decades.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation is relatively well understood, {{the problem of how}} the equatorially confined quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) wave forcing can induce a signal in the extratropics of comparable or larger magnitude remains unsolved. A simple mechanistic model is constructed to provide a quantitative test of the hypothesis that {{the phenomenon}} of extratropical QBO is mainly caused by an anomalous seasonal circulation induced by an anomalous Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux divergence. The anomaly in E-P flux divergence may be caused in turn by the relative poleward and downward shift of the region of irreversible mixing (breaking) of the extratropical planetary waves during the easterly phase of the equatorial QBO as compared to its westerly phase. The hemispheric nature of the anomaly wave forcing in solstice seasons (viz., no wave breaking in the summer hemisphere) induces a global circulation anomaly that projects predominantly into the first few zonal Hough modes of Plumb. Such a global QBO circulation pattern, although difficult to measure directly, is reflected in the distribution of stratospheric tracers transported by it. Our model produces a global pattern of QBO anomaly in column ozone that appears to account for much of the unfiltered interannual variability in the column ozone observed by the total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) instrument aboard the <b>Nimbus</b> <b>satellite.</b> Furthermore, the model produces the characteristic spectrum of the observation with peaks at periods of 20 and 30 months...|$|E

50|$|Among {{the most}} serendipitous discoveries that the Nimbus {{missions}} made possible {{was that of}} a gaping hole in the sea ice around Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere winters of 1974-76. In a phenomenon that has not been observed since, an enormous, ice-free patch of water, called a polynya, developed {{three years in a row}} in the seasonal ice that encases Antarctica each winter. Located in the Weddell Sea, each year the polynya vanished with the summer melt, but returned the following year. The open patch of water may have influenced ocean temperatures as far down as 2,500 meters and influenced ocean circulation over a wide area.
