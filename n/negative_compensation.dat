40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> shocks on individual performance over time. To do so, performance data over a two year time period were obtained for individuals who remained with their organization after experiencing a reduction in compensation. Using both equity theory and the unfolding model of turnover as theoretical perspectives, the {{study examines}} whether {{the magnitude of the}} shock matters, whether the individual 2 ̆ 7 s pay level affects their reaction to a negative shock, and whether or not the impact of a <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> shock dissipates over time. Additionally, this study proposes an extension to the unfolding model of turnover by suggesting that a logical outcome in response to a negative shock may be to stay with an organization but to reduce one 2 ̆ 7 s performance in response to a dissatisfying situation. Based on equity theory, it was predicted that individuals would decrease their performance (inputs) in response to a decrease in compensation (outputs). To examine these questions, the study used an interrupted time series with a nonequivalent no-treatment control group method of design. Data on 292 individuals were analyzed. The findings were contrary to expectations in that negative compensations shocks caused performance to increase rather than decrease. The contradictory findings {{may be due to the}} fact that pay was highly linked to individual performance for the individuals participating in this study. Some of the study 2 ̆ 7 s findings do show consistency with expectations. First, the results show that in response to a <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> shock, individuals at high pay levels change their performance less than individuals at lower pay levels. Thus, high pay seems to be an insulating factor as it relates to <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> shocks. Second, the effects of <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> shocks on performance tend to dissipate time. Third, the study shows that the magnitude of the shock matters such that the larger the shock, the larger the resulting performance impact. The practical implications of these findings provide important new insights into contingencies that may affect the outcomes of pay for performance programs, particularly in the case of individuals whose performance in tightly linked to their compensation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new {{category}} of the compensatory eyecup movement is found in crayfish. The compensatory rotation of the eyecup around its longitudinal axis is induced by geotactic and/or optokinetic stimuli. Geotactically controlled compensation is mediated through the statocyst, and the compensatory process in full 3600 turn {{of the body is}} characterized by four distinct consecuitive phases: 1) positive compensation of high gain, 2) null compen-sation, 3) <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> for recovery, and 4) positive compensation of low gain. A large hysteresis is also observed. The eyecup will take quite different positions at the same body position depending on the direction of approach. In ordinary condition, the geotactic and optokinetic factors are found to operate synergetically to maintain the dorsoventral axis of the receptive visual surface parallel to the gravitational vertical. The gains of the two systems are separately measured experimentally as well as the gains in synergetic and antagonistic cases. A model of control system is proposed to describe the contribution of the two systems. The model well predicts the responses measured in the present experiment...|$|E

It has been possible to resolve disparate conformational families but not unique geometries within each, and drastic peak broadening has been the bane of protein analyses by chromatography, electrophoresis, and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The new differential or field asymmetric waveform IMS (FAIMS) approach using hydrogen-rich gases was recently found to separate conformers of a small protein ubiquitin with the same peak width and resolving power up to similar to 400 as for peptides. The present work explores the reach of this approach for larger proteins, exemplified by cytochrome c and myoglobin. Resolution similar to that for ubiquitin was largely achieved with longer separations, while the onset of peak broadening and coalescence with shorter separations suggests the limitation of the present technique to proteins under similar to 20 kDa. This capability may enable one to distinguish whole proteins with differing residue sequences or localizations of post-translational modifications. Small features at <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> voltages that markedly grow from cytochrome c to myoglobin indicate the dipole alignment of rare conformers in accord with theory, further supporting the concept of pendular macroions in FAIMS.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of wireless communication system {{has led to}} pressing need for highly linear amplifier design and implementation as amplifier {{is one of the}} most critical devices in transmit and receive chain.

One of the techniques is the <b>negative</b> impedance <b>compensation.</b> The design results showed that high gain, good linearity and wider bandwidth can be achieved by using the novel compensation method. However, as some kind of feedback can be introduced when applying the <b>negative</b> impedance <b>compensation,</b> the stability of the whole system should be investigated carefully.

40|$|Volatilities implied from {{interest}} rate swaptions {{are used to}} assess the size and the sign of the compensation for volatility risk, for dollar, euro and pound rates at a daily frequency, between October 1998 and August 2006. The measurement of the volatility risk premium rests on a simple model according to which variance forecasts are generated under the objective probability measure. Results show that especially between September 2001 and mid- 2003 dollar implieds were embodying a large - negative - compensation for volatility risk, a component which was smaller in absolute terms - but not relative {{to the level of the}} respective implied volatilities - for the other two currencies. While the <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> for volatility risk is in line with previous studies focusing on other asset classes, we also document that it exhibits a term structure, more evident for dollar and euro rates than for pound rates. The volatility risk premium is strongly changing through time but much less than implied volatilities. Estimates of risk aversion based on the physical skewness and kurtosis of {{interest rate}} changes suggest that (minus) the volatility risk premium can almost directly be read as risk aversion, as its proportionality with such risk aversion measure is about 0. 8. Also, compensation for volatility risk is positively related to expected volatility, although the relation is not completely linear. Daily compensation for volatility risk is influenced, as expected, by the level of the short term rate and its volatility as well as by a small but robust number of macroeconomic surprises. The latter induce more sizeable changes on compensation for volatility risk of dollar rates than of euro or pound rates.

40|$|In {{the last}} {{one and a half}} decades, the {{generalization}} of high throughput methods in molecular biology has led to the generation of vast amounts of datasets that unraveled the unfathomed complexity of the cell regulatory mechanisms. The recently published results of the ENCODE project (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012) demonstrated the extend of these in the human genome and certainly more regulation mechanisms will be discovered in the future. Already, this complexity within a single cell - without taking into account cell-cell interaction or micro-environment influences - cannot be abstracted by the human mind. However, understanding it is the key to devise adapted treatments to genetic diseases or disorders, among which is cancer. In mathematics, such complex problems are addressed using methods that reduce their complexity, {{so that they can be}} modeled in a solvable manner. In biology, it led researchers to develop the concept of systems biology as a mean to abstract the complexity of the cell regulatory network. To date, most of the published studies using high throughput technologies only focus on one kind of regulatory mechanism and hence cannot be used as such to investigate the interactions between these. Moreover, distinguishing causative from confounding factors within such studies is difficult. These were my original motivations to develop analytical and statistical methods that control for confounding factors effects and allow the integrative and comparative analysis of different kinds of datasets. In fine, three different tools were developed to achieve this goal. First, "customCDF": a tool to redefine the Custom Definition File (CDF) of Affymetrix GeneChips. It results in the increased sensitivity of downstream analyses as these bene fit from the constantly evolving human genome reference and annotations. Second, "aSim": a tool to simulate microarray data, which was required to benchmark the developed algorithms. Third, for the integrative analysis, a set of combined statistical methods and finally for the comparative analysis, a modification of the integrative analysis approach. These were bundled in the "crossChip" R package. The "customCDF" and "aSim" tools were first validated on independant datasets. The developed analytical methods ("crossChip") were first validated on "aSim" simulated data and publicly available datasets and then used to answer two biological questions. First, using two retinoblastoma datasets, the effect of genomic copy number variations on gene-expression was investigated. Then, motivated by the fact that retinoblastoma patients have a higher chance to develop osteosarcoma later in life than the average population, datasets of both these tumors were comparatively analyzed to assess these tumors similarities and differences. Despite a rather limited number of samples within the selected datasets, the developed approaches with their higher sensitivity and sensibility were successful and set the ground for larger scale analyses. Indeed, the integrative analysis applied to retinoblastoma revealed the high importance of the chromosome 6 gain at a later stage of the disease, indicating that many genes on that chromosome are beneficial to cancerogenesis. Moreover, in comparison to standard microarray analyses, it demonstrated its efficacy at detecting the interplay of regulatory mechanisms: examples of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>compensation</b> of gene expression in lost and gained regions, respectively, as well as examples of antisense transcription, pseudogene and snRNAs regulation were identified in this dataset. The comparative analysis on the other hand revealed the high similarity of the retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma tumors, while at the same time showing that either of them take advantage of their distinct micro-environment and consequently appear to make use of different signaling pathways, PKC/calmodulin in retinoblastoma and GPCR/RAS in osteosarcoma. The developed tools and statistical methods have demonstrated their validity and utility by giving sensible answers to the two biological questions addressed. Moreover, they generated a large number of interesting hypotheses that need further investigations. And as they are not limited to microarray analysis but can be applied to analyze any high-throughput generated data, they demonstrated the usefulness of "systems biology" approaches to study cancerogenesis. ...|$|E

Whiletraditionally, herbivory was considered to have a negative impact on plants, some studies also reportedpossible mutualism between plants and herbivores. Plant defences, and in particular tolerance and resis-tance, seem to play an important role in shaping plant-herbivore interactions. The aim of this study isto show how a direct plant compensation mechanism translates into apparent compensation, i. e. thelong-term biomass response to herbivory, in simple plant-herbivore models. A special emphasis is thenput on how it interacts with resistance mechanisms. A qualitative study of the proposed models showsthat they can exhibit different plant-herbivore patterns, including neutral, antagonistic (<b>negative</b> appar-ent <b>compensation)</b> and mutualistic (positive apparent compensation) interactions. Moreover, it is shownthat density dependence plays a crucial role since, for a given system, the realized plant-herbivore pat-tern critically depends on the initial plant and herbivore levels.
