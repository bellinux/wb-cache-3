Multiple studies attest to the disadvantages perceived and encountered by NNES (non-native English speaking) scholars as a result; yet, {{only a limited number}} have addressed the ‘gatekeeper’ side of the editorial process, with an exclusive focus on publication within social science journals (Belcher, 2007; Flowerdew, 2001). Recent evidence, highlighting significant disciplinary differences in publication practices (Gnutzmann and Rabe, 2014), points towards a lack of knowledge of editorial practices and perceptions of NNES scholars’ submissions in the ‘hard sciences’. This dissertation presents the results of an interview case study with the editors of a top-ranked, international chemistry journal. The purpose was to find out how these editors assess and perceive the role of language in the scientific editorial process and to gain insight into how to enhance the chances of successful publication by NNES authors. Analysis of the data suggests that language assessment is based on overall comprehension instead of quality, with a clear precedence given to the value of the scientific content over {{the way in which it}} is linguistically presented. Moreover, the results highlight the incidence of problematic linguistic errors and unfamiliarity with academic discourse from both NES (native English speaking) and <b>NNES</b> <b>scholars.</b> Recommendations include the need for NNES authors working in the ‘hard science’ disciplines to pay more specific attention to clear and comprehensible language in order to achieve success in publishing...|$|E
