2500|$|In a {{uniaxial}} material, one ray behaves {{according to}} the <b>normal</b> <b>law</b> of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface.

The terms [...] "ordinary" [...] and [...] "extraordinary" [...] are still applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular to the optic axis respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is involved.|$|E

Gauss used M, , [...] to denote the measurements of some unknown quantityV, and sought the [...] "most probable" [...] estimator: the one that maximizes the probability [...] of obtaining the observed experimental results. In his notation φΔ is the probability law of the measurement errors of magnitude Δ. Not knowing what the function φ is, Gauss requires that his method should reduce to the well-known answer: the arithmetic mean of the measured values. Starting from these principles, Gauss demonstrates that the only law that rationalizes the choice of arithmetic mean as an estimator of the location parameter, is the <b>normal</b> <b>law</b> of errors: ...|$|E

He initially studied medicine, but soon switched to law. While in law school, Schellenberg performed some spy work for the SD. He reported actually having been recruited by two SD agents who were college faculty, who also advised him to join the Civil Service. After graduating he joined the SS in 1933. From what Schellenberg later wrote, the [...] "better type of people" [...] preferred the SS over the other Nazi organizations.

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} it had a dual role, unique among British police forces, of providing a <b>normal</b> <b>law</b> enforcement police service while enforcing the new Northern Ireland entity {{in the face of}} considerable opposition, both armed and unarmed. To this end, its members were armed, as the RIC had been. The RUC was limited by statute to a 3,000-strong force. Initially, a third of positions within the force were reserved for Roman Catholics, a reflection of the denominational proportions of the population of Northern Ireland at that time. The first two thousand places were filled quickly and those reserved for Catholics were filled mainly by ex-RIC men fleeing north. Due to reluctance by the political establishment to employ too many Catholics (who were seen as potentially disloyal to the Protestant and unionist ethos of the new government), the force abandoned this policy. As a result, representation of Catholics in the RUC never exceeded 20%. [...] In addition, many Roman Catholics who joined the force, particularly during the troubles were targeted for murder or ostracised by their own community. By the 1960s, representation of Catholics in the RUC had fallen to 12%.|$|E
