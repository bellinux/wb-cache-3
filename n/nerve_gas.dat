5|$|A Drax Industries Moonraker {{space shuttle}} on loan is hijacked and Bond is ordered to investigate. Bond meets {{the owner of}} the company, Hugo Drax and one of Drax's scientists, Dr. Holly Goodhead. Bond follows the trail to Venice, where he {{establishes}} that Drax is manufacturing a <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Bond again meets Goodhead and finds out that she is a CIA agent.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grand Slam {{begins with}} Pussy Galore's Flying Circus {{spraying}} the gas over Fort Knox. However, Bond had seduced Galore and convinced her {{to replace the}} <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> with a harmless substance and alert the US government about Goldfinger's plan. The military personnel of Fort Knox play dead until they are certain that they can prevent the criminals from escaping.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, set 18 months after, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack is {{believed}} to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the American government. The acquisition of <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> by the terrorists poses a new threat, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop those responsible.|$|E

40|$|Threats from {{chemical}} warfare agents, {{commonly known as}} <b>nerve</b> <b>gases,</b> constitute a serious security issue of increasing global concern because of surging terrorist activity worldwide. However, <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> are difficult to detect using current analytical tools and outside dedicated laboratories. Here we demonstrate that surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) {{can be used for}} sensitive detection of femtomol quantities of two <b>nerve</b> <b>gases,</b> VX and Tabun, using a handheld Raman device and SERS substrates consisting of flexible gold-covered Si nanopillars. The substrate surface exhibits high droplet adhesion and nanopillar clustering due to elasto-capillary forces, resulting in enrichment of target molecules in plasmonic hot-spots with high Raman enhancement. The results may pave the way for strategic life-saving SERS detection of {{chemical warfare}} agents in the field...|$|R
25|$|PON1 is {{responsible}} for hydrolysing organophosphate pesticides and <b>nerve</b> <b>gasses.</b> Polymorphisms in the PON1 gene significantly affect the catalytic ability of the enzyme.|$|R
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of <b>nerve</b> <b>gas.</b> Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Roy's {{increasingly}} erratic behavior causes Ronnie {{to become}} upset and leave him, taking {{their three children}} with her, never to be seen again. When a despairing Roy inadvertently sees a television news program about the train wreck near Devils Tower, he realizes the mental image of a mountain plaguing him is real. Jillian sees the same broadcast, and she and Roy, {{as well as others}} with similar visions and experiences, travel to the site in spite of the public warnings about <b>nerve</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that their}} next target is a water-filtration plant near Navy Pier, Fisher infiltrates the Engineers and {{prevents}} {{the release of}} a biological toxin into the water supply. Kobin then tells him that mercenary supplier Reza Nouri may be allied with the Engineers. Sam assaults Nouri's mansion, capturing him for questioning. When he learns about an Engineer sleeper cell in London, Fisher infiltrates an abandoned mill and discovers chemical bombs in a shipping bay. Opening a bomb to plant a tracking device, he is exposed to <b>nerve</b> <b>gas.</b> Incapacitated and apparently dying, Fisher is captured by Sadiq and rescued by Briggs; in the ensuing confrontation, Sadiq escapes while Briggs provides first aid to Sam.|$|E
5000|$|Silent Death {{describes}} routes {{for manufacturing}} <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> (such as tabun and sarin gas), botulinum (botulin toxin), ricin, phosgene, arsine, and other poisons.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Brattain {{was asked}} to carry out {{hazardous}} research studying the structure of German <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> {{that had been used}} in World War II.|$|R
50|$|Orson Welles' radio {{adaptation}} dramatizes {{the effects}} of the black smoke: The poison is depicted as being potent enough to render gas masks useless, as do modern <b>nerve</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bond again {{encounters}} Goodhead in Venice {{where he}} is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond and is killed; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces {{that she is a}} CIA agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence of being on leave.|$|E
5|$|Lacombe and Laughlin—along with a {{group of}} United Nations experts—continue to {{investigate}} increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated over and over until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic <b>nerve</b> <b>gas,</b> all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E
25|$|The key to mycoremediation is {{determining}} the right fungal species to target a specific pollutant. Certain strains {{have also been}} reported to successfully degrade the <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> VX and sarin.|$|R
50|$|Willy Lange from Berlin {{discovered}} {{sodium monofluorophosphate}} in 1929. He fruitlessly {{tried to make}} monofluorophosphoric acid. However, he did discover the highly toxic organic esters. Following this discovery various <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> like sarin were developed.|$|R
25|$|Deaths have {{resulted}} from accidental exposure to fumigation materials containing aluminum phosphide or phosphine. Phosphine gas attacks the central nervous system, much as military <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> do. It can be absorbed either by inhalation or through the skin.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, Bantam Books {{published}} a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style {{reminiscent of the}} film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were {{cut out of the}} film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk— both disillusioned war veterans— deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> as a result of World War III.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an Egyptian agent, the CIA had {{obtained}} a sample of soil from the facility taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX <b>nerve</b> <b>gas,</b> at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent's bona fides were later confirmed through polygraph testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, questioning whether Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, and the agency advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted telephone communications from the plant that reputedly bolstered the American case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.|$|E
25|$|The crash led to {{demands to}} remove the B-52s from Okinawa and {{strengthened}} a push for the reversion from U.S. rule in Okinawa. Okinawans had correctly suspected that the Chibana depot held nuclear weapons. The crash, together with a <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> leak from Chibana Depot the following year sparked fears that another potential disaster on the island could put the chemical and nuclear stockpile and the surrounding population in jeopardy and increased the urgency of moving them to a less populated and less active storage location.|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholinesterase {{inhibition}} by organophosphorus pesticides or <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> {{can cause}} acute parasympathetic system dysfunction, muscle weakness, seizures, coma, and respiratory failure. 						Prognosis {{depends on the}} dose and relative toxicity of the specific compound, as well as pharmacokinetic factors...|$|R
25|$|Contact or {{absorption}} of poisons can cause rapid death or impairment. Agents that {{act on the}} nervous system can paralyze in seconds or less, and include both biologically derived neurotoxins and so-called <b>nerve</b> <b>gases,</b> which may be synthesized for warfare or industry.|$|R
50|$|Organophosphate is {{the general}} name for esters of phosphoric acid {{and is one of}} the organophosphorus compounds. They can be found as part of insecticides, herbicides, and <b>nerve</b> <b>gases,</b> amongst others. Some less-toxic {{organophosphates}} can be used as solvents, plasticizers, and EP additives.|$|R
25|$|In the books, Draka {{equipment}} - from {{tanks to}} tank-busting aircraft- seems deliberately evocative of late-20th century military equipment, enhancing the otherworldliness and {{superiority of the}} Draka in technological as well as purely physical sense. The assault rifles used by Draka citizen-soldiers feature integral bipods and optical sights, while support weaponry includes <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> grenades and magazine-fed mortars. Descriptions of the Draka Hond tanks evoke images of modern tanks such as the M1 Abrams. In a similar vein, flashbacks involving {{some of the older}} characters reveal that the Draka had a large dirigible air force capable of strategic bombing during the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Having {{become a}} main {{character}} in the show's eighth season, the Master reappears in The Mind of Evil, where he regains his TARDIS' circuit from the Doctor after attempting to launch a <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> missile that would start off World War III. After another incursion on Earth in The Claws of Axos, and failing to hold the galaxy to ransom using a doomsday weapon on the planet Uxarieus in the year 2472 in Colony in Space, in The Dæmons the Master is finally captured on Earth by the organisation UNIT after Jo Grant (Katy Manning) prevents the alien Azal (Stephen Thorne) from gifting the Master his powers.|$|E
25|$|In the film, Goldfinger, an avid golfer, {{reveals a}} fascination with Nazi gold when Bond tempts him to betting high stakes against a lost, {{historical}} Nazi gold bar, an incident not in the novel (the golf game is merely for {{a large amount of}} cash). He is defeated, however, when he is tricked by Bond after attempting to cheat. Goldfinger is shown to take sadistic pleasure in killing his enemies, which he accomplishes in elaborate ways. This is shown when he attempts to kill a captured Bond by slowly cutting him in half with a laser (but is talked out of it by Bond) and, later, when he uses <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> to execute a group of gangsters he had invited to his ranch.|$|E
50|$|Kaplan is also {{co-author}} of The Cult at the End of the World, on the Aum doomsday sect behind the 1995 <b>nerve</b> <b>gassing</b> of Tokyo's subway (Crown, 1996); {{and author of}} Fires of the Dragon, on the life and murder of Taiwanese-American journalist Henry Liu.|$|R
50|$|Decontamination {{varies with}} the {{particular}} chemical agent used. Some nonpersistent agents, including most pulmonary agents (chlorine, phosgene, and so on), blood <b>gases,</b> and nonpersistent <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> (e.g., GB), will dissipate from open areas, although powerful exhaust fans {{may be needed to}} clear out buildings where they have accumulated.|$|R
50|$|Organophosphates (such as <b>nerve</b> <b>gases)</b> are {{well-known}} inhibitors of AChE. They bind to {{a specific}} place on the enzyme and prevent it from functioning normally by changing the OH group on the serine residue and by protonating (quaternary nitrogen, R4N+) the nearby nitrogen atom located in the histidine residue.|$|R
25|$|Other {{government}} work includes {{the construction of}} the facilities to treat the liquid radioactive waste stored underground at the Department of Energy's Hanford nuclear waste site in Washington. The unit also manages U.S. Department of Defense contracts to dismantle and dispose of stored chemical weapons, including decades-old mustard and <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> from World War II. It completed {{the construction of the}} Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant as part of this work in 2015. Since May 2012, Bechtel has been part of a consortium completing the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, a structure that will safely confine the damaged Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor Number 4. As of 2016, It is a partner in Savannah River Remediation, the liquid waste contractor for the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|The German Wehrmacht is {{somewhat}} {{more advanced than}} historically, with a fully mechanized supply train. The Waffen-SS units facing the Draka Citizen Airborne unit the novel centers around are also in possession of numerous 'hybrid' armoured vehicles made from German and captured Soviet parts, {{but they are still}} no match for the Draka army. The Draka citizen soldiers, female as well as male, are honed killing machines, each equal to several of their enemy on the battlefield. The Draka also have superb weaponry, including 14,000 Hond III tanks with armor, engine size and gun caliber approaching those of modern MBTs, and powerful air force which includes high-performance single and twin piston engine fighters, airborne early warning systems mounted on dirigibles and a twin-engine armored ground attack aircraft. By 1944, all sides are widely using <b>nerve</b> <b>gas,</b> jet- and rocket-powered fighter aircraft and ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|Flynn {{contacts}} Doyle {{by radio}} {{and tells him}} to head to Wembley Stadium, but to leave the civilians. Doyle ignores his instructions and escorts Andy, Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an abandoned Volvo V70 to escape <b>nerve</b> <b>gas</b> released to kill the infected, but are unable to start the car while soldiers with flamethrowers draw near. Doyle exits the car and sacrifices himself by push starting the car and is subsequently burned alive. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives Tammy and Andy into the London Underground, where the trio continues on foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet, then bites Andy. Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy, who remains symptom-free but an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and are {{picked up by a}} reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the English Channel to France, as previously instructed by Doyle.|$|E
2500|$|PON1 {{was first}} {{discovered}} through {{its ability to}} hydrolyse and therefore detoxify organophosphorus compounds which are widely used as pesticides and <b>nerve</b> <b>gases.</b> Despite decades of research it is only now becoming clear that PON1 protects humans from the acute and chronic harmful effects of these compounds Low PON1 activity found in children may increase their susceptibility to organophosphates.|$|R
5000|$|A cholinesterase {{inhibitor}} (or [...] "anticholinesterase") suppresses {{the action of}} the enzyme. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of cholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death (examples are some snake venoms, and the <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> sarin and VX). One counteracting medication is pralidoxime. The so-called <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by combining with a residue of serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. The enzyme acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.|$|R
50|$|Otto Ambros (19 May 1901 - 23 July 1990) was a German chemist and Nazi war criminal, notably {{involved}} with the research of chemical nerve agents, especially sarin and tabun. He worked at Monowitz and tested the <b>nerve</b> <b>gases</b> on inmates of Auschwitz. After {{the end of the}} war, he was tried at Nuremburg and convicted of crimes against humanity.|$|R
