5|$|Although erections are <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for {{satisfying}} sexual encounters, {{many men}} {{see them as}} important, and treating erectile dysfunction improves their relationships and quality of life.

5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for stability, either.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, it is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Golding left to lead Kent State, {{and with}} a brief {{intermission}} of Academic Vice President Trevor Colbourn serving as president, Thomas B. Day became the sixth president in 1978. When Proposition 13 passed, the school faced budget issues and Day proposed abolishing some departments, combining others, and laying off approximately 80 faculty members. However, budget cuts were deemed <b>not</b> <b>necessary,</b> and on April 8, 1980, Day again proposed cutting 115 faculty members and four departments due to foreseeing upcoming budget cuts; on May 16, 1980 he recanted his comments.|$|E

5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> {{for males}} with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner {{has not been}} effectively vaccinated.

5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is <b>not</b> <b>necessary.</b> Education {{is an important}} part of any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E

5|$|Linda passed {{very near}} Socorro Island. In addition, early {{forecasts}} predicted that Linda would make landfall in California. The landfall never materialized and warnings or watches were <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for any location. However, Linda caused large surf, which crashed ashore in California, where it swept five people off a jetty.
