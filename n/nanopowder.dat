25|$|Nanoparticle-Assisted PCR (nanoPCR): In recent years, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that some nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance the efficiency of PCR (thus being called nanoPCR), and some even perform better than the original PCR enhancers. It was also found that quantum dots (QDs) can improve PCR specificity and efficiency. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are efficient in enhancing the amplification of long PCR. Carbon <b>nanopowder</b> (CNP) was reported be able to improve the efficiency of repeated PCR and long PCR. ZnO, TiO2, and Ag NPs were also found to increase PCR yield. Importantly, already known data has indicated that non-metallic NPs retained acceptable amplification fidelity. Given that many NPs are capable of enhancing PCR efficiency, it is clear that there is likely to be great potential for nanoPCR technology improvements and product development.|$|E

50|$|LF-FSP {{offers several}} {{advantages}} over other <b>nanopowder</b> production methods. A key problem in <b>nanopowder</b> synthesis {{is the use}} of expensive raw materials. These expensive raw materials include metal chloride precursors, which are highly corrosive. Protective construction of equipment is needed when using metal chloride precursors in FSP. In addition, toxic, polluting byproducts need to be disposed. In LF-FSP, organometallic precursors are used which do not pose this problem. Due to the use of non-corrosive precursors, LF-FSP does not require protective equipment and disposal of toxic byproducts. Also, organometallic precursors are low cost and easy to produce. For instance, silatrane glycolate, a precursor in the production of SiO2 through LF-FSP, can be synthesized in kilogram quantities in one step from silica.|$|E

50|$|Common {{methods of}} {{producing}} coated nanoparticles are primarily based on solution phase methods and sol-gel processing, which are multi-step processes. These multi-step processes are inefficient in cost, time and homogeneity {{of the final}} product. Also, the disposal of solvents is costly. These coated nanoparticles include ZrO2 coated Al2O3, SiO2 coated ZrO2, and SnO2 coated ZrO2. However, LF-FSP {{has the potential to}} provide simple and efficient routes to coated <b>nanopowder</b> production without aggregation. LF-FSP allows access to core-shell nanoparticles of (ZrO2)1−x(Al2O3)x, which can be produced in a single step.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem in}} <b>nanopowder</b> {{synthesis}} is {{the difficulty in}} controlling the size, size distribution, and agglomeration of particles. Milling, grinding, jet milling, crushing, and micronization are conventionally used for particle size reduction. However, neither the particle size can reach the nanoscale, nor are the shapes uniform. LF-FSP directly produces nanopowders that are not possible via grinding. Uniform particle size distributions are obtained using LF-FSP {{as it is a}} vapor phase process. For instance, Al2O3 nanopowders produced from LF-FSP have an average particle size (APS) of 20-150 nm with a log-normal particle size distribution.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of the different synthesis processes on microstructural and morphological characteristics and distribution of hydroxyapatite-bioactive glass (HAp-BG) composite <b>nanopowders</b> obtained by sol-gel method. HAp-BG composite <b>nanopowders</b> with 20 wt% bioactive glass were prepared using a sol-gel method via four routes: (I) mixing the prepared HAp solution with BG solution before aging time; (II) mixing the prepared BG solution with the prepared HAp gel after gelation; (III) mixing the calcined BG <b>nanopowders</b> with the prepared HAp solution; and (IV) mixing the two prepared calcined <b>nanopowders</b> by mechanochemical activation. The prepared <b>nanopowders</b> were evaluated and studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), transmission electron diffraction (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method to investigate the phase structure, microstructure and morphology, functional groups, and the size and distribution of <b>nanopowders.</b> Results indicated that morphology, crystallinity, crystallite size and specific surface area (SSA) of the powders are highly correspondent to the process and type of synthesis method. These findings suggest that the modified sol-gel derived HAp-BG composite <b>nanopowders</b> are expected to efficiently provide a possibility to produce a good candidate to use for fabrication of a bulk nanostructured HAp-BG composite for bone tissue engineering.|$|R

50|$|Obtaining a {{final product}} with high purity and {{relatively}} narrow size distribution {{is much easier}} compared to alternatives, and such powders do not require additional powder processing which may result in introduction of impurities. Aggregation is another key problem in <b>nanopowder</b> synthesis. Aggregates contain discrete primary particles that are necked. Particle necking refers to particles, which chemically bond together from the diffusion of atoms to the particles' interface {{in the presence of}} a driving force, such as heat. Neck formation is shown in Figure 3. A major disadvantage of vapor-fed FSP is the formation of hard agglomerates in the gas phase. As a result, it leads to difficulties in producing high-quality, bulk materials. LF-FSP largely avoids this problem by limiting aggregation through rapid quenching.|$|E

5000|$|LF-FSP, as invented at the University of Michigan, uses metalloorganic {{precursors}} such as metal carboxylates or alkoxides, not metal chlorides. Briefly, alcohol (typically ethanol) solutions containing 1-10 wt % {{loading of}} the target ceramic components as precursors are aerosolized with O2 into a quartz chamber and ignited with methane pilot torches. Initial combustion temperatures run 1500-2000 °C, depending on the processing conditions, generating <b>nanopowder</b> [...] "soot". Temperatures drop to 300-500 °C over 1.5 m, equivalent to a 1000 °C quench in 100 ms leading to kinetic products and nanopowders that are unaggregated. Production rates can be 200 g/h when using wire-in-tube electrostatic precipitators operating at 10 kV. Typical powders have 15-100 nm average particle sizes (APS) with specific surface areas of 30-100 m2/g.

50|$|Metal alkoxides, {{carboxylates}} such as alumatrane Al(OCH2CH2)3N, silatrane Si(OCH2CH2)3NOCH2CH2N(CH2CH2OH)2, and zirconium propionate Zr(O2CCH2CH3)2-(OH)2, {{are generally}} used, {{and they are}} dissolved in an alcohol solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Solubility of the precursor in alcohol is an important property, which {{is controlled by the}} ligands. Too much carbon in the ligand may promote formation of metal carbonate as a secondary minor phase since enormous amounts of CO2 are generated on combustion which may react with metal oxides. Too little carbon in the ligand will limit the solubility of precursor in alcohol. The process is inexpensive as metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or nitrates can be used as starting points for precursor synthesis. For mixed-metal oxides, one can either synthesize a double-alkoxide which contains two metal elements such as magnesium aluminum double alkoxide as shown in Table 1, or simply mix different alkoxide and/or carboxylates in stoichiometric ratios. For example, LF-FSP products of alumatrane and silatrane glycolate dissolved in ethanol at 3:1 molar ratio is mullite (3Al2O3•2SiO2).
