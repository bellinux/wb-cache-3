In particular, understanding whether a migratory lifestyle is compulsory or facultative, and whether adults home to their natal geographic area is paramount to fully appraise disruptions of longitudinal connectivity resulting from damming. In the Amazon, the large migratory catfishes of the Brachyplatystoma genus are apex predators of considerable interest for fisheries. They are believed to use {{the entire length of}} the basin to perform their life cycle, with hypothesized homing behaviours. Here, we tested these hypotheses, using the emblematic B. rousseauxii as a model species. We sampled adults close to major breeding areas in the Amazon basin (upper Madeira and upper Amazonas) and assessed their lifetime movements by measuring variations in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr along transverse sections of their otoliths (ear stones) using laser ablation multicollector mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS). We demonstrate that larvae migrate downstream from the Andean piedmont to the lower Amazon, where they grow over a protracted period before migrating upstream as adults. Contrary to prevailing inferences, not all fish spend their <b>nursery</b> <b>stages</b> in the Amazon estuary.

Synthesis and applications. By using otolith microchemistry, we were able to demonstrate a seemingly compulsory basin-wide migratory life cycle of large Amazonian catfishes. This makes them the organisms performing the longest migrations (> 8000 km) in fresh waters. This exceptional life history is already jeopardized by two dams recently built in the Madeira River, which block a major migration route and access to a substantial part of their spawning grounds.

It focuses on improving {{the efficiency of}} parentage assignment, determining the optimum life stage to mix oyster families for rearing and selection, comparing mixed-family and separate-family selective breeding in the field, and applying the mixed method to estimate the heritability of shell shape. We developed novel computer software, P-LOCI (available at [URL] which identifies the most efficient set of codominant markers for assigning parentage, accounting for marker linkage, mating design, null alleles and genotyping error, {{and found that the}} most efficient group of loci for assignment is not necessarily comprised of the top individually ranked loci, or best for all populations. We determined the optimum time to mix oyster families for rearing and selection in the field; overall, planting size is the most prudent time to mix families for MFS, due to high variability in family representation produced during larval and <b>nursery</b> <b>stages.</b> Mixing families at stages earlier than this for selection on field traits would require pre-planting genotyping of large samples for estimation of initial family representation, which would add substantial cost, or other special considerations. Rearing mixed family groups of oysters in the field yielded very similar results to rearing the same families separately, (r = 0. 817 for two-site average individual weight at harvest), demonstrating it is unlikely associative effects are of great importance in the Pacific oyster. Our results show that the mixed method was well-suited for individual traits and walk-back selection, but would incur higher costs than the separate method to estimate survival with lower precision. Finally, we utilized the mixed method to estimate the heritability of shell shape using midparent-offspring regression; we estimated shell depth heritability as 0. 404 ± 0. 14 and shell width as 0. 287 ± 0. 11, nearly equal to the only other study for the Pacific oyster, demonstrating potential for selective breeding on these traits in this U. S. population, and similar results between methods. Overall, we found that mixed-family rearing is viable for Pacific oyster breeding, given some important restrictions...|$|R
40|$|Permit, Trachinotus falcatus are {{economically}} and ecologically important throughout their {{range of the}} Caribbean, subtropical and tropical western Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. Despite their economic importance, {{little is known about}} the biology and ecology of permit, and most existing information is from Florida. While sufficient information is available to paint a general picture of permit life history, details are lacking for most life stages. For the juvenile life <b>stage,</b> <b>nursery</b> habitats and size and age at settlement have not yet been defined. Although six distinct habitat types (medium energy and low energy windward beaches, leeward beaches, and windward, leeward, and lagoon interior mangrove shorelines) were sampled to determine spatial patterns of habitat use by early juvenile permit a...|$|R
50|$|The school offered {{students}} {{an international}} education from Nursery to Year 13 (Kindergarten to grade 12). The school {{was divided into}} three phases : Infants (<b>nursery</b> and Key <b>Stage</b> 1), Junior / Middle School (Key Stage 2 and 3) and High School (Key Stages 4 and 5). The school followed the British Curriculum (See Education in England) to Year 11 where students took IGCSE; students in Senior High School undertook a university preparation programme. Students who successfully completed Year 13 (grade 12) were awarded with a High School Diploma. St. John's International School was {{a founding member of}} the International School Association of Thailand (ISAT). It was also the first school in Thailand to be designated under the Safe School Community International Accreditation Programme (SSCIAP) by the Safe Communities Foundation New Zealand.|$|R
