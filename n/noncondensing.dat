50|$|The vapour {{pressure}} over the hot liquid working fluid at the hot {{end of the}} pipe is higher than the equilibrium {{vapour pressure}} over the condensing working fluid at the cooler end of the pipe, and this pressure difference drives a rapid mass transfer to the condensing end where the excess vapour condenses, releases its latent heat, and warms the cool end of the pipe. Non-condensing gases (caused by contamination for instance) in the vapour impede the gas flow and reduce the effectiveness of the heat pipe, particularly at low temperatures, where vapour pressures are low. The speed of molecules in a gas is approximately the speed of sound, {{and in the absence of}} <b>noncondensing</b> gases (i.e., if there is only a gas phase present) this is the upper limit to the velocity with which they could travel in the heat pipe. In practice, the speed of the vapour through the heat pipe is limited by the rate of condensation at the cold end and far lower than the molecular speed. Note/explanation: The condensation rate is very close to the sticking coefficient times the molecular speed times the gas density, if the condensing surface is very cold. However, if the surface is close to the temperature of the gas, the evaporation caused by the finite temperature of the surface largely cancels this heat flux. If the temperature difference is more than some tens of degrees, the evaporation from the surface is typically negligible, as can be assessed from the vapour pressure curves. In most cases, with very efficient heat transport through the gas, it is very challenging to maintain such significant temperature differences between the gas and the condensing surface. Moreover, this temperature differences of course corresponds to a large effective thermal resistance by itself. The bottleneck is often less severe at the heat source, as the gas densities are higher there, corresponding to higher maximum heat fluxes.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} Bose-condensed ground states of bosons in a {{two-dimensional}} optical lattice {{in the presence}} of frustration due to an effective vector potential, for example, due to lattice rotation. We use a mapping to a large-S frustrated magnet to study quantum fluctuations in the condensed state. Quantum effects are introduced by considering a 1 /S expansion around the classical ground state. The large-S regime should be relevant to systems with many particles per site. As the system approaches the Mott insulating state, the hole density becomes small. Our large-S results show that, even when the system is very dilute, the holes remain a (partially) condensed system. Moreover, the superfluid density is comparable to the condensate density. In other words, the large-S regime does not display an instability to <b>noncondensed</b> phases. However, for cases with fewer than 1 / 3 flux quantum per lattice plaquette, we find that the fractional condensate depletion increases as the system approaches the Mott phase, giving rise to the possibility of a <b>noncondensed</b> state before the Mott phase is reached for systems with smaller S.

Early analysis of dilute sprays and other dispersed flows assumed either locally-homogeneous flow (LHF), implying infinitely-fast interphase transport rates, or deterministic separated flow (DSF) where finite interphase transport rates are considered, but interactions between dispersed-phase el ments and turbulence are ignored. These limits are useful in some instances; however, recent evidence shows that both methods are deficient for quantitative estimates {{of the structure of}} most practical dispersed flows, including sprays.

40|$|The {{transport}} of a condensing passive scalar is studied as a prototype {{model for the}} kinematics of moisture transport on isentropic surfaces. Condensation occurs whenever the scalar concentration exceeds a specified local saturation value. Since condensation rates are strongly nonlinear functions of moisture content, the mean moisture flux is generally not diffusive. To relate the mean moisture content, mean condensation rate, and mean moisture flux to statistics of the advecting velocity field, a one-dimensional stochastic model is developed in which the Lagrangian velocities of air parcels are independent Ornstein– Uhlenbeck (Gaussian colored noise) processes. The mean moisture evolution equation for the stochastic model is derived in the Brownian and ballistic limits of small and large Lagrangian velocity correlation time. The evolution equation involves expressions for the mean moisture flux and mean condensation rate that are nonlocal but remarkably simple. In a series of simulations of homogeneous two-dimensional turbulence, the dependence of mean moisture flux and mean condensation rate on mean saturation deficit is shown to be reproducible by the one-dimensional stochastic model, provided eddy length and time scales are taken as given.
