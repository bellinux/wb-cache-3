5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances.

LM10 is capable of operating with a 1.1 volt power supply, thus instead of a conventional bandgap reference it employs Widlar's sub-bandgap circuit locked at 200 mV and the low-voltage Widlar output stage. For 10 years, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry was able to produce a circuit that matched the LM10.|$|E

25|$|In February 1897 Sinclair scored 301 not {{out in a}} club game, which {{remained}} {{the highest score in}} any form of cricket in South Africa for many years. South Africa's next Tests came in 1898-99, with a two-match series against England. This time, thanks largely to Sinclair, the matches were more evenly contested, and South Africa gained a first-innings lead each time before losing. He did not bowl in the First Test, but scored 86, South Africa's first Test fifty, opening the first innings; apart from Pelham Warner's 132 in England's second innings, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match reached 40. In the Second Test Sinclair became the first person from any country to score a century and take five wickets in an innings in the same Test. In England's first innings he took 6 for 30, dismissing them for 92, then went in to bat with South Africa's score at 27 for 2 to make 106 before being last out with the total on 177. He was caught on the boundary in each innings.|$|E
500|$|Although Henry {{played up}} front as a striker during his youth, {{he spent his}} time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger {{immediately}} changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again {{to fit into the}} Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: [...] "Thierry Henry could take the ball {{in the middle of the}} park and score a goal that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world could score".|$|E

[...] She later would recall how she felt [...] "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible." [...] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.|$|E

500|$|Some time {{early in}} May 1779, Arnold met with Joseph Stansbury (whose {{testimony}} before a British commission apparently erroneously placed {{his meeting with}} Arnold in June). Stansbury said that he then [...] "went secretly to New York with a tender of [...] services to Sir Henry Clinton." [...] Stansbury ignored instructions from Arnold to involve <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot, and crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York. Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin, the last colonial governor of New Jersey {{and the son of}} Benjamin Franklin. [...] On May 9, Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major André, who had just been named the British spy chief. [...] This {{was the beginning of a}} secret correspondence between Arnold and André, sometimes using his wife Peggy as a willing intermediary, that culminated over a year later with Arnold's change of sides.|$|E
500|$|After his seven-triple season, {{his speed}} began to {{decrease}} {{and he could}} no longer regularly score triples due to pulling his quadriceps during the 1962 season. Killebrew moved to left field, where he started off the season slowly. He hit under [...]200 in both April and June, and because of this Killebrew was not selected to play in either 1962 All-Star Game, the last season he was not named an All-Star before 1972. On July 18 in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Killebrew and Bob Allison became the first teammates since 1890 to hit grand slams in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first. Over the course of the season, Killebrew hit 48 home runs, 126 RBIs, and had 107 walks, all career highs at the time. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AL managed even 40 home runs and he also led the league in RBIs. Killebrew's 48 home runs also broke the franchise record {{for the second year in}} a row. Not all of his stats were positive; Killebrew's batting average dropped from [...]288 in 1961 to [...]243 and he struck out a career-worst 142 times, leading the AL.|$|E
500|$|The Elder {{election}} {{is an old}} tradition at Seio Girls' Academy where every June {{one of the students}} is elected by her peers to be the [...] "Elder", who is seen as the number one [...] "Elder Sister" [...] in the school.

If none of the candidates get at least 75% {{in the first round of}} voting, one of the candidates hands over her votes to another candidate, and the candidate who finally obtains at least 75% of the votes becomes the Elder. If there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In Otoboku, Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the following months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls better and helps them with their problems.|$|E

2500|$|But Ha-myeong is alive, {{having been}} {{rescued from the}} water by Choi Gong-pil, a kind elderly man who lives on Hyangri Island. Gong-pil, who may either have Alzheimer's disease or trauma-induced memory loss, {{believes}} that Ha-myung is his older son Choi Dal-po, a simpleton who had died thirty years earlier. Ha-myeong, who has <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, embraces the deception and treats Gong-pil as his father. Gong-pil officially adopts Ha-myeong, now named Dal-po, and places him in the family register as his eldest son. Five months later, when Gong-pil's younger son Choi Dal-pyung moves to the island with his daughter Choi In-ha, they are flabbergasted to be told by Gong-pil to address a mere boy as their [...] "older brother" [...] and [...] "uncle," [...] respectively. Choi In-ha (Park Shin-Hye) has [...] "Pinocchio syndrome," [...] which causes her to hiccup whenever she tells a lie. She idolizes her mother, and hates living on the island after her parents' divorce. The fledgling friendship between Dal-po and In-ha is dashed, however, when he learns that In-ha's mother {{is none other than}} Song Cha-ok.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Martínez {{finished}} 23–4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts (earning {{the pitching}} Triple Crown) in 31 games (29 starts), pitching 213⅓ innings. He led the entire major leagues with K/9 and K/BB ratios of 13.20 and 8.46 and his Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) (a defense independent pitching statistic measuring a pitchers effectiveness to limit walks, homers and hits and accumulate strikeouts) of 1.39 {{was the lowest}} in modern major league history and the third lowest in history behind Christy Mathewson in 1908 and Walter Johnson in 1910 (by comparison the next best FIP in baseball was Randy Johnson's 2.76 and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American League had an FIP below 3.20). unanimously winning his second Cy Young Award (this time in the American League), and coming in second in the Most Valuable Player (MVP) ballot. The MVP result was controversial, as Martínez received the most first-place votes of any player (8 of 28), but was omitted from the ballot of two sportswriters, New York's George King and Minneapolis' LaVelle Neal. The two writers argued that pitchers were not sufficiently all-around players to be considered. (However, George King had given MVP votes to two pitchers just the season before: Rick Helling and David Wells; King was the only writer {{to cast a vote}} for Helling, who had gone 20–7 with a 4.41 ERA and 164 strikeouts.) MVP ballots have ten ranked slots, and sportswriters are traditionally asked to recuse themselves if they feel they cannot vote for a pitcher. [...] "It really made us all look very dumb", said Buster Olney, then a sportswriter for the New York Times. [...] "People were operating under different rules. The question of eligibility is a very basic thing. People were determining eligibility for themselves." [...] The Times does not permit its writers to participate in award voting. Martínez finished second to Texas Rangers catcher Iván Rodríguez, by a margin of 252 points to 239. Rodríguez had been included on all 28 ballots. When asked about the result by WEEI-FM radio in January 2012, Martínez said, [...] "I'm not afraid to say that the way that George King and Mr. LaVelle Neal III went about it was unprofessional." ...|$|E
