40|$|Due to climatic {{conditions}} and cultural traditions, {{only a part}} of the world fruit and vegetable diversity is cultivated in Europe. Since the 1950 s, major evolutions have affected most of the cultivated species at several levels: (i) an enlargement of the number of cultivated species, with the introduction for instance of kiwi (Actinidia), <b>nashi</b> (<b>Pyrus</b> <b>pyrifolia)</b> or Japanese plums (Prunus salicina); (ii) new cultigroups or botanical varieties have been introduced or created introducing market segmentation for instance red apricot, flat peach, parthenocarpic cucumber, or red Belgian endive; (iii) a tremendous increase of the number of available cultivars with almost 20000 cultivars of vegetables registered in the European catalogue. Nevertheless for most of the species, the number of cultivars has a tendency to increase in the most important cultigroups and to decrease in minor cultigroups (winter radish, running beans, peas, etc.). The diversity at the genotypic level can be estimated by neutral molecular markers like microsatellites or SNPs. Several situations have been described: (i) a good relationship between genotype and phenotype for instance in cherry tomatoes versus large-fruited types or in peach; (ii) a correlation between genotype and geographical origin; (iii) or a mix of both with foundation effects of a small number of parental accessions. New prospects or concerns based onto climatic change potential impacts and production durability have to be addressed. Development of future cultivars requires the mobilization of new adapted germplams. The characterization of the world existing resources on both morphological and genotypic bases is of major importance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} seed extracts of Pongamia pinnata, <b>Pyrus</b> <b>pyrifolia,</b> and Manilkara hexandra, bacterial pigment prodigiosin, and three organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, and dimethylsulfoxide), on quorum sensing (QS) in Chromobacterium violaceum (C. violaceum). MethodsC. violaceum was challenged with plant extracts prepared by microwave assisted extraction method, prodigiosin, and organic solvents. Effect of these test substances on C. violaceum growth, and quorum sensing regulated pigment (violacein) production was studied by broth dilution assay. High performance liquid chromatography was also applied to generate chromatographic fingerprint of the active extracts. Effect of sub-minimum inhibitory concentration level of the antibiotic streptomycin on quorum sensing regulated pigment production was also studied. ResultsPongamia pinnata seed extracts and prodigiosin were found to possess anti-QS, and Manilkara hexandra and <b>Pyrus</b> <b>pyrifolia</b> seed extracts to possess QS-enhancing effect in C. violaceum. Dimethylsulfoxide was found to enhance violacein production, whereas ethanol and methanol reduced violacein production in C. violaceum. Streptomycin at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration level was able to significantly arrest QS-regulated pigment production in C. violaceum and Serratia marcescens. ConclusionsProdigiosin and the seed extracts {{used in this study}} could affect quorum sensing in C. violaceum to a notable extent.

Results showed that trunk SF had significant relationship with the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in the single-variable analysis method but with soil volumetric water content ([theta]) using the ANN models with default of different variables. The correlation coefficient (R 2), mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured and simulated sap flows by the ANN model developed by taking VPD, solar radiation (Sr), air temperature (T), wind speed (Ws), [theta], leaf area index (LAI) as the input variables were 0. 953, 10. 0 % and 5. 33 Ld- 1, respectively, and the simulation precision of ANN model was superior to that of multiple-linear regression due to its better performance for the nonlinear relationship between trunk SF and its affecting factors, thus ANN model can simulate trunk sap flow and then may help the efficient water management of orchard.

40|$|MicroRNA 156 is an {{evolutionarily}} highly conserved plant micro-RNA (miRNA) {{that controls}} an age-dependent flowering pathway. miR 156 and its target SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes regulate anthocyanin accumulation in plants, {{but it is}} unknown whether this process is affected by light. Red Chinese sand pear (<b>Pyrus</b> <b>pyrifolia)</b> fruits exhibit a unique coloration pattern in response to bagging treatments, which makes them appropriate for studying the molecular mechanism underlying light-induced anthocyanin accumulation in fruit. Based on high-throughput miRNA and degradome sequencing data, we determined that miR 156 was expressed in pear fruit peels, and targeted four SPL genes. Light-responsive elements were detected in the promoter regions of the miR 156 a and miR 156 ba precursors. We identified 19 SPL genes using the “Suli” pear (<b>Pyrus</b> <b>pyrifolia</b> Chinese White Pear Group) genome database, of which seven members were putative miR 156 targets. The upregulated expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory genes and downregulated expression of PpSPL 2, PpSPL 5, PpSPL 7, PpSPL 9, PpSPL 10, PpSPL 13, PpSPL 16, PpSPL 17, and PpSPL 18 were observed in pear fruits after bags were removed from plants during the anthocyanin accumulation period. Additionally, miR 156 a/ba/g/s/sa abundance increased after bags were removed. Yeast two-hybrid results suggested that PpMYB 10, PpbHLH, and PpWD 40 could form a protein complex, probably involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis.

Treatments with the highest pollen density showed a significantly increased fruit growth rate and larger fruit at harvest. High pollen density increased germination rate and gave a faster pollen tube growth, both in vivo and in vitro. Endogenous gibberellin (GA) concentrations increased in pollen tubes soon after germination and the concentration of two growth-active GAs, GA 3, and GA 4, was positively correlated to final fruit size, cell numbers in the mesocarp, and pollen tube growth rate. These two GAs appear to be biosynthesized de novo in pollen tube and are the main pollen-derived bioactive GAs found after pollen germination. GA 1 levels in the pollen tube appear {{to be related to}} a pollen–style interaction that occurred after the pollen grains landed on the stigma...|$|R
40|$|Two genes {{encoding}} putative glutathione S-transferase proteins {{were isolated}} from pear (<b>Pyrus</b> <b>pyrifolia)</b> and designated PpGST 1 and PpGST 2. The deduced PpGST 1 and PpGST 2 proteins contain conserved Glutathione S-transferase N-terminal domain (GST_N) and Glutathione S-transferase, C-terminal domain (GST_C). Using PCR amplification technique, the genomic clones corresponding to PpGST 1 and PpGST 2 were isolated and shown to contain two introns and a singal intron respectively with typical GT/AG boundaries defining the splice junctions. Phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that PpGST 1 belonged to Phi class of GST superfamilies and had high homology with apple MdGST, while PpGST 2 was classified into the Tau class of GST superfamilies. The expression of PpGST 1 and PpGST 2 genes was developmentally regulated in fruit. Further study demonstrated that PpGST 1 and PpGST 2 expression was remarkably induced by glucose, salicylic acid (SA) and indole- 3 -aceticacid (IAA) treatments in pear fruit, and in diseased fruit. These data suggested that PpGST 1 and PpGST 2 {{might be involved}} in response to sugar, SA, and IAA signaling during fruit development of pear...|$|R
