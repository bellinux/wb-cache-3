500|$|In November 2002 {{several former}} members {{arranged}} Your Country <b>Needs</b> <b>You,</b> a concert of [...] "voices {{in opposition to}} war", as the Crass Collective. At Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank, Your Country <b>Needs</b> <b>You</b> included Benjamin Britten's War Requiem and performances by Goldblade, Fun-Da-Mental, Ian MacKaye and Pete Wright's post-Crass project, Judas 2. In October 2003 the Crass Collective changed their name to Crass Agenda, with Rimbaud, Libertine and Vaucher working with Matt Black of Coldcut and jazz musicians such as Julian Siegel and Kate Shortt. In 2004 Crass Agenda spearheaded a campaign to save the Vortex Jazz Club in Stoke Newington, north London (where they regularly played). In June 2005 Crass Agenda was declared to be [...] "no more", changing {{its name to the}} [...] "more pertinent" [...] Last Amendment. After a five-year hiatus, Last Amendment performed at the Vortex in June 2012. Rimbaud has also performed and recorded with Japanther and the Charlatans.

500|$|The {{campaign}} and loss left Lenore in emotional pain. [...] In her election night remarks she had said, [...] "I thought [...] {{would be an}} asset. It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman." [...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George <b>needs</b> <b>you</b> there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep." [...] She told one of her children that she wished she had not run, and concluded that [...] "It's the most humiliating thing I know of to run for office." ...|$|E
500|$|Late in 1995, Walker {{released}} his third studio album, titled Hypnotize the Moon.

Hypnotize the Moon was certified platinum in 1996, making for Walker's third consecutive platinum album. This album received a four-star rating from Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who {{said that it was}} his [...] "most assured, cohesive album to date" [...] and that he gave a [...] "consistently excellent performance." [...] Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly thought that Walker did not show a distinct musical personality, but considered the song selection strong and gave it a B+. Richard McVey II of Country Standard Time considered it a [...] "throwback" [...] in sound to Walker's debut, while USA Today said that it lacked the [...] "verve" [...] of that album.|$|E

500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad <b>needs</b> <b>you</b> but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out. You have got to get your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E
500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and what would make life wonderful for them... It's not {{an understanding of the}} head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's {{alive in the}}m... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them." [...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and <b>needs</b> <b>you</b> guess they may be expressing.|$|E
500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / <b>Needs</b> <b>you</b> to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith Sweat from the 1990s.|$|E
