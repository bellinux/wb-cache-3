500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality.

Your people love art but do not sufficiently honour the handicraftsman. Of course, those millionaires who can pillage Europe for their pleasure need have no care to encourage such; but I speak for those whose desire for beautiful things is larger than their means.

40|$|This is {{an essay}} about gated {{communities}} {{and their impact}} on society. The key questions of my essay are: why people choose to live in gated communities; how the city is impacted by gated communities and what the difference concerning the reasons and impact of gated communities in Florida and Sweden is, and what this difference might depend on. I am using postmodern urbanism as a starting point, and I look closer on Edward J. Soja’s theories about the postmodern metropolis. The research about gated communities is almost nonexistent in Sweden, so the literature I have read and used in my essay has mostly an American perspective. For a Swedish perspective I have among other things interviewed a professor in urban planning from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. My study shows that a search for security and a certain lifestyle are the main reasons for people to live or want to live in gated communities, both in Florida and in Sweden. However, {{there is a big difference}} in the subject between Florida and Sweden, mainly because there are only a few living areas in Sweden that can be considered as being gated communities. In Sweden a new lifestyle community called Victoria Park and is considered being a “Swedish gated community” has gotten a lot of critique in the media. This shows that gated communities are not really accepted in Sweden yet. In Florida gated communities are not considered extraordinary and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see the negative impacts they have had on the city, like empty cities without the service that is now found inside gated communities. Gated communities can be seen by some as a dream living situation, and for others a nightmare. Living in a private community with gates are <b>not</b> yet <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do in Sweden, but the development of living areas like Victoria Park and its popularity show that maybe it won’t take long until it’s not considered as an irregularity...|$|R

The notion of non-voluntary action is developed by appeal to the claim that judging has truth as a constitutive goal.

40|$|In several cases, {{systems that}} have been {{developed}} have been very time consuming and cost a lot of money, but they still do not fulfil the users requirements and requests. To make new systems better, you {{have to find a way}} to communicate that allows the developers to understand the needs of the user. The aim for our thesis is to highlight the importance of communication in system development. To investigate this we have choosen to do a study of the real-estate system. The work methods that have been used include mock-ups and informal conversations with the user, who is employed by the Church of Sweden in Ronneby. The purpose of this thesis is, among other things, to provide the Church of Sweden in Ronneby with a report, which can be of help for further development of the system. The system was developed by a work group at Blekinge Institute of Technology. Our question of issue is: Would the Church of Sweden in Ronneby obtain a more useful system if the developers applied the guidelines and experience that exists within the area of HCI? Further more we have looked in to if the communication has improved with the use of mock-ups to increase the interaction? Human-computer interaction as a term was adopted in the mid- 1980 s as a means of describing this new field of study. The focus of interest described the new way of looking at the interaction between computers and people. In this field it is important to involve the user in the developing process from the beginning to the end. Together with the user, we have made some propositions based on previous documentation from the project. Mock-ups are a prototype of paper that shows the user what the system will look like. This method was applied together with the user, to find a more logical structure for the system. After gathering the result of the case study, we can honestly say that communication do increase because of mock-ups. Good communication is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> learn from books; you have to adjust to the situation. It is important when you develop a system to work with a model that allows you to go back and change things in previous phases that are incorrect, and also to include the user in the whole process...|$|R
50|$|The {{illustration}} on page 87 shows a {{young black}} male, {{appears to be no}} older than 16 and is filled with vibrant colors consisting of yellow, blue, green, and orange. Toyin herself says that, “this piece actually speaks of identity and how malleable it is. It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really pin point with certainty, its very kind of…suspect I think” (Odutola Shaiman Gallery). This image follows a heavy chapter about Hurricane Katrina, the killings of Trayvon Martin, Mark Duggan, James Anderson, as well as {{a detailed description of the}} infamous Zinedine Zidane head-butt. This chapter included the struggles that the black community as a whole underwent during the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Rankine uses a quote from a local person present in New Orleans during the hurricane, “…it was the classic binary between the rich and the poor, between the haves and the have-nots, between the whites and the blacks, in the difficulty of all that” (Citizen, Pg. 83). The glare which resonates from the young boy’s eyes suggests an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and distress similar to the majority of the black population; however, the boy’s conscious decision to keep his chin elevated suggests that he has an optimistic view of life yet. The chapter touched upon an entire community of people feeling as if they were the last to be saved in an emergency situation, if at all. Another survivor on the scene stated, “We never reached out to anyone to tell our story, because there’s no ending to our story, he said. Being honest with you, in my opinion, they forgot about us” (Citizen, Pg. 84). “I don’t know what the water wanted. It wanted to show you no one would come. He said, I don’t know what the water wanted. As if then and now were not the same moment”(Citizen, Pg. 84). In a separate yet very close analysis and comparison of this illustration, Toyin Odutola created this picture and placed a multitude of muted colors versus brighter, more iridescent colors to illustrate the creative energy channels flowing through the young boy’s body. These channels represent the many experiences that he has gone through, both conscious and unconscious. The dark background also emphasizes the vibrant colors, forcing the viewer to strain their eyes, just as this boy has had to do growing up with no standard model to interpret his experiences. The illustration creates an almost stained glass affect, exhibiting the variations of the boy’s experiences thus far. Further thought brings you even deeper into the idea that these colors represent the more or less tarnished parts of the boy’s view of the world and himself.|$|R

Many of the causes of poor profit ability only require small changes on your part but can result in big returns over time. Reproductive Failure The single biggest source of losses on livestock operations is reproductive failure. A cow, doe or ewe that fails to produce and raise a live calf, kid or lamb incurs all of the costs of production for the year without generating an income. For this reason, females that are not pregnant at the end of the breeding season should be culled. Perhaps the most important reason animals fail to reproduce is poor nutrition. Females should be provided enough feed to maintain moderate or good body condition up until the time they give birth. Moderate to good body condition can be determined by body condition scoring. Your cows can be judged visually. They should be in body condition score (BCS) 5 (on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 = emaciated and 9 = obese) when they calve. (Se...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomena}} of cyber bullying is relatively new, {{but it is}} now more prevalent than ever as children today {{have access to the}} internet on a daily basis, in school as well as at home. Although cyber bullying is an increasing problem in today’s society, there seem to be few guidelines for teachers to follow when using the internet with their students in school. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate who, according to six teachers, has the responsibilities revolving cyber bullying – teachers or parents. There has not been very much research done revolving the issue. The questions that are going to be raised in this study are who the six interviewed teachers think is responsible for taking actions revolving cyber bullying, if there are any guidelines about how to work with the problem, if teachers and parent work together to prevent and act against cyber bullying and what kind of education teachers and parents get to increase their awareness about bullying and cyber bullying. This study is built on interviews with six teachers from three different schools. Two of the schools work with a bullying program that is based on Olweus methods against bullying. The third school has a collaboration with the organisation Friends. This study has its theoretical outcome in Olweus’ methods against bullying in general and Campbell’s definition of what cyber bullying means. Regarding responsibility this study is built on the definition of two different kinds of responsibilities, the moral kind and the legal kind. The conclusions of this study are that the responsibility is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> put on either the parents or the teachers, it is a shared responsibility between both parts since the children have access to the internet almost anywhere. There is also a need of guidelines regarding how to act in a case of cyber bullying as there are no known guidelines to turn to today. Some schools seem to have a collaboration between parents and teachers to prevent and act against cyber bullying, where other schools do not. The same schools that have that collaboration also seem to educate both teachers and parents about cyber bullying. ...|$|E
40|$|Theologian, Dr Angela McCarthy of The University of Notre Dame Australia, {{is using}} her life-long love of {{theology}} and art to delve deeper into the hidden mysteries of medieval Christian paintings and icons to uncover profound details about the artists’ lives, times and experiences. With her current research focusing {{on a series of}} pictures entitled Noli Me Tangere, (broadly translated as ‘cease clinging to me’), based on the Gospel of John 20 : 11 - 18, Dr McCarthy said she was inspired to explore the moment of Mary Magdalene’s meeting with Jesus. “When Mary Magdalene meets Jesus she thinks he’s a gardener and she doesn’t realise who he is. It’s not until he turns to her and says, ‘Mary’ and she realises that it’s him,” said Dr McCarthy. “I’m currently researching medieval artists, Giotto, Fra Angelico and Duccio di Buoninsegna’s interpretations and versions of that beautiful moment. ” Having travelled to Italy in 2009 {{to get a closer look}} at the artwork, Dr McCarthy said seeing the individual Noli Me Tangere pieces up-close and in-person was a magical experience. “Giotto in the city of Padua is small but on a wall that’s completely covered in incredible paintings and it is mind-blowing,” she said. “The one in Assisi covers the whole section of a ceiling in a chapel. In Sienna, Duccio’s are all tempera panels and that gives them a very particular sheen. ” Dr McCarthy said her research into the artworks involved the study of a number of aspects in context with the time in which they were produced. “First of all, I start with the Gospel and work very closely with John 20 : 11 - 18. I’ve looked at what resurrection is, the theology of resurrection and what that has meant to us over time,” she said. “Then I’ve looked at it in its original context when John wrote it and what was happening and why he was writing his Gospel. ” Dr McCarthy said a biased medieval-church perception of Mary Magdalene had contributed towards the quality of artworks depicting her at the time. “I’m looking at the Gospel through the eyes of medieval artists who were informed by theologians of the time, so I have researched the theology of the church in these different periods,” she said. “For example, in 1229, a hagiography (a tome depicting Saints lives) called The Golden Legend, was put together by Voragine, Archbishop of Milan, which was quite extensive. “Giotto painting in that time period would have known about it, as it was a big part of their belief system, and this would have greatly influenced his work and interpretation of Mary Magdalene. ” Dr McCarthy said as times progressed and new ideas were brought to the fore, the subtle changes in artwork became evident, helping her to pinpoint the influences of the period when they were created. “Some people within the church at the end of the thirteenth century were pushing for less of the formal theological idea in iconography and wanting to introduce more realism. Giotto was one of the first cabs off the rank in getting naturalism going,” she said. “For instance, instead of the subjects’ bodies displaying rigid and formal positions, we’ve got bodily form and curves coming through. “Duccio had a harder time with this because he was in Sienna and they were very fond of Byzantine art, so he had to try to use both old and new styles, which ended up being very successful. He maintained the tremendous gold splendour and things which were beautiful about the Byzantine style but he brought in this fabulous realism as well. “Fra Angelico kept the simplicity and beautiful clarity that came from the Giotto form and didn’t allow it to be restrained. ” Dr McCarthy said she revelled in the opportunity to explore the views of the past and that it allowed her to engage in a deeply spiritual journey and meditation on the evolution of Christianity. “For example, I think we’ve grown to be quite blasé about resurrection but we don’t really think about it as much these days. It’s not resuscitation, it is really something quite extraordinary and profound. It’s a cosmic event,” she said. “It’s <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tie down to an easy human experience because nobody else has experienced it. It was so profound that it shifted the community of believers into such an extraordinary place that 2000 years later, there are two billion Christians. ” Media Contact: Andrea Barnard (+ 61) 8 9433 0610, Mob (+ 61) 0408 959 13...|$|E
