5|$|By 1901, the {{population}} of Paris had grown to 2,715,000. At {{the beginning of the}} century, artists from around the world, including Picasso, Modigliani, and Matisse made Paris their home.

5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> {{have come into}} prominence, {{including}} multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays most {{construction}} {{firms have}} begun to use information management systems in their business to work more efficiently. At the same time, a lot of management information is being accumulated {{and some of the}} information can be reused to support the decision-making. Up to now, the information has not been reused so effectively in construction firms as expected. This paper introduces a <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> to reusing construction firm’s management information, which is based on BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology. In the paper, the current approaches are reviewed at first, and then the framework of the <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> is described. Next, the key issues of the <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> are clarified. Finally, a use case of the <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> is demonstrated. It is concluded that the <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> can be used in construction firms to better reuse the accumulated management information. </span...|$|R

Approved by voters in 2008, the line will connect Overlake Transit Center at Northeast 40th Street and Overlake Village station at 152nd Avenue Northeast to Seattle and Downtown Bellevue, crossing Lake Washington on the I-90 floating bridge. In 2024, the line will be extended along SR520 to Downtown Redmond, as part of Sound Transit 3. The rebuilt floating bridge was also designed to accommodate a future light rail extension, requiring supplemental pontoons and <b>new</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the <b>new</b> <b>approaches,</b> arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E

In 2008, Bolger informed the public that <b>New</b> <b>Approach</b> would go to Newmarket for the Guineas followed by a trip to the Curragh for the Irish 2,000 Guineas and then on for a tilt at the Irish Derby. <b>New</b> <b>Approach</b> finished second in both Guineas, however, behind the Ballydoyle trained Henrythenavigator. It then emerged that at the latest Epsom Derby forfeit stage, <b>New</b> <b>Approach's</b> name had been left in by mistake. A week later, Bolger revealed that his horse would go to Epsom after all, which led to much criticism from punters and bookmakers alike.

5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and {{cultural}} materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting {{to piece together}} its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} taken <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> to {{analyzing}} {{both traditional and}} modern Ethiopian historiography. For instance, Donald Crummey (1941–2013) investigated instances in Ethiopian historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, and gender. He also criticized earlier approaches made by Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960) and Richard Pankhurst (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the Ethiopian ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in Ethiopian historical works. Following the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the historical materialism of Marxist historiography came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding of Northeast African history. In her 2001 article Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review, Belete Bizuneh remarks {{that the impact of}} social history on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of women and gender in historical societies, but that Ethiopian historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: We propose <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> {{could be}} used to guide the {{selection}} of the "true" order of autoregressive model for different sample size. Approach: We used simulation study to compare four model selection criteria with and without the help of the <b>new</b> <b>approach.</b> The comparison of the four model selection criteria was in terms of their percentage of number of times that they identify the "true" order of autoregressive model with and without the help of the <b>new</b> <b>approach.</b> Results: The simulation results indicate that overall, the <b>new</b> proposed <b>approach</b> showed very good performance with all the four model selection criteria comparing to their performance without the help of the <b>new</b> <b>approach,</b> where the SBC, AICC and HQIC criteria provided the best performance for all the cases.

A <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> to two-dimensional radial flow permeability measurement with constant inlet pressure is proposed in part A of this paper.

It was demonstrated how the convergence chart can be used to check whether the experimental results follow the underlying assumptions of the model. Examples are given of acceptable and unacceptable measurements. Experimental design is introduced to investigate the variation of measured permeability between individual experimental runs. It was concluded that most of the observed variation was the result of flow front measurement sensors used in the experiment. Finally the <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> is compared with current methods. Differences are discussed. It is shown that the <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> extends the capabilities of current methods...|$|R
