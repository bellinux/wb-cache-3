The calcium carbonate particles had a particle size of 0. 7 mm and a stearic acid coating (1 %). Composites of 0 e 31. 5 vol% CaCO 3 content have been compounded and injection moulded. Studied are the morphology of the composites, the modulus, yield strength, the <b>notch</b> <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> {{strength and the}} temperature development in the deformation zone by infrared thermography. The thermal properties of the matrix remained unchanged upon addition of CaCO 3. With increasing particle content the modulus increased and the yield strength decreased.

With increasing particle content the notched impact resistance increased strongly. The notched impact energy at room temperature was increased from 10 to 80 kJ/m 2 and the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature was lowered to 80 C. At calcium carbonate contents higher that 16 vol% no further impact improvement was observed.

Pre-formed particles with poly(butyl-acrylate) core and a poly(methylmethacrylate) shell, ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 6 μm in diameter, were used as a toughening agent. The morphology was checked by means of transmission electron microscopy. The test methods involved an un-notched uniaxial tensile test, <b>notched</b> <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> and notched tensile testing. The experiments were carried out with varying deformation rates and temperatures. N. m. r. experiments were used to measure network densities in the rubber core of the various particles. Uniaxial tensile tests showed that elastic modulus and yield stress of the blends were independent of particle size and network density of the rubber core. There were, however, some differences in cavitation resistance caused by the differences in network density. Easily cavitating particles produced higher toughness in <b>notched</b> <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> and notched tensile test but a clear relation with particle size could not be established for the range studied. The brittle-tough transition temperatures were much higher than for materials based on poly(butadiene) core-shell rubbers.

After 300 thermal cycles, the beneficial effect of moisture was negated, likely due to an increase in damage from freeze/thaw expansion of the water, and a reduction in the overall moisture state in the composite.

40|$|Polycarbonate {{is widely}} used as a {{transparent}} protective material because of its low density and excellent mechanical properties. However, when defects such as cracks or notches are introduced, it is subject to catastrophic brittle failure at relatively low loads. Notched Izod testing is a common qualitative measure of toughness of a material, measuring energy absorbed prior to failure under high triaxiality and high rate loading conditions. Much {{research has been done}} using Izod testing to compare the fracture energies of blends of Polycarbonate and rubbery materials; however the specific yielding and fracture mechanisms associated with each blend are rarely analyzed. This study presents detailed images, fracture energies, and time durations of the deformation and failure processes actively occurring during the Notched Izod testing of 3. 23 mm and 6. 35 mm thick Polycarbonate specimens, as well as of a quasi-static version of Notched Izod bending. The thin specimens were found to yield in a ductile manner followed by tearing across most of the ligament width, resulting in a final failure including a small plastically-deformed ligament hinging the two failure surfaces in both the <b>Notched</b> <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> and Quasi-Static tests. (cont). The thick specimens exhibited slight yielding followed by catastrophic failure, where the crack initiated ahead of the notch and then propagating back towards the notch root as well as across the remaining ligament [...] In the thick Izod tests local pre-failure yielding was evident at the notch root resulting in extensive blunting of the notch. The fracture energies per unit thickness for the thin specimens were almost a full order of magnitude larger than those for the thick specimens. A finite element simulation for the <b>Notched</b> <b>Izod</b> <b>Impact</b> test was developed using the Arruda and Boyce(1988) constitutive model of polymers as modified by Mulliken and Boyce(2004) for high rate deformation. The 3. 23 mm <b>Notched</b> <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> test was successfully modeled from initial contact of the pendulum through initiation of failure and early tearing. The yielding patterns and failure occurred along the same lines as in the experiment where diagonal shear bands and lobes initiate plastic deformation from the notch tip and tearing progresses in a horizontal manner across the specimen width. An extensive shear yielded region is observed ahead of the propagating tear. The 6. 35 mm thick model shows the beginning of the formation pressure concentration which causes brittle fracture, but further refinement of the mesh needs to be performed for more accurate modeling. by Meredith N.

40|$|Nylon 6, 6 is {{regarded}} as tough and ductile materials since it exhibit high tensile elongation to break and high drop weight impactstrengths. However, under conditions of stress concentration {{such as in the}} presence of sharp notches or cracks, polyamides exhibit brittle failure. This property, evaluated as <b>notched</b> <b>Izod</b> or Charpy <b>impact</b> tests, indicates that unmodified polyamides exhibit relatively low energies for crack propagation. Crystalline thermoplastic polymeric materials such as low carbon monomer nylons are very sensitive to craze and crack propagation and so their toughness and impact resistance properties are relatively low. Nylon 6 and 6, 6 are relatively low cost engineering thermoplastics that have been found so many applications including automotive industry. However, relatively low impact and bending resistance of these materials especially at low temperatures and high deformation rates, restrict applications of these materials. Rubber toughening can be considered as an economical and effective method to toughen and extend applications of nylon without any important increase in its price or decrease in its engineering properties. Many rubbers such as EPR, EPDM (ethylene propylene- diene monomers), NR (nitrile rubber), SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber), and SEBS (styrene ethylene- butadiene-styrene tri-block copolymer) have been successfully used in toughening of thermoplastic materials. However, most rubbers are not compatible with nylon and cannot be finely dispersed in it. To overcome this deficiency, polyamides have been blended with several types of impact modifiers that are typically elastomeric or low modulus type olefinic polymers. However, the inherent immiscibility of polyamides with other polymers such as olefinic rubbers necessitated the development of proper compatibilization techniques to reduce the interfacial tension and improve thedispersability of the rubber for effective impact modification. This development in the area of nylon 6, 6 /EPDM blend may give the more advantageous characteristics of the presently available nylon and may compensate the deficiencies of the same...|$|R
