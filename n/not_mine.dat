5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did <b>not</b> <b>mine</b> it because their government had sent them to find gold, not copper.|$|E

I have never uttered such words and denounce such small-minded thoughts.” He blamed the articles on several ghostwriters who had contributed to the newsletters, which {{he said he did not}} edit, while he was busy practicing medicine full-time.|$|E
25|$|The work at Dartford thus {{came to a}} halt. In {{a report}} in 1581 Schutz' design for the Dartford furnace was blamed, but recent modern {{research}} has shown that the real problem was that the 1400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island were not gold-bearing. Hogarth concluded that since Schutz had attempted to buy all the ore himself, he was unlikely to have tampered with the tests, and the 'inescapable conclusion' is that the assay method was at fault, perhaps because of contamination from additives necessarily used in the process. McDermott also notes that Schutz' original test while he was on Countess of Warwick Island had been on a 'rich red ore' from Jonas' Mount, but little of that ore was brought back on the 1577 voyage because the ships were already laden with black ore before the red ore was found, and Frobisher did <b>not</b> <b>mine</b> at Jonas' Mount on the 1578 voyage. Moreover, the original black stone had been found by Garrard on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage, and according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'.|$|E

In the match, on 6 June, he entered as a substitute for Giampaolo Pazzini in the 62nd minute and scored a goal 11 minutes later in the 3–0 win. Regarding his debut with the national squad, he stated, [...] "It's a dream that came true. L'azzurra is the cherry on the cake of an extraordinary season.
