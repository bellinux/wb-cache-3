For example, Dharavi slum of Mumbai – {{now one of the}} largest slums in India, used to be a village referred to as Koliwadas, and Mumbai used to be referred as Bombay. In 1887, the British colonial government expelled all tanneries, other <b>noxious</b> <b>industry</b> and poor natives who worked in the peninsular part of the city and colonial housing area, to what was back then the northern fringe of the city – a settlement now called Dharavi. This settlement attracted no colonial supervision or investment in terms of road infrastructure, sanitation, public services or housing. The poor moved into Dharavi, found work as servants in colonial offices and homes and in the foreign owned tanneries and other polluting industries near Dharavi. To live, the poor built shanty towns within easy commute to work. By 1947, the year India became an independent nation of the commonwealth, Dharavi had blossomed into Bombay's largest slum.|$|E
5000|$|Another strong {{impetus for}} urban villages {{has been growing}} disenchantment with the urban sprawl that has {{characterized}} the development of many cities since World War II. Urban villages are seen to create self-contained communities that reduce the need to travel large distances and reduce the subsequent reliance on the automobile. The decline of <b>noxious</b> <b>industry</b> {{and the emergence of}} the service economy allows the mixing of employment and residential activities without detriment to residents. This is in contrast to the single-use zoning that helped fuel urban sprawl during the industrial and manufacturing eras. Through more consolidated development, urban villages can reduce the intrusion of urban growth on the countryside. These environmental consequences of urban sprawl have come to dominate discussion promoting urban villages in recent years.|$|E

5|$|The siting of <b>noxious</b> <b>industries,</b> such as tanning and fulling {{downwind}} {{outside the}} boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls. The foul-smelling industries partially preferred the East End because the prevailing winds in London traveled from west to east (i.e. it was downwind {{from the rest of the}} city), meaning that most odors from their businesses would not go into the city but outside, and thereby reduced complaints.|$|R

50|$|Although Cremorne was {{a largely}} {{residential}} area {{in its early}} history, {{the banks of the}} Yarra became home to many so-called <b>noxious</b> <b>industries,</b> such as tanneries and soap makers, as well as the Richmond Power Station, which opened in 1891. In the 20th century Cremorne became increasingly industrial. Large manufacturing complexes were built, including the Bryant and May and Rosella factories. In the mid 20th century light industry flooded into the area, with the construction of hundreds of small to medium-sizes factories which were occupied by the rag trade, mechanics, printers and small engineering businesses.|$|R
50|$|Wentworth Park was {{not always}} a {{football}} oval. It commenced its life as a creek and swamp, known from the 1830s as Blackwattle Cove Swamp. Between the 1830s and 1860s various <b>noxious</b> <b>industries</b> were established along the shore, including, in particular, abattoirs and boiling down works. The pollution from these works so befouled the swamp that even after the removal of these establishments from the area, the local council lobbied to have the area in-filled because of the stench that continued to arise from the water and mud.|$|R

40|$|This article {{documents}} how a small, oppressed, {{and seemingly}} powerless community in Lou-isiana persevered {{to defeat the}} strategic plans of a multinational chemical company that was supported by local and state government elites. The evolving construct of environmental jus-tice played a significant part in this battle as community groups formed coalitions with local, state, and national agents and organizations to challenge the decision to site a hazardous facility. Lawsuits resulted in costs, lengthy delays, and uncertainty for the corporation, lead-ing Shintech to abandon its original site of choice. Data were gathered from media archives and coded and analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Implications of the study are discussed for stakeholder theory, environmental justice scholars, and community advocacy groups, as {{it is even more}} clear from this landmark case that <b>noxious</b> <b>industries</b> can be thwarted as they attempt expansion, start-up, or even permit renewal, especially in minority or economically deprived communities...|$|R
50|$|In Pre-European {{times the}} Wolli Valley {{was home to}} the Bidjigal clan who relied on the bushland for food and shelter. After European {{settlement}} land uses began to effect {{the ecology of the}} area by drastically changing the animals and plants found here. Trees were cut down and the cleared land used for orchards, market gardens, dairies, poultry and pig farming. Later European settlement affected the landforms of the area. The land was used for <b>noxious</b> <b>industries</b> such as making tallow from animal carcasses and wool scouring. The construction of the Illawarra railway in 1882 altered the flow of Wolli Creek and caused floodwater to drain into it. In 1890 construction of a sewer network began for the drainage of Sydney’s suburbs. Small scale stone quarrying on the Turrella side of Wolli Creek occurred during the 19th and early 20th Century and the sandstone was used for local buildings. The old quarry is located in the bushland below Highcliff Road, east of Turrella Reserve. A dam was built on Cooks River at Tempe which caused problems in the flow of Cooks River and Wolli Creek. These historical land uses have resulted in changes to flow regimes, soils and vegetation within the park.|$|R
5000|$|Four mixed groups {{comprising}} 10 students {{each from}} Japan and Lithuania generated ideas {{aimed at the}} recovery of a problematic area. The point at issue - Park of Architecture, an area of about 58 hectares {{in one of the}} most beautiful locations in close proximity to Vilnius Old Town. Since the 19th century, <b>noxious</b> and polluting <b>industries</b> were developed there, which resulted in the loss of interface between the area and its natural environment, architectural integrity and broken functional and social links with the city.

40|$|Often {{regarded}} as exceptional in its degree of economic decline, conditions {{of abandonment and}} population loss, the city of Detroit has garnered the attention of media, academics and planning professionals. Significant to this draw {{is the role of}} development ‘expertise’ and its hopes of mitigating the challenges of the city through largely economically motivated development strategies. A number of scholars contributing to the literature on political economy have related expertise to neoliberal agendas, contending that the status of experts relies on the economic rationalization of policy decisions. In the context of Detroit, I will explore the role of development experts (practitioners formally trained in development professions) at a time of economic restructuring, and the discursive practices employed to reproduce their status as experts; I will also explore the communities that resist such expertise. I used discourse analysis to compare the values and rationale for redevelopment strategies as presented in four discourses: 1) urban planning academia; 2) media; 3) development professionals and 4) community groups. More specifically, I aim to understand how the narratives within differently situated development discourses frame problems and prescribe solutions and how such narratives relate to worsening disparity across race and class groups. In addition to exploring the narratives that give leverage to the economically motivated and state sanctioned development strategies that dominate planning discourse, this work focuses on the resistance to these strategies through political mobilization of community groups. These explorations focus primarily on two disparate development landscapes: Downtown-Midtown, an area of burgeoning, state-subsidized private investment, and the 48217 zip code, an area with some of the worst air quality in the state, undergoing state supported expansion of <b>noxious</b> <b>industries.</b> From these explorations, I conclude that discourse on the development of Downtown-Midtown is largely framed by a handful of private investors deemed development experts, and the philanthropic foundation community that bolsters their interests. These individuals and institutions utilize their expertise in branding campaigns that simultaneously attract a wealthier class of young professionals to the city’s core, {{while at the same time}} pathologize outer neighborhoods of the city not seen as fit for investment. Building from the racialized historic context of the 48217 zip code, community groups were found to mirror the strategies of neoliberal expertise in their efforts to stop the expansion of industry, to no avail. This points to a more complex power dynamic between experts and supposed non-experts than the literature currently offers. Finally, this dissertation considers the ways that both the media and academic planning discourse potentially denigrate lower income and communities of color in the city, treating them as outside of the goals of dominant development discourse...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} deliver {{large amounts}} of electricity with a very small footprint of CO 2 and other <b>noxious</b> emissions. <b>Industry</b> is still {{a significant source of}} emissions, responsible for about 24 % of EU’s consumption of fossil fuels and concomitant emission of CO 2. Therefore, for a CO 2 curbing policy to be successful, it must include the reduction of fossil fuel use in industry. This would also help avoid issues related to "carbon leakage", loss of tax income and jobs, and it would enhance energy security. Expansion of nuclear power in this new market would provide substantial environmental, economic, societal and geopolitical benefits which go way beyond pure classical economic analysis, e. g. in the form of LCOE. The NC 2 I-R project was run from 2013 to 2015, co-financed by the European Commission and was an "executive" project of the European nuclear stakeholder platform SNETP and specifically one of its pillars, the Nuclear Cogeneration Industrial Initiative (NC 2 I). Building on an earlier project called EUROPAIRS, NC 2 I-R has first clarified the NC 2 I governance. This was important to establish NC 2 I as an interlocutor for national and European programs, industrial stakeholders and regional/national authorities. A large activity consisted in drawing an inventory of all infrastructures and competences which are crucial for the establishment of new nuclear cogeneration, both at the scale of demonstration and of industrial deployment. This stock-taking spanned in particular the EU, but also reached out to selected countries overseas where use of nuclear cogeneration was/is industrial practice or planned for the future. A second large activity investigated the requirements regarding the licensing process, safety demonstration and R&D needs of a nuclear co-generation system. Technology state-of-the-art and previous experience gained from licensing of existing and past nuclear cogeneration facilities in Europe and overseas were gathered and reviewed which led to a roadmap for licensing a new installation in Europe. Demonstration and deployment options for nuclear cogeneration were identified and modeled to evaluate and rank them according to industrial and/or policy-driven interests. More detailed economics analyses were performed including sensitivity studies. These included factors influencing the economics & financing, and conditions of economic viability. General specifications for a demonstrator program including siting were defined, and the most promising chemical industry sites in Europe were mapped. As nuclear cogeneration is still a little known technology, NC 2 I-R emphasized communication and dissemination of the results to European and non-European audiences: nuclear and conventional industry including the NGNP Industry Alliance in the US, safety organizations, international institutions (OECD/NEA, IAEA, GIF), and the general public. This paper delivers the key results from the NC 2 I-R project and outlines the way forward for successful demonstration and deployment of nuclear cogeneration technology with High Temperature Reactors.

40|$|The {{disturbing}} current situation regarding the world climate has initiated a major wave of urgent developments towards decreasing the overall impact of human {{activities on the}} living environment. A major role player in this development is the automobile industry that is inherently connected to pollution of various types, be it air, water or noise pollution. There have been drastic changes {{not only in the}} technologies employed in producing vehicles and components, but also in the construction and technologies built into modern automobiles to lessen the overall environmental impact of the <b>industry.</b> <b>Noxious</b> emissions have been decreased, overall efficiencies increased and vehicles are becoming more economical with each new generation. Stricter laws dictate that the level of acceptable vehicle emissions is to be decreased ever further and all manufacturers are developing various possibilities to achieve this. With the emergence of hybrid vehicle technology, there was also a sudden development of different electrical systems that were made viable by the higher onboard voltage systems employed in hybrid vehicles. One of these developments was the electrical air conditioning compressor for use in automobile applications. Although it is designed to operate with a higher voltage than the traditional 12 V onboard vehicle systems, it is theoretically possible to incorporate it into a 12 V system by making use of a DC-DC converter to step up the supply voltage of the electrical compressor sufficiently to allow for its successful operation. The question therefore arises whether it would be feasible and sensible to employ an electrical air conditioning system in conventional combustion engine vehicles from an overall fuel consumption and vehicle emissions point of view. A modelling approach was taken where an overall vehicle driving simulation was created to represent an average modern production vehicle. The simulation was then extended to include the options of incorporating models for both mechanically and electrically driven air conditioning systems. This provides insight into the influences of the air conditioning system on the vehicle’s overall fuel consumption and an opportunity to compare the influences from the two different systems. This study attempted to provide answers to some of the viability questions regarding the incorporation of electrically driven air conditioning systems into vehicles that use standard 12 V onboard voltage systems. It was found that the electrical system has definite potential as a viable replacement option for the conventional system should it be combined with an appropriate alternator and equipped with an efficient control syste...|$|R
