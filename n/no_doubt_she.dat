5|$|The Harajuku Lovers Tour was {{the first}} solo concert tour of American {{recording}} artist Gwen Stefani. The tour began through October to November 2005, to support of her debut studio album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). Although Stefani embarked on multiple tours with her band <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> initially opted {{not to participate in}} a tour to promote her album, an attitude that the singer eventually abandoned due to the commercial success of Love. Angel. Music. Baby.|$|E
25|$|Once accused, Miss Gilchrist {{breaks down}} in a flood of {{complaints}} of the hardships {{of her life and}} fantasies about a new teashop. She goes quietly with Inspector Morton. Thus Poirot answered the question Mr Entwhistle hired him to resolve, and untangled the mystery of Cora's death. Miss Gilchrist is found guilty at trial. In her time in prison during legal proceedings, she is quickly becoming insane, planning one tea shop after another. Mr Entwhistle and Hercule Poirot suspect her punishment might be served in Broadmoor, but have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> had plotted and carried out the cold blooded murder in full possession of her faculties – this ladylike murderer.|$|E
25|$|Countess de Ficquelmont met Alexander Pushkin during fall 1829 {{and often}} {{invited him to}} her Saint Petersburg Palace. They became friends. In 1922 {{historian}} Mstislav Tsiavlovski published the writings of poet Nachtchokine (Pushkin's friend): according to Barteniev, Pushkin {{was in love with}} a brilliant socialite noblewoman holding a salon in Saint Petersburg. Even if the lady is not named, <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> is Countess de Ficquelmont. Ficquelmont's palace is also believed to be the frame for the old Countess' palace in Pushkin's story The Queen of Spades. Pushkin would also have depicted his own feelings for Dolly through Hermann's love for Lise. However, historian Leonid Grossman has said Pushkin only saw himself as a new Boccaccio. Indeed, the relationship between Countess de Ficquelmont and her husband was perfect.|$|E

25|$|The Song of Dermot and the Earl and Expugnatio Hibernica {{follow the}} same pattern, portraying Derbforgaill’s {{abduction}} in 1152 and Mac Murchada’s banishment in 1166 as occurring at the same time. The Song claims that Derbforgaill {{had fallen in love}} with Diarmait, who in turn only made a pretense of loving her, in an effort to entice her away from Ua Ruairc, as a means of avenging previous wrongs inflicted by Leth Cuinn (the northern half of Ireland) upon Leth Moga (the southern half of Ireland). She subsequently arranged for a rendezvous from which he could carry her back to Laigin unchallenged. Ua Ruairc is then said to have complained to the (unnamed) king of Connacht, who convinced Mac Murchada’s allies to abandon him and force him into exile. In the events as narrated by the Song (and to a degree the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the Annals of the Four Masters) Derbforgaill is clearly a dupe, but in Gerald of Wales’s Expugnatio Hibernica she becomes more blameworthy:On an occasion when Ua Ruairc king of Meath had gone off on an expedition to far distant parts, his wife, Ua Máelechlainn's daughter, whom he had left on an island in Meath, was abducted by the aforesaid Diramait, who had long been burning with love for her and took advantage of her husband's absence. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> was abducted because she wanted to be and, since 'woman is always a fickle and inconstant creature', she herself arranged that she should become the kidnapper's prize.Almost all the world's most notable catastrophes have been caused by women, witness Mark Antony and Troy. King Ua Ruairc was stirred to extreme anger on two counts, of which however the disgrace, rather than the loss of his wife, grieved him more deeply, and he vented all the venom of his fury with a view to revenge. And so he called together and mustered his own forces and those of neighbouring peoples, and roused to the same purpose Ruaidrí, prince of Connacht and at that time supreme ruler of all Ireland. The men of Leinster, seeing that their prince was now in a difficult position and surrounded on all sides by his enemies' forces, sought to pay him back, and recalled to mind injustices which they had long concealed and stored deep in their hearts.. They made common cause with his enemies, and the men of rank among this people deserted Mac Murchada along with his good fortune... he finally trusted his life to the sea in flight, and so to speak had recourse to this last hope of saving himself.In addition to the classical references to Mark Antony and Troy, the quotation used by Gerald is from Mercury's pushing Aeneis to leave Dido and fulfill his fate by sailing to Italy, in the Aeneid.|$|E
500|$|Despite Seymour's statement, Williams {{maintained}} {{that he was}} innocent of the murder and the burglary, saying that [...] "whoever did that did it to get to [...] papers for political purposes. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> is mixed up in some foreign political business. I would not commit a crime like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Stefani joined <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would {{let me have a}} baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle {{the ups and downs of}} their relationship.|$|E

Taste is our weak point in America, and in the rural regions--well, there isn't any taste above that for shortcake, dollar chromos and the New York Repository." ...|$|R
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} as a solo artist, Stefani has won several music awards, {{including}} one Grammy Award, four MTV Video Music Awards, one American Music Award, one Brit Award, and two Billboard Music Awards. With <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> has won two Grammy Awards. In 2005, Rolling Stone called her [...] "the only true female rock star left on radio or MTV" [...] and featured her on the magazine's cover. Stefani received the Style Icon Award at the first People Magazine Awards in 2014. Additionally in 2016, the singer was honored at the Radio Disney Music Awards with a Hero Award, which is given to artists based on their personal contributions to various charitable works.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, {{following}} Stefani's {{work with}} <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> {{enlisted the help}} of Greg Kurstin to write and produce songs for her upcoming third studio album. After Stefani's 2014 single releases, [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Spark the Fire", received mixed responses, she scrapped all of her completed material for the opportunity to start fresh. A year later, Stefani enlisted other potential collaborators, like Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, for work on the album shortly after she announced her divorce from Gavin Rossdale. Stefani later revealed that during the writing of several songs, including [...] "Rare", she and Michaels had taken [...] "stream-of-conscious" [...] lyrics from her computer and fit them into melodies.|$|E
500|$|American Canadian {{linguist}} William J. Samarin noted Armstrong conflated {{tone and}} intonation {{for the most}} part; he claimed this led to [...] "exaggerated complexities" [...] in her description, {{particularly with respect to}} the final intonational fall in interrogatives. When Armstrong wrote her manuscript, analysis of tone was a nascent field and the complex relationship between phonemic tonemes and phonetic pitch led phoneticians to analyze languages as having large numbers of tones. In 1952, SOAS linguist Lyndon Harries was able to take Armstrong's data and analyze Kikuyu tone as only having two underlying tone levels. American linguist Mary Louise Pratt also re-analyzed Armstrong's Kikuyu data as only having two levels. Pratt also noted Armstrong did not distinguish allophonically long vowels from vowels which are phonemically long. University of Nairobi linguist Kevin C. Ford wrote that if Armstrong had not died before completing this book [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> could have expanded her range of data and probably presented some rigorous analysis, which is sadly lacking in the published work". The American phonologist Nick Clements described Armstrong's book in a 1984 paper as [...] "an extremely valuable source of information due to the comprehensiveness of its coverage and accuracy of the author's phonetic observations".|$|E

500|$|Unlike Tandy, Nappi did {{not read}} the books before {{illustrating}} them; instead, his wife read them and provided him with a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting. Nappi's first cover was for The Clue of the Velvet Mask, where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as [...] "bobby-soxer... a contemporary sixteen-year-old. This Nancy was perky, clean-cut, and extremely animated. In {{the majority of his}} covers Nancy looks startled– which, <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>she</b> was." [...] Nancy's style is considerably conservative, and remains so during the psychedelic period. Although she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high-necked and with long hemlines. Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers he simply updated the color scheme, clothing style, and hairstyles of the characters but retains their original poses in similar settings. Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story. These Nappi covers would later be used for the opening credits of the television production, with photos of Pamela Sue Martin inserted on the book covers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1800, the Duchess {{prepared}} Little G for her {{presentation at}} court. The task was difficult; débutantes {{were expected to}} display grace and dignity or face the ruin of their first London season. However, young Georgiana had not inherited her mother's poise and ease of movement, and tended to keep her head down. Her court dress, complemented with the Cavendish diamonds, was considered a dramatic success [...] Soon after, she came out in society during a ball held in her honour. Lady Holland observed Georgiana and described her as [...] "a most charming girl–sensible, pleasing, full of information and totally without a particle of affectation, and if she bestows herself upon a man equal to her situation, I have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> will make a most delightful wife".|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> was {{a wicked}} person, and <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> had murdered Ustane {{when she stood}} in her path, but then she was very faithful, and by a law of nature man is apt to think but lightly of a woman's crimes, {{especially}} if that woman be beautiful, and the crime be committed {{for the love of}} him.|$|E

Faith, Captain, I don't wonder that the men are wild about her. I never saw such eyes in my life, or such a grand manner. I am sure she is as intellectual as she is beautiful; and I have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she's</b> as good as she is clever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too Catholic-Apostolic for her, I suppose? <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> {{called them}} popish images and talked of the {{invocation}} of saints." ...|$|E
