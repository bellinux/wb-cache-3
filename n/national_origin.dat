5|$|Title VIII of the Act, {{commonly}} known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or <b>national</b> <b>origin</b> (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, <b>national</b> <b>origin,</b> illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or <b>national</b> <b>origin</b> (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon <b>national</b> <b>origin</b> and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points {{is that there are}} several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to <b>national</b> <b>origin</b> and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there is a relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
5|$|Sherman paid greater {{attention}} to foreign affairs {{during the second half}} of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the <b>national</b> <b>origin</b> of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Origins</b> Formula (1921-65) {{was meant}} to {{maintain}} the status quo demographic-group percentages of colored ethnic populations in proportion to the white ethnic populations. The eugenicist purpose of the <b>National</b> <b>Origins</b> Formula was that the immigration of colored peoples not change the WASP national character of the U.S. To that end, the <b>National</b> <b>Origins</b> Formula allowed only the yearly immigration of 150,000 colored people to the U.S., and specifically included Latin Americans and excluded Asians; thus, Yellow Peril racism was institutionally inherent to U.S. immigration law, yet, 45 years later, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 repealed the racial-quota systems of the 1920s.|$|R

50|$|With {{the passage}} of the {{sweeping}} Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the country's immigration system was reformed and all <b>national</b> <b>origins</b> quotas dating from the 1920s were removed. The percentage of foreign-born in the United States increased from 5% in 1965 to 14% in 2016. Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law, which was not one of his priorities; he had supported the restrictive Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers. Regardless, the Immigration and Nationality Act dramatically changed the ethnic composition of the United States, ending the <b>National</b> <b>Origins</b> Formula which had heavily favored European immigrants. The act also prioritized family reunification over the <b>national</b> <b>origins</b> of potential immigrants. Johnson also signed the Cuban Adjustment Act, which granted Cuban refugees an easier path to permanent residency and citizenship.|$|R

Priority was given to those with skills and family in United States. Since the 1960s, Chinese have immigrated to the United States in significant numbers, taking particular advantage of the immigration policy’s emphasis on family reunification. In 2010, there were an estimated 3.7 million Chinese Americans.|$|R
