40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} the success of pregnancy through in vitro fertilization and maternal age. Methods Assessment of pregnancy was performed in eight in vitro fertilization centers in Indonesia: Harapan Kita Pediatric and Obstetric Hospital from 1997 to 2001, and seven in vitro fertilization centers in Indonesia. Follicular induction was performed through the long protocol, short protocol and <b>natural</b> cycle. <b>Insemination</b> was performed through ICSI (intra cytoplasmic sperm injection) on petri dish. Spermatozoa were obtained through masturbation, testicular biopsy and epididimical biopsy. A successful pregnancy was indicated chemically, with the presence of fetal heart beat and the birth of a baby (take home baby). Results There was a 34 % pregnancy rate for the age group below 30 years, 33. 75 % for those between 31 and 35 years olds, and 26 % for the age group 36 to 40 years old, and 8 % for the age group above 40 years.

ET calves were constrained to 0 for maternal breed and breed heterozygosity effects. Random effects included direct and maternal additive genetic. The regression coefficient for HET (4. 09 ? 0. 96 kg) (P < 0. 001) The regression coefficient for GI was ? 4. 24 ? 0. 95 kg (P < 0. 001). XCHR has a probable role but was antagonized {{by the presence of}} NONRP in the model. This is likely due to insufficient data and structure available to partition the effects.

Artificial <b>Insemination</b> has been in commercial use since 1937, but its origins {{can be traced back to}} 1667 when Leeuwenhoek saw the first spermatozoa through the newly developed microscope. This discovery would be built upon nearly a century later when Spallanzi an Italian scientist discovered that a dog could be impregnated with the cellular portion of semen.

He observed that the spermatozoa could be suspended or, “inactivated, ” by cooling them and then could be inseminated at a later date. The idea of artificial insemination would be furthered by the Russians in the 1990 ’s when Professor Ivanov developed methods for collecting semen and inseminating horses, cattle, sheep and swine.

40|$|After <b>natural</b> or {{artificial}} <b>insemination,</b> the spermatozoon {{starts a}} {{journey from the}} site of deposition to the place of fertilization. However, only a small subset of the spermatozoa deposited achieves their goal: to reach and fertilize the egg. Factors involved in controlling sperm transport and fertilization include the female reproductive tract environment, cell-cell interactions, gene expression, and phenotypic sperm traits. Some of the significant determinants of fertilization are known (i. e., motility or DNA status), but many sperm traits are still indecipherable. One example is the influence of sperm dimensions and shape upon transport within the female genital tract towards the oocyte. Biophysical associations between sperm size and motility may influence the progression of spermatozoa through the female reproductive tract, but uncertainties remain concerning how sperm morphology influences the fertilization process, and whether only the sperm dimensions per se are involved. Moreover, such explanations do not allow the possibility that the female tract is capable of distinguishing fertile spermatozoa {{on the basis of their}} morphology, as seems to be the case with biochemical, molecular, and genetic properties.

Many mahouts thus mate their female elephants. Unfortunately, <b>natural</b> <b>insemination</b> and birthing is time consuming and expensive. An easy way around this is the illegal capture of baby elephants from wild herds.

40|$|Neospora caninum {{represents}} one of the most frequent abortifaciant organisms worldwide. The parasite is diaplacentally transmitted from the pregnant cow to the fetus, where it normally leads to the delivery of a healthy, however persistently infected calf. Abortion thus is a relative rare event. The transmission of bovine neosporosis occurs in more than 90 % of the cases vertically due to the endogenous reactivation of a persistently infected mother. Exogenous infections are therefore responsible for less than 10 % of the cases. The question arises about which infection sources may be relevant in this context. In Switzerland, the role of dogs as definitive hosts {{has been shown to be}} of low significance in that respect. Recently, discussion focused on the potential of infectious bull semen following <b>natural</b> or artificial <b>insemination.</b> Thus, a few years ago a report documented the detectability of N. caninum-DNA in the semen of naturally infected bulls by nested-PCR. As a consequence, we decided to gain own experience by investigating 5 separate semen specimens per animal, originating from 20 N. caninum-seropositive bulls used for artificial insemination in Switzerland.

We have found an enormous variability, but we have observed that the minimal number of spermatozoa free of defects assuring a normal fertility seems to be a little higher than 2 x 10 (6). The second and third examples concern varicocele and assisted fertilization. In both cases the formula allows a precise simultaneous evaluation of the totality of studied characters and a determination of the number of spermatozoa free from defects. This comparative analysis shows that the formula is sufficiently sensitive to distinguish the different degrees of the varicocele condition and the various possibilities of fertility power in cases of <b>natural</b> or artificial <b>insemination.</b> In this way we will easily control the level of improvement of sperm quality in cases of varicocele treated pharmacologically or surgically, or we will better predict the success of artificial insemination...|$|R

40|$|An {{egg yolk}} is a common {{component}} of diluents used as protectants of sperm cells {{during the process}} of cryopreservation. Its substitution by low density lipoproteins (LDL) has shown that it is the LDL that provides the egg yolk with its cryoprotective characteristics: it protects sperms against cold shock and other changes, thus helping to preserve their fertilization ability even after the freezing-thawing process. However, the sperm quality is affected by many other internal and external factors. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate if the effect of the addition of LDL to the diluent of the ejaculate is significantly influenced by the following selected factors - the type of used diluent, the bull´s breed and its individuality and the date of the sampling. Experimental insemination doses were repetitively (four times) obtained from a group of six bulls (three Holstein bulls and three Czech Fleckvieh bulls) at the <b>Natural</b> Hradišťko <b>insemination</b> service s. r. o. The samples of semen were diluted with two types of non-egg diluents containing soybean lecithin extracts (AndoMed and BioXCell). To each of these diluents, LDL at 4, 6, and 8 % concentration was added; a non-LDL diluent served as a check. All the insemination doses were frozen by a standard procedure and then stored in liquid nitrogen. The CASA system (Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis) was selected for the evaluation of the sperm motility. Immediately after thawing and then after two hours of incubation in water bath (37 °C), the values of kinematic parameters were obtained from the samples - the total percentage of motile sperm and the percentage of progressively motile sperm. These data were then statistically processed; based on the outputs, VAP, VCL, ALH and the percentage of progressively motile sperm (PMOT) were chosen as representative kinematic parameters. The values of the parameters were higher in almost all evaluated samples diluted with BioXCell, compared to those diluted with AndroMed. Even though we demonstrated the existence of a high variability of results depending on the time of incubation, bull breed, the individuality of the bull and the date of the sampling, it could be said that the best concentration of added LDL is 6 % for BioXCell and 8 % for AndroMed. It would be useful to perform more experiments evaluating the effect of adding LDL to non-egg diluents on the quality of the thawed sperm. In these experiments, more sperm quality parameters should be examined and factors influencing the variability of results demonstrated in this work should be taken into consideration...|$|R

Ten queens were tested {{in each of the}} 12 combinations. Queens were reared using standard beekeeping methods (Doolittle/grafting) and emerged from their cells into vials held in an incubator at 34 C. All 12 combinations gave high survival (90 or 100 %) for three days but only one method (wooden cage, with attendants, honey) gave 100 % survival to day seven. Factors affecting queen survival were analysed. Across all combinations, attendant bees significantly increased survival (18 % vs. 53 %, p< 0. 001). In addition, there was an interaction between food type and cage type (p< 0. 001) with the honey and plastic cage combination giving reduced survival. An additional group of queens was reared and held for seven days using the best method, and then directly introduced using smoke into queenless nucleus colonies that had been dequeened five days previously. Acceptance was high (80 %, 8 / 10) showing that this combination is also suitable for preparing queens for introduction into colonies. Having a simple method for keeping newly-emerged virgin queens alive in cages for one week and acceptable for introduction into queenless colonies will be useful in honey bee breeding. In particular, it facilitates the screening of many queens for genetic or phenotypic characteristics when only a small proportion meets the desired criteria.
