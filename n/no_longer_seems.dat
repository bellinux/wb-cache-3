25|$|Today, {{this theory}} {{is no longer}} accepted. In 1989, Egyptologist Nabil Swelim {{examined}} the pyramid more precisely {{and found that it}} was made of small mud bricks, with a quarter of its inner core hewn out of a natural bedrock. The rock core itself contained several rock-cut tombs dating back to the 5th and 6th dynasty. Swelim and others Egyptologists, such as Toby Wilkinson, point out that it would be surprising for a royal pyramid to have been completely destroyed less than 300 years after its construction, only to be re-used for simple rock-cut tombs. Additionally, he points to the unusual geographic position of the pyramid: Old Kingdom pyramids were commonly built on high grounds, while the pyramid Lepsius I lies on a flat plain. Thus, the datation of this monument to the late 3rd dynasty <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seems</b> tenable.|$|E
25|$|The Acorn Archimedes version, ArcElite (1991), {{written by}} Warren Burch & Clive Gringras and {{regarded}} by Stuff magazine {{as the best}} conversion of the original game, added intelligent opponents who engage in their own private battles and police who take an active interest in protecting the law. As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using polygon mesh graphics {{in place of the}} wire-frames. The game world <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seems</b> to be centred around the player; freighter fleets with escorts go about their own business, pirate formations patrol lawless systems looking for cargo to loot and mining ships can often be found breaking up asteroids for their mineral content. Unlike the mythical Generation Ships of the original, rare occurrences of other non-pirate entities mentioned in the manual really {{can be found in the}} Archimedes version: geometric formations of space beacons; hermits living among the asteroids; abandoned ships towed by police (although Dredgers and Generation Ships are confirmed not to exist in Archimedes Elite). The Archimedes version of Elite was originally written to be a space trading game called Trojan - however the obvious similarities eventually meant that to avoid a potential lawsuit Trojan had to become an official Elite conversion. ArcElite was one of a number of games released for free by The Icon Bar website in 2006.|$|E

The series has been described as both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre. Mike Hale of The New York Times described it as [...] "a superior anime, a giant-robot tale of unusual depth, feeling and detail". Theron Martin (Anime News Network) described the character design as [...] "distinctive, designed to be sexy rather than cutesy", and the mecha designs as [...] "among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series, with sleek, lithe appearances that look monstrous, fearsome, and nimble rather than boxy and knight-like". Mike Crandol stated [...] "It <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seems</b> contrite to say that Evangelion is surely one of the all-time great works of animation".

In the early 1970s some speculated that this cooling effect might dominate over the warming effect of the CO2 release: see discussion of Rasool and Schneider (1971), below.

2500|$|The Cochrane {{collaboration}} (2013) {{states that}} the best quality evidence neither demonstrates a reduction in cancer specific, nor a reduction in all cause mortality from screening mammography. When less rigorous trials {{are added to the}} analysis there is a reduction in mortality due to breast cancer of 0.05% (a decrease of 1 in 2000 deaths from breast cancer over 10 years or a relative decrease of 15% from breast cancer). Screening over 10 years results in a 30% increase in rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment (3 to 14 per 1000) and more than half will have at least one falsely positive test. This has resulted in the view that {{it is not clear whether}} mammography screening does more good or harm. Cochrane states that, due to recent improvements in breast cancer treatment, and the risks of false positives from breast cancer screening leading to unnecessary treatment, [...] "it therefore <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seems</b> beneficial to attend for breast cancer screening" [...] at any age.

2500|$|A 2013 Cochrane review {{estimated}} that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old {{results in a}} relative decreased risk of death from breast cancer of 15% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. However, when the analysis included only the least biased trials, women who had regular screening mammograms were {{just as likely to}} die from all causes, and just as likely to die specifically from breast cancer, as women who did not. The size of effect might be less in real life compared with the results in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased self-selection rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies. The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews said that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective at saving lives today. They concluded that screening is “no longer effective” at preventing deaths and “it therefore <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seems</b> reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. [...] The review also concluded that [...] "half or more" [...] of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment. They found that most of the earliest cell changes found by mammography screening (carcinoma in situ) should be left alone because these changes would not have progressed into invasive cancer.|$|E
