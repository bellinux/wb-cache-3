5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (<b>Na2CO3),</b> baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and {{is viewed as}} a hard Lewis acid.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (<b>Na2CO3)</b> at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + <b>Na2CO3</b> → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E

25|$|The prefix, bi, in {{bicarbonate}} {{comes from}} an outdated naming system {{and is based on}} the observation that there is twice as much carbonate (CO3) per sodium in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as there is carbonate per sodium in sodium carbonate (<b>Na2CO3)</b> and other carbonates. Modern analyse is based on the exact chemical composition (which was unknown when the name sodium bicarbonate was coined) says this the other way around: there is half as much sodium in NaHCO3 as in <b>Na2CO3</b> (Na versus Na2).|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{carbonate}} (also {{known as}} washing soda, soda ash and soda crystals, {{and in the}} monohydrate form as crystal carbonate), <b>Na2CO3,</b> is the water-soluble sodium salt of carbonic acid.|$|E
25|$|Making sodium bicarbonate: NaHCO3 {{is used in}} {{baking soda}} and in fire extinguishers. Although NaHCO3 is itself an {{intermediate}} product of the Solvay process, the heating needed to remove the ammonia that contaminates it decomposes some NaHCO3, making it more economic to react finished <b>Na2CO3</b> with CO2.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoids can be {{purified}} from plant cells using {{a combination}} of differential and gradient centrifugation. Disruption of isolated thylakoids, for example by mechanical shearing, releases the lumenal fraction. Peripheral and integral membrane fractions can be extracted from the remaining membrane fraction. Treatment with sodium carbonate (<b>Na2CO3)</b> detaches peripheral membrane proteins, whereas treatment with detergents and organic solvents solubilizes integral membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to about 2 mM as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, NaHSO4, <b>Na2CO3,</b> NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic. In this situation, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is far from equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Progress towards equilibrium through outgassing of CO2 is slowed by (i) the slow reaction H2CO3 ⇌ CO2(aq) + H2O; (ii) limited aeration in a deep water column and (iii) periodic replenishment of bicarbonate to maintain buffer capacity (often estimated through measurement of ‘total alkalinity’).|$|E
25|$|An alkali flux – {{to lower}} the {{temperature}} at which the silica melts, making it achievable using currently available working temperatures. In ancient times, the ash of sodium-rich plants growing in arid areas around the eastern Mediterranean provided soda (<b>Na2CO3)</b> as flux. In Roman times the mineral natron was used, a naturally occurring mixture of alkaline sodium salts, sourced from the Wadi El Natrun area of Egypt. Post-Roman Islamic glassmakers reverted to using sodium-rich plant ash, while in Northern Europe, a method using ash from wood was developed to provide potash (K2CO3) as flux. Calcium oxide (lime, CaO) can also act as a flux.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of fibroin protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin. Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous <b>Na2CO3</b> solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium metal is {{obtained}} by a multistep process {{that begins with}} the roasting of crushed ore with NaCl or <b>Na2CO3</b> at about 850°C to give sodium metavanadate (NaVO3). An aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to give [...] "red cake", a polyvanadate salt, which is reduced with calcium metal. As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use, in all of which vanadium is produced as a byproduct of other processes. Purification of vanadium is possible by the crystal bar process developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. It involves {{the formation of the}} metal iodide, in this example vanadium(III) iodide, and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Solvay process {{results in}} soda ash (predominantly sodium {{carbonate}} (<b>Na2CO3))</b> from brine (as {{a source of}} sodium chloride (NaCl)) and from limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)). The overall process is: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of using 14C incorporation (added as labelled <b>Na2CO3)</b> to infer primary production is {{most commonly used}} today because it is sensitive, {{and can be used}} in all ocean environments. [...] As 14C is radioactive (via beta decay), it is relatively straightforward to measure its incorporation in organic material using devices such as scintillation counters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemistry}} {{of this process}} is explained in the [...] "Sodium Hydroxide" [...] section in the carbon dioxide scrubber page. In short, CO2 from the air is chemically dissolved into NaOH(aq) solution as Na2CO3; the <b>Na2CO3</b> is then reacted with solid Ca(OH)2, which regenerates the solvent and produces CaCO3 crystals; lastly, heat is applied to the CaCO3 crystals to produce pure CO2 gas.|$|E
2500|$|Because the Solvay process recycles its ammonia, it consumes only brine and limestone, and has calcium {{chloride}} as its only waste product. This made it substantially more economical than the Leblanc process, and it soon came to dominate world sodium carbonate production. By 1900, 90% of sodium carbonate {{was produced by}} the Solvay process, and the last Leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s.The Solvay process results in soda ash (predominantly sodium carbonate (<b>Na2CO3))</b> from brine (as a source of sodium chloride (NaCl)) and from limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)).

2500|$|Fused quartz is a glass {{made from}} chemically-pure silica. It has {{excellent}} resistance to thermal shock, {{being able to}} survive immersion in water while red hot. [...] However, its high melting temperature (1723°C) and viscosity {{make it difficult to}} work with. [...] Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (<b>Na2CO3,</b> [...] "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|E
2500|$|Glass is a non-crystalline {{amorphous}} solid {{that is often}} transparent and has widespread practical, technological, and decorative usage in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optoelectronics. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of glass are [...] "silicate glasses" [...] based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. [...] The term glass, in popular usage, {{is often used to}} refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called soda-lime glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium oxide (Na2O) from sodium carbonate (<b>Na2CO3),</b> calcium oxide, also called lime (CaO), and several minor additives.|$|E
2500|$|Air {{is pumped}} through the CO2 {{absorber}} {{as the first}} step of this process. [...] CO2 absorber for DAC are designed either as a counter-current spray tower or as a counter-current thin-falling-film contractor to maximize the contact area between the air and the solvent and thus maximize the absorption driving force. [...] The solvent is regenerated in the causticization unit by reacting the <b>Na2CO3</b> with Ca(OH)2, which also transfers the captured CO2 to the form of CaCO3 solid crystals. [...] A mechanical filter is then used to separate the CaCO3 crystals form the water. [...] Since the crystals come out wet from the filter, they are dried in a steam dryer. [...] Then the dry crystals are heated in a furnace to produce CaO and pure CO2 gas. [...] The CaO is then hydrated to regenerate the Ca(OH)2 used for the causticization reaction. [...] The pure CO2 stream is then compressed and ready to be transported for geologic sequestration, EOR, or other commercial applications.|$|E
