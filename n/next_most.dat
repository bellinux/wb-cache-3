5|$|Nineteen nuclides {{and three}} nuclear isomers {{are known for}} {{einsteinium}} with atomic weights ranging from 240 to 258.

All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 40 hours, {{and most of them}} decay within less than 30 minutes. Of the three nuclear isomers, the most stable is 254mEs with half-life of 39.3 hours.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>most</b> {{common use}} is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>most</b> {{important}} {{record type}} are those achieved {{at a specific}} competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records {{and a large number}} of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.|$|E

Prior to this, the species had been mentioned in a 2001 Thai publication as an unidentified species of Hymenogaster. Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences shows that Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus. The <b>next</b> <b>most</b> closely related genus is Strobilomyces. All three genera {{are members of the}} Boletaceae family, and in the Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder.|$|E
5|$|Vega {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the <b>next</b> <b>most</b> important star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed {{and the first to}} have its spectrum recorded. It {{was one of the first}} stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.|$|E

5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The <b>next</b> <b>most</b> commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Alcocer and Martinez {{described}} a new taxon of herrerasaurid, Sanjuansaurus. It could {{be distinguished from}} Herrerasaurus based on multiple features. In the phylogenetic analysis, Herrerasaurus, Sanjuansaurus and Staurikosaurus all were in a polytomy, and Herrerasauridae was the most primitive group of saurischian, outside Eusaurischia, Eoraptor and Guaibasaurus. In 2011, Martinez et al. described Eodromaeus, a basal theropod from the same formation as Herrerasaurus. In a phylogenetic analysis, Eoraptor was placed within Sauropodomorpha, Herrerasauridae was placed as the most basal theropods, and Eodromaeus was placed as the <b>next</b> <b>most</b> basal. A more recent analysis, by Bittencourt et al. (2014), placed Herrerasauridae in a polytomy with Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, with Eoraptor also being in an unresolved position. This cladogram is shown below.|$|E

The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the <b>next</b> <b>most</b> successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every time they have reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
