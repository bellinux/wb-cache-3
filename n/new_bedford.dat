5|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District in <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> Massachusetts, United States, {{west of the}} community's waterfront. During the 19th century, {{when the}} city {{was the center of}} the American whaling industry, this was its downtown. After its decline in the early and mid-20th century, through the efforts of local activist groups the {{district}} has since been preserved and restored to appear much as it was during that period.|$|E
5|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Institute for Savings (NBIS), {{now used}} as the National Park Service's visitors' center, was built in 1853.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, 2014, {{controversy}} arose over a {{story that}} Baker told the previous night about a fisherman and his two sons in <b>New</b> <b>Bedford.</b> In the following days, The Boston Globe and The Standard-Times were unable to find the fisherman. This story, which Baker claims to have occurred in 2009, has been attributed by a professor from Northeastern University as a potential false memory. Coakley seized on this moment to launch an attack on Baker, and visited <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> to meet with fishing industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|The Natural History Museum in London {{contains}} a famous mounted skeleton and life-size {{model of a}} blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Similarly, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has a full-size model in its Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life. A juvenile blue whale skeleton is installed at the <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Whaling Museum in <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Grey's {{force of}} 4,000 was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} relief force for the British garrison that was briefly besieged at Newport, Rhode Island, but they arrived after the Americans had retreated. They were diverted for raiding by British army officer General Sir Henry Clinton. On September 5 and 6, Grey raided <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> and Fairhaven, encountering significant resistance only in Fairhaven. His troops destroyed storehouses, shipping, and supplies in <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> where they met with light resistance from the local militia; they damaged fewer American holds at Fairhaven where militia resistance had additional time to organize. He then sailed for Martha's Vineyard, which was undefended. Between September 10 and 15, its residents surrendered 10,000 head of sheep and 300 oxen, {{as well as most}} of the island's weapons.|$|E

5|$|Old Third District Courthouse. Warren-built {{sandstone}} Greek Revival building {{opened in}} 1853 on opposite corner from Customhouse as <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Institute for Savings.

5|$|The whaling {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1857, when <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> accounted {{for half the}} U.S. fleet. Growing competition from the new petroleum industry, {{and the impact of}} the Civil War, ensured that it would not recover as it had in the past. The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire, with a new exterior and an added tower. The NBIS building became a local courthouse, and the center of commercial activity in <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> moved west, where it has remained, as textiles became the city's dominant industry. The whaling museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907. But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they had been before, and in 1927, the John R. Mantra made the last whaling voyage from the city and the last in American history.|$|E
50|$|A {{merchant}} and trader, French, {{along with}} Charles D. Burt, owned <b>New</b> <b>Bedford's</b> only chandlery store. He also owned a successful gold mine near Black Hawk, Colorado. French ran the mine himself {{for some time}} before leasing it out.|$|R

5|$|For {{his first}} term, Frank {{represented}} a {{district in the}} western and southern suburbs of Boston, anchored by Brookline and his hometown of Newton. However, in 1982, redistricting forced him to run against Republican Margaret Heckler, who represented a district centered on the South Coast, including Fall River and <b>New</b> <b>Bedford.</b> Although the newly configured district retained Frank’s district number—the 4th—it was geographically more Heckler's district. Frank focused on Heckler's initial support for President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, and won with 60% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Thirty years later, Congress passed {{legislation}} creating <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Whaling National Historical Park, commemorating the city's past. It included the entire historic district within its boundaries, {{and the park}} service chose the old NBIS building as its visitors' center. In 2008, WHALE turned over the neighboring Corson Building, built 1875-84, to the Park Service, which it had renovated after a 1997 fire. Plans call {{for it to be}} used for educational purposes related to the park, with a 60-seat theater, archival space, seminar room, and similar features.|$|E
5|$|While {{owned by}} Weston, the brig Smyrna, {{launched}} in 1825, {{was the first}} United States vessel to enter the Black Sea under a special permit from the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The ship Lagoda, launched in 1826 and sold by Weston to a whaling merchant, {{became one of the}} most successful in the <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> Massachusetts whaling fleet. A half-scale model of the Lagoda is today featured in the <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Whaling Museum. The brig Messenger, launched in 1834, was also sold to a whaling merchant and, in 1862, became part of the infamous Stone Fleet sunk in Charleston Harbor by the United States Navy in hopes of obstructing the Confederate port during the Civil War. The ship Oneco, Weston's second largest vessel launched in 1839 became the only Weston ship to circumnavigate the globe from 1850–1852. The ship Hope, launched in 1841, was at the time the largest merchant vessel built in New England and on her maiden voyage shipped a record-breaking cargo of cotton from New Orleans to Liverpool, England.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{the city}} hopes its {{proximity}} to Massachusetts' southern coastline will allow it to become a center for the growing wind energy market. Three companies, OffshoreMW, Deepwater Wind, and DONG Energy, have leased portions of <b>New</b> <b>Bedford's</b> Marine Commerce Terminal for the staging of turbines and platforms.|$|R
25|$|Mark Duff, a {{descendant}} of one of <b>New</b> <b>Bedford's</b> whaling families that had expanded into other businesses, bought it the following year. Under the direction of Boston landscape architect Mrs. John Coolidge, they redecorated it extensively and planted 7,000 tulip bulbs in the garden, as well as adding landscaping, walkways and ornamental ponds.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "South Coast" [...] {{reportedly}} {{began with}} weather forecasts by Todd Gross on WHDH-TV in Boston. <b>New</b> <b>Bedford's</b> local daily newspaper, The Standard-Times, {{picked it up}} in the late 1990s, and other media have followed suit, albeit not without some protest by longtime area residents who protested the manufactured name.|$|R
5|$|Because a Hurricane Watch {{existed for}} the New York City {{metropolitan}} area, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials {{set up a}} hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas. Near <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters {{in case of a}} direct hit. <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city. However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage. On Cape Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29km) traffic backup. As a result, many beach resorts lost millions in potential revenue. Of those who remained on Cape Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety. Many sailors removed their boats from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of one every eight minutes. In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed their boats, and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} several {{extensions}} of the Commuter Rail system under construction or in the planning stages. The extension of service from Providence further into Rhode Island opened to T. F. Green Airport In December 2010 and to Wickford Junction in April 2012. The Fairmount Line is undergoing a major rehabilitation that includes the construction of four new stations in Boston; the first three of these opened in November 2012 and July 2013. Planning work on the South Coast Rail project to restore service to Fall River and <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> is continuing with bridge work already started, and proposed extensions of commuter rail service to Nashua, New Hampshire via the Lowell Line and Plaistow, New Hampshire via the Haverhill Line are in the planning stages.|$|E
5|$|I-95 {{runs from}} north to south through Providence while I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, {{including}} <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> Massachusetts, and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million.|$|E
50|$|Seven craft unions {{directly}} represented about 8,000 of <b>New</b> <b>Bedford's</b> textile workers. These included locals of the American Federation of Textile Operatives, {{an independent}} organization. The deteriorating wage situation spurred militance {{in many of}} these locals, however, and in April and May 1928 a move was made to join the United Textile Workers (UTW), a larger and more potent labor organization affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL).|$|R

5|$|On 3 November, {{with her}} {{reconditioning}} complete, West Honaker sailed from New York. After transiting the Panama Canal {{a week after}} her departure, she headed for Brisbane, Australia, where she arrived on 13 December. After then calling at Sydney, Melbourne, Port Pirie, and Adelaide through 8 January 1941, West Honaker called at Melbourne and Sydney before departing for the United States on 18 January. Loaded with a cargo of wool intended for uniforms, blankets, and overcoats for the military, West Honaker arrived at <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> Massachusetts, on 3 March.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{was born}} in Portland, Maine on March 20, 1804, the son of Josiah Dow and his wife, Dorcas Allen Dow. Josiah Dow {{was a member of}} the Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers) and a farmer {{originally}} from New Hampshire. Dorcas Allen was also a Quaker, and a member of a prosperous Maine family headed by her prominent grandfather, Hate-Evil Hall. They had three children, of whom Neal was the middle child and only son. After his marriage, Dow's father opened a tannery in Portland, which soon became a successful business. After attending a Friends school in <b>New</b> <b>Bedford,</b> Massachusetts, and further schooling at Edward Payson's Portland Academy, Dow followed his father into the tanning trade in 1826. He embraced technology, becoming one of the first in the city to incorporate steam power in the tanning process.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of museums and {{historical}} sites. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and the DeCordova contemporary art and sculpture museum in Lincoln are all located within Massachusetts, and the Maria Mitchell Association in Nantucket includes several observatories, museums, and an aquarium. Historically themed museums and sites such as the Springfield Armory National Historic Site in Springfield, Boston's Freedom Trail and nearby Minute Man National Historical Park, both of which preserve a number of sites important during the American Revolution, the Lowell National Historical Park, which focuses on some of the earliest mills and canals of the industrial revolution in the US, the Black Heritage Trail in Boston, which includes important African-American and abolitionist sites in Boston, and the <b>New</b> <b>Bedford</b> Whaling National Historical Park all showcase various periods of Massachusetts's history.|$|E
50|$|Camacho {{worked at}} Williams' side for four seasons, three (1969-71) in Washington and one (1972) when the {{franchise}} became the Texas Rangers. Although Williams' {{first season as}} a manager was a rousing success, his 1970-72 teams finished last, or next-to-last, in their divisions. When Williams resigned as Texas' manager following the 1972 campaign, Camacho resumed his career as an educator (he was principal of <b>New</b> <b>Bedford's</b> Campbell Elementary School) and coach before his 1986 retirement.|$|R
50|$|Intrigued by the {{possibilities}} of using radio to bring traditional music to larger audiences, Clayton landed a weekly series of 15-minute folk programs on <b>New</b> <b>Bedford's</b> WFMR and later on WBSM. Besides writing and announcing his own material, he performed live, singing the traditional songs he had been collecting to his own guitar accompaniment. He was successful enough that the program was expanded to an hour per week. He was still only in high school.|$|R
