5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E
5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the <b>nose,</b> <b>for</b> example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso {{became the}} first man to win two races in 2012 at the European Grand Prix in Valencia, scoring his first home win since the 2006 Spanish Grand Prix. Starting eleventh, he was forced to {{navigate}} his way through traffic, narrowly avoiding early contact between Bruno Senna and Kamui Kobayashi as Sebastian Vettel broke free of the field to establish a twenty-second lead by the first round of stops. Vettel's lead was quashed when Heikki Kovalainen and Jean-Éric Vergne made contact, triggering the deployment of the safety car to clear debris from the circuit. Alonso found himself third at the restart and pounced on a mistake by second-placed Romain Grosjean to lead the chase against Vettel. Vettel pulled away once more, but his lead was short-lived as he lost drive and his engine shut down on lap 33. Grosjean attempted to challenge Alonso, but was forced out of the race with an alternator problem seven laps later, leaving Alonso in the lead, four seconds clear of Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen. As the race entered the final laps, Räikkönen forced his way past Hamilton to secure second place, but Pastor Maldonado's attempts to take third place ended with Hamilton in the barrier and a broken <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> the Williams driver. Maldonado finished tenth, but was given a post-race drive-through penalty and was classified twelfth. Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher and Mark Webber had started to carve their way through the field by virtue of a late pit stop and easily picked off the minor points positions and taking advantage of the Maldonado—Hamilton collision to finish third and fourth behind Alonso and Räikkönen. It was Schumacher's first podium since the 2006 Chinese Grand Prix. Alonso's win cemented a twenty-point lead in the championship, whilst Vettel's retirement relegated him to fourth overall, twenty-six points behind Alonso.|$|E

25|$|In {{reconstructive}} rhinoplasty, the {{defects and}} deformities that the plastic surgeon encounters, and must restore to normal function, form, and appearance include broken and displaced nasal bones; disrupted and displaced nasal cartilages; a collapsed {{bridge of the}} nose; congenital defect, trauma (blunt, penetrating, blast), autoimmune disorder, cancer, intranasal drug-abuse damages, and failed primary rhinoplasty outcomes. Rhinoplasty reduces bony humps, and re-aligns the nasal bones after they are cut (dissected, resected). When cartilage is disrupted, suturing for re-suspension (structural support), {{or the use of}} cartilage grafts to camouflage a depression allow the re-establishment of the normal nasal contour of the <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> the patient. When the bridge of the nose is collapsed, rib-cartilage, ear-cartilage, or cranial-bone grafts can be used to restore its anatomic integrity, and thus the aesthetic continuity of the <b>nose.</b> <b>For</b> augmenting the nasal dorsum, autologous cartilage and bone grafts are preferred to (artificial) prostheses, because of the reduced incidence of histologic rejection and medical complications.|$|E
5000|$|In American Jewish {{literature}} and cinema, the Jewish nose {{has been a}} defining characteristic - {{for better or for}} worse - of the American Jewish identity.

Big <b>noses</b> <b>for</b> Jews, small <b>noses</b> <b>for</b> non-Jews, and the frequent appearance of rhinoplasty [...] "as an instrument of (attempted) Americanization" [...] all appear in Jewish literature as showing [...] "the special significance attached to the nose as a factor marking the otherness of Jews - historically, in print, on stage, and on the screen," [...] writes Goldblatt.|$|R

The majority of onboard electronics operated on direct current. The lineage of early Soviet airliners could be traced directly to the Tupolev Tu-16 strategic bomber, and the Tu-134 carried over the glass <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> the navigator and the landing gear fitted with low-pressure tires to permit operation from unpaved airfields.|$|E

25|$|The T3M {{was a large}} single-engined biplane {{capable of}} being fitted with either a {{conventional}} tailwheel undercarriage or floats. The fuselage was constructed of welded steel tube {{in place of the}} riveted steel frame of the CS/SC, with the pilot and bombardier seated {{side by side in the}} front cockpit situated forward of the wing, with the bombardier having a position under the <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> aiming the aircraft's bombs or torpedoes, while the gunner had a cockpit well aft of the wing, with a radiator slung under the top wing between the cockpits. Power was from a 575hp (429kW) Wright T-3B V-12 engine. 24 T3M-1s were built.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} {{is located}} in the wide end of the re-entry cone, where it can be larger, and thus more powerful. The usual arrangement is to put the heavier, denser secondary in the narrow end for greater aerodynamic stability during re-entry from outer space, and to allow more room for a bulky primary in the wider part of the cone. (The W87 warhead drawing in the W87 article shows the usual arrangement.) Because of this new geometry, the W88 primary uses compact conventional high explosives (CHE) to save space, rather than the more usual, and bulky but safer, insensitive high explosives (IHE). The re-entry cone probably has ballast in the <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> aerodynamic stability.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} {{oral traditions}} explain {{the use of}} the <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's hā, breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As the hā travels from the na`ao, or gut, through the mouth, the hā can be used to lie. When the hā travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music he plays with his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.|$|E

25|$|The Frog Baby statue {{has been}} the center of legend and {{tradition}} since it was presented by Frank Ball in 1937. While initially {{on display in the}} David Owsley Museum of Art, students began a tradition of rubbing the statue's <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> good luck before taking exams. Over the years, the nose was worn away, and in 1993, the statue was sent overseas for refurbishment. Today, Frog Baby is situated in a fountain on University Green. Since its move and restoration, students have started a new tradition of dressing the statue to reflect weather patterns (scarves and hats in the winter) or current university events (jerseys and helmets for upcoming football games). Despite 24/7 surveillance, the statue has been a repeated target of vandals.|$|E
25|$|The Morane-Saulnier T was a large, five-bay biplane of {{conventional}} configuration, with unstaggered wings of equal span. The conical rear fuselage and large triangular vertical stabilizer were {{reminiscent of a}} scaled-up version of some Morane-Saulnier's smaller designs. The engines were mounted tractor-fashion in streamlined nacelles supported by struts in the interplane gap and the propellers on the Type T were often fitted with large spinners. The Renault's of the Type S were cooled with Hazet type side radiators. The landing gear consisted of two main units, each of which had two wheels joined by a long axle, plus a tailskid and an auxiliary nosewheel. Three open cockpits in tandem were provided: one in the <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> a gunner, and others for the pilot and a second gunner placed further back.|$|E
25|$|The Nimrod {{design was}} based on that of the Comet 4 civil {{airliner}} which had {{reached the end of}} its commercial life (the first two prototype Nimrods, XV148 & XV147 were built from two final unfinished Comet 4C airframes). The Comet's turbojet engines were replaced by Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans for better fuel efficiency, particularly at the low altitudes required for maritime patrol. Major fuselage changes were made, including an internal weapons bay, an extended <b>nose</b> <b>for</b> radar, a new tail with electronic warfare (ESM) sensors mounted in a bulky fairing, and a MAD (magnetic anomaly detector) boom. After the first flight in May 1967, the RAF ordered a total of 46 Nimrod MR1s. The first example (XV230) entered service in October 1969. A total of five squadrons using the type were established; four were permanently based in the UK and a fifth was initially based in Malta.|$|E
