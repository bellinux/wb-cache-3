5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination.

Many CSF leaks do <b>not</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E
