5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to <b>nip</b> running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E

40|$|Chickpea is an {{important}} crop in the cropping pattern supplying cheap protein diet especially for poor people. Over the years, however, low yields are more prominent declining acceptability of this crop. Apart from other production enhancement indicators, <b>nipping</b> {{appeared to be a}} factor increasing yield and yield contributing parameters. To investigate the appropriate <b>nipping</b> technique as well as to sort out combination of spacing and <b>nipping,</b> an experiment was conducted during 2008 - 09 with chickpea variety NIFA- 2005. <b>Nipping</b> was done on four different crop growth stages viz. nibbling (topping), harvesting at 4 ” level, harvesting at ground level and control (no <b>nipping)</b> with rows 40 and 50 cm apart. Among the parameters studied, number of plants/plot, plant height and grain yield appeared statistically significant across <b>nipping</b> methods and row spacing whereas number of pods/plant, number of grains/pod and 1000 -grain weight were found non-significant. Control plot produced tallest plants (78. 80 cm) whereas maximum yield (1792 kg/ha) was obtained in <b>nipping</b> at ground level with rows 40 cm apart. The research concluded that <b>nipping</b> is a profitable practice for chickpea growers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} in-situ remediation of low permeability soils contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP) by electrokinetic delivery of nanoscale iron particles (<b>NIPs).</b> Kaolin soil {{was used as}} a model low permeability soil and it was artificially spiked with PCP (1000 mg per Kg of dry soil). Laboratory electrokinetic experiments were conducted using deionized water or <b>NIPs</b> of 50 - 300 nm particle size at slurry concentrations of 5 g/L and 10 g/L at the anode. All experiments were conducted for 427 hours at a constant voltage gradient of 1 VDC/cm. The experimental results showed that the soil pH decreased near the anode and increased near the cathode. Substantial electroosmotic flow was induced initially and then it decreased, but the flow was not hindered by the <b>NIPs.</b> The total iron in the soil increased from the anode to the cathode, indicating that <b>NIPs</b> may have transported towards the cathode. However, the transport of <b>NIPs</b> in the soil was limited by aggregation and settling of <b>NIPs</b> in the anode. In addition, <b>NIPs</b> may have transformed into Fe 3 + ions under the oxygenated and low pH conditions that existed at the anode. It appears that <b>NIPs</b> may not have contributed to PCP degradation. Instead, 47 to 55 % of PCP was degraded in the cathode by reductive dechlorination in all tests. Complete PCP degradation did not occur in any of the tests because of limited transport of PCP into the cathode as a result of low solubility of PCP under the low pH conditions induced near the anode and low electroosmotic flow. An electrokinetic system without <b>NIPs</b> may be effective for remediation of PCP provided enhanced transport of PCP into the cathode and high electroosmotic flow are achieved...|$|R
