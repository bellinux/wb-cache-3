5|$|In 2007, {{sales of}} spirits {{increased}} 9% {{over the previous}} year. Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers, while tequila had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced <b>new</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each, versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits, but sales of beer hadn't increased like sales of spirits. The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8th11th graders has fallen nationally, it has increased in Oregon.

Falk pushed for <b>new</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> new or expanded markets. Falk saw great growth potential in the mechanization of agriculture, {{which at the time}} was blossoming all over America. Allis-Chalmers's first farm tractors, the 10-18, the Model 6-12, and the Model 15-30, were developed and marketed between 1914 and 1919, and the farm implement line was expanded.|$|E

The stock rooms were an exhibition space where businessmen could demonstrate their <b>new</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> were built as the hotel aimed to attract most of its clients from commercial visitors from out of town.

After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in Newcastle upon Tyne, until quite recently. Numerous <b>new</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> brand names were introduced over time, and Procter & Gamble began branching out into new areas. The company introduced Tide laundry detergent in 1946 and Prell shampoo in 1947. In 1955, Procter & Gamble began selling the first toothpaste to contain fluoride, known as Crest. Branching out once again in 1957, the company purchased Charmin paper mills and began manufacturing toilet paper and other tissue paper products. Once again focusing on laundry, Procter & Gamble began making Downy fabric softener in 1960 and Bounce fabric softener sheets in 1972.|$|E

25|$|The Nature Index {{tracks the}} affiliations {{of high quality}} {{scientific}} articles published in 68 science journals independently chosen by the scientific community as the journals scientists would most like to publish their best research in. Updated monthly, the Nature Index presents research reports of approximately 9,000 parent institutions worldwide presenting a page of output statistics for each institution along with information on institutions collaborating with the institution in the publication of Index articles. Each of the approximately 60,000 articles in the Index has a dedicated article page with social and mainstream media coverage tracked by Altmetric. League tables of output of institutions can be generated on the fly on a global, regional or country basis and by broad subject area {{as well as by}} article count and fractional article count. Compare with other metrics of science (e.g., Impact Factor, h-index), Nature Index is the prominent scientific journal ranking with global reputation on original natural science and life science research. Tracing the flow of scientific knowledge into economic and social benefit is a growing priority for governments and research funding agencies. Nature Index Innovation examines the connection between high-quality research and the commercialization of <b>new</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> services. In particular, it highlights the use of references to academic literature in patents to show concrete links between discovery and its economic potential.|$|E
25|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{make money}} from trading in already existing assets which are not used by them to produce any <b>new</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> services with. Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of net interest, net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} non-productive assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; second-hand physical assets, financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from operating surplus because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise more adequate measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, then a lot of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new product value, and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|E
