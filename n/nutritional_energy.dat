40|$|The poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARsylation) {{activity}} of tankyrase (TNKS) regulates diverse physiological processes including energy metabolism and wnt/β-catenin signaling. This TNKS activity uses NAD+ as a co-substrate to post-translationally modify various acceptor proteins including TNKS itself. PARsylation by TNKS often tags the acceptors for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Whether this TNKS activity is regulated by physiological changes in NAD+ levels or, more broadly, in cellular energy charge {{has not been}} investigated. Because the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) in vitro is robustly potentiated by ATP, we hypothesized that <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy</b> might stimulate cellular NAMPT to produce NAD+ and thereby augment TNKS catalysis. Using insulin-secreting cells as a model, we showed that glucose indeed stimulates the autoPARsylation of TNKS and consequently its turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system. This glucose effect on TNKS is mediated primarily by NAD+ since it is mirrored by the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and is blunted by the NAMPT inhibitor FK 866. The TNKS-destabilizing effect of glucose is shared by other metabolic fuels including pyruvate and amino acids. NAD+ flux analysis showed that glucose and nutrients, by increasing ATP, stimulate NAMPT-mediated NAD+ production to expand NAD+ stores. Collectively our data uncover a metabolic pathway whereby <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy</b> augments NAD+ production to drive the PARsylating {{activity of}} TNKS, leading to autoPARsylation-dependent degradation of the TNKS protein. The modulation of TNKS catalytic activity and protein abundance by cellular energy charge could potentially impose a nutritional control on the many processes that TNKS regulates through PARsylation. More broadly, the stimulation of NAD+ production by ATP suggests that <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy</b> may enhance the functions of other NAD+-driven enzymes including sirtuins...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims at {{estimating}} empirically {{the impact}} of EU-ASEAN trade liberalisation on food security in ASEAN with a specific focus on people who live below the international poverty line. The contributions obtained from this study are that this study investigates the projected food security situation in ASEAN countries after the EU-ASEAN trade liberalisation is implemented, taking the effects of non-tariff barrier elimination into account in order to compare the effects between the elimination of TBs only {{and the elimination of}} both TBs and NTBs for each ASEAN country. In addition, the combination of the GTAP model and the Food Security Assessment model is first introduced in this study. The results from the GTAP model indicate that the EU-ASEAN trade liberalisation can create production expansion for net food exporting countries such as Thailand and Vietnam while net food importing countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines are estimated to encounter contraction in food production and to depend on more imports. In addition, the elimination of both TBs and NTBs is expected to result in more positive effects than that of TBs elimination only; however, after both TBs and NTBs are eliminated, the Philippines is projected to experience negative effects due to a large decrease in rice imports. Another important issue is the low <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy</b> level obtained from food consumption by ASEAN people who live below the poverty line. This potential threat to food security generally occurring in the lower-income countries results from income inequality. In the Philippines and the group of other ASEAN countries including Brunei, Cambodia, Laos PDR and Myanmar, poverty rates are at the highest level, accounting for 26. 5 and 26 percent respectively. These results translate into low purchasing power for lower income households. As a result, <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy</b> has been consumed by those people at a level below the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). Even though the free trade agreement is expected to increase their food consumption, the <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy</b> consumption level just rises over the MDER and it is still far from reaching the average dietary energy requirement (ADER).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of nutritional plans on the productive and economic performance of Hubbard Flex broiler chickens. A completely randomized experimental design was applied, consisting of five treatments. Treatments consisted of five different nutritional plans: a basal diet containing the nutrient and energy levels recommended by literature and designated reference diet; two diets containing 1. 5 % and 3 % lower levels than the reference diet; and two diets containing 1. 5 % and 3 % higher levels than the reference diet (- 3 %, - 1. 5 %, reference plan, + 1. 5 % and + 3 %). Feed intake (FI), body weight (BW), feed conversion rate (FCR), livability (L) and productive efficient index (PEI) were determined when broilers were 42 days old. Broilers were processed, and carcass and parts (breast fillet, leg, and wings) yields were determined. The economic viablility of the nutitional plans was evaluated as a function of feed cost/kg live and carcass weights, economic efficiency index (EEI), and cost index (CI). Feed intake and the feed conversion rate decreased as dietary nutrient and energy levels increased. Feed cost/kg live weight, economic efficiency index, and cost index cost increased as dietary nutrient and energy levels increased.

The present study aimed to examine if there was a difference in nutrition intake and training load between teams from different geographical locations across football training season, and how both influence training stress markers regarding training sessions. Methods: Following ethical approval, participants (n= 45; age 24. 47 ?? 6. 07 years; height 1. 75 ?? 0. 08 m; mass 74. 86 ?? 9. 57 kg) were male footballers from three different teams; one UK based professional team and two Cyprus based teams; professional (UKpro), semi-professional (CYsem) and recreational (CYrec). Data was collected from all teams at three time points across an annual training programme (pre, mid, end season). A food recall 4 -day diary was used to record nutritional intake and metabolic equivalent (MET) values of physical activities method was used to quantify the energy cost of training. Saliva samples were collected during a standard training week on a fixed day pre- and post-training, and at rest 24 hours post training. Samples were analysed in duplicate via enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) for secretory IgA, cortisol and testosterone. Results: It was found that across all three testing blocks none of the groups received inadequate <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy</b> intake. All groups showed consumption of the investigated micronutrients in higher than recommended daily amounts (RDA) but only vitamin C was significantly higher (> 20 %) for UKpro compared to Cyprus groups.

The FAO 2013 report reckons that methane {{emissions}} by ruminants damage production as they constitute {{a waste of}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>energy.</b> Of course, methane emissions deliver energy to the environment, but do not spoil it, as methane is a (so far) unavoidable by-product of anaerobic degradation (by rumen cellulolytic bacteria) {{of the most widely}} spread substance in the biosphere, cellulose. Without methanogenesis, hydrogen (H 2) would accumulate in the rumen and inhibit ongoing fermentation and digestion by negative feedback (Eckard et al. 2010). Thanks to the methane emissions, ruminants can make use of the high-fibre diet growing abundantly on the enormous terrestrial areas marginal to crop agriculture and convert it into precious food for humans (meat and milk), as well as skins, fibres and other useful products. As long as there are no effective and inexpensive technologies available to manipulate the rumen metabolism in order to cut back the methane emissions without hampering the digestibility of fibre-rich diets, methane emissions seem to be the price for the very important contribution of ruminants to food security and livelihood resources for humanity.|$|E
