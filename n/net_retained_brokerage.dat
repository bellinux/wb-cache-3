Therefore, this study aimed to assess the durability of Olyset(®) LLINs distributed during campaigns between 2009 and 2011 in Tanzania. A retrospective field survey was conducted in eight districts in Tanzania mainland to assess the durability of Olyset campaign nets. Household questionnaires {{were used to assess}} attrition, i. e. net loss. All nets remaining in households were collected. A sub-sample of 198 Olyset campaign nets was examined for bio-efficacy against Anopheles gambiae s. s. mosquitoes, permethrin content and physical integrity following standard World Health Organization (WHO) methods. Of 6067 campaign nets reported to have been received between 2009 and 2011, 35 % (2145 nets) were no longer present. Most of those nets had been discarded (84 %) mainly because they were too torn (94 %). Of the 198 sub-sampled Olyset LLINs, 61 % were still in serviceable physical condition sufficient to provide personal protection while 39 % were in unserviceable physical condition according to WHO proportionate Hole Index (pHI). More than 96 % (116 / 120) of nets in serviceable condition passed WHO bioefficacy criteria while all nets in unserviceable condition passed WHO bioefficacy criteria. Overall mean permethrin content was 16. 5 g/kg (95 % CI 16. 2 - 16. 9) with 78 % of the sub-sampled <b>nets</b> <b>retaining</b> recommended permethrin content regardless of their age or physical condition.

This study evaluated the two delivery channels regarding LLIN retention and use, and estimated the associated costs, to contribute towards the evidence-base on LLIN delivery channels in Uganda. Methods: Household surveys were conducted 5 - 7 months after LLIN distribution, combining questionnaires with visual verification of LLIN presence. Focus groups and interviews were conducted to further investigate determinants of LLIN retention and use.

Total of 1, 223 Cx. quinquefasciatus females were collected. PermaNet 3. 0 unwashed deterred 16. 84 % Culex mosquitoes. After 20 washes, it deterred 5. 79 % mosquitoes compared to 6. 84 % deterrence by unwashed PermaNet 2. 0. PermaNet 3. 0 induced mosquitoes to exit huts 50. 48 % and inhibited blood feeding 70. 97 % in unwashed state. After 20 washes, the net induced 42. 91 % mosquitoes to exit and inhibited 67. 06 % mosquitoes from blood feeding.

40|$|BackgroundMalaria {{morbidity}} and mortality have been significantly reduced through {{the proper use of}} insecticide-treated mosquito nets, but the extra protection afforded by the insecticide diminishes over time. The insecticide depletion rates vary according to location where wash frequency and wear are influenced by cultural habits as well as the availability of water. Monitoring of available insecticides on the net surface is essential for determining the effective life of the net. Therefore, a rapid and inexpensive colorimetric field test for cyanopyrethroids (Cyanopyrethroid Field Test or CFT) was used to measure surface levels of deltamethrin on insecticide-coated polyester nets (PowerNets 22 ̆ 01 e 2) in rural Lao PDR over a two-year period. MethodsNet surface levels of deltamethrin were measured by wiping the net with filter paper and measuring the adsorbed deltamethrin using the CFT. A relationship between surface levels of deltamethrin and whole net levels was established by comparing results of the CFT with whole levels assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). An effective deltamethrin surface concentration (EC 80) was determined by comparing mosquito mortality (WHO Cone Test) with CFT and HPLC results. Five positions (roof to bottom) on each of 23 matched nets were assayed for deltamethrin surface levels at 6, 12, and 2422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 months.

Materials and Methods Using 1 cm phantom Bego stones, a spherical model bladder was used to simulate percutaneous bladder access. A UroNet (US Endoscopy, USA) was placed alongside a Swiss Lithoclast probe through the working channel of a Storz 26 Fr rigid nephroscope. Using a 30 Fr working sheath, the stone was captured, and fragmented for 60 seconds. Resulting fragments and irrigation were filtered through a 1 mm strainer, and recorded. Five trials were performed with and without the UN. Durability was then assessed by measuring net defects, and residual grasp strength of each instrument. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviations) were used to summarize the data, and Student&# 8217;s t-tests (alpha< 0. 05) were used to compare trials. Results The mean time to stone capture was 12 s (8 - 45 s). After fragmentation with UN stabilization, there were significant improvements {{in the amount of}} residual stone (22 % dry weight reduction vs 8. 1 % without UN, p< 0. 001), number of fragments (17. 5 vs 5. 0 frag/stone, p= 0. 0029), and fragment size (3. 6 mm vs. 7. 05 mm, p= 0. 035).

Foreword When enjoying convenience from automobile, people are confronted with scrap tires at the same time. Scrap tires, which have strong resistance to heat, biont and mechanism, are hard to be decomposed, and can not disappear naturally even for decades. If piled in the open for too long, they not only occupy a lot of land, but also generate mosquitoes carrying disease, even cause fires sometimes, which should be the reason why people call them “black pollution ” [1]. How to make effective use of scrap tires without polluting the environment, is not only a worldwide difficulty, but also a new topic in resources recycling confronting China. According to incomplete statistics, as of 2002, an estimated 50 million scrap tires were generated in China, among which 20 million found no takers. The recycling rate is less than 60 %, far behind 90 %, the average tires recycling rate in developed country [2]. Therefore, It is imperative to make full use of scrap tires, and go on an eco-efficient economy road, to protect the ecological environment, and to promote the creation of a resource-conserving and environment-friendly society in China...|$|R

Financial delivery costs for the two channels were similar in the same location, USD 1. 04 for campaign or USD 1. 07 for ANC delivery in Adjumani, but differed between locations (USD 0. 67 for campaign delivery in Jinja). Economic cost for ANC distribution were considerably higher (USD 2. 27) compared to campaign costs (USD 1. 23) in Adjumani. Conclusions Targeted campaigns and routine ANC services can both achieve high LLIN retention and use among the target population. The comparatively higher economic cost of delivery through ANC facilities was at least partially due to the relatively short time this system had been in existence. Further studies comparing the cost of well-established ANC delivery with LLIN campaigns and other delivery channels are thus encouraged. </p...|$|R

The shoreward portion may as a fishery reservoir influence species which contribute more than 70 % of the landed value of commercial and sports fisheries. Yet the microbiota on which this reservoir is based has been a very neglected aspect of the island's marine biology. With the increase in coastal industrial development there is a greater potential for deterioration of this fragile and unfamiliar resource base. [...] In this social context a portable plankton pumping system was designed, assembled, and evaluated. The first module, a commercial diaphragm pump delivers sea water to a surge-tank where temperature, salinity, conductivity and dissolved oxygen measurements are made. In the third module the water is filtered by gravity flow through four Nitex plankton filters sequentially arranged after which the water's volume is determined. [...] Evaluation consisted of seventeen closely integrated field and laboratory experiments. Most of the field evaluation took place at Come by Chance adjacent to an oil refinery prior to its start-up operations. Several aspects of its operation and laboratory procedures were assessed. [...] Electronic environmental sensors were evaluated against alternate methods. Of these only the dissolved oxygen sensor yielded statistically significant variations. The water meter's performance was well within the value assured by the manufacturer. The filter-cleaning procedures were satisfactory and sedimentation losses were not significant. [...] To evaluate zooplankton catching efficiency a conical net was tied below the pump's intake and both were pulled simultaneously through the same water column. There was little pump damage to plankton. The pump captured more of the smaller forms while the <b>net</b> <b>retained</b> more of the larger. [...] Together the net and the pump provided a means of gathering information on plankton numbers, diversity and their aqueous environment in a manner not previously demonstrated. Reduction of spatial and temporal displacement of the sampling devices increases the confidence one has in the conclusion that the numbers and diversity of plankton in the water column are more closely approximated by both devices together than by either operated singly...|$|R
