5|$|Coinciding {{with its}} {{classification}} as {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for {{the west coast of}} Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach, with a tropical storm watch declared from Keaton Beach northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also issued for <b>non-coastal</b> and non-tidal areas of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The passage of the storm resulted in an increased threat for rip currents, with officials recommending that swimmers stay out of the water until the storm leaves the area. A tornado watch was also posted for the southern portion of the state, though was dropped after the storm weakened.|$|E

25|$|Tacitus, {{writing in}} AD 98, {{described}} the inland, <b>non-coastal</b> Chauci homeland as immense, densely populated, and well-stocked with horses. He was effusive in his praise of their character as a people, {{saying that they}} were the noblest of the Germans, preferring justice to violence, being neither aggressive nor predatory, but militarily capable and always prepared for war if the need arose.|$|E
25|$|The Chauci {{were one}} of the most {{prominent}} early Germanic sea raiders. They are probable participants in the Germanic flotilla that was destroyed by Drusus in 12 BC. They were raiding the coasts of Roman Belgica in AD 41, long before they participated in further raids of the same coasts under Gannascus in AD 47. It is likely that their raiding was endemic over the years, as the few surviving accounts probably do not reflect all occurrences. Tacitus describes the Chauci as 'peaceful' in his Germania (AD 98), but this is in a passage describing the <b>non-coastal,</b> inland Chauci, whereas sea raiders are necessarily a coastal people.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Navy {{recruited}} their seamen {{using the}} same system as the army, but from coastal provinces and towns (including <b>non-coastal</b> towns). As with the infantry, the farms in coastal areas were organized into rotar, which would each provide a croft (båtmanstorp) for a navy volunteer. Recruits only had duties on board the ships, for example as artillerymen or sailors, and were not used for other combat duties, such as boardings and landings, which were executed by army units transported on the ships. The seamen often served in the navy six months over the summer of every third year. Later, {{from the middle of}} the 18th century, some of the rotar in the cities would pay a fee equal to the approximate cost of providing a boatsman, instead of providing one from among themselves.|$|E
500|$|Winter {{temperature}} inversions {{can also}} occur given the correct conditions allowing very low minima to occur. Nonetheless, on average {{the region is}} one of the warmest <b>non-coastal</b> areas in the UK, with overall night time minima in particular rivalling more urban areas. Indeed, despite the notable low absolute minima (several weather-observing sites nearby having fallen below −20°C in the past) the annual average frost ratio is a mere 33 days per year (1971–00), actually lower than more urbanised weather station locations such as London's Heathrow Airport. A new absolute minimum of −19.5°C (−3.1°F) was recently set during the record cold month December 2010. [...] Prior to this the coldest nights were recorded in the winter of 1981/82; -18.1°C (−0.6°F) in December 1981, −18.0°C (−0.4°F) in January 1982.|$|E
2500|$|Andros {{exhibits}} greater botanical diversity {{than any}} other island in the Bahamas. The presence of its barrier reef and the Tongue of the Ocean give the island a great zoological diversity. Among the various land ecosystems are hardwood coppice, pineyard, scrub, saltwater marsh, rocky and sandy beaches, palm savannas and mangroves. [...] <b>Non-coastal</b> areas on Andros are referred to generically as 'the bush'. Coastal mangrove flats and estuaries {{are referred to as}} 'the swash', or salt water marsh.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cork oak}} forest needs {{siliceous}} soils of a sandy texture, and a mild, slightly damp climate. Under such conditions it totally or partially displaces the Holm oak; Holm oak {{may be found}} in stands of Cork Oak with a certain frequency, as well as Portuguese oaks (Quercus faginea subsp broteroi). The area occupied by oak forests corresponds above all to the southwest quadrant of the peninsula, but also to Catalonia, Menorca and even the <b>non-coastal</b> valleys of Galicia. They often alternate with the oaks, which occupy the drier slopes and with the quejigares [...] of Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis), that occupy the ravines and cool, shady northward slopes.|$|E
2500|$|A large <b>non-coastal</b> land {{grant was}} given to John Sutter who, in 1839, settled a large land grant close to the future city of Sacramento, California, which he called [...] "New Helvetia" [...] (New Switzerland). There, he built an {{extensive}} fort equipped {{with much of the}} armament from Fort Ross—bought from the Russians on credit when they abandoned that fort. Sutter's Fort was the first non-Native American community in the California Central Valley. Sutter's Fort, from 1839 to about 1848, was a major agricultural and trade colony in California, often welcoming and assisting California Trail travelers to California. Most of the settlers at, or near, Sutter's Fort were new immigrants from the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Though General American accents are not {{commonly}} {{perceived as}} {{associated with any}} region, their sound system does, in fact, have traceable regional origins: specifically, the English of the <b>non-coastal</b> Northeastern United States {{in the very early}} twentieth century. This includes western New England and the area to its immediate west that was itself initially settled by speakers of Western New England English: interior Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and the adjacent [...] "Midwest" [...] or Great Lakes region. Ironically however, since the early to middle twentieth century, deviance away from General American sounds started occurring, and is ongoing, in the eastern Great Lakes region due to its Northern Cities Vowel Shift towards a unique Inland Northern accent (often now associated with the region's urban centers, like Chicago and Detroit) and in the western Great Lakes region towards a unique North Central accent (often associated with Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota).|$|E
2500|$|The {{starting}} point, {{or first}} stage, of the Southern Shift is {{the transition of}} the gliding vowel (diphthong) [...] (...) towards a [...] "glideless" [...] long vowel [...] (...) , so that, for example, the word ride commonly approaches a sound that most other American English speakers would hear as rod or rad. Stage 1 is now complete {{for a majority of}} Southern dialects. Southern speakers particularly exhibit the Stage 1 shift at the ends of words and before voiced consonants, but often not before voiceless consonants, where the diphthong instead retains its glide, so that ride is , but right is [...] Inland (i.e. <b>non-coastal)</b> Southern speakers, however, indeed delete the glide of [...] in all contexts, as in the stereotyped pronunciation [...] "nahs whaht rahss" [...] for nice white rice; these most shift-advanced speakers are largely found today in an Appalachian area that comprises eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina and northern Alabama, as well as in central Texas. Some traditional East Coast Southern accents do not exhibit this Stage 1 glide deletion, particularly in Charleston, SC and possibly Atlanta and Savannah, GA (cities that are, at best, considered marginal to the modern Southern dialect region).|$|E

50|$|Nagapattinam District was {{formerly}} {{a part of}} Thanjavur District. The district boundary is shared by Tiruvarur, Karaikal, Tanjore and Cuddalore districts. Its population at the 2001 Census was nearly 1.5 million. The district has seven taluks, eleven administrative blocks, eight town panchayats, and four municipalities. Five of the talukas are coastal, and all are named after their main towns, which are their administrative centres. From north to south, they are Sirkazhi, Tharangambadi, Mayiladuthurai (<b>non-coastal),</b> Nagapattinam, Kilvelur, Thirukkuvalai (<b>non-coastal),</b> and Vedaranyam. It is bordered on the east by the Bay of Bengal and on the south by the Palk Strait. On the coast between Tharamgambadi and Nagapattinam lies the small district of Karaikal, an enclave belonging administratively to the Puducherry Union Territory.

50|$|Despite {{the common}} {{perception}} of {{there being a}} mainstream American accent that is free of any regional influence or origins, the General American sound system does, in fact, have traceable regional origins: namely, the Northern speech patterns of the <b>non-coastal</b> Eastern United States, including interior Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and the adjacent Midwestern region prior to the Northern Cities Vowel Shift of the mid-20th century.|$|E
50|$|Later, in {{the quest}} for Terra Australis, Spanish explorers in the 17th century {{discovered}} the Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos, and sailed the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, named after navigator Luís Vaz de Torres.

50|$|Inland saline {{aquaculture}} is {{the farming}} or culture of aquatic {{animals and plants}} using inland (i.e. <b>non-coastal)</b> sources of saline groundwater rather than the more common coastal aquaculture methods. As a side benefit, {{it can be used}} to reduce the amount of salt in underground water tables, leading to an improvement in the surrounding land usage for agriculture. Due to its nature, it is only commercially possible in areas that have large reserves of saline groundwater, such as Australia.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Barbary Coast" [...] {{emphasizes}} the Berber coastal regions and cities {{throughout the middle}} and western coastal regions of North Africa - what is now modern nations of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.

50|$|Flatland skimboarding (also {{known as}} inland skimboarding) {{is a form}} of skimboarding practiced on <b>non-coastal</b> waters, such as a river, lake, stream or puddle. It uses a wooden board about three times as wide as a {{skateboard}} and one and a half times as long. The board is thrown across a thin film of water. While the board is still moving the rider jumps on and skims across the water to do what ever tricks he or she can imagine.|$|E
