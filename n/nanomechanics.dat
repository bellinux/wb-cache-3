25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular <b>nanomechanics</b> and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{phenomena}} become pronounced as {{the size}} of the system decreases. These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example the [...] "quantum size effect" [...] where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called quantum realm. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics.

This feature article concerns mainly how to employ AFM-based SMFS to obtain some of the important information which is not available by conventional characterizing methods, including single chain mechanics, the interfacial conformation and adhesive energy of polymers, interaction between macromolecules and small molecules, and the direct measurement of intermolecular forces.

40|$|We {{systematically}} studied {{effects of}} selective hydrogenation of {{single-walled carbon nanotube}} (SWNT) on the shape of tube cross section based on a mechanical relaxation model and ab initio calculations. We found that fully hydrogenated SWNTs (FH-SWNTs) are energetically more favorable than partially hydrogenated ones. We uncovered a new channel for the strain relaxation at the nanoscale, {{in contrast to the}} known plasticity or buckling channel. We showed that the curvature strain energy of a cylindrical FH-SWNT can be significantly relieved by flipping a few rows of H atoms from outside to inside of the tube. We conclude that selective hydrogenation of SWNTs not only can be an effective way to achieve highly stable configurations of FH-SWNTs but also can be used to control the shape of tube cross section (triangle, square, etc.) for <b>nanomechanic</b> applications.

Determining how chromatin remains accessible to DNA binding proteins, and transcription machinery is crucial to understand the link between genetic regulation, DNA structure, and topology. Here, we study very large supercoiled dsDNA using high-resolution characterization, theoretical modeling, and molecular dynamics calculations. We unveil {{a new type of}} highly ordered DNA organization forming in the presence of attractive DNA-DNA interactions, which we call hyperplectonemes. We demonstrate that their formation depends on DNA size, supercoiling, and bacterial physiology. We compare structural, <b>nanomechanic,</b> and dynamic properties of hyperplectonemes bound by three highly abundant nucleoid-associated proteins (FIS, H-NS, and HU). In all these cases, the negative supercoiling of DNA determines molecular dynamics, modulating their 3 D shape.

Electron backscatter diffraction EBSD and transmission electron microscopy TEM studies revealed outstanding structural properties of this nanomaterial. It could be shown that SiNWs with entirely predetermined shapes including lengths, diameters and spacings and straight side walls form independently of their crystalline orientation and arrange in ordered arrays on glass. Furthermore, {{for the first time}} grain boundaries could be observed in individual, straightly etched SiNWs. After heat treatment an electronic grade surface quality of the SiNWs could be shown by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS. Integrating sphere measurements show that SiNW patterning of the multicrystalline Si mc Si starting thin film on glass substantially increases absorption and reduces reflection, as being desired for an application in thin film photovoltaics PV.

30|$|Interests on {{semiconductor}} nanowires (NWs) {{are derived}} from their unique physical properties compared with the bulk materials such as the quantum confinement and increased cross sections [1, 2] {{as well as their}} potentials to be adapted in numerous electronic, optoelectronic, and <b>nanomechanic</b> applications [3 – 5]. For instance, a single GaAs NW photovoltaic device has demonstrated 40 % conversion efficiency over the 'Shockley-Queisser limit’ [5]. The fabrication of NWs is usually achieved via the metallic droplet-assisted vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism [6 – 8]. In the VLS, crystallization can occur at the liquid-solid interface due to the higher sticking coefficient and the Au droplets as a common catalyst exert an excellent capability of transferring the vapor phase precursors through the supersaturation regardless of the materials and substrates utilized. Naturally, NWs can only be grown at droplet sites, and thus, the fabrication of NWs including the size, density, and shape strongly depends on the fabrication of Au droplets. For example, ZnO NWs showed a larger diameter as well as lower density with the increased size of droplets [9]. To date, various NWs such as Si, Ge, ZnO, GaN, GaAs, InP, and InAs have been fabricated by the Au droplet-assisted VLS approach [9 – 16]. In the meantime, due to their unique properties and applications, such as localized surface plasmonic resonance, catalysis, quantum size effect, and bio-sensing, Au droplets have drawn a lot of research attention and have been demonstrated on diverse surfaces including Si, sapphire, SiO 2, GaN SiC, and polymeric substrates [17 – 25]. As a common semiconductor with a direct band gap, GaAs is widely used in light-absorbing and light-emitting devices, and also various GaAs surfaces of different indices are often used in controlled fabrication of nanostructures. For example, the cross-sectional shape of NWs can be determined by substrate indices such as a triangular shape on GaAs (111)A, trapezoid shape on GaAs (110), and hexagonal shape on GaAs (111)B [26 – 28]. In addition, the resulting NWs on GaAs (111)B often showed stacking faults (SFs), and SF-free NWs can be successfully fabricated on GaAs (311)B and others [29 – 31]. This naturally puts the investigation on the Au droplets synthesized on a diverse GaAs index, which is an essential research topic in the fabrication of desired NWs. However, to date, systematic studies on Au droplets on type-B GaAs are still deficient.|$|R
