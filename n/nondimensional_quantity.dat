40|$|Flexible link {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} becoming popular for advantages like superior performance in micro/nanopositioning, less weight, compact design, lower power requirements, and so on. The dynamics of distributed and lumped parameter flexible link systems, {{especially those in}} vertical planes are difficult to capture with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and pose a challenge to control. A representative case, an inverted flexible pendulum with tip mass on a cart system, is considered in this paper. A dynamic model for this system from a control perspective is developed using an Euler Lagrange formulation. The major difference between the proposed method and several previous attempts {{is the use of}} length constraint, large deformations, and tip mass considered together. The proposed dynamic equations are demonstrated to display an odd number of multiple equilibria based on <b>nondimensional</b> <b>quantity</b> dependent on tip mass. Furthermore, the equilibrium solutions thus obtained are shown to compare fairly with static solutions obtained using elastica theory. The system is demonstrated to exhibit chaotic behavior similar to that previously observed for vibrating elastic beam without tip mass. Finally, the dynamic model is validated with experimental data for a couple of cases of beam excitation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The present {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of previous explorations by the authors, aimed at gaining a basic under-standing of the time domain (TD) behavior of large periodic phased (i. e., sequentially turned-on) array antenna and related configurations. Our systematic investigation of the relevant canonical TD dipole-excited Green’s functions has so far included those for infinite and truncated sequentially pulsed line periodic arrays, parameterized in terms of radiating (propagating) and nonradiating (evanescent) conical TD Floquet waves (FW) and truncation-induced TD FW-modulated tip diffractions. The present contribution extends these investigations to an infinite periodic sequentially pulsed planar array, which generates pulsed plane propagating and evanescent FW. Starting from the familiar frequency domain (FD) transformation of the linearly phased element-by-element summation synthesis into summations of propagating and evanescent FWs, we access the time domain by Fourier inversion. The inversion integrals are manipulated in a unified fashion into exact closed forms, which are parameterized by the single <b>nondimensional</b> <b>quantity</b> = () 1, where () and are the excitation phase speed along a preferred phasing direction 1 in the array plane and the ambient wave speed, respectively. The present study deals with the practically relevant rapidly phased propagating case 1, reserving the more intricate slowly phased 1 regime for a future manuscript. Numerical reference data generated via element-by-element summation over the fields radiated by the individual dipoles with ultrawide band-limited excitation are compared with results obtained much more efficiently by inclusion of a few TD–FWs. Physical interpretation of the formal TD–FW solutions is ob-tained by recourse to asymptotics, instantaneous frequencies and wavenumbers, and related constructs. Of special interest is the demonstration that the TD–FWs emerge along “equal-delay” ellipses from the array plane; this furnishes a novel and phys-ically appealing interpretation of the planar array TD–FW phenomenology...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} is to obtain quantitative information on the turbulent transport of mass, angular momentum, and energy under the conditions that characterize the solar nebula, by direct numerical calculations. These calculations were made possible by research conducted on supercomputers (Cray XMP and Cray 2) by the Ames Computational Fluid Dynamics Branch. Techniques were developed that permitted the accurate representation of turbulent flows over {{the full range of}} important eddy sizes. So far, these techniques were applied (and verified) primarily in mundane laboratory situations, but they have a strong potential for astrophysical applications. A sequence of numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the Reynold's stress tensor, turbulent heat transfer rate, turbulent dissipation rate, and turbulent kinetic energy spectrum, as functions of position, for conditions relevant to the solar nebula.

This process is important in the interaction of the cell with its surroundings and in determining the cell’s behavior and fate. Motivated by published experiments on curvature-modulated phase separation in lipid membranes, we formulate a mathematical model aiming at studying the spatial ordering of composition in a two-component biomembrane that is subjected to a prescribed (imposed) geometry. Based on this model, we identified key <b>nondimensional</b> <b>quantities</b> that govern the biomembrane response and performed numerical simulations to quantitatively explore their influence. We reproduce published experimental observations and extend them to surfaces with geometric features (imposed geometry) and lipid phases beyond those used in the experiments. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility for curvature-modulated phase separation above the critical temperature and propose a systematic procedure to determine which mechanism, the difference in bending stiffness or difference in spontaneous curvatures of the two phases, dominates the coupling between shape and composition...|$|R

We examine the heat transfer characteristics of this situation, to estimate the maximum temperature increase and thermal time constants that might be encountered in such an experiment. The sample is modeled as a uniform sphere, cylinder, or slab subject to uniform heating, which is located in an unbounded coolant flow. The heat transfer is determined by the Biot and Reynolds numbers (which reflect the geometry, fluid flow, and material thermal properties of the system) the temperature rise is governed by the heat conduction equation coupled with external convection. The results are expressed in terms of <b>nondimensional</b> <b>quantities,</b> from which the thermal response of a heated object of arbitrary size can be determined. At low coolant flow rates, the maximum temperature rise can be biologically significant, even for relatively small objects (of millimeter radius) exposed to moderate levels of microwave energy (with a SAR of ca. 100 mW/g). The results are valid also where the coolant is a gas or a liquid different from water, the only restriction being on the Reynolds number of the flow...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{viscosity}} of {{the medium}} {{plays an important role}} in defining the characteristics of sound wave propagation in ducts. This effect, due to the difficulty of analysis, has been either completely neglected in the literature or considered only approximately. In this study, a mathematical model is constructed to describe the physical problem in its general form without imposing assumptions a priori. The physical quantities have been conveniently expressed in only two <b>nondimensional</b> <b>quantities,</b> a frequency or wave number bK and a Reynolds number Re. The set of equations describing the model is solved in two-dimensional ducts in the case of no mean flow. Closed-form, exact solutions for the acoustic parameters are obtained. The effect of both Re and bK are computed and presented graphically. The results confirm the existence of a small region, the acoustic boundary layer, inside which the acoustic parameters vary very rapidly. For the first time, the vaues of u, v and p are computed inside the acoustic boundary layer. The profiles of these parameters are presented across the duct width. The widely used assumption that the viscous effect is confined to the boundary layers, and the rest of the field is essentially inviscid is not supported by the current results...|$|R

During {{the early stages of}} a project, the process engineer needs to know the performance of turbomachinery, the horsepower, etc., in order to complete the arrangement of equipment in the process. As the project progresses, selection of the turbomachinery becomes focused on materials of construction, rotor design, bearings, and seals. The configuration of a centrifugal compressor employing radial flow type impellers in a typical refinery process is presented, along with the methods used to select, compute estimated performance and mechanical design parameters, including materials of construction. A discussion is included on the <b>nondimensional</b> <b>quantities</b> of aerodynamic (rotating) elements; specific speed, suction specific speed, and flow coefficient. The compressor selection discussions are directed primarily to radial flow type compressors that are commonly used in hydrogen rich services for a refinery unit. Here, "selection of turbomachinery" is considered to be computation (estimation) of thermodynamic performance, metallurgy and rotor arrangement (shaft, bearings, seals, etc.).

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of g-jitter, the residual acceleration aboard spacecraft, on selected classes of materials processes. In particular, the anticipated acceleration environment aboard Space Station Freedom (SSF) and its potential effects are analyzed, but the topic is covered with a sufficient level of generality as to apply to other processes and to other vehicles as well. Some of the key findings of this study include: The present acceleration specifications for SSF are inadequate to assure a quality level low-g environment. The local g vector orientation is an extremely sensitive parameter for certain key processes, but can not be controlled to within the desired tolerance. Therefore, less emphasis should be placed upon achieving a tight control of SSF attitude, but more emphasis should be focused on reducing the overall level of the g-jitter magnitude. Melt-based crystal growth may not be successfully processed in the relatively noisy environment of a large inhabited space structure. Growth from vapor or from solution appears more favorable. A smaller space structure and/or a free flyer can provide better alternatives in terms of g-jitter considerations. A high priority (including budgetary) should be given to coordinated efforts among researchers, SSF designers, and equipment contractors, to develop practical experiment-specific sensitivity requirements. Combined focused numerical simulations and experiments with well-resolved acceleration measurements should be vigorously pursued for developing reliable experiment-specific sensitivity data. Appendices provide an extensive cross-referenced bibliography, a discussion of the merits offered by g-jitter analysis techniques, as well as definitions of relevant <b>nondimensional</b> <b>quantities</b> and a brief description of available accelerometry hardware...|$|R
40|$|Nondimensional linear-bifurcation {{buckling}} equations for balanced, symmetrically laminated cylinders with negligible shell-wall anisotropies {{and subjected}} to uniform axial compression loads are presented. These equations are solved exactly for the practical case of simply supported ends. <b>Nondimensional</b> <b>quantities</b> are used to characterize the buckling behavior that consist of a stiffness-weighted length-to-radius parameter, a stiffness-weighted shell-thinness parameter, a shell-wall nonhomogeneity parameter, two orthotropy parameters, and a nondimensional buckling load. Ranges for the nondimensional parameters are established that encompass {{a wide range of}} laminated-wall constructions and numerous generic plots of nondimensional buckling load versus a stiffness-weighted length-to-radius ratio are presented for various combinations of the other parameters. These plots are expected to include many practical cases of interest to designers. Additionally, these plots show how the parameter values affect the distribution and size of the festoons forming each response curve and how they affect the attenuation of each response curve to the corresponding solution for an infinitely long cylinder. To aid in preliminary design studies, approximate formulas for the nondimensional buckling load are derived, and validated against the corresponding exact solution, that give the attenuated buckling response of an infinitely long cylinder in terms of the nondimensional parameters presented herein. A relatively small number of "master curves" are identified that give a nondimensional measure of the buckling load of an infinitely long cylinder {{as a function of the}} orthotropy and wall inhomogeneity parameters. These curves reduce greatly the complexity of the design-variable space as compared to representations that use dimensional quantities as design variables. As a result of their inherent simplicity, these master curves are anticipated to be useful in the ongoing development of buckling-design technology...|$|R
40|$|Fluids with a {{controllable}} {{yield stress}} allow rapid variations in viscous force {{in response to}} an externally applied field. These fluids are used in adaptive energy dissipating devices, which have a controllable force response, reducing shock and vibration loads on occupants and structures. This thesis investigates the physics of these fluids at high speeds and shear rates, through particle modeling and fluid dynamics. The focus is on the experimentally observed reduction in controllable force at high speeds seen in magnetorheological (MR) fluid, a suspension of magnetizable particles that develop a yield stress when a magnetic field is applied. After ruling out particle dynamic effects, this dissertation takes the first rigorous look at the fluid dynamics of a controllable yield stress fluid entering an active region. A simplified model of the flow is developed and, using computational fluid dynamics to inform a control volume analysis, we show that the reduction in high speed controllable force is caused by fluid dynamics. The control volume analysis provides a rigorous criteria for the onset of high speed force effects, based purely on <b>nondimensional</b> fluid <b>quantities.</b> Fits for pressure loss in the simplified flow are constructed, allowing yield force prediction in arbitrary flow mode geometries. The fits are experimentally validated by accurately predicting yield force in all of the known high speed devices. These results should enable the design of a next generation of high performance adaptive energy absorbers...|$|R
40|$|Water waves {{generated}} by underwater landslides threaten coastal communities near heads of fjords, near heads of underwater canyons, near river deltas, and on volcanic islands. This work provides a thorough analysis of water waves {{generated by}} two-dimensional underwater landslides using experimental, theoretical, and computational means. Water wave amplitudes generated by an underwater landslide are {{a function of}} the landslide length, the initial landslide submergence, the incline angle measured from horizontal, the characteristic distance of landslide motion, the characteristic duration of landslide motion, and the landslide rate of deformation. Nondimensional wavemaker curves constructed from the aforementioned parameters allow water wave amplitudes to be predicted. These wavemaker curves apply broadly to water waves generated by unsteady motion of a submerged object provided the motion is governed by only one characteristic distance scale and one characteristic time scale. Water wave amplitude predictions can be used for hazard mitigation studies. An analytical solution of underwater landslide center of mass position in time provides the characteristic distance and time scales of landslide motion. Two-dimensional experimental results on a 45 degree incline confirm the existence of wavemaker curves for solid block landslides as a function of <b>nondimensional</b> geometrical <b>quantities</b> and what is called the Hammack number. The Hammack number is the correct nondimensional time for water wave generation problems. Water wave amplitudes generated by solid block landslides can be predicted from the wavemaker curves if the center of mass motion is known. The analytical solution reproduces the center of mass motion of solid block and granular material landslides. Experimental results of granular material landslides on a 45 degree incline show that landslide deformation reduces water wave amplitudes. Therefore, water waves generated by solid block landslides provide an upper bound on water waves generated by geometrically and kinematically similar deforming landslides. A criterion for the generation of linear water waves is given along with criteria for deep (or long) wave propagation down a constant depth channel. Simulations of water waves generated by underwater landslides were conducted with an inviscid fluid dynamics code. The waves simulated by the code agree reasonably well with experimental results...|$|R
