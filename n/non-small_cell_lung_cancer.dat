5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and metastasis, with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human malignancies. CASS4 function was linked to <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> (NSCLC) {{in a study by}} Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E

40|$|<b>Non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> {{are among}} the leading causes of cancer {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. The prognosis is usually based on traditional pathohistological parameters and clinical stage, but additional prognostic survival factors have also been sought. The aim of this retrospective {{study was to explore}} the membranous expression of HER- 2 /neu and estrogen receptors in nonsmall <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> and their relation to survival of patients with <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> and to traditional prognostic factors. The sample consisted of 132 consecutive, surgically resected patient tissues of <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers,</b> and the following parameters were examined: HER- 2 /neu and estrogen receptor expression, as well as the related clinical and pathological features: tumor, nodes, and metastases stage, level of tumor necrosis, histological and nuclear grade, lymphocytic infiltrate, and number of mitoses. HER- 2 /neu was positive in 28. 8 % of tumor samples, and estrogen receptor expression was positive in 29. 5 % of tumors, but neither was significantly associated with the outcome of <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers.</b> There was a significant association between HER- 2 /neu and nuclear grade (P= 0. 01). In addition, the association between estrogen receptor expression and histological type of tumor (P= 0. 04) and mitotic rate (P= 0. 008) was found. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association of patients’ overall survival with the tumor node metastasis stage (P< 0. 001) and the degree of tumor necrosis (P= 0. 02). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that male gender (P= 0. 01), histological type (P= 0. 03), high degree of necrosis (P= 0. 006), and higher histological grade (P= 0. 037) were associated with the patients’ survival. Our findings indicate that the expression of HER- 2 /neu and estrogen receptor is less reliable than traditional histological parameters in predicting the survival of patients with <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

25|$|Examples of {{surgical}} procedures for cancer include mastectomy for breast cancer, prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and lung cancer surgery for <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b> The {{goal of the}} surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. A single cancer cell is invisible {{to the naked eye}} but can regrow into a new tumor, a process called recurrence.

40|$|N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase- 3 (GalNAc-T 3) is {{an enzyme}} {{involved}} in the initial glycosylation of mucin-type O-linked proteins. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine GalNAc-T 3 expression in 215 surgically resected <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers.</b> We analysed the biological and clinical importance of GalNAc-T 3 expression, {{especially with regard to}} its potential as a prognostic factor. We found that normal bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial gland cells, and alveolar pneumocytes showed cytoplasmic immunostaining for GalNAc-T 3. Low expression of GalNAc-T 3, observed in 93 of 215 tumours (43. 4 %), was found more frequently in tumours from smokers than those from nonsmokers (P= 0. 001), in squamous cell carcinomas than nonsquamous cell carcinomas (P< 0. 0001), and in moderately and poorly differentiated tumours than well differentiated tumours (P= 0. 0002). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an association of low GalNAc-T 3 expression with squamous cell carcinomas was the only one significant relationship of GalNAc-T 3 expression with various factors (P< 0. 0001). Moreover, tumours losing GalNAc-T 3 expression had a significantly higher Ki- 67 labelling index than tumours retaining GalNAc-T 3 expression (P= 0. 0003). Patients with low GalNAc-T 3 expression survived a significantly shorter time than patients with high GalNAc-T 3 expression in 103 pStage I <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> (5 -year survival rates, 58 % and 78 %, respectively; P= 0. 02 by log-rank test) as well as in 61 pStage I nonsquamous cell carcinomas (5 -year survival rates, 63 % and 85 %, respectively; P= 0. 03). Low GalNAc-T 3 expression was an unfavourable prognostic factor in pStage I <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> (hazards ratio, 2. 04; P= 0. 03), and in pStage I nonsquamous cell carcinomas (hazards ratio, 2. 70; P= 0. 03). These results suggest that GalNAc-T 3 is a new marker of <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> with specificity for histology and prognosis...|$|R
25|$|Dysregulation of IGFBP-3 {{has been}} implicated in many cancers. IGFBP-3 is {{sometimes}} referred to as a tumor suppressor, and downregulation of its tissue expression by promoter hypermethylation in some cancers, such as hepatoma. and <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> may be associated with poor patient outcome. However, consistent with the dual inhibitory and stimulatory roles of IGFBP-3 seen in cell culture, there are other cancer types, such as breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and clear cell renal cell cancer in which high tissue IGFBP-3 expression has been linked to poor prognostic features or patient outcome. The mechanisms regulating these contrasting effects of IGFBP-3 in vivo are not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Many tumors express {{mutations}}. These mutations potentially {{create new}} targetable antigens (neoantigens) {{for use in}} T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high mutational burden. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In <b>non–small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched {{for a series of}} tetrapeptide motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit. However, human neoantigens identified in other studies do not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.|$|E

For example: non-melanoma skin cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, <b>non-small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> <b>cancer,</b> cervical cancer, anal cancer, prostate cancer.
