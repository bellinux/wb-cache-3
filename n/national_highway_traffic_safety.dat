40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we examine whether {{the top five}} {{executives}} of automakers engage in abnormal selling during various stages of auto recalls. We find no evidence of abnormal selling around the date the auto recall is publicly announced. However, we find that insider selling activity is concentrated around the one month before the date the defect report was received by the <b>National</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Safety</b> Administration. We further document that insider selling activity is more pronounced prior to auto recalls preceded by more severe customer complaints (number of accidents, injuries, fires etc.) or accompanied with larger declines in the manufacture’s share price. Collectively, we provide evidence consistent with insiders of automakers engaging in opportunistic trading activity {{at the expense of}} other shareholders...|$|R

5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{well-established}} and validated methods {{commonly used}} in vehicular accident reconstruction involved analyzing the crush damage experienced by vehicles during the collision impulse. A significant challenge in using this method, however, was the difficulty to obtain crush stiffness coefficients for the subject vehicle.

[...] In the fall of 2004 in the U.S., the <b>National</b> <b>Highway</b> and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration confirmed the international studies, releasing results of a field study in the U.S. of ESC effectiveness. The NHTSA in United States concluded that ESC reduces crashes by 35%. Additionally, Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) with stability control are involved in 67% fewer accidents than SUVs without the system. The United States Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) issued its own study in June 2006 showing that up to 10,000 fatal US crashes could be avoided annually if all vehicles were equipped with ESC.

40|$|Background: Sales of new on-road {{motorcycles}} increased substantially throughout recent years. As {{gas prices}} {{continue to increase}} in the U. S., more people are turning to other alternatives means of transportation such as motorcycles. In Hawaii, motorcycles sales and riders steadily increased over the past 5 years due to same reasons nationally of increasing gas prices and popularity in the media. Hypothesis: This author believes that the death rate of motorcyclists in Hawaii will be either equivalent or higher to the national average due to their current law of helmet use for motorcyclist. Methods: A retrospective chart review of public data that has been acquired from Fatal Analysis Reporting System of <b>National</b> <b>Highway</b> and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration. Results: In the period from 1995 - 2004, there were 193 total deaths attributed to motorcycles crashes in Hawaii with no trend in the annual numbers, the highest in fatalities occurring in 2002. One hundred Thirty-nine of decedents of motorcycle crashes were not wearing a helmet {{at the time of}} the crash. Most of the crashes occurred during the time of day between 4 pm - 12 midnight. Alcohol use was prevalent over a third of the motorcycle crashes. Conclusion: This study finds that through in-depth statistical analysis of fatalities retrieved by the FARS through NHTSA, fatalities in Hawaii have been at a high rate. One can infer from the data that one of the major reasons resulting to this high fatality rate is because of the majority of the decedents was not wearing a helmet {{at the time of the}} crash...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a set of}} performance metrics and a performance measurement system developed {{for the evaluation of}} roadway departure warning systems. The work is part of an effort by the Department of Transportation's <b>National</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Safety</b> Administration (NHTSA) to develop quantitative measures of performance for the evaluation of highway safety systems. The work is also {{part of an effort to}} promote dual-use technologies between the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense. The Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology undertook the development of the performance measurement system. The approach for quantitative evaluation rests on establishing a baseline measurement of roadway departure that is of higher accuracy than the warning system under test. The output of the warning system is then compared to the baseline measurement to produce a quantitative measure of performance. The baseline measurement system is installed on a vehicle with the warning system. The baseline system achieves high accuracy by aiming a calibrated camera onto an area of the road adjacent to the vehicle. As the vehicle is driven and roadway departure maneuvers are performed, the output of the video camera, the vehicle's position (from a global positioning system and inertial sensors), and the output of the warning system are synchronized and digitally recorded. After a vehicle run is complete, a suite of software is used to automatically analyze the baseline video data to determine roadway departure. Since the video and other data remain available after the vehicle run, an operator (to establish the credibility of the baseline measurement) can verify a roadway departure. Also, the data can be analyzed to provide insight into the c [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{automotive}} {{manufacturing environment}} is dynamic. It {{is characterized by}} short life cycles of products especially in powertrain, {{due in part to}} changing Government regulations for fuel economy. In the USA, the <b>National</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Safety</b> Administration (NHTSA), Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) mandates an average of 29 miles per gallon (mpg), gradually increasing to 35. 5 mpg by 2016 and 54. 5 mpg towards 2025. Life cycles of engines and transmissions have consequently shortened, driving automakers to develop and manufacture more efficient powertrains. Not long ago, plants produced engines for decades, with minor modifications warranting slight manufacturing line rework. Conversely, today’s changing trends require machines and complete engine line overhauls rendering initial setups obsolete. Automakers compete to satisfy government regulations for best mileage and also lower manufacturing cost, thus the adoption of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS). Production lines follow modularity in designs, for hardware and software, to adapt to new business conditions, economically and time-wise. Information Technology (IT) and Controls are growing closer with the line of demarcation disappearing in manufacturing. Controls are benefiting from opportunities in IT, hardware and software. The advent of agent-based technology which are autonomous, cooperative and extendible in different production activities, helped to develop controls for RMS in academia. Component-based software suitable for RMS modularity and plug-and-play hardware/software components has gained decades of popularity in the software industry. This thesis implements distributed controls imbedding component-based technology and IEC 61311 - 3 function block standard for automotive engine assembly, which will contribute to these developments. The control architecture provides reconfigurability which is lacking in current manufacturing systems. The research imbeds: 1 - Reconfigurability - Fitting RMS-designed hardware towards new manufacturing, 2 - Reusability - Building software library for reuse across assembly lines, and 3 - Plug-and-Play - Embedding easy to assemble software components (function blocks) ...|$|R
40|$|The special {{interests}} leading the accelerating crusade against regulation have re-ignited a potent coalition of industry lobbyists, traditional conservatives, and grassroots Tea Party activists. The politicians speak in generic terms for public consumption: “the nation is broke,” “big government is bad,” “regulation costs trillions. ” Behind the scenes, industry lobbyists target for repeal dozens of regulations {{that are designed}} to control pollution, ensure drug, product, and food safety, and eliminate workplace hazards. In an effort to bring light and air to an often misleading and always opportunistic national debate, this essay presents five truths about the state of health, safety, and environmental regulation in America: First, regulatory dysfunction hurts many people. At the same time, big, bad government and powerful, protective regulation are two different things. The current system is sufficiently weak, especially with respect to enforcement, that even scoundrels are not stopped. Fourth, regulated industries understand the benefits of regulation and could negotiate compromises with agencies and public interest representatives if deregulatory opportunists would back off. Finally, if left alone, health, safety, and environmental agencies could accomplish great things. Six “protector agencies” with the mission to safeguard people and natural resources from the hazards of the industrial age are the focus of the essay. In the descending order of size include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the <b>National</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Safety</b> Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In a nutshell, I argue that stringent regulation has enabled this country to achieve a remarkable level of industrialization while maintaining its natural environment to a remarkable degree, with the admittedly huge exception of the eroding ozone layer that is causing severe climate change. For verification of this observation, we have only to consider China, where a break-neck pace toward industrial development has left the environment in shambles, causing as many as 2. 4 million deaths annually {{as a direct result of}} contaminated water and air (adjusted for population, the American equivalent would be 558, 000 deaths). The truth about regulation in America is that we cannot prosper without it, as many corporate executives will admit when they are standing outside the herd. The agencies that protect health, safety, and the environment cost less than one percent of the federal budget and projected benefits exceed costs by at least two to one. But the agencies are growing weaker and less able to enforce the law effectively. Further, as happened on Wall Street, even egregious violators continue business as usual until disaster strikes (and, in some painfully notorious cases, even afterwards—see, for example, British Petroleum’s chronic violations of worker safety and environmental laws that were left undeterred over the decade leading up to the Gulf oil spill) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. In {{the last}} decade, the {{increase}} in usage of light trucks and vans (LTVs) has resulted {{in an increase in}} fatal injuries to the occupants of passenger cars for truck-car accidents, because of the aggressive nature of LTVs. To study the aggressive behavior of LTVs, <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration (NHTSA) has developed an aggressivity metric (AM) for different vehicles in a specific impact configuration. These AM however does not produce consistent estimates when specific vehicle-to-vehicle impact categories are studied. Hence, NHTSA has introduced a Driver Fatality Ratio (DFR), based on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and General Estimating System (GES) crash Involvement statistics, which has produced good estimates of the aggressive behavior of vehicles in crashes. The DFR proposed by NHTSA is based on the statistical data, which makes it difficult to evaluate DFR for other vehicle categories (e. g., crossovers, etc.), which are relatively new in the market as they do not have sufficient crash statistics. This research work proposes a new methodology based on computational reconstruction of impact crashes and objective measures to predict the DFR for any vehicle. The objective measures considered include the ratios of maximum intrusion, peak acceleration, and weight for the two vehicles in head-on collisions. Factors which directly influence fatal injuries to the occupants are identified and studied to develop a relation between these objective measures to the DFR. The proposed method is then validated for a range of LTVs against a passenger car, and is then used to predict the DFR for a cross category vehicle, a light pick-up truck, and a full-size car. Factors which influence these objective measures in predicting the DFR are discussed. Results from this study indicate that the ratio of intrusions produces a better estimate of the DFR and can be utilized in predicting fatality ratios for head-on collisions...|$|R
