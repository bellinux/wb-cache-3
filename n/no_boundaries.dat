One early convert observed: “The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.” The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} initiatives taken by Zia in 1977, was to militarise the integrated atomic energy programme which was founded by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1972. During the first stages, the programme was {{under the control of}} Bhutto and the Directorate for Science, under Science Advisor Dr. Mubashir Hassan, who was heading the civilian committee that supervised the construction of the facilities and laboratories. This atomic bomb project had <b>no</b> <b>boundaries</b> with Munir Ahmad Khan and Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan leading their efforts separately and reported to Bhutto and his science adviser Dr. Hassan who had little interest in the atomic bomb project. Major-General Zahid Ali Akbar, an engineering officer, had little role in the atomic project; Zia responded by taking over the programme under military control and disbanded the civilian directorate when he ordered the arrest of Hassan. This whole giant nuclear energy project was transferred into the administrative hands of Major-General Akbar who was soon made the Lieutenant-General and Engineer-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers to deal with the authorities whose co-operation was required. Akbar consolidated the entire project by placing the scientific research under military control, setting boundaries and goals. Akbar proved to be an extremely capable officer in the matters of science and technology when he aggressively led the development of nuclear weapons under Munir Ahmad Khan and Abdul Qadeer Khan in a matter of five years.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as <b>no</b> <b>boundaries</b> were given {{up in the next}} eight overs, and Yuvraj felt like he had to attack. He got away with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had a feel at a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was gone for a stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but he ran out of partners, as no one could help him keep the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E

500|$|The match {{began on}} 11 February 1851 and was {{scheduled}} to be played to a finish irrespective of time. It was well attended, and booths were set up to accommodate spectators. According to Ray Webster in his analysis of all Australian first-class matches, spectators were not charged for admission; the attendance was approximately 1,000 on the first day and 1,500 on the second. In common with all cricket games at the time, each over consisted of four deliveries. Similarly, there were <b>no</b> <b>boundaries</b> to the pitch, so runs could be scored only by running between wickets, and not by hitting a boundary. Although the colonies were officially called Van Diemen's Land and Port Phillip at this point, press reports generally referred to the teams as [...] "Tasmania" [...] and [...] "Victoria". The match was closely followed in Melbourne.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to Ghosts I–IV was generally favorable, {{with an average}} rating of 69/100 based on 12reviews on Metacritic. Seth Colter Walls of Newsweek described the album as [...] "the kind of absorbing musical experience that the surviving ranks of know-it-all record-store clerks would be pushing on customers, if only they could offer it for sale." [...] IGN gave the album a rating of 8.7 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "The music is so engrossing and encompassing that time ceases to be a factor—at least until the music finally stops." [...] PopMatters gave the album an 8 out of 10 and described the album as [...] "36 tracks, but no songs", {{and went on to}} call it [...] "dark, brooding haunting." [...] Pitchfork criticized the album by saying [...] "nearly every one of the untitled instrumental sketches here feels emaciated and half-finished", and gave the work a 5.0 out of 10.0. Blender also criticized the album, summarizing the review by saying [...] "Nine Inch Nails return with no label oversight, <b>no</b> <b>boundaries</b> and no tunes." ...|$|E

500|$|On 23 March 1973, Lennon {{was ordered}} to leave the US within 60 days. Ono, meanwhile, was granted {{permanent}} residence. In response, Lennon and Ono {{held a press conference}} on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association, where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia; a place with [...] "no land, <b>no</b> <b>boundaries,</b> no passports, only people". Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), they asked for political asylum in the US. The press conference was filmed, and would later appear in the 2006 documentary The US vs. John Lennon. Lennon's Mind Games (1973) included the track [...] "Nutopian International Anthem", which comprised three seconds of silence. Soon after the press conference, Nixon's involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington, DC. They led to the president's resignation 14 months later. Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon, and the deportation order was overturned in 1975. The following year, his US immigration status finally resolved, Lennon received his [...] "green card" [...] certifying his permanent residency, and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.|$|E
500|$|In 1868, Edward Tylecote {{had become}} the first batsman to score a quadruple century (400 runs) in cricket, when he {{accumulated}} 404 not out in an internal match at Clifton College. W. G. Grace had got close to the total in 1876, but ran out of batting partners to finish on 400 not out. In the summer of 1881, Roe achieved his fame, by surpassing them both. In an intercollegiate match between the [...] "long vacation clubs" [...] of Gonville and Caius and Emmanuel, Roe was called upon as a guest player for Emmanuel, who had only managed to find nine players. Caius batted first, and were dismissed for 100 runs exactly, Roe taking half of their wickets and Charles Allcock the other half. Roe and Allcock then proceeded to open the batting for Emmanuel, finishing the day on 157 without the loss of either batsman. The next afternoon Roe reached his century early, and then after scoring 200 runs {{he could have been}} out three times, but each chance was missed. Against bowling described in the contemporary press as weak, he batted {{through the rest of the}} day to finish on 415 not out. The game was played on a ground with <b>no</b> <b>boundaries,</b> so he had to run each of his team's 708 runs, a distance of nearly eight miles. In all, he scored 1 six, 6 fives, 16 fours, 48 threes, 52 twos and 67 ones, but so fastidious was Roe, that when he came off the field at the close of play, he challenged the scorer for crediting him one run short; Roe had counted 416 runs. Roe's record was beaten by James Stewart Carrick in 1885, when the latter scored 419 not out for the West of Scotland against Priory Park, Chichester.|$|E
