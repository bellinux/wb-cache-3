25|$|Ramsay {{is said to}} {{have brought}} great energy to the talk of {{improving}} the College. He embarked on a round of after-dinner parties to promote the College, and in 1883 he was able to build a purpose-built laboratory. In 1884 the College came close to bankruptcy when the Treasurer announced that funds would dry up within two months. The College survived, but two professors were given <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>dismissal</b> and their departments were placed on a self-supporting notice. At this time Welsh colleges were able to receive financial support but not English ones, so English colleges therefore decided to lobby the Government for funding. The result was that English colleges would receive a grant of £15000, of which Bristol gained the modest share of £1,200. Ramsay resigned his post in 1887 after being appointed Chair of Chemistry at University College, London. Although no longer Principal, after his resignation he used his influence to lobby the College council to appoint his assistant Morris Travers to the Chair of Chemistry when the position became vacant. Travers is credited with pushing forward the Charter campaign during the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E

An abrogation of the distasteful rules was requested, June 15, by a committee, consisting of John Donohue, William Schrier, and John C. Meginnes. Superintendent McCallum's explanation and reply not being satisfactory, the engineers struck on June 17 - the first strike {{in the history of}} the railroad. This strike on the Erie was settled after ten days' paralysis of the business of the railroad, and a loss of many thousands of dollars to the Company.|$|R

He discovered them in the main shop at the counter of the ribbon department. He had come to the opposite glove counter with some goods enclosed in a parcel that he had unpacked in his own department. The two ladies were both bent over a box of black ribbon.|$|E

He did not credit his {{subjects}} with the high-mindedness that puts ideals first and money after. That military and civilians alike would rally to a man round Mr. Scobell and the Casino he was well aware. But this did not affect his determination to remain till the last. If he went now, he would be like a boy who makes a runaway ring at the doorbell. Until he should receive formal <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>dismissal,</b> he must stay, although every day had forty-eight hours and every hour twice its complement of weary minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Seeking {{other ways}} to save money, the Board {{obtained}} permission in November 1931 to have only a single conductor on duty per tram regardless {{of the number of}} trailers. By mutual agreement with the union in February 1932, it was decided on a temporary system of a reduction in hours for all traffic staff rather than terminating the employment of 11 men that had become redundant. When the men refused to agree to a renewal of this arrangement the Board dismissed 12 of its staff. A rally in support of the tramway men was held on May Day at which it was decided to strike from the following Wednesday if the <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>dismissal</b> were not rescinded. The Board warned its staff that if they refused to go to work on Wednesday that they would be dismissed, and also advertised for [...] "volunteers" [...] to apply for permanent positions with the Board. Despite offers of negotiation from the union, the Board remained implacable in its position.|$|R

Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III, Thompson sought $246 million in damages from the publisher, Take-Two Interactive, along with PlayStation 2 maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal-Mart. The suit charged that the defendants knew or should have known that the game would cause copycat violence. On October 22, 2003, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> voluntary <b>dismissal,</b> and the case was closed.|$|R

50|$|The {{common law}} afforded the {{employee}} virtually no protection against unfair dismissal.

The employer was not required to give the employee an explanation for the termination; nor was there any requirement that the dismissal be fair.|$|R

Her fourteen-year-old son Mswati emerged from the power struggle as Crown Prince, and in 1986 he was crowned King as Mswati III. One of Ntombi's first acts as regent was to give delegated powers to the Authorized Person, who was still Sozisa, to sign state documents making decisions on a number of matters of national importance. This change had been demanded by the 'Tibiyo' faction. Subsequently, the constitution was revised to provide that where the Regent and the Authorised Person were not in agreement on any matter, it must be referred to the princes and the chiefs.|$|R

The Bar also argued that it was absolutely immune from liability for actions arising out of its disciplinary functions, that the Eleventh Amendment barred Thompson's recovery of damages, and that the court should dismiss the case pursuant to the abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris. On May 4, 2006, Thompson {{filed a motion}} asking Judge Federico Moreno to recuse himself from the case, as Judge Moreno {{was a member of the}} Florida Bar. Citing an [...] "abundance of caution," [...] Judge Moreno recused himself on May 9, 2006 and referred the case to Chief Judge William Zloch for further action. Thompson did not, however, respond to the Bar's motion to dismiss the case. Finally, on May 17, 2006, Thompson filed a <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> Voluntary <b>Dismissal</b> with the court, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.|$|R
