5|$|Soft tissue was {{apparently}} preserved with the specimen, but was subsequently removed during preparation. Covering the limbs {{and the rest}} of the body was a layer of smooth, multilayered calcite, which was originally interpreted as preservation of decaying skin. Additionally, an accumulation of sediment in the abdominal region may have represented gut contents, with both gastroliths and digested bones. However, since both samples of the alleged soft tissue are <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available,</b> it is impossible to verify these interpretations.|$|E

Henceforth, neither adversary respected Kentucky's proclaimed neutrality, and the Confederate advantage was lost. The buffer zone that Kentucky provided between the North and the South was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available</b> to assist in the defense of Tennessee.|$|E

Rockstar also developed a Facebook application based on the game, titled Red Dead Redemption: Gunslingers. Released on April 12, 2010, the game was a role-playing social game that allowed players to duel their friends; it is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available,</b> due to updates on the Facebook platform.|$|E
5|$|AMD chose a {{different}} direction, designing the less radical x86-64, a 64-bit extension {{to the existing}} x86 architecture, which Microsoft then supported, forcing Intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors. These designs can run existing 32-bit applications at native hardware speed, while offering support for 64-bit memory addressing and other enhancements to new applications. This architecture has now become the predominant 64-bit architecture in the desktop and portable market. Although some Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, they are <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2002, Google cofounder Sergey Brin {{launched}} Google Compute as an add-on for the Google Toolbar.

The program ended in October 2005, {{in favor of the}} official Folding@home clients, and is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available</b> for the Toolbar. Folding@home also gained participants from Genome@home, another distributed computing project from the Pande lab and a sister project to Folding@home. The goal of Genome@home was protein design and associated applications. Following its official conclusion in March 2004, users were asked to donate computing power to Folding@home instead.|$|E

However, the numbers are not {{considered}} to be officially retired. Although Aurie's uniform was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris, current team owner Mike Ilitch does not consider the number to be retired. Konstantinov's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mining regions}} of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive {{large-scale}} mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production. The gold mines of Dacia, for instance, were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available</b> for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271. Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century.|$|E

5|$|After the {{unexpected}} {{success of the}} first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony contacted Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console. Revolution wanted {{to move away from the}} style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. According to executive producer Charles Cecil, the game was inspired by crime films Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title. In Cold Blood was released on 14 July and 10 October 2000 in Europe, and on 25 March and 30 May 2001 in North America for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. While the PlayStation version is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available</b> for purchase, the PC version can be purchased at GOG.com.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flytoget {{announced}} that they had ordered a fourth car {{for each of the}} units. This increased the capacity of each unit by 40% to 244 seats, and allows the company to manage the annual 10% growth in passengers. The delivery of the fourth cars started in 2008 and were built by Bombardier Transportation, who has bought ADtranz, with the rebuilding scheduled to be completed during 2009. The rebuilding created several challenges for Bombardier, since most of the components used in the class were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available.</b> Significant components such as the car body and rectifiers had to be built by Bombardier based on abandoned production lines, and many of the original manufacturers for the interior have become defunct.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>available.</b> With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E
