5|$|The {{three major}} Armenian {{political}} {{parties of the}} late 19th century and early 20th century — the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchak) and Armenakan Party (later Ramgavar) were present in America <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> after their foundation. They established their own newspapers: Hairenik and Asbarez by Dashnaks and Baikar by Ramgavars. After the Bolsheviks took over Armenia in 1920, Rmagavars and Hunchaks formed a coalition supporting Soviet Armenia, while the ARF, the ruling party of the Republic of Armenia from 1918 to 1920, remained anti-Soviet in the diaspora. The 1988 Spitak earthquake and the Karabakh movement brought the separate groups of the Armenian community together.|$|E
5|$|In July 1848, <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> after James Marshall's famous gold find at Sutter's Mill – {{which started}} the California Gold Rush – Major Reading {{discovered}} gold on the Trinity River. The find attracted thousands of miners {{to the area}} and created boomtowns such as Douglas City, Francis, Hoboken, Lake City, Lewiston, Junction City and Quimby. Weaverville, located {{at the end of}} the trail Reading had established from the Sacramento Valley to the Trinity, prospered as the main trade center through which gold was exchanged for imported supplies and services. The initial discoveries were placer deposits, carried by the river to settle in gravel bars. The Trinity River gold rush is also noted for the large number of Chinese miners attracted to the area, as many as 2,500 by 1854. Many of the Chinese were from the Pearl River Delta (Guangdong region).|$|E

The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat and the pilots were not immediately killed but shoved {{to the back of}} the plane with the rest of the passengers. At 08:54, the plane began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. Two minutes later at 08:56, the plane's transponder was switched off. The hijackers set the flight's autopilot on a course heading east towards Washington, D.C.|$|E

Maria Teresa was married to Pier Antonio Pinottini on June 13, 1752, and they settled in a district populated by intellects and artists, but eventually suffered severe financial ruin.

25|$|Terengganu {{used to be}} Malaysia's poorest state until oil and gas were {{discovered}} off its coastline <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> ago. Terengganu's main industry now is petroleum and gas. There are huge petrochemical complexes near Paka and Kerteh, involving many joint ventures between the Malaysian national oil company, Petronas, and foreign multinationals. Tourism and fishing are also major industries in Terengganu, a state with a long coastline. Agriculture also remains important, with banana, rambutan, durian, watermelon, and various other fruits and vegetables available in season. Terengganu was traditionally famous for boat-building, with highly decorated carved wooden boats called bangau {{to be found in}} the harbour of every village and town in days not so long gone by, before electric motorboats became standard equipment for the state's fishermen.|$|E

25|$|Of the two batsmen, Hayden was {{the most}} prolific. He reached the 50-run mark from 71 balls with a single off Khan in the 27th over. Ponting {{followed}} him, <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> after, reaching his fifty from 84 balls. Hayden reached his hundred off a mere 137 balls, but his knock was circumspect. He was selective about his strokeplay early on in his innings, batting cautiously against Ashish Nehra, who bowled two accurate and probing spells to him. His runs came mostly off Agarkar's and Kumble's bowling, driving the former down the ground, while slogging the latter, never allowing him to settle. He repeatedly attacked Kumble, whose figures were unimpressive–5-1-35-0. Hayden's running was equally good as well. After reaching his hundred, he broke the self-imposed shackles off, taking guard outside his crease, and dispatching even the good balls for boundaries.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> before he died, {{but it is}} likely that the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E
500|$|In 1154, the Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal Yuri Dolgoruki {{divided the}} {{territory}} surrounding the monastery's grounds amongst his sons.

[...] Bogolyubsky despised the city of Kiev, therefore moving to Suzdal, in modern-day Russia. On his trip, he took with him the [...] "Theotokos of Vladimir" [...] icon, a gift from Constantinople Patriarch Luke Chrysoberges to Dolgoruki.

This forced a last minute re-write that saw about 9 pages cut from the previously 110 page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase {{at the end of}} the Twelve Bullets Fight, and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, [...] "It was that last, lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it.

Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it.

500|$|On {{arrival in}} London, Hammill and Smith {{met up with}} trainee BBC {{engineer}} and classically trained organist Hugh Banton, who was a brother {{of one of their}} friends back in Manchester. Later that year, they met Tony Stratton-Smith, who agreed to sign a management contract with them in December. Through him, the band acquired a bass guitar player, Keith Ellis, with drummer Guy Evans joining <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> afterwards. This line-up performed on BBC Radio 1's Top Gear radio show in November, and recorded a series of demos for Mercury, before releasing a single ("People You Were Going To" [...] b/w [...] "Firebrand") on Polydor Records in January 1969. Melody Maker said the single was [...] "one of the best records of the week". But the single was quickly withdrawn under pressure from Mercury, since it violated the contract band members Hammill and Smith signed the previous year. Smith, feeling superfluous to requirements, left the band, amicably, shortly after the recording of the single. He later released demos featuring his time in Van der Graaf Generator on a CD, Democrazy.|$|E
