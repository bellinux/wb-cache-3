40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} perform Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) {{of a given}} system, it is {{necessary}} to define some relevant variables sensitive to the different degradation modes of the system. Those variables are named Health Indicators (HI) and they are the keystone of PHM. However, they are subject to a lot of uncertainties when computed in real time and the stochastic nature of PHM makes it hard to evaluate the efficiency of a HI set before the extraction algorithm is implemented. This document introduces <b>Numerical</b> <b>Key</b> Performance Indicators (NKPI) for the validation of HI computed only from data provided by numerical models in the upstream stages of a PHM system development process. In order to match as good as possible the reality, the multiple sources of uncertainties are quantified and propagated into the model.

40|$|Micro-data {{protection}} {{is a hot}} topic in the eld of Statis-tical Disclosure Control (SDC), that has gained special in-terest after the disclosure of 658000 queries by the AOL search engine in August 2006. Many algorithms, methods and properties have been proposed to deal with micro-data disclosure. p-Sensitive k-anonymity has been recently de-ned as a sophistication of k-anonymity. This new property requires that there be at least p dierent values for each con dential attribute within the records sharing a combi-nation of key attributes. Like k-anonymity, the algorithm originally proposed to achieve this property was based on generalisations and suppressions; when data sets are numer-ical this has several data utility problems, namely turning <b>numerical</b> <b>key</b> attributes into categorical, injecting new cat-egories, injecting missing data, and so on. In this article, we recall the foundational concepts of micro-aggregation, k-anonymity and p-sensitive k-anonymity. We show that k-anonymity and p-sensitive k-anonymity can be achieved in numerical data sets by means of micro-aggregation heuris-tics properly adapted {{to deal with this}} task. In addition, we present and evaluate two heuristics for p-sensitive k-anonymity which, being based on micro-aggregation, over-come most of the drawbacks resulting from the generalisa-tion and suppression method...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{increase}} the dependability of complex systems, one {{solution is to}} assess their state of health continuously through the monitoring of variables sensitive to potential degradation modes. When computed in an operating environment, these variables, known as health indicators, are subject to many uncertainties. Hence, the stochastic nature of health assessment combined {{with the lack of}} data in design stages makes it difficult to evaluate the efficiency of a health indicator before the system enters into service. This paper introduces a method for early validation of health indicators during the design stages of a system development process. This method uses physics-based modeling and uncertainties propagation to create simulated stochastic data. However, because of the large number of parameters defining the model and its computation duration, the necessary runtime for uncertainties propagation is prohibitive. Thus, kriging is used to obtain low computation time estimations of the model outputs. Moreover, sensitivity analysis techniques are performed upstream to determine the hierarchization of the model parameters and to reduce the dimension of the input space. The validation is based on three types of <b>numerical</b> <b>key</b> performance indicators corresponding to the detection, identification and prognostic processes. After having introduced and formalized the framework of uncertain systems modeling and the different performance metrics, the issues of sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling are addressed. The method is subsequently applied to the validation of a set of health indicators for the monitoring of an aircraft engine's pumping unit...|$|E

Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use <b>numerical</b> <b>keys.</b> Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.

40|$|AbstractBoundaries occur {{naturally}} in everyday life. This paper introduces numerical constraints into {{the framework of}} XML {{to take advantage of}} the benefits that result from the explicit specification of such boundaries. Roughly speaking, numerical constraints restrict the number of elements in an XML data fragment based on the data values of selected subelements. Efficient reasoning about numerical constraints provides effective means for predicting the number of answers to XQuery and XPath queries, the number of updates when using the XQuery update facility, and the number of encryptions or decryptions when using XML encryption. Moreover, numerical constraints can help to optimise XQuery and XPath queries, to exclude certain choices of indices from the index selection problem, and to generate views for efficient processing of common queries and updates. We investigate decision problems associated with numerical constraints in order to capitalise on the range of applications in XML data processing. To begin with we demonstrate that the implication problem is strongly coNP-hard for several classes of numerical constraints. These sources of potential intractability direct our attention towards the class of numerical keys that permit the specification of positive upper bounds. Numerical keys are of interest as they are reminiscent of cardinality constraints that are widely used in conceptual data modelling. At the same time, they form a natural generalisation of XML keys that are popular in XML theory and practice. We show that numerical keys are finitely satisfiable and establish a finite axiomatisation for their implication problem. Finally, we propose an algorithm that decides <b>numerical</b> <b>key</b> implication in quadratic time using shortest path methods...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 It is {{necessary}} to evaluate and compare the characteristics of various methods of accessing data-files in order to utilize economically both the hardware and the software (Space and Time) supported by the digital on-line system. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe and evaluate the structure and use of four conventional methods of file organization: Sequential File, Indexed Sequential File, Partitioned File, and Direct File. Special attention is given to the Direct File, which possesses the fastest accessing time. Five selected Hash Coding Techniques, each associated with three methods of handling redundant keys, are simulated and examined with the use of a selected data model of 1024 random United States names, and the resulting "average number of search per record retrieval" are compared with their corresponding theoretical values. As Hash 1 has offered the best results, it has been used to evaluate the organization of the Direct File, and to compare this organization with that of the other files. The CDC- 3300 system hardware parameter, control cycle time, the internal core storage, and the auxiliary storage parameters are introduced. From these values and the average number of searches per record retrieval, an expression of logical record file size, or loading factor is developed. The file size, or loading factor varies for different methods of file structure and accessing, (based upon the selected testing program). The system characteristics consisting of the average throughput per record retrieval, achievable-throughput-rate capability and user operating cost per call (unit cost) are evaluated and compared. The file system uses the full name of the record and a fixed length <b>numerical</b> <b>key.</b> Two common internal searches, Linear search and Binary search, are evaluated and compared as the preliminary work of this investigation, as shown in Appendix B...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{a product}} with lower {{expenses}} is a situation that every farmer {{wants to be in}} and monitoring is an important tool used to provide understanding and a record of performance of a process. This project provides a way to monitor and log information about the performance of an irrigation pumping unit {{over an extended period of}} time, thereby allowing the farmer to use this data to make informed decisions on maintenance and overall efficiency of a pumping unit. The system consists of two main elements: a user configurable data logging station and a second element that controls the interaction between the user and the first element. Furthermore, each of these elements has an extended set of features as follows: The data logging element is able to log data from a set of separate sensors with outputs ranging from a 0 - 5 V analogue voltage through to a pulsed signal output. It also is able to communicate with a PC so that the information that is logged can be downloaded to a comma-separated-variable file for further analysis in a standard spread sheeting package such as Microsoft Excel. The interfacing element is made up of a <b>numerical</b> <b>key</b> pad for input of information into the system and a two by sixteen character liquid crystal display that presents the user with current readings from the sensors. There is a system of software procedures that allows these two components be independent and still communicate with each other thus allowing the input and display element to be in a separate location to that of the sensors and the data logging element. Currently, the system is able to read inputs from four separate sensors and store data for over two months, however, these limits are both easily upgradeable to eight or more sensor inputs and enough memory to last for over twelve months of data...|$|E
