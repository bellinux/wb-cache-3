The carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide is further proteolysed to CCK- 4 (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH 2) by a puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase and to CCK- 3 (Met-Asp-Phe-NH 2) and Gly-Trp by an endopeptidase action.

In the present study, we re-evaluated the effects of SRIF on PC 12 cell differentiation. Our results indicate that SRIF alone is ineffective in promoting neurite outgrowth. Instead, SRIF or its analogue, octreotide (a SRIF agonist on the receptor subtypes 2, 3 and 5), potentiates neurite extension induced by NGF. These results suggest that SRIF enhances neurite formation in PC 12 cells without directly promoting neurite outgrowth. SRIF potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth persists at least in part in the presence of pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting the involvement of PTX-insensitive G-proteins. In addition, protein kinase-dependent pathways are likely to mediate SRIF effects on NGF-induced differentiation...|$|E

To examine the effect of peptide sequence on the folding kinetics of α-helices, we studied the relaxation kinetics of a 21 -residue helical peptide, Conantokin-T (Con-T), using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with a laser-induced temperature jump technique. Con-T is a <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptide</b> containing a large number of charged residues that is found in the venom of the piscivorous cone snail Conus tulipa. The temperature-jump relaxation kinetics of Con-T is distinctly slower than that of previously studied alanine-based peptides, suggesting that the folding time of α-helices is sequence-dependent. Furthermore, it appears that the slower folding of Con-T {{can be attributed to the}} fact that its helical conformation is stabilized by charge-charge interactions or salt bridges. Although this finding contradicts an earlier molecular dynamics simulation, it also has implications for existing models of protein folding...|$|E

40|$|Classical {{transmitters}} and <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides</b> act as transmitters or modulators {{within the}} central and peripheral nervous systems of nematodes, for example Ascaris suum and Caenorhabditis elegans. Acetylcholine (ACh) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are respectively the excitatory and inhibitory transmitters onto somatic body wall muscle while 5 -hydroxytrypamine (5 -HT) is the excitatory transmitter onto pharyngeal muscle. 5 -HT also reduces ACh-induced contractions of somatic muscle and this action of 5 -HT is mediated through activation of adenylate cyclase while that on pharyngeal muscle is mediated through inositol phosphate activation. Glutamate, dopamine and octopamine also have transmitter roles in nematodes. <b>Neuroactive</b> <b>peptides</b> of the RFamide family can excite somatic muscle, for example, AF- 1 (KNEFIRFamide), AF- 2 (KHEYLRFamide), AF- 3 (AVPGVLRFamide) and AF- 4 (GDVPGVLRFamide) or inhibit and relax this muscle, for example, PF- 1 (SDPNFLRFamide), PF- 2 (SADPNFLRFamide) and PF- 4 (KPNlRFamide).

40|$|Examination of Aplysia californica's {{defensive}} withdrawal reflexes {{has been}} particularly powerful in understanding learning-related phenomena. The tail withdrawal reflex is mediated {{in large part by}} identified tail mechanosensory neurons in the pleural ganglia. Although learning-induced changes at the synapses between the identified tail mechanosensory neurons (MSNs) and their follower motor neurons have been extensively studied, the peripheral sensory endings have not been characterized. Using a combination of immunohistochemistry (with an antibody to a neuronal-specific tubulin) and electron microscopy, putative mechanosensory structures in the tail region were identified. These neural structures penetrated the epithelium and terminated as endings consisting of mixed cilia and microvilli. Brunet et al. (1991, Science 252 : 856) have identified a peptide, sensorin-A, that is specific for the Aplysia MSNs. To determine if the cilia/microvilli endings were the sensory endings of the MSNs, immunostaining for sensorin-A was performed in the tail region. Sensorin-A immunofluorescence did not colocalize with the ciliated/microvillar sensory structures, but did reveal the endings of the MSNs. Confocal microscopy of the sensorin-A fibers revealed that they terminated as coiled structures deep in the body wall. The general morphology of these endings most resembled that of vertebrate muscle spindles. Although the ciliated endings were determined not {{to be associated with the}} sensorin-A MSNs, it is possible that they are the unidentified low-threshold mechanoreceptors for which there is physiological evidence. Electrophysiological experiments (Brunet et al., ibid) suggest that sensorin-A acts as a neurotransmitter centrally. In the periphery sensorin-A immunofluorescence was localized predominantly to varicosities in the MSNs. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that at the ultrastructural level, sensorin-A was localized mainly to dense granules, and dense-core vesicles, a distribution consistent with a <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptide.</b> Sensorin-A's presence peripherally raises the possibility of a parallel with substance-P, a <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptide</b> released at primary afferent terminals of vertebrate nociceptors. The mechanoafferents that innervate the tail are carried from the ganglia to the tail region in nerve p 9. To determine if the tail MSNs have the ability to regenerate, bilateral crushes of nerve p 9 were performed. Regeneration was monitored morphologically using immunostaining for sensorin-A, and behaviourally by examining the tail withdrawal reflex. Functional recovery, indicated by a return of the tail withdrawal reflex, was observed between 10 and 15 days, and growth of sensory fibers (as observed by sensorin-A immunostaining) down p 9 paralleled the time course for behavioural recovery. Recently, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis has emerged as a model system for studying rhythm generation. Nothing is however known about the mechanosensory inputs that affect behaviours such us respiration, locomotion and feeding. Sensorin-A immunostaining on the Lymnaea CNS, and in situ hybridization with a probe to the sensorin-A gene of Aplysia, revealed putative mechanosensory neurons. These putative sensory cells did not colocalize with previously identified motor neurons, interneurons or neurosecretory cells. As would be expected for a mechanoafferent, sensorin-A positive fibers were found in nerve tracts innervating the body wall...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConantokin-R (con-R) is a γ-carboxyglutamate-containing 27 -residue <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptide</b> {{present in}} the venom of Conus radiatus, and acts as a non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. This peptide features a single disulfide bond, a type of structural element found in most classes of conotoxins, but not in other conantokins. The NMDA receptor antagonist activity of chemically synthesized con-R was determined through an assay involving inhibition of the spermine-enhanced binding of the NMDA receptor channel blocker, [3 H]MK- 801, to rat brain membranes, and yielded an IC 50 of 93 nM. This value represents a 2 – 5 times better potency than con-G or con-T, the other two characterized conantokins. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis of the metal-free form of con-R is indicative of a low α-helical content. There {{is an increase in}} α-helicity upon the addition of divalent cations, such as Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, or Zn 2 +. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed one detectable Mg 2 + binding site with a Kd of 6. 5 μM, and two binding sites for Zn 2 +, with Kd values of 150 nM and 170 μM. Residue-specific information of the conformational state of con-R was obtained by two-dimensional 1 H-NMR. Analyses of the α-proton chemical shifts, NOE patterns, and hydrogen exchange rates of the peptide indicated an α-helical conformation for residues 1 – 19. Synthetic con-R-derived peptide variants, containing deletions of 7 and 10 amino acid residues from the carboxy-terminus of the wild-type peptide, displayed unaltered cation binding and NMDA receptor antagonist properties. The α-helical secondary structures of the two truncation peptides were more stable than full-length con-R, as evidenced by CD measurements and reduced backbone hydrogen exchange rates. These results provide experimental evidence that the structural elements common to the three conantokins thus far identified are the primary determinants for receptor function and cation binding/secondary structure stability...|$|E

Kisspeptins are also involved in the sexual dimorphism of the brain. Kisspeptin signaling defects are implicated in reproductive disorders like idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, precocious puberty and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Kisspeptins were originally discovered as metastasis suppressors in melanoma cell lines and have also been found to down regulate metastasis in breast and ovarian cancers.

In this study, we developed a simple and cost-effective method to express and purify kisspeptins in large quantities. We designed the kisspeptin constructs in-silico and expressed them in an Escherichia coli bacterial system. The purification was then optimized using standard chromatographic techniques. In anticipation of future demands, we successfully scaled the expression and purification of the kisspeptins using larger bioreactors and chromatography systems. We tested the biological activity of the kisspeptin we produced on mammalian cell lines expressing the kisspeptin receptor and compared its actions to the kisspeptins synthesized by chemical means. We found that kisspeptins activated two proteins involved in the cell proliferation underlying metastasis. Thus, we were able to show that the much lower cost kisspeptins synthesized by Escherichia coli act similarly to proteins manufactured by chemical synthesis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The structure, assembly, and {{function}} of the bacterial flagellum involves about 60 different proteins, {{many of which are}} selectively secreted via a specific type III secretion system (T 3 SS) (J. Frye et al., J. Bacteriol. 188 : 2233 – 2243, 2006). The T 3 SS is reported to secrete proteins at rates of up to 10, 000 amino acid residues per second. In this work, we showed that the flagellar T 3 SS of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium could be manipulated to export recombinant nonflagellar proteins through the flagellum and into the surrounding medium. We translationally fused various <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides</b> and proteins from snails, spiders, snakes, sea anemone, and bacteria to the flagellar secretion substrate FlgM. We found that all tested peptides of various sizes were secreted via the bacterial flagellar T 3 SS.

Lesions of the LC decreased the number of nerve cell profiles in the frontal cortex 8 weeks after lesioning and were without effect on nerve cell profiles in the frontal cortex 4 weeks after lesioning and in the hippocampus at both 4 and 8 weeks after LC lesioning. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocytes were not affected by lesions of LC. Silver-gold impregnated fibres were decreased in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus of LC-lesioned rats at 8 weeks after lesioning. TH immunoreactivity, which was localized in nerve fibre-like structures both in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus was decreased in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus from the 4 th week after LC lesioning.

40|$|Substance P (sP), a <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptide,</b> has {{now been}} implicated {{in a wide range}} of behaviors. One in {{particular}} is female rat sexual behavior. Recently, it has been shown that bilateral injections of sP into the dorsal midbrain central gray (dMCG) of estrogen-primed female rats facilitate sexual behavior (lordosis). Uncertainty remains, however, concerning the mode of action of synaptically released sP. Indeed, most of our understanding of sP activity has revealed that its full structural sequence is not needed for biological activity. This has led to speculation that sP may be processed into one or more types of fragments before it can exert its behavioral effect. In view of these unusual properties, we must first develop a thorough understanding of the effects of sP fragments before we can fully appreciate the significance of this peptide on the expression of female sexual behavior. In a series of behavioral experiments, we assessed the effects of injecting two different fragments (sP 1 - 7 and sP 5 - 11) into the dMCG of ovariectomized, steroid primed, female rats. In the first experiment, sexual receptivity was measured following injection of sP(1 - 7), (5 - 11) or acidified saline directly into the dMCG of maximally receptive (estrogen and progesterone primed) females. At five and thirty minutes post injection, an assessment revealed that neither sP(5 - 11) nor (1 - 7) had an effect on sexual behavior when compared to saline injections (controls). 1 n the second experiment, speS-II) or acidified saline were injected into the dMCG of estrogen primed female rats showing a minimal lordosis response, and the effects of speS-II) injections were compared to those of controls (saline). Again, no significant difference in sexual behavior was observed following injection of speS-II) or saline. In conclusion, our data suggest that the effect of sP on lordosis behavior following injection into the dMCG is not due to the activity of biologically active fragments...|$|E
40|$|The heptapeptide SP 1 - 7, a {{metabolite}} of the <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptide</b> substance P (SP), {{is suggested}} {{to play a}} role in opioid addiction and memory function. These two dimensions are known to involve dopamine and glutamate transmissions mediated through dopamine receptors and N-methyl-D- aspartate (NNMA) receptors, respectively. Research on interactions between SP 1 - 7 and these two neurotransmitter systems may therefore be of importance to increase our understanding of the mechanisms behind opioid tolerance and dependence as well as memory processes. New knowledge in this area may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic routes for treatment of opioid addiction and other neuropsychiatric disorders, as well. Studies described in this thesis include investigation of adaptive changes during morphine tolerance and withdrawal in brain levels of SP 1 - 7 and in the activity of substance P endopeptidase (SPE), an enzyme responsible for the generation of this fragment. In morphine tolerant and abstinent rats, the SP 1 - 7 level and SPE activity were significantly increased in discrete areas of the brain, which are crucial for the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. Furthermore, significant correlations between the SPE activity and some morphine withdrawal signs were observed. This finding was indicative of an endogenous modulatory mechanism involving both the enzyme and its active peptide product. The effects of SP 1 - 7 on the expression of morphine withdrawal and its interaction with dopaminergic pathways were examined in this thesis by behavioural tests, microdialysis as well as Northern blot and autoradiography techniques. Pre-treatment of morphine dependent rats with SP 1 - 7 was found to stimulate dopamine release in nucleus accumbens and to inhibit the intensity of withdrawal behaviours. It was further shown to regulate both the dopamine D 2 receptor gene transcript and the density of dopamine receptor proteins in mesolimbic dopamine pathways, confirming an interaction between SP 1 - 7 and the dopamine system. The influence of SP 1 - 7 on glutamate transmission was investigated in morphine naive rats. The expression of the gene transcripts of the NMDA receptor subunits NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B was regulated in several brain regions involved in opioid withdrawal reactions and memory functions. The result is consistent with a possible decrease glutamate transmission in these areas. It was concluded that SP 1 - 7 may function as an endogenous modulator of the expression of opioid withdrawal by influencing both dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission...|$|E

A common goal of these approaches is to achieve an adequate decrease in the plasma glucose level combined with ketogenesis, in order to mimic the metabolic state of fasting. Although several metabolic hypotheses have been advanced to explain the anticonvulsant effect of KDs, including changes in the plasma levels of ketone bodies, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and brain pH, direct modulation of neurotransmitter release, especially purinergic (i. e., adenosine) and γ-aminobutyric acidergic neurotransmission, was also postulated. Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are potent modulators of synaptic activity, and their levels are regulated by metabolic states. This {{is the case for}} <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides</b> such as neuropeptide Y, galanin, cholecystokinin and peptide hormones such as leptin, adiponectin, and growth hormone-releasing peptides (GHRPs). In particular, the GHRP ghrelin and its related peptide des-acyl ghrelin are well-known controllers of energy homeostasis, food intake, and lipid metabolism. Notably, ghrelin has also been shown to regulate the neuronal excitability and epileptic activation of neuronal networks. Several lines of evidence suggest that GHRPs are upregulated in response to starvation and, particularly, in patients affected by anorexia and cachexia, all conditions in which also ketone bodies are upregulated. Moreover, starvation and anorexia nervosa are accompanied by changes in other peptide hormones such as adiponectin, which has received less attention. Adipocytokines such as adiponectin have also been involved in modulating epileptic activity.

These studies suggest that streptozotocin does not induce neurotoxicity in mice and that NEP plays a role in regulating nerve function in insulin-deficient diabetes and diet-induced obesity...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} stability and permeability of peptides can be greatly improved by conjugation with lipoamino acids such as 2 -aminododecanoic acid (C 12 Laa). However, the increase in lipophilicity which this conjugation provides can also cause {{a significant decrease in}} the compound 2 ̆ 7 s water solubility. In this study, we coupled C 12 Laa to the N-terminus of endomorphin 1 (Endo- 1, Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-NH 2), and addressed its solubility issue by formulating C 12 Laa-Endo- 1 into phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The aqueous solubility of the lipidic analogue was greatly improved, facilitating the accurate analysis of the compound in in vitro assays. The metabolic stability and in vitro endothelial permeability of the C 12 Laa-Endo- 1 liposomal formulation was assessed using Caco- 2 cells, and compared with the formulation of the parent peptide Endo- 1. The liposome-encapsulated C 12 Laa-Endo exhibited significant increases in both stability and permeability. These results suggest that the combination of chemical modification and liposome formulation has great potentials in improving the bioavailability of <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides...</b>|$|R
40|$|Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), {{a member}} of the prolyl endopeptidase family, is known {{to play a role in}} several {{neurological}} disorders. Its primary function is to cleave a wide range of small oligopeptides, including <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides.</b> We have used force biased molecular dynamics simulation to study the binding mechanism of POP. We examined three possible binding pathways using Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) and Umbrella Sampling (US) on a crystal structure of porcine POP with bound Z-pro-prolinal (ZPP). Using SMD, an exit pathway between the first and seventh blade of the ß-propeller domain of POP was found to be a nonviable route. US on binding pathways through the ß-propeller tunnel and the TYR 190 -GLN 208 flexible loop at the interface between both POP domains allowed us to isolate the flexible loop pathway as the most probable. Further analysis of that pathway suggests a long-range covariation of the interdomain H-bond network, which indicates the possibility of large-scale domain reorientation observed in bacterial homologues and hypothesized to also occur in human POP...|$|R
40|$|The structure, assembly, and {{function}} of the bacterial flagellum involves about 60 different proteins, {{many of which are}} selectively secreted via a specific type III secretion system (T 3 SS) (J. Frye et al., J. Bacteriol. 188 : 2233 – 2243, 2006). The T 3 SS is reported to secrete proteins at rates of up to 10, 000  amino acid residues per second. In this work, we showed that the flagellar T 3 SS of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium could be manipulated to export recombinant nonflagellar proteins through the flagellum and into the surrounding medium. We translationally fused various <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides</b> and proteins from snails, spiders, snakes, sea anemone, and bacteria to the flagellar secretion substrate FlgM. We found that all tested peptides of various sizes were secreted via the bacterial flagellar T 3 SS. We subsequently purified the recombinant μ-conotoxin SIIIA (rSIIIA) from Conus striatus by affinity chromatography and confirmed that T 3 SS-derived rSIIIA inhibited mammalian voltage-gated sodium channel NaV 1. 2 comparably to chemically synthesized SIIIA...|$|R
40|$|Ion-Exchange Chromatography (IEC) {{allows for}} the {{separation}} of ionizable molecules {{on the basis of}} differences in charge properties. Its large sample-handling capacity, broad applicability (particularly to proteins and enzymes), moderate cost, powerful resolving ability, and ease of scale-up and automation have led to it becoming one of the most versatile and widely used of all liquid chromatography (LC) techniques. In this chapter, we review the basic principles of IEC, as well as the broader criteria for selecting IEC conditions. By way of further illustration, we outline protocols necessary to partially purify a serine peptidase from bovine whole brain cytosolic fraction, covering crude tissue extract preparation through to partial purification of the target enzyme using anion-exchange chromatography. Protocols for assaying total protein and enzyme activity in both pre- and post-IEC fractions are also described. The target serine peptidase, prolyl oligopeptidase (POP, EC 3. 4. 21. 26), is an 80 kDa enzyme with endopeptidase activity towards peptide substrates of ≤ 30 amino acids. POP is a ubiquitous post-proline cleaving enzyme with particularly high expression levels in the mammalian brain, where it participates in the metabolism of <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides</b> and peptide-like hormones (e. g. thyroliberin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone) ...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} effects of <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides,</b> vasopressin, vasopressin fragment, and its analog, NC- 1900, on cognitive functions and CCh-induced amnesia. Vasopressin (AVB-s) and its fragments are synthesized {{in the central}} nervous, and {{it is well known}} to regulate diuretic action. However, vasopressin receptors are distributed not only in the supraoptic nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus but also throughout the central nervous system. This fact shows that an action ofAVB-> is not restricted to the anti- diuretic action, and it is suggested thatAVFVp and its metabolites regulate cognitive function such as learning and memory. In order to determine the mechanism of action of a new AVPw analog, NC- 1 900, on memory process, we investigated the facilitative effect ofNC- 1900 on memory performance in eight-arm radial maze and in passive avoidance (PA) tasks in nonamnesic and amnesic mice. The improved effect ofNC- 1900 on the CO-induced amnesia was caused by VIA receptor but not V 2, and the effect of NC- 1900 on memory retention test performance appeared to be due to activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway via VIA receptors...|$|R
40|$|Vasopressins and oxytocins are homologous, {{ubiquitous}} and multifunctional peptides {{present in}} animals. Conopressins are vasopressin/oxytocin-related peptides {{that have been}} found in the venom of cone snails, a genus of marine predatory molluscs that envenom their prey with a complex mixture of <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides.</b> In the present paper, we report the purification and characterization of a unique conopressin isolated from the venom of Conus villepinii, a vermivorous cone snail species from the western Atlantic Ocean. This novel peptide, designated γ-conopressin-vil, has the sequence CLIQDCPγG* (γ is γ-carboxyglutamate and * is C-terminal amidation). The unique feature of this vasopressin/oxytocin-like peptide is that the eighth residue is γ-carboxyglutamate instead of a neutral or basic residue; therefore it could not be directly classified into either the vasopressin or the oxytocin peptide families. Nano-NMR spectroscopy of the peptide isolated directly from the cone snails revealed that the native γ-conopressin-vil undergoes structural changes in the presence of calcium. This suggests that the peptide binds calcium, and the calcium-binding process is mediated by the γ-carboxyglutamate residue. However, the negatively charged residues in the sequence of γ-conopressin-vil may mediate calcium binding by a novel mechanism not observed in other peptides of this family...|$|R
40|$|Background: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a complex, inflammatory and {{neurodegenerative disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} leading to long-term disability. Recent studies indicate a close association between inflammation and neurodegeneration in all lesions and disease stages of MS. Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) is a proline-specific serine protease that cleaves several <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides.</b> This peptidase has been implicated in neurodegeneration, {{as well as in the}} modulation of the inflammatory response. Methods: We examined plasma POP and the levels of an endogenous POP inhibitor from relapsing remitting MS patients and compared these with healthy controls, by monitoring the fluorescent changes due to standard fluorescently labelled substrate cleavage. We analysed the data in relationship to patient age and disease disability status. Results: We observed a significant decrease in POP activity in plasma of relapsing remitting MS patients relative to healthy controls, coupled with an increase of POP endogenous inhibitor. The POP activity was also correlated with patient age and disability status. The lowered POP activity from plasma of MS patients could be rescued by reductants Conclusions: The decrease in circulating POP activity measured in MS is reverted by reductants. This suggests that POP inactivation in MS might be a result of the oxidative conditions prevailing in the plasma of the diseased patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{microbore}} electrospray (ESI) {{injection system}} has been adapted to our 9. 4 -tesla ESI FT-ICR mass spectrometer, greatly enhancing the stability and sensitivity of the system. Spray was generated from micro-ESI needles made from sharply tapered, polished fused silica capillaries of 25 to 50 μm inner diameter. Micro-ESI permits low-level sample analysis by constant infusion at sub-μL/min flow rate {{over a wide range}} of solvent conditions in both positive- and negative-ion mode. The system is flexible and allows rapid conversion to allow routine LC/MS analysis on low-level mixtures presented in biological media. LC/MS analyses were accomplished by replacing micro-ESI needles with capillaries packed with reverse phase retention media to permit analyte concentration and purification prior to analysis (micro-ESI/LC). A unique nano-flow LC pumping system was developed, capable of producing a true unsplit solvent gradient at flow rates below 1 μL/min. The micro-ESI/LC FT-ICR system produces mass spectra from a mixture of three <b>neuroactive</b> <b>peptides</b> at a concentration of 500 amol/μL (5 fmol each total loaded) in biological salts with baseline separation, signal-to-noise ratio of > 10 : 1 and mass resolving power > 5000. These results represent a reduction in detection limit by a factor of ∼ 2 × 106 over the best previously published LC/FT-ICR MS data...|$|R
