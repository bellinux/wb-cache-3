5|$|On 14 August, Deputy Superintendent of Police Steve Brown {{announced}} that fourteen statements had been collected {{and that the}} investigation was progressing. In October 2013, {{a group of men}} set fire to the place in which Jones had lived as a squatter, forcing its four occupants to flee, in what was also believed to be an anti-LGBT hate crime. Everald Morgan, an officer at the St James Public Health Department, requested that police provide protection for the four youths made homeless by the arson attack, but they declined to do so. Meanwhile, a charity named Dwayne's House was set up in Jones' memory to aid homeless LGBT youth in Jamaica. As of May 2014, however, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested or charged, and in August 2015 the crime was still considered unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by a friend, {{she went}} to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Morès. Although deMorès was {{reportedly}} murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt {{was familiar with the}} area where deMorès died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMorès' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMorès widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seen in the parquet or parquet circle. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in there since District Chief Farley's departure {{more than three}} hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with her back against the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E
25|$|Lower courts {{decided that}} because the Commonwealth's Attorney doesn't prosecute {{fornication}} cases and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> prosecuted for fornication anywhere in Virginia in over 100 years, Martin had no risk of prosecution and thus lacked standing to challenge the statute. Martin appealed. Since Martin had something to lose - the ability to sue Ziherl for damages - if the statute is upheld, she had standing to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} statute even though the possibility of her being prosecuted for violating it was zero. Since the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence has found that there is a privacy right in one's private, noncommercial sexual practices, the Virginia Supreme Court decided that the statute against fornication was unconstitutional. The finding gave Martin standing to sue Ziherl since the decision in Zysk was no longer applicable.|$|E
25|$|Until 1958, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to {{successfully}} establish a revolving credit financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by {{a large number of}} merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in Fresno, California, which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card. It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand Visa. In 1966, the ancestor of MasterCard was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when Citibank merged its own Everything Card, launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.|$|E

500|$|Footage of real sharks {{was shot}} by Ron and Valerie Taylor in the waters off Dangerous Reef in South Australia, with a short actor in a {{miniature}} shark cage {{to create the illusion}} that the sharks were enormous. [...] During the Taylors' shoot, a great white attacked the boat and cage. The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the cage at the time, however, and the script, following the novel, originally had the shark killing Hooper in it. The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage, which allowed the footage to be used. As production executive Bill Gilmore put it, [...] "The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss's character." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1996, Warren {{served as}} the island's only police officer. However, since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested on the island since the 1950s, her duties {{involved}} issuing driving licenses and stamping visitors' passports. Warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer, and was given the job because everyone on the island had a [...] "job". [...] The island's jail was described as [...] "the size of a garden shed and riddled with termites," [...] and its cells {{had been used to}} store building materials and lifejackets. When the island came into the international spotlight due to a sexual abuse scandal, a law enforcement professional sent to the island criticized their practices, stating [...] "It was glaringly obvious...that their standard of policing was not really adequate." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1945, McGovern used R time to {{see every}} sight that he could in Rome, and to {{participate}} in an audience with the Pope. Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor. In February, McGovern was promoted to First Lieutenant. On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb inadvertently released above the structure and destroyed it, an event which haunted McGovern. (Four decades later, after a McGovern public appearance in that country, the owner of the farm approached the media to let the Senator know that he was the victim of that incident but that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hurt and the farmer felt that it had been worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of Nazi Germany in some small way. McGovern was greatly relieved.) On returning to base from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier. April 25 saw McGovern's 35thmission, which marked fulfillment of the Fifteenth Air Force's requirement for a combat tour, against heavily defended Linz. The sky turned black and red with flak – McGovern later said [...] "Hell can't be any worse than that" [...] – and the Dakota Queen was hit multiple times, resulting in 110holes in its fuselage and wings and an inoperative hydraulic system. McGovern's waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with battle fatigue, but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.|$|E

2500|$|Learning of {{the unrest}} over the robbery, Smith {{took to the}} streets, {{mingling}} with the residents and merchants, and claiming that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> robbed. Smith argued that Stewart had lost his gold in a square game. Between 2 and 6 PM, “at least a dozen men went to Soapy Smith {{and tried to get}} him to disavow the robbery and give up the men.” Smith, however, maintained his position and “declined to do anything about the matter,” finally stating in exasperation “that if Stewart had not ‘hollered,’ he [...] would feel like going out and getting him a piece of the money” back. In contrast with the Alaskan, Smith told several businessmen he would make amends.|$|E
2500|$|Gershwin made {{a number}} of solo piano {{recordings}} of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his Three Preludes for piano. In 1929, Gershwin [...] "supervised" [...] the world premiere recording of An American in Paris with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hired to play the brief celeste solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section.|$|E

Starkad engaged with Ubbi and a fight began that was long and the most fierce of the entire battle. Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> closer to kill him before. The two champions were separated by the pushing throng of warriors, and Ubbi finally fell riddled with arrows from the archers of Telemark.|$|E
