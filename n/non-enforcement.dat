25|$|In Western Europe, liberal {{parties have}} often cooperated with socialist and social {{democratic}} parties, {{as evidenced by}} the Purple Coalition in the Netherlands during the late 1990s and into the 21st century. The Purple Coalition, one of the most consequential in Dutch history, brought together the progressive left-liberal D66, the economic liberal and centre-right VVD, and the social democratic Labour Party – an unusual combination that ultimately legalised same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and prostitution while also instituting a <b>non-enforcement</b> policy on marijuana.|$|E
25|$|Various {{animal species}} have become extinct due to {{unchecked}} hunting under Ottoman rule {{and to a}} lesser extent under British Mandate rule, due to a <b>non-enforcement</b> of hunting laws. By the beginning of the 20th century, the white oryx, the Syrian brown bear, the Asiatic lions, the Asiatic cheetah, and the Nile crocodile became extinct in the region. Modern hunting laws prohibit all hunting of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, except those considered pests and specific animals in hunting seasons. However the packs of feral dogs that are taking over the countryside are an increasing threat to wildlife and domesticated animals.|$|E
25|$|One {{controversial}} issue which has dominated Maastricht politics {{for many years}} and which has also affected national and international politics, is the city's approach to soft drugs. Under the pragmatic Dutch soft drug policy, a policy of <b>non-enforcement,</b> individuals may buy and use cannabis from 'coffeeshops' (cannabis bars) under certain conditions. Maastricht, like many other border towns, has seen a growing influx of 'drug tourists', mainly young people from Belgium, France and Germany, who provide a large amount of revenue for the coffeeshops (around 13) in the city centre. The city government, most notably ex-mayor Leers, have been actively promoting drug policy reform {{in order to deal with}} its negative side effects.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of gedoogbeleid {{argue that}} such a policy {{practices}} more consistency in legal protection than without it. Opponents of the Dutch drug policy either call for full legalization, or argue that laws should penalize morally wrong or deviant behavior, whether enforceable or not. In the Dutch courts, however, {{it has long been}} determined that the institutionalized <b>non-enforcement</b> of statutes with well defined limits constitutes de facto decriminalization. The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties. A November 2008 poll showed that a 60% majority of the Dutch population support the legalisation of soft drugs. The same poll showed that 85% supported closing of all cannabis coffeeshops within 250 meters walking distance from schools.|$|E

50|$|The {{drug policy}} of the Netherlands is marked by its {{distinguishing}} between so called soft and hard drugs. An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug, is legal and a soft drug can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, {{and as a result}} the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.Cannabis remains a controlled substance in the Netherlands and both possession and production for personal use are still misdemeanors, punishable by fines.

5000|$|In law, desuetude ( [...] or {{from the}} désuétude, from the desuetudo outdated, no longer custom) is a {{doctrine}} that causes statutes, similar legislation or legal principles to lapse and become unenforceable by a long habit of <b>non-enforcement</b> or lapse of time.
