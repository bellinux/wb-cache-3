CA-01 is a large structural module that forms the internal structures of some compartments within the Containment Vessel, including the Steam Generator compartments, Reactor Vessel cavity, and Refueling Canal. The CA-01 Module is the heaviest module on site, weighing 1,200 tons, or 2.4 million pounds.

40|$|Nuclear islands, {{which are}} {{integrated}} power production sites, could effectively sequester and safeguard the US stockpile of plutonium. A <b>nuclear</b> <b>island,</b> an {{evolution of the}} integral fast reactor, utilizes all the Transuranics (Pu plus minor actinides) produced in power production, and it eliminates all spent fuel shipments {{to and from the}} site. This latter attribute requires that fuel reprocessing occur on each site and that fast reactors be built on-site to utilize the TRU. All commercial spent fuel shipments could be eliminated by converting all LWR nuclear power sites to nuclear islands. Existing LWR sites have the added advantage of already possessing a license to produce nuclear power. Each could contribute to an increase in the nuclear power production by adding one or more fast reactors. Both the TRU and the depleted uranium obtained in reprocessing would be used on-site for fast fuel manufacture. Only fission products would be shipped to a repository for storage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{displacements}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>island</b> buildings {{occur because}} of earthquake, thermal expansion, creep shrinkage etc. Because there are penetrations and some supports that {{connect to the}} wall of reactor building, the displacement loads must be considered when the piping and the supports are verified, the displacement loads have great effect on the piping and supports stress analysis. Studying the effect and looking for that how to reduce this effect are helpful {{to find a way to}} reduce the piping stress and the loads on the supports, and it is also helpful to make the plant safe. In this paper some piping calculation units of EPR project are showed as examples, the calculation units are done with a new software ANASYS PIPE, and finite element method is used. there are penetrations and supports that connects {{to the wall of}} reactor building in the calculation units, the building displacements due to earthquake, thermal expansion and creep shrinkage are considered, and the effect of displacement loads and the combinations of all kinds of loads under different category conditions on the piping and supports are studied, the result shows that the stress of piping and the loads on the supports caused by building displacement loads are prominent, but the piping and the supports can meet the requirement by optimizing the support concept.
