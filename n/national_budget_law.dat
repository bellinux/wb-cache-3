Particular atención merece la evolución de la asignación tributaria fijada en la Ley de Presupuestos Generales del Estado desde 1988. Este sistema de asignación tributaria ha sido sustituido en el año 2007 por uno nuevo que no dependerá cada año de la dotación presupuestaria del Estado sino exclusivamente de la voluntad de los ciudadanos al presentar la declaración del Impuesto sobre la Renta de las personas Físicas (en un porcentaje del 0, 7 %). En el artículo se estudia también el mecanismo de distribución de los fondos obtenidos con la asignación tributaria mediante el Fondo Común Interdiocesano.

Three failures are most evident: first, spending is heavily tilted towards {{the support of a}} declining sector, agriculture; second, {{it is almost impossible to}} reallocate spending across time and across policies; and third, its size is unrelated with the goals of the Union.

40|$|Revenue {{authorities}} (RAs) {{have been}} adopted by some countries as an alternative delivery model for improved revenue administration. They are sometimes seen as a possible solution to problems such as low rates of tax compliance, ineffective tax administration staff, and corruption. The paper discusses RAs as a governance model, {{from the perspective of}} revenue administration and the almost universal desire to improve performance and compliance with the law. It compiles and analyses features of the model, examines reasons why revenue authorities were established, and explores the extent to which countries have evaluated the success of the model. It also assesses countries'' own perceptions about how this model may have contributed to tax administration reform. Further, the paper discusses data collection difficulties in carrying out an assessment using econometric analysis, and the problem of attributing changes in performance to a particular governance model. The paper concludes that while there are subjective perceptions among countries with revenue authorities that their model has led to improved revenue administration and has spurred modernization, there is no objective analysis that countries with RAs have performed better in this regard than countries without RAs.

A {{limit on the}} deficit, such as the deficit ceiling in Bulgaria''s organic <b>budget</b> <b>law,</b> serves to protect solvency. The recent crisis clearly indicated that the key challenges are not only to contain the deficit but also to avoid a procyclical stance during upswings and to build a buffer for rainy days. Ideally, fiscal policymaking is guided by a fiscal rule that adapts through the economic cycle. This paper lays out the objectives of fiscal rules and analyzes how these objectives can be met in Bulgaria through either a growth-adjusted balance rule or an expenditure rule complemented by a deficit ceiling.
