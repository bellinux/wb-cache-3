25|$|The {{topology}} of a β-sheet {{describes the}} order of hydrogen-bonded β-strands along the backbone. For example, the flavodoxin fold has a five-stranded, parallel β-sheet with topology 21345; thus, the edge strands are β-strand 2 and β-strand 5 along the backbone. Spelled out explicitly, β-strand 2 is H-bonded to β-strand 1, which is H-bonded to β-strand 3, which is H-bonded to β-strand 4, which is H-bonded to β-strand 5, the other edge strand. In the same system, the Greek key motif described above has a 4123 topology. The secondary structure of a β-sheet can be described roughly by giving the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>strands,</b> their topology, and whether their hydrogen bonds are parallel or antiparallel.|$|E

25|$|In a {{parallel}} arrangement, {{all of the}} N-termini of successive strands are oriented in the same direction; this orientation may be slightly less stable because it introduces nonplanarity in the inter-strand hydrogen bonding pattern. The dihedral angles (φ,ψ) are about (–120°,115°) in parallel sheets. It is rare to find less than five interacting parallel strands in a motif, suggesting that a smaller <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> may be unstable, however it is also fundamentally more difficult for parallel β-sheets to form because strands with N and C termini aligned necessarily must be very distant in sequence. There is also evidence that parallel β-sheet may be more stable since small amyloidogenic sequences appear to generally aggregate into β-sheet fibrils composed of primarily parallel β-sheet strands, where one would expect anti-parallel fibrils if anti-parallel were more stable.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} ways to generalize this notion to an {{infinite}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>strands.</b> [...] The simplest way is to take the direct limit of braid groups, where the attaching maps [...] send the [...] generators of [...] to the first [...] generators of [...] (i.e., by attaching a trivial strand). Fabel has shown that there are two topologies that can be imposed on the resulting group each of whose completion yields a different group. One is a very tame group and is isomorphic to the mapping class group of the infinitely punctured disk [...] a discrete set of punctures limiting to the boundary of the disk.|$|E
2500|$|Silk strings {{are made}} by {{gathering}} a prescribed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> of silk thread, then twisting them tightly together. The twisted cord of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid composed of a special mixture of natural glue that binds the strands together. The strings is taken out and left to dry, before being cut into the appropriate length. The top thicker strings (i.e. strings one to four) are further wrapped in a thin silk thread, coiled around the core to make it smoother. According to ancient manuals, there are three distinctive gauges of thickness that one can make the strings. The first is taigu [...] which is the standard gauge, the zhongqing [...] is thinner, whilst the jiazhong [...] is thicker. According to the Yugu Zhai Qinpu, zhongqing is the best. The currently used silk string gauge standard was defined by Suzhou silk string maker Pan Guohui (潘國輝).|$|E

2500|$|In his Mishneh Torah, Maimonides {{detailed}} {{the laws of}} the fringes ( [...] , tzitzit) set forth in [...] Maimonides taught that the tassel on the fringes of a garment is called tzitzit, because it resembles the locks of hair on one's head, as [...] says, [...] "And he took me by the locks ( [...] , be-tzitzit) of my head." [...] The Torah does not set a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> for the tassel. They take a strand of wool, called techelet, that is dyed sky-blue and wind it around the tassel. The Torah does not set a fixed number of times that this strand should be wound around the tassel. [...] which states, [...] "And you shall make tassels [...] [...] [...] and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of techelet," [...] contains two commandments: (1) to make a tassel on the fringe of a four-cornered garment, and (2) to wind a strand of techelet around the tassel. The absence of techelet, however, does not prevent one from fulfilling the commandment with white strands, as a person who does not have techelet should make tzitzit from white strands alone. Whether the tzitzit a person wears on a garment are white, techelet, or a combination of the two, it is a single commandment, as [...] states, [...] "And they shall be tzitzit for you." [...] The presence of four tzitzit is necessary for the commandment to be fulfilled.

40|$|Addition of Fe(III) {{increases}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>strand</b> breaks <b>of</b> plasmid DNA {{in aqueous solution}} under gamma-radiolysis at room temperature and at 77 K. Low temperature radiolysis requires ca. 100 times higher radiation dose for the creation <b>of</b> comparable <b>strand</b> breaks due to the suppression of Fenton-type reactions. Room temperature radiolysis produces a relatively large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> multi-single <b>strand</b> breaks (ssb) and, on absorption of 100 Gy, less double-strand breaks (dsb), ca. 4 %, while under cryogenic conditions at a dose of 10 kGy, are produced ca. 10 % dsb for a similar total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>strand</b> breaks. Fe(Ill) in its complex with EDTA exhibits small, but distinct damage to DNA even without irradiation, {{in comparison to the}} strong effect of Fe(II) /EDTA. Under our experimental conditions hydrogen peroxide does not influence the damage in a noticeable way in the presence of Fe(II) and Fe(III), although UV light exhibits a very strong effect on the addition of both Fe(III) and H 2 O 2. In our system, iron forms complexes with EDTA and also is bound by other components. A molar excess of iron in relation to EDTA has no striking effect. The chelators seem to be responsible for creation of a reactive form of iron, able to produce reactive oxygen species in solutions containing dissolved air. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|A multi-year unusual {{mortality}} event (UME) involving primarily common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncates) {{was declared}} {{in the northern}} Gulf of Mexico (GoM) with an initial start date of February 2010 and remains ongoing as of August 2014. To examine potential changing characteristics of the UME over time, we compared the <b>number</b> and demographics <b>of</b> dolphin strandings from January 2010 through June 2013 across the entire GoM as well as against baseline (1990 - 2009) GoM stranding patterns. Years 2010 and 2011 had the highest annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stranded</b> dolphins since Louisiana's record began, and 2011 {{was one of the}} years with the highest strandings for both Mississippi and Alabama. Statewide, annual <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>stranded</b> dolphins were not elevated for GoM coasts of Florida or Texas during the UME period. Demographic, spatial, and temporal clusters identified within this UME included increased strandings in northern coastal Louisiana and Mississippi (March-May 2010); Barataria Bay, Louisiana (August 2010 -December 2011); Mississippi and Alabama (2011, including a high prevalence and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stranded</b> perinates); and multiple GoM states during early 2013. While the causes of the GoM UME have not been determined, the location and magnitude of dolphin strandings during and the year following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including the Barataria Bay cluster from August 2010 to December 2011, overlap in time and space with locations that received heavy and prolonged oiling. There are, however, multiple known causes of previous GoM dolphin UMEs, including brevetoxicosis and dolphin morbillivirus. Additionally, increased dolphin strandings occurred in northern Louisiana and Mississippi before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Identification of spatial, temporal, and demographic clusters within the UME suggest that this mortality event may involve different contributing factors varying by location, time, and bottlenose dolphin populations that will be better discerned by incorporating diagnostic information, including histopathology...|$|R
