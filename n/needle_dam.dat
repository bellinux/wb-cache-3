5000|$|Keno Dam, a non-generating dam {{impounding}} Lake Ewauna, {{built in}} 1967 {{to replace the}} wooden <b>Needle</b> <b>Dam</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The first <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> in the United States was {{completed}} in 1896 on the Big Sandy River, downstream {{from the city of}} Louisa, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|The dam {{is built}} of cyclopean masonry, {{composed}} of sandstone blocks weighing from 2 to 4.5 LT. These were quarried {{at the site}} and bedded in cement mortar. The vertical joints were filled with basalt or sandstone concrete. The upstream face consisted of basalt concrete moulded blocks set in a cement mortar. The downstream face was of basalt concrete, 1.8 m thick in the lower section and 0.9 m thick in the upper section. There were two lines of 122 cm diameter pipes which passed through the dam and discharged water into the Nepean River. The flow is controlled by a Larner Johnson <b>needle</b> valve. The <b>dam</b> wall was given a decorative finish. The upstream parapet was castellated with sandstone blocks while {{the top of the}} downstream wall was corbelled in concrete. In approximately the midsection of the dam stands the valve house. This is finished in quarried sandstone blocks with ashlar coursing. It features a steeply pitched slate-covered pipped roof topped with finials and gables at either side.|$|R
5000|$|Needle sluice: A sluice {{formed by}} a number of thin needles held against a solid frame through water {{pressure}} as in a <b>needle</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Chattaroi Railroad (now {{a part of}} CSX) {{connected}} to Louisa in 1881. The city is also served by US 23. The first <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> constructed in the United States was completed just north of town in 1896.|$|E
50|$|One early <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> {{maintains}} {{the level of}} Lake Lucerne in Lucerne, Switzerland by restricting {{the flow of the}} Reuss, several are still in operation on the Meuse, France and others were built in the United States in the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> is a weir {{designed}} {{to maintain the}} level or flow of a river {{through the use of}} thin [...] "needles" [...] of wood. The needles are leaned against a solid frame and are not intended to be water-tight. Individual needles can be added or removed by hand to constrict the flow of the river, forming a sluice.|$|E
5000|$|A Barrage dam on the Saône {{was built}} in 1840 and {{operated}} for 170 years until April 2011 when a modern dam (with inflatable mechanical shutters) of a <b>Needle</b> <b>dam</b> type took over. It is over 200 metres long and is divided into four sections of 50 metres each {{with a total of}} 1,040 needles to manoeuvre depending on the fluctuating water levels.|$|E
50|$|The <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> was {{replaced}} with a modern segment weir during improvements carried out on Vienna’s defenses against flooding between 1971 and 1975. The new weir featured barriers that could be lowered {{to the bottom of}} the canal. Between 2004 and 2005, the Nussdorf power station was built downstream of the weir and lock without any visible changes to the historical appearance of the area. The power station’s 12 turbines produce around 28 gigawatt hours per year and thus provide electricity for approximately 10,000 households.|$|E
50|$|The {{breadth of}} these various {{sections}} of the lake is very variable, but is usually between one and two miles (3 km). The lake's surface, whose mean height above the sea is 434 metres, is the lowest point of the cantons of Uri, Obwalden and Nidwalden. Originally the lake was susceptible to variations in level and flooding along its shoreline. Between 1859 and 1860, {{the introduction of a}} <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> in the Reuss in the city of Lucerne, just upstream from the Spreuerbrücke, allowed the lake level to be stabilised.|$|E
50|$|The Reuss leaves Lake Lucerne some 20 km to the north-west, at {{the city}} of Lucerne.Notable bridges in Lucerne are the Kapellbrücke, first built 1333, rebuilt 1993 and Spreuerbrücke, built 1408.A <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> just {{upstream}} from the Spreuerbrücke) maintains the water level.It receives the Kleine Emme from Entlebuch at Emmen (432 m).From here, it flows north-east through Buchrain, Root, Gisikon and Honau, and downstream of Honau (402 m) leaves the canton of Lucerne, now forming the border between Aargau and Zug, passing Dietwil (Aargau), Risch-Rotkreuz (Zug), Oberrüti (Aargau) and Sins (Aargau), Hünenberg (Zug) and Mühlau (Aargau). It receives the Lorze from Lake Zug downstream of Maschwanden.|$|E
50|$|The Nussdorf weir {{was built}} between August 1894 and 1899. The walls were {{finished}} in 1897 and the steel construction was mounted by August 1898. The administration {{building and the}} chain magazine followed in 1899. Otto Wagner was employed by the transport commission for the project; the architectural plans for the weir and the Schemerlbrücke, the adjoining buildings and (possibly) the lock are the work of Sigmund Taussig. Because of the site’s highly visible location - at {{the point at which}} the Donaukanal leads away from the Danube towards the centre of Vienna - Otto Wagner considered the weir (technically a <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> but also a bridge weir) as the gate to the city and thus designed it to be particularly impressive. It features imposing columns topped with lions made of bronze. These lions are the work of Rudolf Weyr and were later the model for the logo of Gräf & Stift, an Austrian automobile producer.|$|E
50|$|From the 17th century, {{wood was}} also rafted down the Aller tributaries, {{such as the}} Ise and Örtze to Celle. In Celle, the logs {{collected}} at a <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> in the Aller Land and were stored in a wood yard. Rafts also ran past Celle and down the Weser to Bremen. After the death of George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1705, timber rafting on the Upper Aller to Celle fell into decline. When the royal household moved to Hanover, Celle lost the baroque lustre of a Residenz town. Raft dealers took over the business. On the Lower Aller, timber rafting flourished again {{at the end of}} the 19th century during the Gründerzeit. There was a large demand for wood in Bremen, Bremerhaven and the Weser Marshes, where wood was used for the construction of houses and shipbuilding. In the years around 1895, about 8,000 solid cubic metres of wood were rafted down to the Weser. After the First World War, timber rafting on the Aller dwindled to nothing.|$|E
5000|$|To {{begin with}} 100 men were {{employed}} on the task. They freed logs that had jammed at critical points such as sluices, bends, bridges and ox-bows. Later a smaller workforce was employed. Under good conditions it took 10 days for log rafts to reach Celle, otherwise {{it might take}} up to 3 weeks. There were 10 assembly points on the Ise where the logs were tied together into rafts. The rafts of logs were about 2.5 metres wide by around 20 metres long. The logging crew comprised 2 or 3 raftsmen. Losses occurred {{as a result of}} logs sinking or being stolen en route. In Gifhorn, where the Ise enters the Aller, the logs continued to Celle. In Celle they came to rest at a <b>needle</b> <b>dam</b> and were then hauled ashore. After the death of Duke George William, in 1705, timber rafting on the Ise and Aller went into decline. When the royal household moved to Hanover, Celle lost the baroque lustre of a Residenz town. Raft dealers took over the business. Around 1880, timber rafting on the Ise finally petered out. The cause was the upgrade of tracks and roads and the construction of sawmills {{in the vicinity of the}} forests.|$|E
