Objectives 1) To assess knowledge, attitude & practice about <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> amongst Private Medical Practitioners (PMPs). 2) To find out barriers experienced by PMPs in reporting of diseases under surveillance. 3) To assess feasibility of various alternative ways of reporting convenient for PMPs. 4) To develop a Public Private Partnership Model of disease notification based on feasible options obtained in the study. Materials and Methods This study was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in the F South Municipal ward of Mumbai city during April-May 2011. Two stage simple random sampling was used to select 104 PMPs for the study. Results and Conclusions Nearly 98 % PMPs felt importance of notification in health system, but only 46 % had practiced it. Most common reason for non-reporting was lack of information about reporting system.

To describe the epidemiologic trends of incident leprosy cases detected in Spain among Spanish- and foreign-born population groups. Observational, retrospective study of suspected leprosy cases in Spain, as reported through the System of Compulsory <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Diseases</b> from 2003 to 2013, with results disaggregated by country of birth. We collected statistical data on leprosy burden for other countries from WHO to estimate the expected number of imported cases. Of the 168 leprosy cases registered during the study period, 40 (24. 6 %) were in Spanish patients, while 128 (76. 2 %) were detected in legally resident immigrants. We identified a significantly higher number of imported leprosy cases during the 2008 - 2010 and 2011 - 2013 trienniums compared to the reference biennium 2003 - 2004 (OR 5. 38, 95 % CI 1. 83 - 14. 88 and OR 4. 80, 95 % CI 1. 41 - 16. 33, respectively). Most imported cases were diagnosed in Latin American immigrants (71. 9 %), especially Brazilians, but also Paraguayans, Bolivians and other nationalities from South and Central America. However, registered incidence was lower than expected for each year. For example, in 2003, the expected new cases in immigrants was 47. 12, compared to only four cases that were actually detected (a 91 % difference). Likewise, we expected to find 49. 6 incident cases among immigrants in 2009, but only 15 new cases were reported (60 % fewer than expected). Imported cases of leprosy are responsible for most leprosy incidence in Spain, and we cannot rule out some under-diagnosis. Clinicians should be made more aware of the potential for leprosy incidence among patients from countries where the disease is endemic...|$|E

Neste estudo foi analisado o perfil dos inscritos no Programa de Controle das DST/Aids de uma {{regional}} de saúde do Estado do Paraná, nos anos de 1989 a 2005. Os dados foram coletados do banco de dados regional do Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação – SINANW, no Setor de Epidemiologia da 14 ª Regional de Saúde. As variáveis estudadas foram: sexo, idade, ocupação e município de residência dos pacientes; forma de transmissão da doença, data do diagnóstico e de notificação do caso; e data de óbito. No período foram diagnosticados 241 casos de Aids na região, com concentração de 53 % no município pólo, porém em seis municípios da região não ocorreu notificação nos 17 anos estudados, mas a ausência de casos pode indicar a ausência real de casos ou subnotificação ou exportação de casos. Os casos ocorreram predominantemente em homens, na faixa etária entre 25 e 49 anos, com transmissão pela via sexual; no período de 2001 a 2005, no entanto, observa-se o aumento do número de mulheres infectadas, com razão entre os sexos de 1, 6 homens por mulher, e o incremento da transmissão heterossexual, acometendo indivíduos com ocupação do lar e autônomos. Foi encontrado número expressivo de caso com notificação epidemiológica na data do diagnóstico de doenças decorrentes da Aids ou nos dias subsequentes, sugerindo identificação tardia da doença e indivíduos diagnosticados já na fase terminal da doença.

Over the last 27 {{years of the}} AIDS epidemic, crucial changes {{have taken place in}} the trends of HIV transmission and in the disease’s epidemiological profile. This study analyzed the profiles of people enrolled in the STD/AIDS Control Program of a regional health division in the state of Paraná, Brazil, between 1989 and 2005. Data were collected from the regional database of the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAWN), at the Epidemiology Sector of the 14 th Regional Health Division. The studied variables were: patient gender, age, occupation and city of residence; how the disease was transmitted, date of diagnosis and notification; and date of death. During the study period, 241 AIDS cases were diagnosed in the region, with a 53 % concentration in the county seat; however, in six towns in the region, there were no notifications in the 17 years of the study, which can mean a real absence of cases or sub-notification/exportation of cases. The cases occurred primarily in men, between the ages of 25 and 49, through sexual transmission. However, in the period between 2001 and 2005, an increase was observed in the number of infected women, with a 1. 6 male:female ratio; also, there was an increase in heterosexual transmission, affecting homemakers and self-employed individuals. The study detected an expressive number of cases with epidemiological <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> resulting from AIDS on the date of diagnosis or soon thereafter, suggesting the late identification of the disease on individuals who were already in the terminal stages of the disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{this report}} the {{increase}} in the number <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> suspicions <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by the way the job is performed, observed recently in the Regional Center of Occupational Medicine in Wrocław, is highlighted. The problem stems from the recognition of medical certification <b>of</b> such <b>diseases</b> as occupational diseases only in one third <b>of</b> all <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> suspicions. Material and Methods: The case study was based on statistical data concerning <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> suspected occupational <b>diseases</b> collected in the Branches of the Regional Center of Occupational Medicine in Wrocław in the years 2006 - 2011, as well as on medical certificates issued by the Center's Out-patient Clinics <b>of</b> Occupational <b>Diseases.</b> More than 700 reports of suspected chronic occupational <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> the musculo-skeletal system and chronic <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral nervous system caused by the way the job is performed were analyzed, taking into account gender, age and how the work had been done. On the basis of the analysis of medical certificates issued by physicians, decision-making procedures and the recognition <b>of</b> occupational <b>disease</b> certification are discussed. Results: The analysis of the data collected in the Regional Center of Occupational Medicine, Wroclaw, in the years 2006 - 2011 showed a significant increase in the percentage <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> suspicions <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by the way the job is performed. At the same time it was shown that only about one third of reported suspicions were concluded with issuing medical certification <b>of</b> an occupational <b>disease</b> and the administrative confirmation of the decision. Conclusions: The results of the study revealed significant certification problems in the group <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by the way the job is performed in terms of the recognition of this type of pathology as an occupational disease. These issues are ambiguous because of a large number of non-occupational factors involved in the pathogenesis <b>of</b> these <b>diseases.</b> Med Pr 2013; 64 (3) : 387 – 39...|$|R

The duration of the pediatric rheumatologist's e-mail interactions and telephone interactions with patients was measured using a stopwatch. After 1 year of enrollment in the patient-physician e-mail service, families were mailed a 12 -item satisfaction survey regarding their e-mail experience. RESULTS. A total of 306 of 328 families who were offered patient-physician e-mail access enrolled, and 121 used the service. The patients sent 40 % of their e-mails outside business hours. Messages that were urgent (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> flare, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> new symptoms, or parent expectation of same-day response) made up 5. 7 % of the e-mails sent to the physician. Messages that required emergent attention made up 0. 002 % of the e-mails to the physician. Answering patient questions by e-mail was 57 % faster than using the telephone for the physician. The physician received 1. 2 e-mails per day from patients. The families who responded to the survey agreed that patient-physician e-mail increased access to the physician and improved the quality of care. The families did not find that patient-physician e-mail distanced them from their child's doctor. CONCLUSIONS. Patient-physician e-mail is a service that patients will use given the opportunity. The e-mail service enables physicians to answer medical questions with less time spent compared with telephone messaging. In our experience in an academic pediatric subspecialty practice, patients reported enhanced communication and access with the e-mail service...|$|R
