40|$|Currently, {{the real}} {{economy is the}} {{important}} basis {{for the development of}} a country, especially after the global financial crisis in 2008. Given that the manufacturing industry is the main part of the <b>national</b> <b>real</b> <b>economy,</b> many developed and developing countries have paid considerable attention to its significance. This study focused on cost factors given that they influence national manufacturing development. Initially, this study proposed two elements, namely, manufacturing development scale and manufacturing development level, to evaluate national manufacturing development from two aspects: quantity and quality. Subsequently, we extracted a series of cost factors on the bass of the theoretical framework and literature, including labor costs, financing costs, tax and rental costs, energy and raw materials, foreign trade exports and business environments. On the basis of the data of 13 main manufacturing countries around the world from 2000 to 2015, we tested the influence degree of each cost element index on the scale and level of national manufacturing industry development through a two-way fixed effects model and incorporated it with the development of China’s manufacturing industry as a case study. Finally, we deduced the future development trend of the manufacturing industry by specifically analyzing the cost factors affecting the development of this industry and provided policy suggestions. The main innovation and contribution of this study including: to comprehensively evaluate the national manufacturing development from two aspects, namely, “quantity” and “quality”; to identify the impact of national cost of the six elements; to demonstrate and determine the extent of its impact on the development trend of manufacturing sector and carry out pre-judgment through empirical research on each indicator; to provide policy recommendations targeted for each of the indicators...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the onset}} of the current crisis, {{numerous}} intergovernmental organizations made declarations and plans, but only national packages were implemented to minimize adverse effects to <b>real</b> (<b>national)</b> <b>economies.</b> Despite the fact that capital markets have long ago become increasingly complex with a multitude of actors, a state-level approach remains firmly in place. This paper aims to present political responses to the crisis, identifying how politicians envision the future of capital markets and the world economy. The financial crisis might have been a direct motive to start a global political interplay regarding regulation, {{but it was also a}} unique opportunity for numerous actors to start pressing for their own agenda vis-Ã -vis the global economic and political order.

Instead, these firms held more liquidity in terms of cash and working capital than did the other firms.

The <b>real</b> <b>economy</b> is represented by a Keynesian goods market approach while the setup {{for the stock market}} includes heterogeneous speculators. Using a mixture of analytical and numerical tools we find, for instance, that speculators may create endogenous boom-bust dynamics in the stock market which, by spilling over into the <b>real</b> <b>economy,</b> can cause lasting fluctuations in economic activity. However, fluctuations in economic activity may, by shaping the firms' fundamental values, also {{have an impact on the}} dynamics of the stock market.

40|$|International audienceThis {{article focuses}} on the {{comparison}} of sacrifice ratios as an indicator for structural dispersion within the euro area over the period 1972 - 2003. Estimates of the sacrifice ratio, defined as the cumulative output cost arising from permanent inflation reduction, are obtained using structural VAR models. Results from sub-period analysis as well as ten-year-period rolling estimates lead to two main conclusions. Firstly empirical evidence displays a recent increase in the average sacrifice ratio, which {{can be linked to}} the simultaneous decrease in the average inflation rate: this negative relationship between the initial level of inflation and the cost of disinflation {{can be seen as a}} justification for the choice of an inflation objective close to 2 % for the European Central Bank (ECB) rather than a target of perfect price stability, potentially very damaging. Secondly, we can't provide evidence of any reduction in European sacrifice ratio dispersion, which would suggest that the nominal convergence triggered by the Maastricht Treaty didn't involve a true reduction of structural differences. It is likely to be a problem in the stance of a single monetary policy, since structural differences imply asymmetric responses of <b>real</b> <b>national</b> <b>economies</b> to the same monetary impulse...|$|R

We could also interpret that the excess liquidity in the financial economy firstly affects the capital price. Then, the capital price will take positive effects on the product price. This is opposed to the influence mechanism taken by liquidity on the <b>real</b> <b>economy.</b> We conclude by analyzing the relationship between liquidity in <b>real</b> <b>economy,</b> financial economy, and inflation...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasingly}} intertwined {{banking and}} insurance sectors have lead to calls for stronger regulatory {{oversight of the}} insurance industry as potentially systemically risky. Ultimately systemic risk impacts the <b>real</b> <b>economy,</b> and this paper measures the risk via interconnectedness of the banking, insurance and <b>real</b> <b>economy</b> firms in the US for 500 firms from 2003 - 2011. Systemic risk in the banking sector peaked with the top of the housing cycle in 2006, while in the insurance sector it continued to rise until September 2008. The rescue of AIG and announcement of TARP dramatically decreased this interconnectedness risk. The results clearly demonstrate that whilst banking firms are the most consistently systemically risky in the economy, insurance firms are a readilly identifiable group displaying substantial systemic risk via interconnectedneess with the financial sector and the <b>real</b> <b>economy...</b>|$|R
