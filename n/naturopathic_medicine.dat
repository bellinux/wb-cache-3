40|$|Context: Medical {{providers}} who have personally used {{various forms of}} complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) {{are much more likely}} to use, refer, and wish to refer their patients to such CAM therapies in the future. Objective: This study will investigate the physician assistants in Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties to determine the current level of use, referral, and desire for service of different complementary and alternative medicine therapies in the Portland, Oregon Metropolitan Region. Design: Testing will involve a survey that is sent to all physician assistants in Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties. Seventeen therapies were asked about in the survey including: acupressure, acupuncture, aromatherapy, biofeedback, chiropractic, ethnic healing, herbal medicine, hydrotherapy, hypnotherapy, magnetic field therapy, massage, meditation/guided imagery, <b>naturopathic</b> <b>medicines,</b> nutritional supplements, osteopathy, prayer therapy, and yoga. Data was analyzed based on the amount of physician assistants who indicated for each therapy whether they had used a therapy with a patient; referred a patient for therapy; if they would like to offer the therapy to their patients in the future; if they personally use any of the therapies listed; and if given the opportunity, would they be interested in attending CME courses in alternative medicine.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality among women. A diagnosis of cancer is a stressful event that requires an individual to adapt to new stressors. The purpose of this qualitative study was to better understand the perceptions of mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope and living with breast cancer among Native Hawaiian women. The conceptual framework of this phenomenological study was positive psychology. Data collection included in-depth interviews with 5 Native Hawaiian women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Data coding and analysis resulted in identification of 8 themes. The themes included: (a) mana 2 ̆ 7 olana /hope is the essence of my being, (b) family strengthens me and gave me mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope, (c) my relationship with God and Jesus promoted mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope in me, (d) my religious affiliation promoted mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope in me, (e) the cancer support group promoted mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope in me, (f) the cancer treatment team promoted mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope in me, (g) treatment options; Allopathic, Osteopathic, <b>Naturopathic,</b> Alternative <b>medicine,</b> and herbal remedies promoted mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope in me, and (h) nature 2 ̆ 7 s beauty and the arts promoted mana 2 ̆ 7 olana/hope in me.

40|$|A network {{dealing with}} the topic of anthroposophic {{medicine}} and encompassing general practitioners, specialists and clinics {{has been set up}} on a specially developed web-based internet platform. The EvaMed network was able to record the largest cohorts actually using complementary and integrative medicine in Germany. It consequently succeeded in ascertaining the indications {{of a wide range of}} drugs with no indications (so-called registered drugs), recording the structure of therapy concepts and drawing comparisons with regular treatment regimes. The actual provision of AM in specific age groups such as children, adults, seniors and the very old compared to cohorts treated by conventional medicine was determined by means of special subgroup analyses and compared with average cohorts in Germany. One significant finding of these analyses was that the actual provision of AM corresponds to an integrative medicine model, i. e. conventional and complementary therapies are used to obtain a form of “best practice”. At the same time, conventional drug therapy largely conforms with current guidelines (e. g. as regards infections of the respiratory tract, hypertension etc.) and is usually supplemented by drugs prescribed in specific forms of therapy (anthroposophic, homeopathic and herbal remedies). Establishing a drug vigilance network made it possible to ascertain the safety of a wide range of drug groups in certain forms of therapy, particularly anthroposophic medicine. The number of reports increased markedly after the doctors underwent a special training programme. The effectiveness and sustainability of such training programmes for drug vigilance networks was evaluated. The Oncology Network (ON) keeps records of anthroposophical clinics and practices focusing on oncology which actually provide anthroposophical therapies. Here it was established that the oncological services actually provided make up an integrative model of treatment encompassing standard conventional cancer therapies supplemented with complementary or anthroposophical treatments. The complementary treatment most frequently used in the field of oncology is mistletoe therapy. Preliminary analyses indicated that mistletoe therapy has a positive effect on the patient’s quality of life and survival period. Comparisons of cohorts made it possible to determine drug use and the indications, effectiveness, safety and side-effects of various treatment concepts customarily used in children, adults, seniors and the very old in anthroposophic medicine and to compare them with average cohorts in Germany. The EvaMed project, comprising a network recording the actual provisions of one of the three special forms of therapy. has confirmed the feasibility of such a project in the field of supply research, with the result that this structure is also to be applied to homeopathic and <b>naturopathic</b> or alternative <b>medicine</b> (in the place of phytotherapy) and expanded accordingly. Homeopathy in particular largely uses registered drugs with no special indications, which means that comparable issues should be dealt with. The drug vigilance project should also be extended to encompass homeopathy and phytotherapy. Other perspectives offered by the EvaMed network and its expansion to encompass the two other main form of therapy (homeopathy and phytotherapy) include data mining, by means of which both direct and indirect cohort comparison studies could be performed. In data mining, the autologous data in the cohort is compared with data from other secondary databases (e. g. health insurance company data) by mapping corresponding items and parameters; the EvaMed project already has a few examples of these (e. g. arterial hypertension compared with data from the GEK health insurance company). Other analyses of cohort comparisons, e. g. between the various special forms of therapy and with conventionally treated cohorts, are also being planned. Moreover, the costs of various therapy concepts specific to a certain diagnosis can easily be compared, as the EvaMed network contains all the data sets relevant for invoicing purposes and these can easily be compared with data from the health insurance companies. The electronic network may be used as an IT platform for prospective intervention and cohort comparison studies, thus making it a useful study tool. QuaDoSta has already been developed as a form of study software for this purpose. The EvaMed network’s drug vigilance centre has already been expanded to enable it to act as a form of assessment centre (see sec. 1. 2. 2. 4) and perform patient surveys parallel to the medical evaluations; this service will therefore not have to be organised by the medical practitioners in the network. Moreover, patient surveys performed independently of the attending physician are easy to conduct systematically and are more meaningful, because apart from obtaining the patient’s agreement, the attending physician does not have to render any specific service for such a survey and the patient is less biased or likely to make courtesy appraisals. The Oncology Network (ON) showed that the IT platform is suitable and practicable for use as an epidemiological and clinical oncological register with all items listed by the German Cancer Association (DKG), and can also be used for special modules (e. g. mistletoe therapy) in everyday practice as well as for cancer register reports (GKR). Evaluations of the largest cohorts in the ON revealed an integrative oncological concept in AM with a high proportion of mistletoe therapy carried out parallel to standard therapy. Subgroup analyses facilitate stage-dependent therapy plans and Kaplan-Meier survival rate estimates for various forms of tumour when compared to standard treatment regimens. The IT platform used by ON has already been implemented at the Spandau Tumour Centre in Berlin (today known as the Tumour Centre for Charitable and Denominational Hospitals in Berlin, TZGKB), a joint venture between eight Berlin hospitals, and is used to report cancer cases. The ON is currently being extended to other European countries and South America (Brazil, Argentina and Chile) thanks to its multilingual functions and ease of transmission...|$|R

2500|$|Naturopathy or <b>naturopathic</b> <b>medicine</b> {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as [...] "natural", [...] "non-invasive", and as promoting [...] "self-healing". The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine. Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against modern medical practices, including but not limited to medical testing, drugs, vaccinations, and surgery.
