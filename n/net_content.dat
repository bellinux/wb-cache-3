40|$|During {{anaerobic}} {{growth of}} Rhodopseudornonas spheroides the specific RNA content (pg. RNA/,ug. protein) of cultures was directly propor-tional {{to the light}} intensity {{in which they were}} grown. Cultures sub-jected to a step-up in light intensity preferentially synthesized RNA until their specific RNA content increased to the value characteristic of growth at the higher light intensity. Conversely following a step-down in light intensity the rate of RNA synthesis fell below the rate of protein syn-thesis, and cellular RNA was diluted out to the value characteristic of growth at the lower light intensity. Adjustment of the differential rate of RNA synthesis in response to a change in light intensity was thus opposite to that of the differential rate of photopigment synthesis. Although a decrease in light intensity drastically decreased RNA synthesis some RNA continued to be formed. The RNA synthesized, like that in cultures maintained at a constant light intensity, consisted of soluble and ribo-somal RNA and unstable RNA with sedimentation behaviour like m-RNA.

Although much is known about Prx 2 in healthy RBCs, its role in pathological RBCs remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that the expression and <b>net</b> <b>content</b> of Prx 2 are markedly increased in RBCs from two mouse models of β-thalassemia (β-thal; Hbb th/th and Hbbt h 3 /+ strains). We also demonstrate that the increased expression of Prx 2 correlates with the severity of the disease and that the amount of Prx 2 bound to the membrane is markedly reduced in β-thal mouse RBCs. To explore the impact of oxidative stress on Prx 2 membrane association, we examined Prx 2 dimerization and membrane translocation in murine RBCs exposed to various oxidants (phenylhydrazine, PHZ; diamide; H 2 O 2). PHZ-treated RBCs, which mimic the membrane damage in β-thal RBCs, exhibited a kinetic correlation among Prx 2 membrane displacement, intracellular methemoglobin levels, and hemichrome membrane association, suggesting the possible masking of Prx 2 docking sites by membrane-bound hemichromes, providing a possible mechanism for the accumulation of oxidized/dimerized Prx 2 in the cytoplasm and the increased membrane damage in β-thal RBCs. Thus, reduced access of Prx 2 to the membrane in β-thal RBCs represents a new factor that could contribute to the oxidative damage characterizing the pathology...|$|E
40|$|MOTIVATION: Neutrophil {{extracellular}} traps (NETs) {{are believed}} to be essential in controlling several bacterial pathogens. Quantification of NETs in vitro is an important tool in studies aiming to clarify the biological and chemical factors contributing to NET production, stabilization and degradation. This estimation can be performed on the basis of fluorescent microscopy images using appropriate labelings. In this context, it is desirable to automate the analysis to eliminate both the tedious process of manual annotation and possible operator-specific biases. RESULTS: We propose a framework for the automated determination of <b>NET</b> <b>content,</b> based on visually annotated images which are used to train a supervised machine-learning method. We derive several methods in this framework. The best results are obtained by combining these into a single prediction. The overall Q(2) of the combined method is 93 %. By having two experts label part of the image set, we were able to compare the performance of the algorithms to the human interoperator variability. We find that the two operators exhibited a very high correlation on their overall assessment of the NET coverage area in the images (R(2) is 97 %), although there were consistent differences in labeling at pixel level (Q(2), which unlike R(2) does not correct for additive and multiplicative biases, was only 89 %).

The stability study for the topical herbal gel formulation was done as per ICH guidelines and anti-arthritic activity was evaluated by Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) induced arthritis method. Assessment of body weight, paw volume, hematological and biochemical parameters, histopathological examination and In vitro determination of serum biomarkers were also carried out. Formulated gels were homogenous, stable and complied with the guidelines. Among the formulations, F 4 showed better release (98. 4 %) characteristics than other formulations. No erythema or edema was observed in the skin irritation test confirming the gel was non-toxic and safe. Topical application of the herbal gel F 4 containing carbopol 934 displayed significant (p < 0. 001) anti-arthritic activity compared to diseased rats. Reduction in paw volume, no agglutination in C - reactive protein and rheumatic factor, reduction in TNF level, regaining of normal hematological, and biochemical parameters, reduction in spleen and thymus weight and histopathological examination supported the anti-arthritic activity of the gel formulation...|$|E

Starting from the data of a production process collected from the company, CUSUM and EWMA control charts were used to determine the (average run length (ARL) to detect a condition out-of-control. ARL found by each chart which was then compared. It was observed that the CUSUM control chart practically did not sign point’s out-of-control for the levels of variation between 1. 0 standard deviation. For these variation levels the EWMA control charts was more efficient than CUSUM.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 1861 - 1869 The {{activity}} of anaerobic sulfate reduction was studied using sulfate-reducing bacteria {{isolated from the}} water produced from a Brazilian oil reservoir. The effects of the initial sulfate concentration on the anaerobic sulfate reduction and sulfide generation kinetics were investigated. The redox potential, the biomass solution content, and the sulfate and the sulfide solution content were measured. The {{results indicate that the}} sulfate conversion and the sulfide generation are both first-order processes for the initial sulfate concentration of 823, 1, 282, and 1, 790 mg/L. The results for the kinetic constants for the sulfate conversion indicate an inhibition with the enhancement of the initial sulfate solution content. The kinetic constants for the sulfide generation indicate that this reaction is almost independent of the initial sulfate solution content due to the presence of at least two in-series processes that are faster than the microbial conversion of the sulfate. The kinetic test using the water from an onshore oil field, with an initial sulfide content of 228 mg/L and sulfate content of 947 mg/L, shows a sulfate conversion of 50 % in 528 h.
