2500|$|In winemaking, {{the term}} [...] "wild yeast" [...] has {{multiple}} meanings. In {{its most basic}} context, it refers to yeast {{that has not been}} introduced to the must by intentional inoculation of a cultured strain. Instead, these [...] "wild yeasts" [...] often come into contact with the must through their presence on harvest equipment, transport bins, the surface winemaking equipment and as part of the natural flora of a winery. Very often these are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have taken residence in these places over the years, sometimes being previously introduced by inoculation of prior vintages. In this context, these wild yeasts are often referred to as ambient, indigenous or <b>natural</b> <b>yeast</b> as opposed to inoculated, selected or cultured yeast. Wineries that often solely rely on these [...] "in-house" [...] strains will sometimes market their wines as being the product of wild or natural fermentations. The (c. 304) Nanfang Caomu Zhuang has the earliest description of winemaking using [...] "herb ferment" [...] (cǎoqū 草麴) wild yeast with rice and various herbs, including the poisonous Gelsemium elegans (yěgé 冶葛).|$|E

50|$|Gobelsburg {{winemaking}} emphasizes traditional varietals and terroir expression. Oak casks {{are used}} sparingly and only for top Grüner Velliner and red wines, otherwise large barrels or steel tanks {{are used for}} vinification.

50|$|Fermentation {{is carried}} out at a {{temperature}} of 4 - 16 °C (40 - 60 °F). This is low for most kinds of fermentation but is beneficial for cider as it leads to slower fermentation with less loss of delicate aromas. Fermentation can occur due to <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> that {{are present in the}} must or some cider makers add yeast, such as Saccharomyces bayanus.|$|R
50|$|Palm sap begins fermenting {{immediately}} after collection, due to <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> {{in the air}} (often spurred by residual yeast left in the collecting container). Within two hours, fermentation yields an aromatic wine of up to 4% alcohol content, mildly intoxicating and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.|$|R
50|$|The grapes {{are placed}} in large barrels or vats. They are then closed off and air is {{eliminated}} by pumping in CO2. The <b>natural</b> <b>yeast</b> migrate from {{the skin of the}} grapes into the pulp, looking for water and oxygen, and the fermentation takes place. The fermentation process lasts about 20 days.|$|E
5000|$|On winemaking, he has said, [...] "I {{would not}} say that my style is {{particularly}} evident in the winemaking, although I'm {{a firm believer in}} no filtration or fining, <b>natural</b> <b>yeast,</b> open-top fermenting and other noninvasive techniques.

50|$|Many {{fruit wines}} {{suffer from a}} lack of <b>natural</b> <b>yeast</b> {{nutrients}} needed to promote or maintain fermentation. Winemakers can counter this with the addition of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium available commercially as yeast nutrient. In the opinion of one wine writer fruit wines often do not improve with bottle age and are usually meant to be consumed within a year of bottling.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation starts spontaneously {{under the}} action of the <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> from the grapes. The {{winemaker}} can choose to use a commercially available active dry yeast. It can help to express the characteristics of a variety or a method of manufacture. For a dry white wine fermentation continues until the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually decanted to eliminate the lees. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature often exceeds 20°C or even 25°C.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To isolate yeasts and moulds from {{selected}} {{natural systems}} {{and study the}} effect of tetracycline (Tet) on them so as to generate comprehensive data for further elucidation of transfer or evolutionary development of Tet resistance in general and in these lower eukaryotes in particular. Methods: A total of 139 <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> have been isolated from various ecosystems on potato dextrose agar medium. These along with model <b>yeasts</b> and selected <b>natural</b> and model moulds have been tested for their responses to Tet at various concentrations added to the growth media. The effluxed materials were obtained by vortexing and centrifugation of cells and tested against sensitive bacterium. Results: It was found that Tet efflux was a general feature of <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> and filamentous fungi (moulds) could resist Tet upto a concentration of 5 mg/mL. However, {{at a very high}} concentration (10 mg/mL) neither the yeasts nor the moulds could grow indicating that Tet is toxic for these eukaryotes at very high concentrations. The presence of Tet in the medium exaggerates filamentation in all the hyphal forming yeasts. Conclusions: The results suggest efflux as the general mechanism of Tet-resistance in yeasts and moulds possibly acquired from bacteria via horizontal transfer...|$|R

40|$|The study {{conducted}} by Arkenol was designed to test the conversion of feedstocks such as sugar cane bagasse, sorghum, napier grass and rice straw into fermentable sugars, and then ferment these sugars using <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> and genetically engineered Zymomonis mobilis bacteria (ZM). The study did convert various cellulosic feedstocks into fermentable sugars utilizing the patented Arkenol Concentrated Acid Hydrolysis Process and equipment at the Arkenol Technology Center in Orange, California. The sugars produced using this process were in the concentration range of 12 [...] 15 %, {{much higher than the}} sugar concentrations the genetically engineered ZM bacteria had been developed for. As a result, while the ZM bacteria fermented the produced sugars without initial inhibition, the completion of high sugar concentration fermentations was slower and at lower yield than predicted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). <b>Natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> performed as expected by Arkenol, similar to the results obtained {{over the last four years}} of testing. Overall, at sugar concentrations in the 10 [...] 13 % range, yeast produced 850090 % theoretical ethanol yields and ZM bacteria produced 82 [...] 87 % theoretical yields in 96 hour fermentations. Additional commercialization work revealed the ability to centrifugally separate and recycle the ZM bacteria after fermentation, slight additional benefits from mixed culture ZM bacteria fermentations, and successful utilization of defined media for ZM bacteria fermentation nutrients in lieu of natural media...|$|R

In the UK there are two broad styles: one using dessert (eating) and culinary (cooking) apples (Eastern Counties style) and one using special cider apples used only for cider production (West Country style). In the US, the freestanding term [...] "cider" [...] typically refers to apple cider, unfiltered apple juice, virtually all of which outside of roadside orchards and farmers markets is pasteurized to prevent bacterial contamination, which also kills off the <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> which lead to fermentation; the specific term [...] "hard cider" [...] is used to refer to the fermented alcoholic variety.|$|R

50|$|Yeast is {{normally}} already {{present on the}} grapes, often visible as a powdery appearance of the grapes. The primary, or alcoholic fermentation {{can be done with}} this <b>natural</b> <b>yeast,</b> but since this can give unpredictable results depending on the exact types of yeast that are present, cultured yeast is often added to the must. One of the main problems with the use of wild ferments is the failure for the fermentation to go to completion, that is some sugar remains unfermented. This can make the wine sweet when a dry wine is desired. Frequently wild ferments lead to the production of unpleasant acetic acid (vinegar) production as a by product.|$|E
5000|$|Flour {{naturally}} {{contains a}} variety of yeasts and bacterial spores. When wheat flour comes into contact with water, the naturally occurring enzyme amylase breaks down the starch into the sugars glucose, sucrose, galactose and raffinose, which sourdough's <b>natural</b> <b>yeast</b> can metabolize. Amylase also breaks down starch into maltose, which the yeast cannot metabolize. With sufficient time, temperature, and refreshments with new or fresh dough, the mixture develops a stable culture. This culture will cause a dough to rise if the gluten has been developed sufficiently. [...] The bacteria ferment maltose that the yeast cannot metabolise, and the byproducts are metabolised by the yeast which produces carbon dioxide gas, leavening the dough.|$|E

2500|$|Leaving the hive, {{foraging}} bees collect sugar-rich flower nectar {{and return}} to the hive where they use their [...] "honey stomachs" [...] to ingest and regurgitate the nectar repeatedly until it is partially digested. Bee digestive enzymes – invertase, amylase, and diastase – along with gastric acid hydrolyze sucrose to a mixture of glucose and fructose. The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion for as long as 20 minutes until the product reaches storage quality. It is then placed in honeycomb cells left unsealed while still high in water content (about 20%) and <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts,</b> which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the newly formed honey to ferment. The process continues as hive bees flutter their wings constantly to circulate air and evaporate water from the honey to a content around 18%, raising the sugar concentration, and preventing fermentation. The bees then cap the cells with wax to seal them. As removed from the hive by a beekeeper, honey has a long shelf life and will not ferment if properly sealed.|$|R

50|$|Traditional Kadazan cuisine {{involves}} mostly boiling or grilling {{which employs}} little use of oil, and with locally unique modifications and nuances {{as well as}} particular usage of locally available ingredients, particularly bamboo shoots, sago and fresh water fish. From simple appetizers of unripe mango dressed with soy sauce and chili flakes {{to a variety of}} pickled foods collectively known as noonsom, tangy and pungent flavours from souring agents or fermentation techniques is a key characteristic of traditional Kadazan cooking. One of the most well known Kadazan dishes is hinava, which is similar in concept to the South American ceviche. It is a salad made with pieces of raw fish marinated in citrus juice, ginger, onion and other ingredients like bitter gourd and grated dried bambangan seed which is similar in texture to desiccated coconut strands. This dish is sometimes served in certain Sabahan restaurants which do not otherwise have a traditional Kadazan menu. Another popular dish is pinasakan, which consists of sea or freshwater fish (usually smaller species) cooked with bambangan (a variety of mango found in Borneo) or takob-akob (a very tart dried fruit). The bambangan fruit is also eaten with meals as an appetiser. It is often pickled as noonsom and garnished with grated bambangan seed. Tuhau is a fragrant local root that is often made into a salad or is preserved with vinegar as noonsom. Wild boar or bakas, whether char grilled, stewed or even made into noonsom is very popular with the Kadazandusun community, often an essential item at weddings and major gatherings. Sweets include hinompuka, a type of gooey rice cake steamed in banana leaves and flavoured with dark palm sugar.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in biology is whether variation in organisms primarily {{emerges as a}} function of adaptation or {{as a function of}} neutral genetic drift. Trait variation in the model organism baker’s yeast follows population bottlenecks rather than environmental boundaries suggesting that it primarily results from genetic drift. Based on the yeast life history, we hypothesized that population-specific loss-of-function mutations emerging in genes recently released from selection is the predominant cause of trait variation within the species. As retention of one functional copy of a gene in diploid yeasts is typically sufficient to maintain completely unperturbed performance, we also conjectured that a crossing of <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts</b> from populations with different loss-of-function mutations would provide a further efficient test bed for this hypothesis. Charting the first species-wide map of trait inheritance in a eukaryotic organism, we found trait heredity to be strongly biased toward diploid hybrid performance exactly mimicking the performance of the best of the parents, as expected given a complete dominance of functional over nonfunctional alleles.

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the yeast community of this wine grape growing region in order to create a Saccharomyces cerevisiae bank, providing data on oenological properties for potential industrial applications. A total of 430 yeasts were isolated at the end of spontaneous fermentation. PCR-RFLP was applied for the identification at the species level and underlined that 14 strains exhibited unusual and characteristic restriction patterns different from those typical of the species S. cerevisiae. This difference was due to the insertion of base C at a position 138 in the ITS 1 region that determined an additional cleavage site for the enzyme HaeIII. This insertion could be associated to the fermentative performance and associated to the relationship existing between yeasts and a viticulture region or ‘terroir’...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} {{and relative}} ratios of various aroma compounds produced by fermenting yeast cells {{are essential for}} the sensorial quality of many fermented foods, including beer, bread, wine and sake. Since the production of these aroma-active compounds varies highly amongst different yeast strains, careful selection of variants with an optimal aromatic profile is of crucial importance for a high-quality end product. This study evaluates the production of different aroma-active compounds in 301 different Saccharomyces yeast strains. Our {{results show that the}} production of key aroma compounds like isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate varies by an order of magnitude between <b>natural</b> <b>yeasts,</b> with the concentrations of some compounds showing significant positive correlation, whereas others vary independently. Targeted hybridization of some of the best aroma-producing strains yielded 46 intraspecific hybrids, of which some show a distinct heterosis (hybrid vigour) effect and produce up to 45 % more isoamyl acetate compared to the best-parental strains, while retaining their overall fermentation performance. Together, our results demonstrate the potential of large-scale outbreeding to obtain superior industrial yeasts that are directly applicable for commercial use. status: publishe...|$|R
