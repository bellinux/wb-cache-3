Methods: Rabbits were randomized into 4 groups (each n = 6) : the <b>nicorandil</b> group (100 μg/kg intravenous <b>nicorandil</b> 10 minutes before ischemia); the glibenclamide plus <b>nicorandil</b> group (3 mg/kg intravenous glibenclamide, an antagonist of adenosine triphosphate–sensitive potassium channels, 10 minutes before <b>nicorandil</b> administration); the vehicle group (vehicle alone); and the sham operation group (without spinal cord ischemia). Spinal cord ischemia was induced by balloon occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta for 15 minutes at 39 °C. Neurologic function was graded into Johnson&'s score at 8 hours, 1 day, and 2 days.

40|$|<b>Nicorandil</b> (1 - 1000 mumol l- 1) caused concentration-dependent {{relaxation}} of guinea-pig isolated trachealis. Propranolol (1 mumol l- 1) did not modify the relaxant action of <b>nicorandil</b> but antagonized isoprenaline. Among K+-channel inhibitors tested, apamin (0. 1 mumol l- 1) and procaine (5 mmol l- 1) did not modify the relaxant action of <b>nicorandil.</b> In contrast, tetraethylammonium (TEA, 8 mmol l- 1) caused five fold antagonism. Trachealis exposed to K+-rich (120 mmol l- 1) Krebs solution developed near-maximal tension. <b>Nicorandil</b> relaxed the K+-depolarized tissue though its concentration-effect curve was shifted markedly to the right. In tissues in which tone was induced by histamine, methylene blue (100 mumol l- 1) antagonized <b>nicorandil</b> and sodium nitroprusside {{but did not}} modify the relaxant action of aminophylline. Intracellular electrophysiological recording showed that <b>nicorandil</b> (1 mumol l- 1) could evoke some relaxation {{in the absence of}} electrical changes. Higher concentrations (10 - 1000 mumol l- 1) reduced the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous electrical slow waves. <b>Nicorandil</b> also caused concentration-dependent hyperpolarization and relaxation. When the hyperpolarization was sufficiently pronounced slow wave activity was abolished. TEA (8 mmol l- 1) induced slow waves which were surmounted by a spike potential. TEA slightly reduced the maximal hyperpolarization induced by <b>nicorandil</b> and increased the time required for <b>nicorandil</b> to abolish slow wave discharge. Procaine (5 mmol l- 1) induced slow waves of relatively low frequency. Sometimes these were surmounted by a spike potential Procaine markedly reduced the hyperpolarization induced by <b>nicorandil</b> and increased the time required for abolition of slow waves. In studies of the efflux of 86 Rb+ from muscle-rich strips of trachea, <b>nicorandil</b> (1000 mumol l- 1) increased the efflux rate constant, whereas isoprenaline (1 mumol l- 1) was without effect. It is concluded that nicorandil-induced relaxation does not involve the activation of beta-adrenoceptors but is partly attributable to the formation of nitric oxide from the nitrate moiety in its molecular structure. <b>Nicorandil</b> can evoke relaxation in the absence of membrane potential change but towards the upper end of its effective concentration range, <b>nicorandil</b> increases membrane K+ conductance and thereby evokes hyperpolarization of trachealis cells. The K+ channels opened by <b>nicorandil</b> are permeable to 86 Rb, insensitive to apamin and TEA but may be inhibited by procaine...|$|E
40|$|We used whole-cell patch clamp to {{investigate}} the currents activated by <b>nicorandil</b> in smooth muscle cells isolated from rat small mesenteric arteries, and studied the relaxant effect of <b>nicorandil</b> using myography. <b>Nicorandil</b> (300 [*]μM) activated currents with near-linear current-voltage relationships and reversal potentials near to the equilibrium potential for K+. The nicorandil-activated current was blocked by glibenclamide (10 [*]μM), but unaffected by iberiotoxin (100 [*]nM) and the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor LY 83583 (1 [*]μM). During current activation by <b>nicorandil,</b> openings of channels with a unitary conductance of 31 [*]pS were detected.

A small reduction in current amplitude was seen in 300 [*]μM <b>nicorandil,</b> though this was not statistically significant. In arterial rings contracted with 20 [*]mM K+ Krebs solution containing 200 [*]nM BAYK 8644, <b>nicorandil</b> produced a concentration-dependent relaxation with mean pD 2 = 4. 77 ± 0. 06.

The incidence can be diminished by a progressive titration. In comparative trials with anti-anginal agents, such as propranolol, diltiazem, nifedipine, ISDN and isosorbide 5 mononitrate, the overall incidence of adverse events was not significantly different between <b>nicorandil</b> and the reference drug.

We {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) –sensitive potassium channel opener, <b>nicorandil,</b> on ATP- and verapamil-responsive ventricular tachycardias (VTs). Background. Adenosine- or ATP-sensitive VTs are thought to be due to a nonreentrant mechanism, presumably delayed afterdepolarization. We suggest that this potassium channel opener may suppress ATP- and verapamil-sensitive VTs. Methods. The subjects included 13 patients with idiopathic VTs, 7 of whom had sustained VT and 6 of whom had nonsustained VT. We evaluated the effects of ATP, <b>nicorandil</b> and verapamil on VTs. Results. Sustained VT: Verapamil had preventive effects on seven VTs. Four VTs were terminated by ATP, and of these, <b>nicorandil</b> terminated two and prevented exercise-induced VT in the two others.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{examined}} whether <b>nicorandil,</b> a clinically useful {{drug for}} the treatment of ischemic syndromes, inhibits myocardial apoptosis. BackgroundNicorandil has been reported to have a cardioprotective action through activation of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mitoKATP) channels. Based on our recent observation that mitoKATP channel activation has a remarkable antiapoptotic effect in cultured cardiac cells, we hypothesized that the protective effects of <b>nicorandil</b> may be at least partially due to an antiapoptotic effect. MethodsCultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to hydrogen peroxide to induce apoptosis. Effects of <b>nicorandil</b> were evaluated using a number of apoptotic markers. ResultsExposure to 100 μM hydrogen peroxide resulted in apoptotic cell death as shown by TUNEL positivity, cytochrome c translocation, caspase- 3 activation and dissipation of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm). <b>Nicorandil</b> (100 μM) suppressed all of these markers of apoptosis. Notably, <b>nicorandil</b> prevented ΔΨm depolarization in a concentration-dependent manner (EC 50 ∼ 40 μM, with saturation by 100 μM), as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of cells stained with a fluorescent ΔΨm-indicator, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). Time-lapse confocal microscopy of individual cells loaded with TMRE shows that <b>nicorandil</b> suppresses ΔΨm loss.

40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{are reports}} about a {{possible}} weak local anaesthetic activity of <b>nicorandil,</b> a potassium channel agonist (PCA). In addition, modification of local anesthetic activity of lignocaine by PCA is not clearly defined. The objective {{of the present study}} is to evaluate local anesthetic activity of <b>nicorandil</b> and to evaluate the influence of <b>nicorandil</b> on the efficacy and duration of local anesthesia by lignocaine. A total number of 84 albino rats of either sex were divided into 14 groups of 6 animals each. Two methods, sciatic nerve blockade and tail clip method were applied for the study. Control group received 0. 2 ml normal saline, whereas the study group received 0. 2 ml of 1 % drug solution (lignocaine or <b>nicorandil)</b> combined with 0. 9 % sodium chloride. The results showed weak local anaesthetic activity with the higher dosages of <b>nicorandil</b> (10 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg). Combination of <b>nicorandil</b> (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) and lignocaine (5 mg/kg) yielded synergistic results like decreased onset latency and prolonged reaction time. To conclude unquestionably there are multiple mechanisms involved for causation of local anesthetic effect by drugs like lignocaine.

40|$|AbstractNicorandil (2 -nicotinamide ethyl nitrate), an {{antianginal}} drug {{characterized by}} the coupling of nicotinamide with a nitric oxide (NO) donor, activates guanylyl cyclase and opens ATP-dependent K+ channels.

This activity was observed when <b>nicorandil</b> was administered between 30 and 120 min before the injection of formaldehyde. Ipsilateral intraplantar injection of <b>nicorandil</b> (125, 250 or 500 μg/paw) did not inhibit the nociceptive response. After p. o. administration of <b>nicorandil</b> (50 mg/kg), peak plasma concentrations of this compound and NHN were observed 0. 63 and 4 h later, respectively. Nicotinamide concentrations were not increased after administration of <b>nicorandil.</b> 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ; 1 or 2 mg/kg), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, partially attenuated the antinociceptive activity of <b>nicorandil.</b> However, this activity was not changed by glibenclamide (30 or 60 mg/kg), an inhibitor of ATP-dependent K+ channels.

BACKGROUNDExperimental studies documented that ATP-sensitive K+channel opener exerts cardioprotection after prolonged ischemia. METHODSWe randomly divided 81 patients with a first anterior AMI into two groups, <b>nicorandil</b> (n = 40) and control groups (n = 41). All patients received successful coronary angioplasty within 12 h after the symptom onset and underwent myocardial contrast echcardiography (MCE) with the intracoronary injection of sonicated microbubbles. In the <b>nicorandil</b> group, we injected 4 mg of <b>nicorandil</b> followed by the infusion at 6 mg/h for 24 h and by oral <b>nicorandil</b> (15 mg/day). RESULTSThe improvement in regional left ventricular function, wall motion score and regional wall motion was significantly better in the <b>nicorandil</b> group then {{in the control group}}. Intractable congestive heart failure, malignant ventricular arrhythmia and pericardial effusion were more frequently found in the control group than in the <b>nicorandil</b> group (15 % vs. 37 %, 5 % vs. 20 % and 8 % vs. 37 %, p < 0. 05, respectively).

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>nicorandil</b> on excitation-contraction {{coupling}} {{in the ear}} artery of the rabbit have been investigated. Perivascular nerve stimulation induces excitatory junction potentials (e. j. p.

The decreased excitability of the smooth muscle cells can be partially explained by the increase of K permeability, as measured by 87 Rb efflux, and by the concomitant hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. Because the inhibitory action of <b>nicorandil</b> on the contractile responses also occurs in K-depolarized tissues in which <b>nicorandil</b> no longer affects the membrane potential, additional mechanisms of action have to be sought.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to design and {{evaluate}} extended-release formulations of a model drug, <b>nicorandil,</b> in order to achieve the desired steady-state plasma concentration of drug in vivo. Simulation was employed to estimate optimum dissolution and absorption rate of <b>nicorandil.</b> The dissolution test was employed using pH 1. 2, 4. 0, 6. 8 buffer solution, or water, to measure the in vitro release behaviors of <b>nicorandil</b> formulations. A single dose (15  mg) of each formulation was orally administered to four beagle dogs under fasted conditions, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The in vitro/in vivo relationship of the extended-release formulation was confirmed using in vitro dissolution profiles and plasma concentrations of drug in beagle dogs. <b>Nicorandil</b> was released completely within 30  min from the immediate-release tablets and released for 24  h from the extended-release tablets. The <b>nicorandil</b> plasma concentration could be modified by adjusting the drug release rate from the extended-release formulation. The release rate of <b>nicorandil</b> was the rate-limiting step in the overall absorption of drug from the extended-release formulations.

In the <b>nicorandil</b> group, 4 mg of intracoronary <b>nicorandil</b> was infused prior to PCI.

40|$|The anti-diabetic drug miglitol, an α-glucosidase inhibitor, {{which is}} {{currently}} used clinically, reduces myocardial infarct size by reducing the glycogenolytic rate through inhibition of the α- 1, 6 -glucosidase of glycogen-debranching enzyme in the heart. <b>Nicorandil,</b> a KATP channel opener with a nitrate-like effect, which is also currently used clinically, also reduces the infarct size. Therefore, we hypothesized that combination of <b>nicorandil</b> and submaximal dose of miglitol could markedly reduce myocardial infarct size more than miglitol or <b>nicorandil</b> alone, and investigated the mechanism for the infarct size-reducing effect. Japanese white rabbits without collateral circulation were subjected to 30 [*]min coronary occlusion followed by 48 [*]h reperfusion. Pre-ischaemic treatment with submaximal dose of miglitol (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) and <b>nicorandil</b> alone (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1 5 [*]min) moderately reduced the infarct size {{as a percentage of}} area at risk (24 ± 4 and 25 ± 4 %, respectively), and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 of miglitol markedly reduced the infarct size (15 ± 2 %) compared with the controls (42 ± 2 %). Combination of 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 of miglitol and <b>nicorandil</b> (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1 5 [*]min), and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 of miglitol and <b>nicorandil</b> (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1 5 [*]min) significantly reduced the infarct size (13 ± 4 and 12 ± 3 %, respectively) more than miglitol or <b>nicorandil</b> alone.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Nicorandil,</b> an anti-angina agent, {{reportedly}} improves outcomes even in angina {{patients with}} diabetes. However, the precise mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of <b>nicorandil</b> on diabetic patients {{has not been}} examined. We investigated the protective effect of <b>nicorandil</b> on endothelial function in diabetic rats because endothelial dysfunction is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old) were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg, once a day for 3 days) to induce diabetes. <b>Nicorandil</b> (15 mg/kg/day) and tempol (20 mg/kg/day, superoxide dismutase mimetic) were administered in drinking water for one week, starting 3 weeks after STZ injection. Endothelial function was evaluated by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the femoral arteries of anaesthetised rats. Cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were treated with high glucose (35. 6 mM, 24 h) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production with or without L-NAME (300 μM), apocynin (100 μM) or <b>nicorandil</b> (100 μM) was measured using fluorescent probes. Results Endothelial function as evaluated by FMD was significantly reduced in diabetic as compared with normal rats (diabetes, 9. 7 ± 1. 4 %; normal, 19. 5 ± 1. 7 %; n = 6 - 7). There was a 2. 4 -fold increase in p 47 phox expression, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, and a 1. 8 -fold increase in total eNOS expression in diabetic rat femoral arteries. <b>Nicorandil</b> and tempol significantly improved FMD in diabetic rats (<b>nicorandil,</b> 17. 7 ± 2. 6 %; tempol, 13. 3 ± 1. 4 %; n = 6). <b>Nicorandil</b> significantly inhibited the increased expressions of p 47 phox and total eNOS in diabetic rat femoral arteries. Furthermore, <b>nicorandil</b> significantly inhibited the decreased expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I and the decreased dimer/monomer ratio of eNOS. ROS production in HCAECs was increased by high-glucose treatment, which was prevented by L-NAME and <b>nicorandil</b> suggesting that eNOS itself might serve as a superoxide source under high-glucose conditions and that <b>nicorandil</b> might prevent ROS production from eNOS. Conclusions These results suggest that <b>nicorandil</b> improved diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction through antioxidative effects by inhibiting NADPH oxidase and eNOS uncoupling. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nicorandil</b> is {{a potent}} {{coronary}} vasodilator. To assess its long-term antianginal effect, we designed a randomized, parallel double-blind trial of 6 weeks' duration comparing <b>nicorandil</b> (10 or 20 mg b. i. d.) with propranolol (40 or 80 mg t. i. d.). The study comprised 77 men with stable angina, no maintenance medication at entry, and an exercise test positive for angina and ST-segment depression. The therapy was started with 10 mg <b>nicorandil</b> b. i. d. or 40 mg propranolol t. i. d. After 3 weeks, the dosage could be doubled according to clinical criteria. Four men receiving <b>nicorandil</b> and one receiving propranolol were withdrawn with side effects; in three cases, the data were not complete. Thus, comparative data were obtained in 69 patients; in 51 of these (26 receiving <b>nicorandil</b> and 25 receiving propranolol), the dosage was increased to the higher level. Blood pressure and heart rate were unaltered by <b>nicorandil</b> and lowered by propranolol. The number of anginal attacks decreased relative to baseline on <b>nicorandil</b> and propranolol (p < 0. 002), but total exercise duration was not influenced by either drug. The exercise test performed 2 h after either pill ingestion showed a decrease and a delay in occurrence of myocardial ischemia. The test performed 12 h after medication exhibited reduced ischemia, whereas only propranolol resulted in delayed ST-segment depression. The double product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure was affected only slightly by <b>nicorandil</b> and reduced significantly by propranolol (p < 0. 001). Thus, <b>nicorandil</b> medication affords similar improvement as propranolol in patients with angina pectoris, but the mode of action appears to be differen...|$|E
