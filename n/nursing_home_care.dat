5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>care,</b> direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver.

25|$|Medicaid {{is a joint}} {{federal and}} state program that helps with medical costs for about 74 million people (as of 2017) with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers {{benefits}} not normally covered by Medicare, like <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> and personal care services. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to low-income and disabled people. It is a means-tested program that is jointly funded {{by the state and}} federal governments and managed by the states, with each state currently having broad leeway to determine who is eligible for its implementation of the program. States are not required to participate in the program, although all have since 1982. Medicaid recipients must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, and may include low-income adults, their children, and people with certain disabilities. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), the percent of Medicaid program costs covered by the federal government, ranges from 50% for higher-income states to 75% for states with lower per-capita incomes.|$|E

Yet she also describes moments of forgiveness, humility and admiration." [...] During this time, she developed a close relationship, previously inconceivable, with her mother, which she considered [...] "a miracle and a grace, a gift." [...] Her relationships with her sisters were troubled during this time, but they all came to support their mother's apartment-living. The suggestion of her role as the heroine in Mother Millett, however, may have been [...] "at the expense of her two siblings".|$|E

[...] The adult children of these elders often face a difficult challenge in helping their parents make the right choices. [...] Assisted living is one option for the elderly who need assistance with everyday tasks.

2500|$|For {{institutional}} care, such as {{hospital and}} <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>care,</b> Medicare uses prospective payment systems. In a prospective payment system, {{the health care}} institution receives a set amount of money for each episode of care provided to a patient, regardless of the actual amount of care. The actual allotment of funds {{is based on a}} list of diagnosis-related groups (DRG). The actual amount depends on the primary diagnosis that is actually made at the hospital. There are some issues surrounding Medicare's use of DRGs because if the patient uses less care, the hospital gets to keep the remainder. This, in theory, should balance the costs for the hospital. However, if the patient uses more care, then the hospital has to cover its own losses. This results in the issue of [...] "upcoding," [...] when a physician makes a more severe diagnosis to hedge against accidental costs.|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{analyze the}} impact of six job {{characteristics}} on the intention of nurses to leave their organization, specifically focusing on long term <b>care</b> settings: <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>care.</b> Background. When <b>nurses</b> leave their organization, this can negatively affect organizational performance. Organizations have to recruit new nurses and tacit knowledge is lost. Furthermore, organizational turnover could contribute to the nursing shortage, which will increasingly become a problem given the aging population. This article adds to the literature, given a) its focus on long term care and b) by explicating the differences between <b>nursing</b> and <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> (intramural) {{on the one hand}} and <b>home</b> <b>care</b> (extramural) on the other. Design. Survey Method. Survey of 9, 982 nurses in 156 Dutch organizations in 2010 - 2011, 6, 321 nurses in <b>nursing</b> and <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> and 3, 661 <b>nurses</b> working in <b>home</b> <b>care,</b> based on the ActiZ Benchmark in Healthcare. Results. Firstly, the most important reason for nurses’ intention to leave is insufficient development and career opportunities. Secondly, a negative working atmosphere strongly influenced intention to leave. The impact of the working atmosphere is not often examined in the literature. However, this research shows that it is an important reason. Thirdly, intention to leave is partly context dependent. More specifically, when <b>nurses</b> in <b>home</b> <b>care</b> felt that their autonomy was reduced, this strongly influenced their intention to leave, while this was not the case for nurses working in <b>nursing</b> and <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> Conclusion.

40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is ``The issues of hospice care {{from the viewpoint}} of <b>nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies and potential patients``. The following two objectives and three hypotheses were formulated for the thesis: The first goal was to map the situation in provision of <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} <b>nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies. Two hypotheses were formulated for this objective. H 1 - <b>Nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies provide <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> and H 2 - <b>Nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies are interested in expanding the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> by means of mobile hospice units. The second objective of the bachelor thesis was to survey awareness of the lay public about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies. For this objective the third and the last hypothesis H 3 was formulated { [...] } The lay public has no information about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies. A quantitative research method has been used to achieve the objective, using inquiring with questionnaires. Two types of questionnaires were used, one for <b>nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies and one for the lay public. The resulting data have been processed with a descriptive statistical method. The first surveyed group consisted of 57 nurses and the second surveyed group consisted of 75 respondents. We have found out that <b>nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies provide <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> but they are often unable to ensure quality conditions for such <b>home</b> hospice <b>care.</b> Another surprising finding was that the <b>nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies were not interested in extending the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> with mobile hospice units. We believe that the <b>nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies lack the necessary information about the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care.</b> The hypothesis No. 1 : <b>Nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies provide <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> has been disproved and also the hypothesis No. 2 : <b>Nurses</b> working for <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies are interested in expanding the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> by means of mobile hospice units has been disproved, which means the first objective has been met. Further, we have found out that the lay public does not have sufficient information about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies, which means that the hypothesis No. 3 : The lay public has no information about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies has been confirmed and the second objective has been met. In this connection I have proposed some measures to improve the awareness of <b>home</b> hospice <b>care.</b> I have recommended informative articles to be developed for magazines intended for the lay public, as well as for professional journals for nurses.
