40|$|Aberrant DNA {{methylation}} is {{a common}} feature of neoplastic lesions, and early detection of such changes may provide powerful mechanistic insights and biomarkers for carcinogenesis. Here, we investigate dynamic changes in the mouse liver DNA methylome associated with short (1 day) and prolonged (7, 28 and 91 days) exposure to the rodent liver <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen,</b> phenobarbital (PB). We find that the distribution of 5 mC/ 5 hmC is highly consistent between untreated individuals of a similar age; yet, changes during liver maturation in a transcriptionally dependent manner. Following drug treatment, we identify and validate a series of differentially methylated or hydroxymethylated regions: exposure results in staged transcriptional responses with distinct kinetic profiles that strongly correlate with promoter proximal region 5 hmC levels. Furthermore, reciprocal changes for both 5 mC and 5 hmC in response to PB suggest that active demethylation may be taking place at each set of these loci via a 5 hmC intermediate. Finally, we identify potential early biomarkers for non-genotoxic carcinogenesis, including several genes aberrantly expressed in liver cancer. Our work suggests that 5 hmC profiling {{can be used as}} an indicator of cell states during organ maturation and drug-induced responses and provides novel epigenetic signatures for <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> exposur...|$|E

40|$|Although a rodent carcinogen, {{metronidazole}} {{is widely}} used in humans {{for the treatment of}} infections with anaerobic organisms. Metronidazole is mutagenic for microorganisms, but has a mainly negative data base for mammals and humans. Therefore, metronidazole is generally considered as a <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen.</b> Only the results of two human in vivo studies would allow the classification of metronidazole as genotoxic carcinogen: (1) the induction of DNA strand breaks; and (2) the induction of chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes after metronidazole therapy. Because the classification of metronidazole as genotoxic carcinogen would imply enormous consequences with respect to its application both studies were reinvestigated very thoroughly. The present report describes the reinvestigation of the induction of DNA strand breaks after metronidazole therapy. Each two probes of lymphocytes of metronidazole-treated patients (3 x 500 to 3 x 750 mg/day for 5 - 8 days) were examined separately for the appearance of DNA strand breaks before and after treatment. In total, 400 nuclei were examined per patient. Immediately before the first, and 30 min to 2 h after the last application, 2 x 10 ml blood per patient was sampled, transported to the laboratory at 15 - 200 C to make DNA repair more difficult, and examined within the next 4 - 7 h for DNA strand breaks. At the same time, the individual metronidazole blood plasma levels were measured. In contrast to the published reports, no induction of DNA strand breaks after metronidazole therapy could be observed in the present study. As the applied doses (15 750 mg vs. 4800 mg) and the plasma level (up to 25 ug/ml vs. not measured) of metronidazole were much higher than in the published study, the relevance of the clearly negative result is obvious. As induction of DNA strand breaks is a frequent prerequisite for genotoxicity, metronidazole should be considered as a <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen,</b> and not as a genotoxic carcinogen...|$|E

A complicating factor is that <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> act through several distinctive modes of action, which makes prediction of their carcinogenic property difficult. We have recently demonstrated that gene expression profiling in primary mouse hepatocytes is a useful approach to categorize <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> according to their modes of action. In the current study, we improved {{the methods used for}} analysis and added mouse embryonic stem cells as a second in vitro test system, because of their features complementary to hepatocytes. Our approach involved an unsupervised analysis based on the 30 most significantly up- and down-regulated genes per chemical. Mouse embryonic stem cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were exposed to a selected set of chemicals and subsequently subjected to gene expression profiling. We focused on <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> but also included genotoxic carcinogens and non-carcinogens to test the robustness of this approach. Application of the optimized comparison approach resulted in improved categorization of <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> Mouse embryonic stem cells were a useful addition, especially for genotoxic substances, but also for detection of <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> that went undetected by primary hepatocytes.

Given that <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> are negative for genotoxicity and chronic bioassays are no longer regularly performed, this class of carcinogens will go undetected. Therefore, test systems detecting <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> or even better their modes of action, are required. Here, we investigated whether gene expression profiling in primary hepatocytes {{can be used to}} distinguish different modes of action of <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> For this, primary mouse hepatocytes were exposed to 16 <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> with diverse modes of action. Upon profiling, pathway analysis was performed to obtain insight into the biological relevance of the observed changes in gene expression. Subsequently, both a supervised and an unsupervised comparison approach were applied to recognize the modes of action at the transcriptomic level. These analyses resulted in the detection of three of eight compound classes, that is, peroxisome proliferators, metalloids and skin tumor promotors. In conclusion, gene expression profiles in primary hepatocytes, at least in rodent hepatocytes, appear to be useful to detect some, certainly not all, modes of action of <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens...</b>|$|R

40|$|The cyclodiene {{pesticide}} chlordane {{has been}} reported to be a <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> in rodents. The effects of chlordane on SHE cell transformation were investigated in this study. It appeared that chlordane exhibited a weak transforming activity when applied repeatedly at 8 |xg/ml. No effect resulted from the combination of benzo-[a]pyrene-chlordane. In contrast, chlordane in the range 5 - 20 |ig/ml and 12 - 0 -tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) (0. 1 ng/ml) highly potentiated each other when applied sequentially. The synergistic effects could be inhib-ited by dexamethasone. These results led us to study the genotoxicity of chlordane on SHE cells: no DNA adduct formation could be detected in SHE cells treated with chlordane at a concentration potentiating the transforming effect of TPA. We also confirmed that this pesticide mark-edly inhibited intercellular communication between SHE as well as V 79 cells. These results support literature data on the non-genotoxicity of chlordane.

In the Drosophila glutathione S-transferase D 21 (gstD 21) gene, pentobarbital's regulatory influence {{extends to the}} level of mRNA turnover. Transcribed from an intronless gene, gstD 21 mRNA is intrinsically very labile. But exposure to pentobarbital renders it stabilized beyond what can be attributed to transcriptional activation. We aim here to identify cis-acting element(s) of gstD 21 mRNA as contributors to the molecule's pentobarbital-mediated stabilization. In the context of hsp 70 5 ′UTR and the 3 ′UTR of act 5 C, gstD 21 mRNA, minus its native UTRs, is stable. Maintaining the same context of heterologous UTRs, we can reconstitute using the full-length gstD 21 sequence the inherent instability of gstD 21 mRNA and its stabilization by pentobarbital. Transgenic flies that express these chimeric gstD 21 mRNA exhibit decay intermediates lacking 3 ′UTR, which are not stabilized by PB treatment. The 3 ′UTR sequence, when inserted downstream from a reporter transcript, stabilizes it 1. 6 -fold under PB treatment. The analysis of the decay intermediates suggests a polysome-associated decay pattern. We propose a regulatory model that features a 59 -nucleotide pentobarbital-responsive element (PBRE) in the 3 ′UTR of gstD 21 mRNA.

Using this mouse line as compared with wild-type and Nkx 2 - 1 heterozygous mice, a thyroid carcinogenesis study was carried out using the genotoxic carcinogen N-bis(2 -hydroxypropyl) -nitrosamine (DHPN), followed by sulfadimethoxine (SDM) or the <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> amitrole (3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole).

A bromodeoxyuridine incorporation study revealed that thyroids of the Nkx 2 - 1 -thyroid-conditional hypomorphic mice had > 2 -fold higher constitutive cell proliferation rate than the other two groups of mice, suggesting that this may be at least partially responsible for the increased incidence of adenoma in this mouse line after genotoxic carcinogen exposure.

40|$|Based on {{the process}} of carcinogenesis, {{carcinogens}} are classified as either genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In contrast to <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> many genotoxic carcinogens have been reported to cause tumor in carcinogenic bioassays in animals. Thus evaluating the genotoxicity potential of chemicals is important to discriminate genotoxic from <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> for health care and pharmaceutical industry safety. Additionally, investigating the difference between the mechanisms of genotoxic and <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> could provide the foundation for a mechanism-based classification for unknown compounds. In this study, we investigated the gene expression of HepG 2 cells treated with genotoxic or <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> and compared their mechanisms of action. To enhance our understanding of the differences in the mechanisms of genotoxic and <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> we implemented a gene set analysis using 12 compounds for the training set (12, 24, 48 h) and validated significant gene sets using 22 compounds for the test set (24, 48 h). For a direct biological translation, we conducted a gene set analysis using Globaltest and selected significant gene sets. To validate the results, training and test compounds were predicted by the significant gene sets using a prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM). Finally, we obtained 6 gene sets, including sets enriched for genes involved in the adherens junction, bladder cancer, p 53 signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, peroxisome and RNA degradation. Among the 6 gene sets, the bladder cancer and p 53 signaling pathway sets were significant at 12, 24 and 48 h. We also found that the DDB 2, RRM 2 B and GADD 45 A, genes related to the repair and damage prevention of DNA, were consistently up-regulated for genotoxic carcinogens.

40|$|Background: Induction and {{promotion}} of liver cancer by exposure to non-genotoxic carcinogens coincides with epigenetic perturbations, including specific changes in DNA methylation. Here we investigate the genome-wide dynamics of 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) as a likely intermediate of 5 -methylcytosine (5 mC) demethylation in a DNA methylation reprogramming pathway. We use a rodent model of <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> exposure using the drug phenobarbital. Results: Exposure to phenobarbital results in dynamic and reciprocal changes to the 5 mC/ 5 hmC patterns over the promoter regions of a cohort of genes that are transcriptionally upregulated. This reprogramming of 5 mC/ 5 hmC coincides with characteristic changes in the histone marks H 3 K 4 me 2, H 3 K 27 me 3 and H 3 K 36 me 3. Quantitative analysis of phenobarbital-induced genes {{that are involved in}} xenobiotic metabolism reveals that both DNA modifications are lost at the transcription start site, while there is a reciprocal relationship between increasing levels of 5 hmC and loss of 5 mC at regions immediately adjacent to core promoters. Conclusions: Collectively, these experiments support the hypothesis that 5 hmC is a potential intermediate in a demethylation pathway and reveal precise perturbations of the mouse liver DNA methylome and hydroxymethylome upon exposure to a rodent hepatocarcinogen...|$|E

Here, the effects of Cd treatment on the DNA methylation patten are examined together with its effect on chromatin reconfiguration in Posidonia oceanica. DNA methylation level and pattern were analysed in actively growing organs, under short- (6 h) and long- (2 d or 4 d) term and low (10 μM) and high (50 μM) doses of Cd, through a Methylation-Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism technique and an immunocytological approach, respectively. The expression of {{one member of the}} CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) family, a DNA methyltransferase, was also assessed by qRT-PCR.

Cd treatment induced a DNA hypermethylation, as well as an up-regulation of CMT, indicating that de novo methylation did indeed occur. Moreover, a high dose of Cd led to a progressive heterochromatinization of interphase nuclei and apoptotic figures were also observed after long-term treatment.

Transcriptomic and proteomic approaches {{have been widely}} applied in vitro but relatively few studies have used metabolomics.

The human liver cell line HepG 2, and the well-known hepatotoxic and <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), were used as the in vitro model system and model toxicant, respectively. Results The study focused on the analysis of intracellular metabolites using NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS, with emphasis on the reproducibility and repeatability of the data. State of the art pre-processing and alignment tools and multivariate statistics were used to detect significantly altered levels of metabolites after exposing HepG 2 cells to TCDD. Several metabolites identified using databases, literature and LC-nanomate-Orbitrap analysis were affected by the treatment. The observed changes in metabolite levels are discussed in relation to the reported effects of TCDD. Conclusions Untargeted profiling of the polar and apolar metabolites of in vitro cultured HepG 2 cells is a valid approach to studying the effects of TCDD on the cell metabolome. The approach described in this research demonstrates that highly reproducible experiments and correct normalization of the datasets are essential for obtaining reliable results.

Here, we investigated the mechanism of the human <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> cyclosporine A (CsA) in the Xpa/p 53 mouse model. Xpa/p 53 mice exposed to CsA for 39 weeks showed a significantly increased lymphoma incidence as compared with untreated Xpa/p 53 mice and CsA-treated wild-type (WT) mice. We excluded concealed genotoxicity of CsA in Xpa/p 53 mice by mutant frequency analyses. As a next step, we used a genetic approach: immunodeficient DNA-PKcs mice, defective in the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, were crossed with Xpa and Xpa/p 53 mice. Xpa/p 53 mice had an increased lymphoma incidence with shorter latency times as compared with DNA-PKcs-deficient WT and Xpa mice. Surprisingly, also six of 15 DNA-PKcs/Xpa/p 53 females had developed an adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland. Tumor responses in CsA-treated and DNA-PKcs-deficient Xpa/p 53 mice were comparable as both genotypes developed mainly splenic lymphomas enriched in B lymphocytes. From our present studies, we hypothesize that levels of initiated precancerous cells are elevated in Xpa/p 53 mice. These cells are insufficiently eliminated due to either suppression {{of the immune system}} by CsA or through immune-related DNA-PKcs deficiency.

With mRNA Differential Display (DD), we analysed the transcriptional regulation of SHE cells exposed to 0, 12. 5, 25 and 50 μM of DEHP for 24 hrs, conditions which induced neoplastic transformation of these cells. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to confirm differential expression of genes identified by DD. Results Gene expression profiling showed 178 differentially-expressed fragments corresponding to 122 genes after tblastx comparisons, 79 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated. The genes of interest were involved in many biological pathways, including signal transduction, regulation of the cytoskeleton, xenobiotic metabolism, apoptosis, lipidogenesis, protein conformation, transport and cell cycle. We then focused particularly on genes involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, one of the processes occurring during carcinogenesis and in the early steps of neoplastic transformation. Twenty one cytoskeleton-related genes were studied by qPCR. The down-regulated genes were involved in focal adhesion or cell junction. The up-regulated genes were involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and this would suggest a role of cellular plasticity in the mechanism of chemical carcinogenesis. The gene expression changes identified in the present study were PPAR-independent. Conclusion This study identified a set of genes whose expression is altered by DEHP exposure in mammalian embryo cells. This is the first study that elucidates the genomic changes of DEHP involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton. The latter genes may be candidates as biomarkers predictive of early events in the multistep carcinogenic process. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{there was an}} {{increase}} in the consumption of pre-fried and fried foods, which leads to high intake of fats and oils subjected to thermal treatment. The oils and fats are usually processed to improve the quality, stability and safety. Despite removing a large amount of impurities from the oil, the processing can often originate the formation of contaminants that can cause additional health hazards to those who consume these foods. During processing, oils and foods are exposed to several factors that originate toxic compounds, namely 3 -chloropropane- 1, 2 -diol (3 -MCPD), 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (HNE) and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -(E) -hexenal (HHE). 3 -MCPD is a food processing contaminant included in the group of compounds known as chloropropanols, which is formed when fat and salt containing foods are processed at high temperatures. The Scientific Committee on Food has set a tolerable daily intake of 2 µg/kg of body weight, and has concluded that 3 -MCPD is a <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> for humans. HNE is a secondary lipid peroxidation product derived from the oxidation of n- 6 PUFA, namely linoleic acid. HHE is formed by the oxidation of n- 3 PUFA, namely docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic fatty acids. It is of utmost importance to increase the safety of fried products by improving vegetable oils quality and performance. Due to the importance of this subject, the European Commission and the European Food Safety Authority established it as a priority to investigate, and considered that validated, reliable and accurate analytical methods for the analysis and quantification of these toxic compounds in oils, as well as mitigation strategies for its formation are needed.

This toxicity of carcinogens is referred to as being [...] "non-threshold" [...] because there is believed to be essentially no level of exposure that does not pose some probability of producing a carcinogenic response, therefore, there is no dose that can be considered to be risk-free. However, some (<b>non-genotoxic)</b> <b>carcinogens</b> may exhibit a threshold whereby doses lower than the threshold do not invoke a carcinogenic response.|$|R

Suppression of {{apoptosis}} {{has been}} implicated {{as a mechanism}} for the hepatocarcinogenicity of the peroxisome proliferator class of <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> The ability of the peroxisome proliferator nafenopin to suppress or delay the onset of liver apoptosis was investigated using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and the Reuber hepatoma cell line FaO. 50 ~M nafenopin reversibly maintained the viability of primary rat hepatocyte cultures which otherwise degenerated within 8 d of establishment.

40|$|Abstract Tumorigenesis, {{a complex}} and multifactorial {{progressive}} process of transformation of normal cells into malignant cells, {{is characterized by the}} accumu-lation of multiple cancer-speci fi c heritable phenotypes triggered by the mutational and/or non-mutational (i. e., epigenetic) events. Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental and occupational exposures to natural substances, as well as man-made chemical and physical agents, play a causative role in human cancer. In a broad sense, carcinogenesis may be induced through either genotoxic or non-genotoxic mechanisms; however, both genotoxic and <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> also cause prominent epigenetic changes. This review presents current evidence of the epigenetic alterations induced by various chemical carcinogens, including arse-nic, 1, 3 -butadine, and pharmaceutical and biological agents, and highlights the potential for epigenetic changes to serve as markers for carcinogen exposure and cancer risk assessment. 11. ...|$|R
30|$|It must {{be assumed}} that PFOS and PFOA can {{function}} as agonists of PPARα. In in vitro experiments, PFOS activated PPARα [220, 221] and led to peroxisome proliferation, as had been previously shown only in studies on rodents [108, 222, 223]. The hepatotoxic effects of PFOA in studies on rodents may also have resulted from the activation of peroxisome proliferation [222 – 224]. This mechanism {{is more likely to}} apply to PFOA than to PFOS. In a study on rats, a concentration of 0.64 mg PFOA/kg BW/day and above was found to induce peroxisome proliferation, clearly illustrating the effect of PFOA as a PPARα agonist ([141] cited in EFSA [15]). The activation of PPARα leads to the expression of genes that are involved in lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, cell differentiation, and peroxisome proliferation [225]. This mechanism can result in tumor induction by <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens.</b>|$|R
40|$|Increased cell {{proliferation}} {{is a central}} key event {{in the mode of}} action for many <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> and quantitative {{cell proliferation}} data {{play an important role in}} the cancer risk assessment of many pharmaceutical and environmental compounds. Currently, there is limited unified information on assay standards, reference values, targeted applications, study design issues, and quality control considerations for proliferation data. Here, we review issues in measuring cell proliferation indices, considerations for targeted studies, and applications within current risk assessment frameworks. As the regulatory environment moves toward more prospective evaluations based on quantitative pathway-based models, standardization of proliferation assays will become an increasingly important part of cancer risk assessment. To help address this development, we also discuss the potential role for proliferation data as a component of alternative carcinogenicity testing models. This information should improve consistency of cell proliferation methods and increase efficiency of targeted testing strategies...|$|R

Here, we survey the examples and discuss possible mechanisms of hormetic effects with cytochrome P 450 inducers, such as phenobarbital, a-benzene hexachloride and 1, 1 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethane. Epigenetic processes differentially can be affected by agents that impinge on oxidative DNA damage, repair, apoptosis, cell proliferation, intracellular communication and cell signaling. <b>Non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> may target nuclear receptors and induce post-translational modifications at the protein level, thereby impacting on the stability or activity of key regulatory proteins, including oncoproteins and tumor suppressor proteins. We further discuss role of oxidative stress focusing on the low dose carcinogenicities of several genotoxic carcinogens such as a hepatocarcinogen contained in seared fish and meat, 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline, arsenic and its metabolites, and the kidney carcinogen potassium bromate...|$|R

Advantages of the assay are that SHE cells are metabolically competent, genetically stable and acquire spontaneous transformation with a low frequency; additionally, it detects both genotoxic and <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> However, in comparison with other short-term mammalian cell assays, it is time consuming, laborious and, most importantly, the visual scoring of morphological transformation might be subjective. In this review, we examine the background to the test and why {{it has the potential}} for use in safety risk assessment. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to objectively interrogate and classify SHE colonies using vibrational spectroscopy coupled to a mathematical framework for high-throughput screening. It is our view that this alternative approach has the potential to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the in vitro SHE assay...|$|R

The aims of this article are to review human bladder carcinogenesis and appraise the different in vitro and in vivo approaches {{that have been developed}} to study the process. The review considers how in vitro models based on normal human urothelial (NHU) cells can be applied to human bladder cancer research. We conclude that recent advances in NHU cell culture offer novel approaches for defining urothelial tissue-specific responses to genotoxic and <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> and elucidating the role of specific genes involved in the mechanisms of bladder carcinogenesis and malignant progression. Bladder cancer and carcinogenesis In developed countries, the majority (490 %) of bladder cancers are sporadic carcinomas that arise from the urothelium, the highly-specialized transitional epithelium that lines the urinary bladder.

40|$|In vitro cell {{transformation}} assays (CTAs) {{have been shown}} to model important stages of in vivo carcinogenesis and have the potential to predict carcinogenicity in humans. Advantages of CTAs are their ability of revealing both genotoxic and <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> while reducing both experimental costs and the number of animals used. The endpoint of the CTA is foci formation, and requires classification under light microscopy based on morphology. Thus current limitations for the wide adoption of the assay partially depend on a fair degree of subjectivity in foci scoring. An objective evaluation may be obtained after separating foci from background monolayer in the digital image, and quantifying values of statistical descriptors which are selected to capture eye-scored morphological features. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop statistical descriptors to be applied to transformed foci of BALB/c 3 T 3, which cover foci size, multilayering and invasive cell growth into the background monolayer. Proposed descriptors were applied to a database of 407 foci images to explore the numerical features, and to illustrate open problems and potential solutions. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|R

Here the performance of its gene classifier, derived from exposure of metabolically competent human HepaRG cells to prototypical non-carcinogens (10 compounds) and hepatocarcinogens (20 compounds), is reported. Analysis of the data at the gene and the pathway level by using independent biostatistical approaches showed a distinct separation of genotoxic from non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens and non-carcinogens (up to 88 % correct prediction). The most characteristic pathway responding to genotoxic exposure was DNA damage. Interlaboratory reproducibility was assessed by blindly testing of three compounds, from the set of 30 compounds, by three independent laboratories. Subsequent classification of these compounds resulted in correct prediction of the genotoxicants. As expected, results on the <b>non-genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> and the non-carcinogens were less predictive. In conclusion, the combination of transcriptomics with the HepaRG in vitro cell model provides a potential weight of evidence approach {{for the evaluation of}} the genotoxic potential of chemical substances.
