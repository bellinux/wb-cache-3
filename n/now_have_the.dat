5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

The public <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> chance to scrutinise a selection of the finds discovered at Hengistbury Head in the last century, and to interact with experienced staff, as well as providing them with the opportunity to become actively involved in the administration of the nature reserve.|$|E
5|$|James de Connick {{established}} the first breed {{standard for the}} French Spaniel in 1891. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we <b>now</b> <b>have.</b> <b>The</b> French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier {{as the president of the}} association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.|$|E
50|$|Putting this {{in plain}} English, S1 <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> {{property}} {{that it will}} have mast #2; and S2 <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> property that it did have mast #1. We can then say that S1 and S2 <b>have</b> all <b>the</b> same temporally-indexed properties. According to Leibniz's Law, therefore, they would be the same ship.|$|R

5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E

Brazilian universities <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity to develop nanoscale materials for drug delivery, he says, but ‘our domestic pharmaceutical companies don’t have internal capabilities in research and development, so we have to work with them to push new products and processes out to market’.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} {{completed}} {{and ready for}} revenue service and on September 29, 1872, the first regular passenger train left Frederick (corner of East & Eighth Street) for Westminster (where they <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Carroll County Cattle Show) with a round trip fare costing $1.35 ($=). At that time, no connection had been made with the B railroad {{to the south and}} no station had been built in Frederick but a local citizen wished the road success because it had been met with great opposition.|$|E

25|$|Until 2002, LAPD officers' {{standard}} issue pistol was the Beretta 92F/92FS. However, when William Bratton {{was appointed}} Chief of the LAPD, he allowed his officers {{to carry the}} Glock pistol, a weapon which the two previous departments he was chief at (the New York City Police Department and the Boston Police Department) carried. New officers graduating from the LAPD academy are now issued the Glock 22 or Glock 17 but can qualify {{in a variety of}} firearms. Officers <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> option to carry Smith & Wesson M models on- and off-duty.|$|E

The city of Minneapolis hosts hundreds of Somali-owned and operated businesses offering a variety of products, including leather shoes, jewelry and other fashion items, halal meat, and hawala or money transfer services.

25|$|In 2013, the Spanish Air Force retired its {{fleet of}} Mirage F1s, having {{progressively}} phased the type {{out of service}} as increasing numbers of the Eurofighter Typhoon had become available.

The deal went through and Argentina bought the Spanish Mirages in October 2013, but the deal was scrapped in March 2014 after pressure from the United Kingdom on Spain to not assist in FAA modernization over tensions between the countries over the Falkland Islands.|$|E

25|$|The Hindu {{personal}} laws of 1956 (applying to Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains) gave women {{rights to}} inheritances. However, sons had an independent {{share in the}} ancestral property, while the daughters' shares {{were based on the}} share received by their father. Hence, a father could effectively disinherit a daughter by renouncing his share of the ancestral property, but a son would continue to have a share in his own right. Additionally, married daughters, even those facing marital harassment, had no residential rights in the ancestral home. Thanks to amendment of the Hindu laws in 2005, women <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same status as men.|$|E

25|$|Initially, retail Xbox 360 games {{offered up}} to 1,000G {{spread over a}} {{variable}} number of Achievements, while each Xbox Live Arcade title contained 12 Achievements totaling 200G. On February 1, 2007, Microsoft announced on their Gamerscore Blog some new policies that developers must follow related to Gamerscore and Achievements in future releases. All regular disc-based games must have 1,000 Gamerscore points in the base game; the title can ship with fewer than 1,000 points, but anything added later must be free. Game developers also <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> option of adding up to 250 points via downloadable content every quarter {{after the first year}} of release (for a total of 1,750 points). Xbox Live Arcade titles also allow players to obtain Gamerscore, initially up to 200 Gamerscore with additional points up to 50 Gamerscore via downloadable content (for a total of 250 points), but some XBLA games now contain up to 400 Gamerscore without DLC.|$|E
