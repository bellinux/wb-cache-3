5|$|The {{characters}} in Korkoro {{are drawn from}} Sigot's anecdote. The film traces the Romani familias life during the war, from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel but also being rejected by others when they stay in one place, to their arrest, incarceration, liberation {{with the help of}} a local French mayor and a <b>notary,</b> their struggle to live in a non-nomadic way, and then final arrest before being sent to the Death Camps. The character Théodore Rosier is based on the <b>notary</b> in the anecdote. The other Juste character, Lise Lundi, is based on Yvette Lundy and an old teacher of Gatlif's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a communist and an aide with the Front de Libération Nationale (National Liberation Front).|$|E
5|$|Brown carried several {{government}} appointments. In {{addition to}} <b>notary</b> public, {{he was appointed}} in 1877 to a three-person Board of Appraisers of Lands, and in 1879 as an Agent to Take Acknowledgments to Instruments. He would later resign all three appointments in 1887, to be {{in compliance with the}} 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The Hôtel d'Alluye is a hôtel particulier in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, France.

5|$|Born out {{of wedlock}} to a <b>notary,</b> Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci {{in the region of}} Florence, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice, and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by Francis I of France.|$|E
5|$|During the Paris {{exposition}} in May 1910, Gaudí spent {{a holiday}} in Vic, where he designed two basalt lampposts and wrought iron for the Plaça Major of Vic {{in honor of}} Jaume Balmes's centenary.

Due to ill health he prepared a will at the office of the <b>notary</b> Ramon Cantó i Figueres on 9 June, but later completely recovered.|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales {{there are}} two main classes of <b>notaries</b> - general <b>notaries</b> and scrivener <b>notaries.</b> Their {{functions}} are almost identical. All <b>notaries,</b> like solicitors, barristers, legal executives, costs lawyers and licensed conveyancers, are also commissioners for oaths. They also acquire the same powers as solicitors and other law practitioners, {{with the exception of the}} right to represent others before the courts (unless also members of the bar or admitted as a solicitor) once they are commissioned <b>notaries.</b> In practice almost all English <b>notaries,</b> and all Scottish ones, are also solicitors, and usually practise as solicitors.|$|R

5000|$|In {{practice}} {{the need for}} <b>notaries</b> in purely English legal matters is very small; for example they {{are not involved in}} normal property transactions. Since a great many solicitors also perform the function of commissioners for oaths and can witness routine declarations etc. (all are qualified to do so, but not all offer the service), most work performed by <b>notaries</b> relates to international matters in some way. They witness or authenticate documents to be used abroad. Many English <b>notaries</b> have strong foreign language skills and often a foreign legal qualification. The work of <b>notaries</b> and solicitors in England is separate although most <b>notaries</b> are solicitors. The <b>Notaries</b> Society gives the number of <b>notaries</b> in England and Wales as [...] "about 1,000," [...] all but seventy of whom are solicitors.|$|R

The police further have duties related to civilian court cases, such as writ of execution, evaluation of natural damage, assisting the courts after bankruptcies and functioning as a <b>notary</b> public.|$|E
5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The <b>notary</b> Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E
50|$|It is {{usual for}} Australian <b>notaries</b> {{to use an}} {{embossed}} seal with a red wafer, and now some <b>Notaries</b> also use an inked stamp replicating the seal. It is also common for the seal or stamp to include the <b>notary's</b> chosen logo or symbol.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, <b>notary</b> public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to be a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E
5|$|Pascu was {{a native}} of Agnita (at the time part of Braşov Region, now in Sibiu County), where he {{graduated}} from primary school. He was born to an ethnic Romanian father and a half-Hungarian mother; on his mother's side, he was also the descendant of Poles and Slovaks. His mother was a Roman Catholic and his father, like Gyuri, was a Romanian Orthodox. His name reflects his complex heritage: Ioan was chosen as his Romanian name; his second name was the Hungarian Gyurika, but it was recorded as Ghiurico in his birth certificate and personal documents ever since—as Pascu later indicated, this was because neither his father nor the <b>notary</b> were familiar with Hungarian phonology. Pascu, who was fluent in the Hungarian language, preferred the hypocoristic Gyuri.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Hawaii, Brown was {{licensed}} to practice law before the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 28, 1875. He was appointed a <b>notary</b> public for Oahu on July 27, 1875 by King Kalākaua. Starting a private practice, he was representing clients in circuit court {{by the end of}} 1875, and in the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii by 1876. Despite his future political and business careers, Brown continued the private practice of law (mainly probate) for the duration of his life. On at least eight occasions between 1893 and 1901, Brown sat on the bench of the Supreme Court of Hawaii as an Acting Justice.|$|E
50|$|The Custom of Paris {{contained}} four titles regarding {{debt collection}} and commercial transactions that were {{greatly influenced by}} the canon-law ban on interest-bearing loans. For instance, {{with the exception of}} rentcharges that allowed interest, <b>notaries</b> were forbidden to include interest charges within their contracts. <b>Notaries</b> {{played a significant role in}} the French legal tradition, as opposed to English practice; <b>notaries</b> drew up most agreements and served as mediators. Performing the function of magistrates in non-contentious matters, <b>notaries</b> facilitated amicable settlements through transactions, accords and désistements. Most of a <b>notary's</b> work concerned property law, primarily in the areas of conveyancing, inheritance, indebtedness, and investment.|$|R
50|$|The <b>notaries</b> (tabelliones) {{appeared}} in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law <b>notaries,</b> they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts. They were ubiquitous and most villages had one. In Roman times, <b>notaries</b> were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jurisconsults. Roman <b>notaries</b> were not law-trained; they were barely literate hacks who wrapped the simplest transactions in mountains of legal jargon, since they were paid by the line.|$|R

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine <b>notary,</b> in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of each wing have separate uses. In {{the west wing}} is the baptistry, in the north is the main altar, the main entrance and a <b>notary</b> area, separated by inside corner walls made of chiluca stone and tezontle. Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames the doors and windows. At the crossing of the structure is an octagonal dome framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet {{at the top of}} the dome. The principal altar is in the ornate Churrigueresque style and crafted by indigenous artist Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. It was inaugurated in 1829.|$|E
5|$|Under Louis XII the courtesans of France {{settled in}} Blois from 1498 to 1515, {{and the city}} became {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of France. As a result, many people {{purchased}} residences in Blois and the Loire Valley. Named after Robertet's barony of Alluyes, construction of the Hôtel d'Alluye began in 1498 or 1500 and was completed in 1508. It was built during his tenure as secretary and <b>notary</b> to Louis XII, and a diplomatic document from the Republic of Florence described the hôtel as new in September 1508. The hôtel particulier is an example of French Renaissance architecture; this, coupled with its ornamentation, were intended to reflect the tastes of Robertet, who was well known for his artistic collections. One of the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Blois, the hôtel indicates the influence of the Quattrocento on him.|$|E
