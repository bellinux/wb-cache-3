5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though <b>nephrectomy</b> is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial <b>nephrectomy.</b> Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E
25|$|The {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} renal cell {{cancer may be}} <b>nephrectomy</b> or partial <b>nephrectomy,</b> surgical removal of {{all or part of}} the kidney. This may include some of the surrounding organs or tissues or lymph nodes. If cancer is only in the kidneys, which is about 60% of cases, it can be cured roughly 90% of the time with surgery.|$|E
25|$|Many ADPKD {{patients}} suffer symptomatic sequelae {{in consequence}} of the disease, such as cyst hemorrhage, flank pain, recurrent infections, nephrolithiasis, and symptoms of mass effect (i.e., early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal discomfort), from their enlarged kidneys. In such cases, <b>nephrectomy</b> can be required due to intractable symptoms or when, {{in the course of}} preparing for renal transplantation, the native kidneys are found to impinge upon the true pelvis and preclude the placement of a donor allograft. Additionally, native <b>nephrectomy</b> may be undertaken in the presence of suspected malignancy, as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is 2 to 3 times more likely in the ADPKD population in end stage renal disease (ESRD) than in the ESRD patients without ADPKD. Although the indications for <b>nephrectomy</b> in ADPKD may be related to kidney size, the decision to proceed with native <b>nephrectomy</b> is often undertaken on an individual basis, without specific reference to kidney size measurements.|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of bilateral enhancing renal masses can be technically challenging. Simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic <b>nephrectomies</b> in postrenal transplant patients have been previously described, but these typically require multiple port placements {{in addition to}} a hand port.

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} our experience in the retroperitoneal laparoscopic approach in total and partial <b>nephrectomies</b> in children. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 41 patients who underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic total or partial <b>nephrectomies</b> performed in our center from 2004 to 2012. We looked at the demographic data, age at surgery, indication, operative time, surgical complications, conversion to open surgery and operative complications. Results: Thirty-five total and six partial <b>nephrectomies</b> (upper pole) were performed. The mean age was 84 months (7 - 175). Vesicoureteric reflux, pelviureteric junction obstruction, and multicystic dysplastic kidney disease were the main underlying pathologies. The mean operative time was 158 min (60 - 280). There were no intraoperative complications (surgical and anesthetic), and no significant blood loss was observed. Conversion to open surgery was necessary in two cases caused by failure to progress due to difficult anatomy during the partial <b>nephrectomies.</b> No major postoperative complications were noted. The mean hospital stay was 2. 5 days (1 - 5). A drain was used in 12 cases and was removed after a mean of 2 days. Conclusions: Laparoscopic retroperitoneoscopic renal surgery {{can be carried out}} safely and effectively in children. Still, this procedure is more challenging and requires an excellent image of the retroperitoneal space, especially when partial <b>nephrectomies</b> are concerned...|$|R
25|$|The acute form of SMA {{syndrome}} develops rapidly after traumatic {{incidents that}} forcibly hyper-extend the SMA across the duodenum, inducing the obstruction, or sudden weight loss for any reason. Causes include prolonged supine bed rest, scoliosis surgery, left <b>nephrectomy,</b> ileo-anal pouch surgery.|$|E
25|$|Surgery for {{metastatic disease}}: If metastatic disease is present {{surgical}} treatment may still a viable option. Radical and partial <b>nephrectomy</b> can still occur, {{and in some}} cases if the metastasis is small this can also be surgically removed. This depends on what stage of growth and how far the disease has spread.|$|E
25|$|Chronic pain in {{patients}} with ADPKD is often refractory to conservative, non-invasive treatments, but non-opioid analgesics and conservative interventions can be first used before opioid analgesics are considered; if pain continues, then surgical interventions can target renal or hepatic cysts in order to directly address the cause of pain, with surgical options including renal cyst decortication, renal denervation, and <b>nephrectomy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Renal artery {{pseudoaneurysm}} (RAP) is {{a well-known}} and life-threatening complication of partial <b>nephrectomies.</b> Angioembolization is the preferred intervention, allowing for visualization, diagnosis, and treatment in 96 % of cases. We report {{a case of a}} pseudoaneurysm that was difficult to diagnose even with optimal technique, requiring repeat imaging and additional angiographic intervention. Our case shows that RAP after partial <b>nephrectomies</b> may be difficult to diagnose even with high suspicion and appropriate technique. Repeat angiography may be required. Urologists and interventional radiologists together must keep RAP high on the differential even after a negative angiogram to adequately diagnose and treat symptomatic patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Carbon dioxide {{pneumothorax}} {{is a rare}} complication in laparoscopic urology, {{but with}} {{the widespread use of}} laparoscopy and the increasing surgical pathologies managed by this technique this infrequent complication has become a potential risk. Materials and Methods: A total of 786 laparoscopic transperitoneal urologic operations were reviewed at our institution. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon and included 213 adrenalectomies, 181 simple <b>nephrectomies,</b> 143 lymphadenectomies, 118 radical <b>nephrectomies,</b> 107 partial <b>nephrectomies</b> and 24 nephroureterectomies. Mean patient age was 53. 2 years (range 24 to 70). Mean BMI was 28. 15 Kg/m 2 (range 20 to 48. 9). Results: A total of 6 cases (0. 7 %) of diaphragmatic injury were found. All reported patients had additional factors that may have contributed to diaphragmatic injury. Diaphragmatic repair was always carried out by intracorporeal suturing and only one case required chest tube placement. All patients evolved uneventfully. Conclusions: Repair of diaphragmatic injuries should always be attempted with intracorporeal suture since this is a feasible, reproducible and reliable technique...|$|R
40|$|Background. Chemokines are {{involved}} in the recruitment of leukocytes to vascularized allografts. CCR 1 is a receptor for various proinflammatory chemokines and CCR 1 blockade reduces renal allograft injury in rabbits. The {{purpose of the study was}} to characterize CCR 1 -positive cells in human renal allografts. Methods. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded allograft <b>nephrectomies</b> (n 9) and non-involved parts of tumour <b>nephrectomies</b> (n 10) were studied. Immunohistochemistry for CCR 1, CD 3 and CD 68 was performed on consecutive sections. Double immunofluorescence for CCR 1 and CD 3, CD 20, CD 68, DC-SIGN and S 100 was used on selected cases. Expression of CCR 1 mRNA and the ligands CCL...|$|R
25|$|Kidney {{disease is}} an {{abnormal}} structure, function or {{process in the}} kidney(s). Nephrosis is non-inflammatory nephropathy and nephritis is inflammatory kidney disease. Nephrology is the speciality that deals with kidney function and disease. Medical terms related to the kidneys commonly use terms such as renal and the prefix nephro-. The adjective renal, meaning related to the kidney, is from the Latin rēnēs, meaning kidneys; the prefix nephro- is from the Ancient Greek word for kidney, nephros (νεφρός). For example, surgical removal of the kidney is a <b>nephrectomy,</b> while a reduction in kidney function is called renal dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the only}} clinical/pharmacological {{treatment}} available for ADPKD consists {{in reducing the}} speed in gain of total kidney volume (TKV) with aquaretics (i.e. tolvaptan), which can alleviate pain while giving the patients {{a better quality of}} life for over a mean of 3 years. After this period, patients can restart gaining TKV at pre-treatment rates and may eventually have to go through dialysis and kidney transplant. Paliative treatment modalities involve symptomatic medications (non-opioid and opioid analgesics) for abdominal/retroperitoneal pain. Before the advent of aquaretic medication, the only option for analgesic-resistant pain were simple or complex surgical procedures (i.e. renal cyst aspiration, cyst decortication, renal denervation and <b>nephrectomy),</b> which can result in complications inherent to surgery.|$|E
25|$|Taken as a whole, if {{the disease}} {{is limited to the}} kidney, only 20–30% develop metastatic disease after <b>nephrectomy.</b> More {{specific}} subsets show a five-year survival rate of around 90–95% for tumors less than 4cm. For larger tumors confined to the kidney without venous invasion, survival is still relatively good at 80–85%. For tumors that extend through the renal capsule and out of the local fascial investments, the survivability reduces to near 60%. Factors as general health and fitness or the severity of their symptoms impact the survival rates. For instance, younger people (among 20–40 years old) have a better outcome despite having more symptoms at presentation, possibly due to lower rates spread of cancer to the lymph nodes (stage III).|$|E

2500|$|Small renal tumors (< 4nbsp&cm) {{are treated}} {{increasingly}} by partial <b>nephrectomy</b> when possible. Most {{of these small}} renal masses manifest indolent biological behavior with excellent prognosis. Nephron-sparing partial <b>nephrectomy</b> is used when the tumor is small (less than 4nbsp&cm in diameter) or when the patient has other medical concerns such as diabetes or hypertension. The partial <b>nephrectomy</b> involves {{the removal of the}} affected tissue only, sparing the rest of the kidney, Gerota's fascia and the regional lymph nodes. This allows for more renal preservation as compared to the radical <b>nephrectomy,</b> and this can have positive long term health benefits.

40|$|PURPOSE: Although {{laparoscopy}} {{is considered}} the mainstay for most renal procedures in adults, {{its role in the}} pediatric population is still controversial, especially for smaller children. We reviewed our experience in pediatric renal laparoscopic surgery in three pediatric age groups in an attempt to identify if age has an impact on feasibility and surgical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 1995 to May 2006, 144 pediatric laparoscopic renal procedures were performed at our institution. The charts of these patients were reviewed for demographic data, urologic pathology and surgical procedure, as well as perioperative complications and post-operative outcomes. The findings were stratified into 3 groups, according to patient age (A: < 1 year, B: 1 to 5 years and C: 6 - 18 years). RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 4. 2 years (42 days - 18 years). We performed 54 <b>nephrectomies,</b> 33 nephroureterectomies, 19 upper pole <b>nephrectomies,</b> 11 radical <b>nephrectomies,</b> 22 pyeloplasties and 4 miscellaneous procedures. The 3 age groups were comparable in terms of the procedures performed. Conversion rates were 0 %, 1. 4 % and 1. 9 % for groups A, B and C, respectively (p = 0. 72). Incidence of perioperative complications was 5 %, 8. 2 % and 7. 8 % for age groups A to C, respectively (p = 0. 88). CONCLUSIONS: Most renal procedures can be performed safely by laparoscopy in the pediatric population, with excellent aesthetic and functional outcomes. The morbidity related to the procedure was minimal irrespective of the age group...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: During {{the last}} 10 years {{laparoscopy}} {{has been applied}} to treat most urological pathology including malignancies. There has been concern regarding peritoneal dissemination and port site metastases. We undertook a survey to assess the incidence of this occurrence. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 international urology departments with experts in laparoscopic urological surgery were contacted for this study. Each site was asked to complete a 2 -page survey regarding the volume of laparoscopic urological procedures and port site recurrences. Results: Nineteen sites elected to participate. A total of 18, 750 laparoscopic procedures were performed, of which 10, 912 were for cancer. These included 2, 604 radical <b>nephrectomies,</b> 559 nephroureterectomies, 555 partial <b>nephrectomies,</b> 27 segmental ureterectomies, 3, 665 radical prostatectomies, 1, 869 pelvic lymph node dissections, 479 retroperitoneal lymph node dissections, 336 adrenalectomies and 108 procedures listed as other. Tumor seeding was reported in 13 cases (0. 1 %), including 3 nephroureterectomies for transitional cell carcinoma, 4 <b>nephrectomies</b> (incidental transitional cell carcinoma), 4 adrenalectomies for metastases, 1 retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer and 1 pelvic lymph node dissection for cancer of the penis. Port seeding occurred in 10 cases (0. 09 %) and peritoneal spread in 3 cases (0. 03 %). Conclusions: The incidence of tumor seeding after laparoscopic oncological surgery is rare and does not appear greater than what has been historically reported for open surgery. Tumor seeding seems to be most commonly related to the removal of high grade tumors and deviation from oncological surgical principles...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{our initial}} {{experience with the}} second-generation Single Port Instrument Delivery Extended Reach (SPIDER) laparoendoscopic single-site surgical system in a porcine model. Materials and Methods: In four swine weighing approximately 32 to 35 kg, five <b>nephrectomies,</b> four adrenalectomies, three pyeloplasties, and three partial cystectomies and closures were performed by a single surgeon. The swine {{were placed in the}} lateral flank position under general anesthesia. The SPIDER surgical system was introduced through a single incision and the various urological procures were performed by use of flexible instrumentation. Results: All five <b>nephrectomies,</b> four adrenalectomies, three pyeloplasties, and three partial cystectomies and closures were performed successfully without additional skin incisions. The mean time to set up the SPIDER platform was 3. 5 minutes. The mean operative time for the right and left <b>nephrectomies</b> was 45. 4 minutes and 47. 8 minutes, respectively. The mean operative time for the right and left adrenalectomies was 37. 6 minutes and 35. 4 minutes, respectively. The mean operative time for the pyeloplasties for one right and two left ureters was 45. 6 minutes and 47. 3 minutes, respectively. The mean operative time for the partial cystectomies and closures was 18. 6 minutes. There were no noticeable intraoperative complications except for minimal urine leakage in the first pyeloplasty. Conclusions: In this initial pilot evaluation, the second-generation SPIDER surgical system offered intuitive instrument maneuverability and restored triangulation.
