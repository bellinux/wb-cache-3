25|$|Health Canada has not {{developed}} advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, {{they suggest that}} daily caffeine intake for this age group {{be no more than}} 2.5mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> for light weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without suffering adverse effects.|$|E

In relation to renal cancer staging, the Heidelberg classification system of renal tumours was introduced in 1976 as a means of more completely correlating the histopathological features with the identified genetic defects.|$|E

The Court opined that even if at a particular point in time the Prime Minister felt that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> to call for an election to fill a vacancy, he would still be compelled to review the circumstances from time to time and call one if and when the circumstances changed.|$|E

25|$|Knox’s {{appointment}} at Ellis Island {{allowed him to}} make what was his most significant contribution to medical science. Early in their time at Ellis Island, both Knox and his colleague, Glueck recognized two issues with using the Binet and Simon scales to measure intelligence in emigrants. First, the scale tested semantic knowledge that was specific to geographic location or culture. Individuals from other cultures might not fare well on these tests, and thus the measures could inaccurately classify them as mentally defective, when tests specific to their own location or culture would not. Further, the normative data used for comparing any individual score to an “average” individual {{of the same age}} was based on French or American schoolchildren, which would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> for determining mental fitness for entering the United States.|$|E

30|$|The wide {{deployment}} of web cache sharing is currently hindered by the overhead of the Internet Cache Protocol (ICP) [40]. This protocol discovers cache hits in other proxies {{by having the}} proxy multicasting a query message to the neighboring caches whenever a cache miss occurs. When the number of proxies increases, both the total communication and the total CPU processing overhead increase quadratically. For this reason, this protocol could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriated</b> when we work on spontaneous networks, due to their limitations.|$|R
25|$|For many {{patients}} with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> and patients will undergo surveillance instead. The form this surveillance takes, e.g. {{the type and}} frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, {{will depend on the}} type of cancer (non-seminoma or seminoma), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the {{many patients}} who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with metastases (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given to the patients that need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative “adjuvant” treatments, but the patients {{have to be prepared to}} follow a prolonged series of visits and tests.|$|E
25|$|The University of Essex {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the efficacy of including the Wii in an established falls prevention training program to improve balance, mobility, and educate recovery from the instance of a fall. After a 7-week falls prevention training, {{the results indicated that}} Wii can positively support a standard rehabilitation, although the use of the game alone would not be encouraged. On the other hand, participants found the experience of Wii game as enjoyable, which can support patients engagement to training. A follow up longitudinal study would be needed to conclude if the incidence of falls can be reduced along time. Extending this study, another research conducted by the same University of Essex found that training with Wii can imply on mood and self-esteem. This behavior was observed in women who participated in this last mentioned research for fall prevention. As said by investigators, it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> to generalize, however one participant who had the biggest improvement on the functional measures had the largest positive changes in well-being, which may indicate that the use of the Wii as an adjunct to standard falls prevention training can improve not only functional but also psychological outcomes.|$|E
