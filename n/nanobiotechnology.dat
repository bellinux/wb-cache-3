2500|$|One area of {{research}} featuring <b>nanobiotechnology</b> is the extracellular matrices of cells (ECM). The ECM is primarily composed of interwoven fibers of collagen and elastin that have diameters ranging from 10–300nm.

Until recently it has been nearly impossible to study the physical forces that help cells maintain their functionality, but <b>nanobiotechnology</b> has given us the ability to learn more about these interactions. Using the unique properties of nanoparticles, it is possible to control how the nanoparticles adhere to certain patterns present in the ECM, and as a result can understand how changes in the ECM's shape can affect cell functionality.|$|E

40|$|Although toxicologic effects {{need to be}} {{considered}} at the organ-ismal level, the adverse events originate from interactions and alterations at the molecular level.

In order to properly assess alterations at these dimensions, nanofabricated tools are needed to detect, separate, analyze, and manipulate cells or biologic molecules of interest. The emergence of laser tweezers, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), laser capture microdissection (LCM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and multi-photon microscopes have allowed for these assessments.

[...] The tweezers can affect the binding of a substrate to the ECM by attempting to draw the substrate away from it. [...] The light emitted from the tweezers was used to restrain ECM-coated microbeads, and the changes in the force exerted by the ECM onto the substrate were studied by modulating the effect of the optical tweezers. [...] Experiments showed that the force exerted by the ECM on the substrate positively correlated with the force of the tweezers, which led to the subsequent discovery that the ECM and the transmembrane proteins are able to sense external forces, and can adapt to overcome these forces.|$|E

MRI can be applied in the medical field to visualize structures; atomic force microscopy (AFM) that gives a topographic view [...] of the sample on a substrate; transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that gives a top view, but with a different technique then that of atomic force microscopy; Raman spectroscopy or surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) gives information about wavelengths and energy in the sample. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) measures the wavelengths where light is absorbed; X-ray diffraction (XRD) generally gives an idea of the chemical composition of the sample.|$|E

40|$|Proteins undergo {{unfolding}} when {{lowering the}} temperature {{by means of}} a process known as cold denaturation. Pure cold denaturation (without using denaturants) is obtained when applying high pressures. In this paper we describe in detail a recent proposal to explain the cold denaturation process based on the high density liquid state of water [1]. Above the pressure where water freezes to the dense ice phase, the mechanism for cold denaturation with decreasing pressure temperature is the loss of local low density water structure. This proposal has been tested by means of multicanonical simulations of a protein model in a water bath and has been compared with experimental results of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A [1]. The correct understanding of this process may be useful to artificially implement activation and inactivation of a protein at low temperatures.

In this context, the follow-up of colloidal stability and other physico-chemical features is of foremost relevance. In this contribution, we have focused our study on hybrid colloids based on biomimetic nanocrystalline apatites (analogous {{to those found in}} bone mineral) stabilized by adsorption of 2 aminoethylphosphate (AEP) molecules; these nanoparticles being intended to interact with cancer cells either for medical imaging (by conferring luminescence features to the apatite phase) or for therapeutic purposes. We show that various physico-chemical characteristics of the suspensions vary with time, including viscosity and mean particle size, suggesting a progressive structuration of the suspensions. Similar modifications were also noticed during the purification by dialysis. Finally,we report on preliminary experiments aimed at drying the colloids while retaining their capacity to recover their initial state after re-immersion in aqueous medium; so as to enable extended storage periods for the nanoparticles in their dry state while allowing their re-suspension at the time of use. On this matter, the addition of glucose prior to freeze-drying was found to be an effective way to avoid the formation of aggregates during drying.

40|$|International audienceAmphotericin B (AMB) {{has long}} been {{considered}} the most effective drug {{in the treatment of}} serious invasive fungal infections. There are, however, major limitations to its use, due to several adverse effects, including acute infusional reactions and, most relevant, a dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. At least some of these effects are attributed to the aggregation of AMB {{as a result of its}} poor water solubility. To overcome this problem, reformulated versions of the drug have been developed, including a micellar dispersion of AMB with sodium deoxycholate (AMBD), its encapsulation into liposomes, or its incorporation into lipidic complexes. The development of <b>nanobiotechnologies</b> provides novel potential drug delivery systems that make use of nanomaterials such as functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs), which are emerging as an innovative and efficient tool for the transport and cellular translocation of therapeutic molecules. In this study, we prepared two conjugates between f-CNTs and AMB. The antifungal activity of these conjugates was tested against a collection of reference and clinical fungal strains, in comparison to that of AMB alone or AMBD. Measured minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values for f-CNT-AMB conjugates were either comparable to or better than those displayed by AMB and AMBD. Furthermore, AMBD-resistant Candida strains were found to be susceptible to f-CNT-AMB 1. Additional studies, aimed at understanding the mechanism of action of the conjugates, suggest a nonlytic mechanism, since the compounds show a major permeabilizing effect on the tested fungal strains only after extended incubation.

Numerous treatment strategies have been developed in an attempt to control diabetics vascular diseases and in particular to speed the healing process, including the use of topical growth factors, living human skin equivalents, hyperbaric oxygen, electrical stimulation. Prostaglandins are cyclic, oxygenated fatty acids that exert different functions in many organs. Recently diabetic patients have been treated with PGE 1 delivered by liposome, made with phosphatidylcholine and Poly-L-lysine, containing carnitine, with good clinical results. The ability of the liposome to antagonize the effects of the damage induced by diabetes was tested in diabetic rats. The diabetes in the rats was induced by streptozotocin injection (70 mg/Kg), and then 1 µg/kg of liposome was injected ip. twice a week, for three months.

The present work examined the protective effect of 25 Mg-PMC 16 nanoparticle (porphyrin adducts of cyclohexil fullerene-C 60) in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ) -induced DN. 25 Mg-PMC 16 (0. 5 lethal dose 50 [LD 50]) was administered intravenously in two consecutive days before intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg/kg). 24 Mg-PMC 16 and MgCl 2 {{were used as}} controls. Blood 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -DPG), oxidative stress biomarkers, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were determined as biomarkers of DN. Results indicated that 2, 3 -DPG and ATP decreased whereas oxidative stress increased by induction of DN which all were improved in 25 Mg-PMC 16 -treated animals. No significant changes were observed by administration of 24 Mg-PMC 16 or MgCl 2 in DN rats.

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} was to study the influence of citrate and sulfate of copper on the biomass composition of the mycelium of the medicinal mushroom Trametes versicolor (L.) Lloyd, (1920) cultivated in a liquid medium. The studied strain of Trametes versicolor 353 {{was obtained from the}} Culture Collection of Mushrooms (IBK) from M. G. Kholodny Institute of Botany, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Copper citrate was obtained from the Institute of <b>Nanobiotechnologies</b> and Resource Conservation of Ukraine, Kyiv. In this study we used glucose-peptone-yeast extract medium. Cu 2 + (sulfate or citrate form) was added to the medium in concentration 4 mg/L. Mycelium was grown in a submerged culture on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 26 °C in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 50 ml of liquid media. The biomass was harvested after 9 days of cultivation in the liquid medium, filtered, washed, dried to a constant weight at 105 °C and weighed. Total nitrogen content (Ntotal) in the mycelium determined by the Kjeldahl method, crude protein content was determined as Ntotal x 6. 25. The ash was obtained by the standard method. Total lipids were extracted from undried mycelium by a modified method of Bligh and Dyer. Amino acid composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography Agilent 1200 (Agilent technologies, USA). The methyl ethers of fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) Agilent 6890 N/ 5973 inert. The results of {{our research}} demonstrated that sulfates and citrates of copper increased the amount of crude protein on the mycelium of T. versicolor 353. Also both form of copper increased the amount of ash by a third relative to the control medium. At the same time, both forms of copper reduced the amount of total carbohydrates on mycelial biomass. But copper sulfate reduced the amount of total lipids relative to the control medium and medium with copper citrate. It should be noted, that given the significant growth of biomass in both cases, the yield of the same biomass compounds (gram per liter of medium) was raised relative to the control medium. So the yield of total carbohydrates was increased by 72 % (on the medium with copper citrate) and 43 % (on the medium with copper sulfate) relative to the control medium. The yield of crude protein was raised by 94 % (on the medium with copper citrate) and 63 % (on the medium with copper sulfate) relative to the control medium. Assay of amino acid composition showed that the quality of crude protein didn’t change. Thus the yield of essential amino acids was increased in conjunction with the yield of crude protein. The yield of total lipids increased only on the medium with copper citrate (by 57 %) and in this case the content of fatty acids was unchanged significantly relative to the control medium. But sulfate of copper decreased the amount of cis-linoleic acids by 7 %, in return the amount of oleic acid was increased relative to the control medium without copper...|$|R
