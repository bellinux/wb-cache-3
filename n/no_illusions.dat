He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded {{he could not}} win, and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> he would win his race. He had hoped to send his cabinet officers {{out on the campaign}} trail, but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him.|$|E

The next year he initiated efforts to emigrate to the United States, {{but was unable to}} make arrangements to receive a research fellowship. On 26 January 1942, Felix Hausdorff, along with his wife and his sister-in-law, committed suicide by taking an overdose of veronal, rather than comply with German orders to move to the Endenich camp, and there suffer the likely implications, about which he held <b>no</b> <b>illusions.</b>|$|E

He was active in {{his support for the}} British stay-behind troops, but had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> about their failure to protect Malaya against the Japanese.

40|$|In Batty (2010 b), I {{argue that}} there are <b>no</b> {{olfactory}} <b>illusions.</b> Central to the traditional notions of illusion and hallucination is a notion of object-failure—the failure of an experience to represent particular objects. Because there are no presented objects {{in the case of}} olfactory experience, I argue that the traditional ways of categorizing non-veridical experience do not apply to the olfactory case. In their place, I propose a novel notion of non-veridical experience for the olfactory case. In his (2011), Stevenson responds to my claim that there are <b>no</b> olfactory <b>illusions.</b> Although he agrees that it is natural—or at least commonplace—to think there are <b>no</b> olfactory <b>illusions,</b> he argues that there are and provides examples of them, many of which he suggests have analogs in the visual and auditory domains. In this paper, I examine the nature of the disagreement between us. I argue that Stevenson fails to argue against my conclusion that there are <b>no</b> olfactory <b>illusions...</b>|$|R

[...] H. L. Mencken in 1925 deemed Borah [...] "the Great Sham", and the one most responsible for stopping reform in its tracks. Harold L. Ickes wrote, most likely after the 1928 campaign, that progressives in the Senate, with <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> left about Borah, called him [...] "our spearless leader". Theodore Roosevelt described Borah as [...] "entirely insincere", an insurgent whose chief talent was to [...] "insurge".|$|E
500|$|Pearson and his Liberals faltered {{badly in}} the campaign. The Liberal Party leader {{tried to make}} an issue {{of the fact that}} Diefenbaker had called a winter election, {{generally}} disfavoured in Canada due to travel difficulties. Pearson's objection cut little ice with voters, and served only to remind the electorate that the Liberals, at their convention, had called for an election. Pearson mocked Diefenbaker's northern plans as [...] "igloo-to-igloo" [...] communications, and was assailed by the Prime Minister for being condescending. The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls when he was done. By election day, Pearson had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> that he might win the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats. The Liberals would be limited to less than half of that.|$|E

500|$|At {{his meeting}} with Mulgrave, Cochrane was asked to explain a plan of attack on Basque Roads which he had drawn up some years previously. Cochrane enthusiastically {{described}} his intention to use fireships and massive floating bombs to destroy a fleet anchored in the roads. When he had finished, Mulgrave announced that the plan was going ahead and that Cochrane was to command it. Cochrane was in poor health, and under <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> about Mulgrave's intentions: should the attack fail Cochrane would be blamed and his political career damaged. In addition, Cochrane was also {{well aware of the}} fury this decision would provoke in the naval hierarchy; the appointment of a relatively junior officer in command of such an important operation was calculated to cause offense. Cochrane refused, even though Mulgrave pleaded that he had been the only officer to present a practical plan for attacking Allemand's fleet. Again Cochrane refused the command, but the following day Mulgrave issued a direct order: [...] "My Lord you must go. The board cannot listen to further refusal or delay.

500|$|Catherine {{was unable}} to control Henry {{in the way she}} had Francis and Charles. Her role in his {{government}} became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: [...] "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner." [...] She was under <b>no</b> <b>illusions,</b> however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, [...] "You are {{on the eve of a}} general revolt.

500|$|In October Robert Dudley {{returned}} to court, many believed, [...] "in great hope {{to marry the}} Queen". Elizabeth's affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown [...] "the matter … to be contrary to which was reported" [...] and to [...] "neither touch his honesty nor her honour." [...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> about his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; and I wish he had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me." [...] In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.|$|E

500|$|I Corps assumed {{responsibility}} for the front in Cyrenaica on 15 February 1941, but within days Blamey was informed that his troops would be sent on the expedition to Greece. Blamey has been criticised for allowing this when {{he knew it was}} extremely hazardous, after he was told that Menzies had approved. He insisted, however, on sending the veteran 6th Division first instead of the 7th Division, resulting in a heated argument with Wavell, which Blamey won. He was under <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> about the odds of success, and immediately prepared plans for an evacuation. His foresight and determination saved many of his men, but he lost credibility when he chose his son Tom to fill the one remaining seat on the aircraft carrying him out of Greece. The campaign exposed deficiencies in the Australian Army's training, leadership and staff work that had passed unnoticed or had not been addressed in the Libyan Campaign. The pressure of the campaign opened a rift between Blamey and Rowell, which was to have important consequences. While Rowell and Brigadier William Bridgeford were extremely critical of Blamey's performance in Greece, this opinion was not widely held. Wavell reported that [...] "Blamey has shown himself a fine fighting commander in these operations and fitted for high command." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} turned personal {{during the}} second of two debates between the two candidates when McConnell charged that the Iroquois Hunt Club, to which Beshear belonged, had no African-American members and was racially discriminatory. Beshear denied that the club was discriminatory and fired back that a prominent McConnell supporter from Louisville was [...] "virulently anti-women." [...] McConnell countered that Beshear had taken money from a labor union group that was under investigation for links to organized crime. After the debate, {{it was revealed that}} the Pendennis Club, of which McConnell had been a member, was under investigation for discriminatory membership practices; McConnell claimed he had resigned his membership in the club after perceiving that it practiced discrimination, but did not express his reasons for resigning to the club's membership or leadership. Ultimately, none of Beshear's arguments gained much traction, and he lost the race by a 724,794 votes (55.5%) to 560,012 (42.9%). At the time, it was the largest victory margin of McConnell's career. In a 2009 biography of McConnell, author John David Dyche wrote that Beshear [...] "had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> about his chance of success , but {{for the sake of his}} party, and hoping to ride the coattails of President Clinton's likely re-election, he got in the race." [...] After the book's release, Beshear said through a spokesman that Dyche's assessment [...] "sounds accurate." ...|$|E

[...] The game's playtesters were enthusiastic about the game during development, which Castle later said had encouraged the team to work harder. The team created live-action FMV cutscenes for the game. These cutscenes contain no professional actors aside from Kucan, who played Kane and was heavily involved in their production. The cast is made up of Westwood team members, and a low budget meant that filming took place in [...] "spare rooms" [...] and warehouses. Castle later said that the team [...] "had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> that we were as good as TV or film," [...] but that the cutscenes were not intentionally campy. He credited Kucan with [...] "taking ragtag group of people who had no business {{in front of a camera}} and making something reasonably good." [...] To replace the spice from Dune II, the team introduced Tiberium, which was inspired by the 1957 B-movie The Monolith Monsters. Castle said that the team's goal in both cases was to create [...] "a central resource that everybody was fighting over." [...] As with Dune II, the soundtrack was composed by Frank Klepacki.|$|E
