A <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice.|$|E
5|$|A {{motto is}} a short phrase usually {{appearing}} below the shield as a statement of belief. Catholic bishops and Presbyterian churches use a motto in their arms, though it is rare among Anglican bishops. A <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> is the motto on the coat of arms of Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|The +4 {{oxidation}} state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 {{oxidation state}} are also common. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a <b>notable</b> <b>exception.</b> Because {{of its high}} oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit {{a high degree of}} covalent bonding. Unlike most other transition metals, simple aquo Ti(IV) complexes are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were four}} of the {{thirteen}} colonies in British America, located between the New England Colonies and the Southern Colonies. Along with the Chesapeake Colonies, this area now roughly makes up the Mid-Atlantic states (though with the <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of Vermont, which is reckoned with New England).|$|E
5|$|The metal {{is readily}} {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> because passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E
5|$|The {{whistlers}} and shrikethrushes are a {{large group}} of stocky passerines found in Australia and surrounding regions. Primarily insectivorous, larger species may also eat small vertebrates such as frogs or nestling birds. Most have drab plumage, the golden whistler a <b>notable</b> <b>exception,</b> and several are accomplished songsters. Three species are found in Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|There is, however, one <b>notable</b> <b>exception.</b> In most implementations, COALESCE evaluates its {{parameters}} {{until it}} reaches the first non-NULL one, while NVL evaluates all of its parameters. This is important for several reasons. A parameter after the first non-NULL parameter could be a function, which could either be computationally expensive, invalid, or could create unexpected side effects.|$|E
5|$|Upon gaining {{independence}} in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of {{its foreign policy}} and {{played a leading role}} in the fight against the apartheid government in South Africa. One <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> to the African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with Israel throughout the 1960s. The latter nation sponsored and oversaw the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bands of}} the NWOBHM {{had the same}} look as their fans and {{produced}} rock shows without special visual effects. A <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career. Other exceptions were Demon, Cloven Hoof and Samson, which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while Pagan Altar and Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.|$|E

5|$|Most of Ælfhelm's {{subsequent}} historical appearances record him as {{a witness}} to charters, although one <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> is the will of his brother, Wulfric Spot. According to a 12th-century tradition, Ælfhelm was murdered and his sons blinded in 1006, by Eadric Streona with the connivance of King (Æthelred II). Ælfhelm's daughter, Ælfgifu, married Cnut the Great, King of England between 1016 and 1035, {{as a result of}} which Ælfhelm became the grandfather of future English king Harold Harefoot.|$|E
5|$|Much of South Dakota, {{with the}} <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of the Black Hills, is {{dominated}} by a temperate grasslands biome. Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts. In open, uncultivated areas of the plains, grasses such as buffalograss, western wheatgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem and little bluestem thrive.|$|E
5|$|Proceeding {{down the}} Mediterranean coast, the crusaders {{encountered}} little resistance, as local rulers preferred {{to make peace}} with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of the abandoned siege of Arqa. On 7 June, the crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before. Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationships}} among Gediminas' children were generally harmonious, with the <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of Jaunutis, who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis. These two brothers {{went on to}} provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century. Gediminas' grandchildren converted Lithuania to Christianity and inaugurated the first personal union with Poland.|$|E
5|$|As the club's {{fortunes}} declined, {{they found}} themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a <b>notable</b> <b>exception),</b> while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs. Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958–59 and fifth in both 1955–56 and 1956–57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951–52, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until 1970–71. To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.|$|E
5|$|Dalmatian cities {{remained}} {{loyal to}} Mary and Sigismund, not least {{thanks to the}} couple's alliance with Venice. A <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> was Klis, which supported the rebellious nobleman John of Palisna. Tvrtko {{took control of the}} Klis Fortress in July 1387, which enabled him to launch attacks on Split. Although the Bosnian army laid waste to the areas of Split and Zadar, the cities refused to capitulate. Their officials were willing to honour King Tvrtko but insisted that Queen Mary and King Sigismund were their legitimate sovereigns. Ostrovica Fortress submitted to Tvrtko in November, followed by Trogir.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and {{have not been able to}} incorporate exotic food into their diet. A <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E
