40|$|Multidrug use is well {{documented}} among nonmedical users of prescription stimulants. We sought to {{provide insight into the}} drug use patterns of those reporting <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) stimulants in an attempt to dis-cern whether such use is a first step in a pattern of drug-abusing behavior or, conversely, is a later development accompanied or preceded by a history of drug abuse. A cross-sectional, population-based survey of the U. S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 years and older was analyzed for lifetime <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants, life-time nonmedical use of another prescription drug, illicit drug use, and drug use initiation patterns. This included 443, 041 respondents from the 2002 – 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Lifetime <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants was reported by 3. 4 % of those aged 12 years and older. Of these, 95. 3 % also reported use of an illicit drug (i. e., marijuana, cocaine/crack, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants) or nonmedical use of another prescription drug (i. e., tranquilizers, pain relievers, or sedatives), and such use pre-ceded <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants in 77. 6 % of cases. On average, 2. 40 drugs were used prior to the first <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants. These data suggest that <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants is not commonly an initi-ating factor leading to the nonmedical use of other prescription medications or abuse of illicit drugs. Rather, <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants appears to be adopted by individuals already engaged in broader patterns of drug abuse and misuse...|$|E

40|$|The <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> {{and abuse}} <b>of</b> <b>{{prescription}}</b> drugs {{is a serious}} public health problem in this country. Although most people take prescription medications responsibly, an estimated 52 million people (20 percent of those aged 12 and older) have used prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons {{at least once in}} their lifetimes. Young people are strongly represented in this group. In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA) Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey found that about 1 in 12 high school seniors reported past-year <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prescription</b> pain reliever Vicodin in 2010, and 1 in 20 reported abusing OxyContin—making these medications among the most commonly abused drugs by adolescents. The abuse <b>of</b> certain <b>prescription</b> drugs— opioids, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and stimulants—can lead to a variety of adverse health effects, including addiction. Among those who reported past-year <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>prescription</b> drug, nearly 14 percent met criteria for abuse of or dependence on it. The reasons for the high prevalence <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drug abuse vary by age, gender, and other factors, but likely include greater availability. The number <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> for some <b>of</b> these medications has increased dramatically since the early 1990 s. Moreover, a consumer culture amenable to "taking a pill for what ails you" and the perception <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs as less harmful than illicit drugs are other likely contributors to the problem. It is an urgent one: unintentional overdose deaths involving opioid pain relievers have quadrupled since 1999, and by 2007, outnumbered those involving heroin and cocaine. NIDA hopes to change this situation by increasing awareness and promoting additional research on prescription drug abuse. Prescription drug abuse is not a new problem, but one that deserves renewed attention. It is imperative that as a Nation we make ourselves aware of the consequences associated with abuse of these medications...|$|R
40|$|Examining {{individual}} characteristics may not yield {{an understanding of}} the complex array of factors that affect college student alcohol use. Utilizing a latent class analysis, the present study investigated an alcohol and drug <b>use</b> database <b>of</b> first-year college students at 89 U. S. colleges and universities (N = 21, 945). These data were collected between December, 2010 and September, 2011. This study identified: (1) classes based on alcohol consumption, alcohol-related behaviors, and past-year <b>use</b> <b>of</b> illegal drugs and <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> medications (NMUPM); (2) demographic covariates of these classes; and (3) differential social norms awareness, perceived harmfulness of illegal drugs and NMUPM, and protective strategies. Four classes were identified: (1) Low Risk Drinking/Low Prevalence Drug Use (Class 1); (2) Lower Intake Drinking/Moderate Prevalence Drug Use (Class 2); (3) Moderate Risk Drinking/Moderate Prevalence Drug Use (Class 3); and (4) High Risk Drinking/High Prevalence Drug Use (Class 4).

40|$|Abstract Background Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> (NMU) <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications is rising, but many previous investigations have used clinical or regionally based samples or limited their investigations to stimulants rather than to medications specifically used to treat ADHD. Using an Internet-based epidemiological survey, this paper advances understanding of the prevalence and correlates of NMU <b>of</b> medications <b>used</b> to treat ADHD, sources of diverted medications, motivations for use, and consumption patterns. Methods The study used a self-administered Internet survey of civilian, noninstitutionalized adults (N = 4, 297) aged 18 to 49 in the United States. National-level estimates were created using propensity scoring methods and weighting procedures using data from three nationally representative probability surveys: a random-digit dialed telephone survey, the current U. S. Census, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Results Past-year prevalence of NMU of ADHD medications was approximately 2 %, with 4. 3 % reported among those aged 18 to 25 and 1. 3 % among those aged 26 to 49. Most respondents reporting NMU used on multiple occasions. Receipt of medications for ADHD was a significant correlate of past-year NMU, though most nonmedical users never had a prescription. Among persons {{who had never been}} prescribed medication to treat ADHD, friends or family members were the most common source. Productivity was the most frequently endorsed reason for NMU. Alcohol was the substance most commonly used in combination with ADHD drugs. Conclusion Because most prescription ADHD medications currently are highly regulated, policy options for supply-side reduction <b>of</b> <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> may include identifying those medications with lower abuse liability for inclusion on insurance formularies. Patient and physician education programs also may be useful tools to heighten awareness of intentional and unintentional diversion of ADHD medications for nonmedical purposes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> illicit and <b>prescription</b> {{drugs is}} not {{uncommon}} among Ameri-can adults, the currently recommended screens for substance use disorders focus only on alcohol. This study reports on the criterion validity of a two-item conjoint screen (TICS) for alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence for a split sample of primary care patients. Methods: Two random samples of primary care patients aged 18 to 59 years responded to several screening items that emanated from a focus group process. The DSM-III-R criteria for substance use disorders, as codified by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module, served as the criterion standard. Results: At least one positive response to the TICS (In the last year, have you ever drunk or used drugs more than you meant to? and Have you felt you wanted or needed {{to cut down on}} your drinking or drug use in the last year?) detected current substance use disorders with nearly 80 % sensitivity and specificity. The TICS was particularly sensitive to polysubstance use disorders. Respondents who gave 0, 1, and 2 positive responses had a 7. 3 %, 36. 5 %, and 72. 4 % chance of a current substance use disorder, respectively; likelihood ratios were 0. 27, 1. 93, and 8. 77.

Methods 1, 852 adolescents aged 14 - 20 presenting for care to the University of Michigan Emergency Department, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, (2011 - 2012) self-administered a computerized health survey. Sleep problems were identified {{if any of the}} 4 items on the Sleep Problems Questionnaire were rated by a patient as greater than 3 on a 0 - 5 scale. Adolescents that were too sick to be screened in the ED were eligible {{to participate in the study}} during their inpatient stay. Exclusion criteria for baseline included: insufficient cognitive orientation precluding informed consent, not having parent/guardian present if < 18 years-old, medical severity precluding participation, active suicidal/homicidal ideation, non-English speaking, deaf/visually impaired, or already participated in this study on a prior visit. Results 23. 5 % of adolescents reported clinically significant sleep problems. Female gender, depression, dating victimization, tobacco use, <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> medication, and an ED visit for medical reasons were each associated with sleep problems among adolescents, even while controlling for age, other types of drug use, receiving public assistance, and dropping out of school.

40|$|Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a {{neurological}} disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention. These symptoms result in impairments for individuals across multiple settings and are developmentally inappropriate. While common during childhood, symptoms {{have been shown}} to persist into adulthood for 50 % or more of those diagnosed before reaching age 18. Although prescription stimulants {{have been shown to}} benefit those with ADHD, increased popularity of prescription stimulant misuse among those without ADHD has been reported, despite the potentially harmful side effects that may accompany this use. Specifically, <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> stimulants during adolescence led to increased risk of crime commitment and increased risk for subsequent addictions to other substances. Despite the negative effects of prescription stimulants on those misusing them, as many as 7 % of undergraduate college students reported prescription stimulant medication misuse. The present NIH R 01 funded study, Trajectories Related to ADHD in College (TRAC) is a 5 -year longitudinal study conducted by Dr. Arthur Anastopoulos at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (Lead Principal Investigator), Dr. George DuPaul at Lehigh University (Co-Principal Investigator), and Dr. Lisa Weyandt at the University of Rhode Island (Co-Principal Investigator).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{patterns and}} knowledge <b>of</b> <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> stimulants among {{a sample of}} college students. DESIGN: Completion of an anonymous survey consisting of 23 questions designed to explore college student <b>use</b> <b>of</b> medications intended to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. SETTING: A private liberal arts college in New England. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty-seven undergraduate students. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <b>Nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> stimulants. RESULTS: Thirty-one students (9. 2 %) reported <b>nonmedical</b> stimulant <b>use.</b> Two hundred forty students (71. 4 %) had peers who used nonprescribed stimulants, 149 (44. 3 %) knew of peers who made stimulant medication-seeking visits to a physician although {{they did not believe}} that they had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and 178 (53. 0 %) knew of people who sold stimulants to students. Nonprescription users were significantly more knowledgeable about the effects of stimulants than nonusers, and nonusers whose peers used nonprescribed stimulants were more knowledgeable about the effects of stimulants than nonusers whose peers did not use nonprescribed stimulants. After controlling for age, race, and sex, the variables that predicted <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> stimulants were beliefs that stimulants help individuals study better, stay awake, and lose weight. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of college students in this sample were using nonprescribed stimulants. Among nonusers, those whose peers use nonprescribed stimulants were much more knowledgeable about the effects <b>of</b> stimulant <b>use</b> than those whose peers do not use stimulants. This knowledge may confer an increased risk <b>of</b> future <b>nonmedical</b> stimulant <b>use</b> if students become tempted to seek the beneficial effects experienced by their peers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nonmedical</b> {{prescription}} drug <b>use</b> (NMPDU) {{is an increasing}} problem, insufficiently studied among people in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT). This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with NMPDU for drug classes insufficiently described in opioid-dependent populations, including antihistaminergic anxiolytics and central stimulants. Methods. Study participants were recruited at two OMT clinics in Malmo, Sweden, between October 2014 and December 2015 () and interviewed about their use, motivations for use, and acquisition and administration <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs. Results. The majority of the sample reported lifetime NMPDU: 60 % for benzodiazepine-like hypnotics (z-drugs), 21 % for pregabalin, 19 % for stimulants, and 12 %– 15 % for antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Lower age was associated with <b>nonmedical</b> benzodiazepine <b>use</b> (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0. 89; 95 % Confidence Interval = 0. 82 – 0. 97). Illicit acquisition was reported by 61 % <b>of</b> people <b>using</b> z-drugs, 46 % <b>of</b> people <b>using</b> pregabalin, and 38 % <b>of</b> people <b>using</b> <b>prescription</b> stimulants, but only by 6 – 10 % <b>of</b> people <b>using</b> antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Conclusions. The substantial <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pregabalin, z-drugs, and prescription stimulants {{found in this study}} suggests that clinicians should prescribe these drugs with great caution. <b>Nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antihistaminergic anxiolytics {{does not seem to be}} a clinical issue among people in OMT in a Swedish setting, but we propose future studies to monitor their use...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{prescription}} of opioid analgesics {{has risen}} {{sharply in the}} United States {{over the last two}} decades. Unfortunately, increased supply of prescription opioids has been mirrored by higher abuse rates and more unintentional opioid overdoses. Thus, some experts have called for restraint, citing the need to balance the benefits of opioid therapy with approaches to curb prescription drug abuse. Yet others have expressed concern that tighter restrictions will prevent some pain patients from obtaining this effective analgesic class. Here, Dr. Keane challenges some long-held beliefs related to the potential harms associated with <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> opioids, including the desirability of this class among potential abusers, the relationship between opioid abuse and wide-ranging functional impairment, and the concept that all nonmedical opioid use inevitably results in poor outcomes.

40|$|Rates of {{overdose}} deaths involving {{prescription drugs}} increased {{rapidly in the}} United States during 1999 – 2006 (1). However, such mortality data do not portray the morbidity associated with prescription drug overdoses. Data from emergency department (ED) visits can represent this morbidity and can be accessed more quickly than mortality data. To better understand recent national trends in drug-related morbidity, CDC and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reviewed the most recent 5 years of available data (2004 – 2008) on ED visits involving the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs from SAMHSA’s Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). This report describes {{the results of that}} review, which showed that the estimated number of ED visits for nonmedical use of opioid analgesics increased 111 % during 2004 – 2008 (from 144, 600 to 305, 900 visits) and increased 29 % during 2007 – 2008. The highest numbers of ED visits were recorded for oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone, all of which showed statistically significant increases during the 5 -year period. The estimated number of ED visits involving nonmedical use of benzodiazepines increased 89 % during 2004 – 2008 (from 143, 500 to 271, 700 visits) and 24 % during 2007 – 2008. These findings indicate substantial, increasing morbidity associated with the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs in the United States during 2004 – 2008, despite recent efforts to control the problem. Stronger measures to reduce the diversion of prescription drugs to nonmedical purposes are warranted. DAWN is a public health information system that tracks the impact of drug use, misuse, and abuse in the United States by monitoring drug-related hospital ED visits. In a manner similar to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, * DAWN uses a sample of EDs to estimate national ED visit rates (2). DAWN collects data from a stratified, simple random sample of approximately 220 nonfederal, short-stay, general hospitals that operate 24 -hour EDs in the United States. DAWN’s samplin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of Review: Polysubstance use is common, {{particularly}} among some age groups and sub-cultures. It is {{also associated with}} elevated risk of psychiatric and physical health problems. We review recent research findings, comment on changes to polysubstance diagnoses, report on contemporary clinical and epidemiological polysubstance trends, and examine the efficacy of preventive and treatment approaches. Recent Findings: Approaches to describing polysubstance use profiles are becoming more sophisticated. Models over the past 18 months that employ Latent Class Analysis typically report a no use or limited range cluster (alcohol/tobacco/marijuana), a moderate range cluster (limited range, plus amphetamine derivatives) and an extended range cluster (moderate range, plus <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs and other illicit drugs). Prevalence rates vary {{as a function of}} the population surveyed. Wider-ranging polysubstance users carry higher risk of comorbid psychopathology, health problems and deficits in cognitive functioning. Summary: Wide-ranging polysubstance use is more prevalent in sub-cultures such as ‘ravers ’ (dance club attendees), and those already dependent on substances. Health risk...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this {{systematic}} review is to assess the effectiveness of brief interventions (BIs) {{as part of the}} Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) model for reducing the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> psychoactive substances. Methods Bibliographic databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO to April 2012) and gray literature sources were searched. We included randomized controlled trials that opportunistically screened adolescents or adults and then provided a one-to-one, verbal BI to those at risk of substance-use harm. Of interest was the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> psychoactive substances (for example, drugs prohibited by international law), excluding alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. Interventions comprised four or fewer sessions and were compared with no/delayed intervention or provision of information only. Studies were assessed for bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results were synthesized narratively. Evidence was interpreted according to the GRADE framework. Results We identified 8, 836 records. Of these, five studies met our inclusion criteria. Two studies compared BI with no BI, and three studies compared BI with information only. Studies varied in characteristics such as substances targeted, screening procedures, and BI administered. Outcomes were mostly reported by a single study, leading to limited or uncertain confidence in effect estimates. Conclusions Insufficient evidence exists as to whether BIs, as part of SBIRT, are effective or ineffective for reducing the <b>use</b> <b>of,</b> or harms associated with <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of,</b> psychoactive substances when these interventions are administered to nontreatment-seeking, screen-detected populations. Updating this review with emerging evidence will be important. Trial registration CRD 4201200241...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent {{increases}} in the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids and the adverse outcomes associated with them have stimulated {{a large amount of}} research and data collection on this public health problem. Systematic organization of the available data sources is needed to facilitate ongoing research, analysis, and evaluation. Method: A list of keywords associated with diversion, <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use,</b> and adverse outcomes <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioid <b>use</b> generated 94 peer-reviewed academic articles and a number of governmental and nongovernmental sources. All sources were in English, contained quantitative data, and were published between January 1995 and April 2012. A list of 20 topics was developed independently by two researchers and differences were resolved through discussion. Sources were examined for relevance to each topic and categorized according to the scale which they were collected. Results: The configuration of data indicates the diverse array of information currently available on the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids in the US. Data appear relatively sparse regarding <b>nonmedical</b> polydrug <b>use,</b> availability <b>of</b> opioids via the black market, and mechanisms of opioid diversion, such as doctor shopping and forgery. Conclusion: This index serves as a reference for researchers and policymakers who seek to further our understanding of the public health problems associated with pharmaceutical opioids and ameliorate associated adverse outcomes. Outlining the array of available data provides a global perspective and identifies topics that contain more and less quantitative information to guide our understanding and inform future research directions for the pharmaceutical opioid system in the US...|$|R
