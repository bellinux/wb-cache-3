25|$|A {{standard}} practice in implementing <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> in applications {{is to reduce}} the load on the Domain Name System servers by caching results locally, or in intermediate resolver hosts. Results obtained from a DNS request are always associated with the time to live (TTL), an expiration time after which the results must be discarded or refreshed. The TTL is set by the administrator of the authoritative DNS server. The period of validity may vary from a few seconds to days or even weeks.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista {{contains}} a new networking stack, which brings large improvements {{in all areas}} of network-related functionality. It includes a native implementation of IPv6, as well as complete overhaul of IPv4. IPv6 is now supported by all networking components, services, and the user interface. In IPv6 mode, Windows Vista can use the Link Local Multicast <b>Name</b> <b>Resolution</b> (LLMNR) protocol to resolve names of local hosts on a network which does not have a DNS server running. The new TCP/IP stack uses a new method to store configuration settings that enables more dynamic control and does not require a computer restart after settings are changed. The new stack is also based on a strong host model and features an infrastructure to enable more modular components that can be dynamically inserted and removed.|$|E
2500|$|DOI <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> is {{provided}} through the Handle System, developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives, and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI <b>name.</b> <b>Resolution</b> redirects the user from a DOI name {{to one or}} more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may {{be thought of as a}} record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its [...] field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.|$|E
50|$|In {{programming}} languages, <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> can {{be performed}} either at compile time or at runtime. The former is called static <b>name</b> <b>resolution,</b> the latter is called dynamic <b>name</b> <b>resolution.</b>|$|E
30|$|The name-based ICN routing can be {{realized}} by the undirected <b>naming</b> <b>resolution</b> service and the direct name based routing. The <b>naming</b> <b>resolution</b> requires one or several centralized servers (e.g. RendezVous points, register servers, trigger points, etc.) in the networking topology. The content publications are collected in these servers, which have a global view of all the published content objects and the networking topology. When an ICN router wants to forward a request message, the routing path is calculated in the centralized server by existing routing protocol. The name based routing is directly performed in the ICN routers. Each router has a local forwarding information base which is filled by the content publication messages. The request forwarding paths are calculated in the local routers by their own forwarding strategies [6].|$|R

50|$|A {{somewhat}} common misconception is that dynamic typing implies dynamic <b>name</b> <b>resolution.</b> However, static typing does imply static <b>name</b> <b>resolution.</b> For example, Erlang is dynamically typed but has static <b>name</b> <b>resolution.</b>|$|E
50|$|JavaScript has simple scoping rules, but {{variable}} initialization and <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> rules can cause problems, and {{the widespread use}} of closures for callbacks means the lexical environment of a function when defined (which is used for <b>name</b> <b>resolution)</b> can be very different from the lexical environment when it is called (which is irrelevant for <b>name</b> <b>resolution).</b> JavaScript objects have <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> for properties, but this is a separate topic.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the release}} of Windows 2000, the use of WINS for <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> has been {{deprecated}} by Microsoft, with hierarchical Dynamic DNS now configured as the default <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> protocol for all Windows operating systems. Resolution of (short) NETBIOS names by DNS requires that a DNS client expand short names, usually by appending a connection-specific DNS suffix to its DNS lookup queries. WINS can still be configured on clients as a secondary <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> protocol for interoperability with legacy Windows environments and applications. Further, Microsoft DNS servers can forward <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> requests to legacy WINS servers {{in order to support}} <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> integration with legacy (pre-Windows 2000) environments that do not support DNS.|$|E

50|$|Many {{small office}} and home {{networks}} {{do not have}} their own DNS server, relying instead on broadcast <b>name</b> <b>resolution.</b> Many versions of Microsoft Windows default to prioritizing DNS <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> above NetBIOS <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> broadcasts; therefore, when an ISP DNS server returns a (technically valid) IP address {{for the name of}} the desired computer on the LAN, the connecting computer uses this incorrect IP address and inevitably fails to connect to the desired computer on the LAN. Workarounds include using the correct IP address instead of the computer name, or changing the DhcpNodeType registry value to change <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> service ordering.|$|E

Most frequently, <b>name</b> <b>resolution</b> relies on an [...] "inner-to-outer" [...] rule, such as the Python LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule: names implicitly resolves to the narrowest relevant context.
