5|$|Half-Life 2: Episode Four – Also {{known as}} Return to Ravenholm, {{this project was}} in {{development}} by Arkane Studios around 2006–2007, however Valve decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> project forward. In 2012, Valve writer Marc Laidlaw confirmed rumors surrounding the project's existence and screenshots of gameplay later emerged in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Although greatly {{obstructed}} by Ranavalona's policies, French and British {{political interests}} in Madagascar remained undiminished. Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as expressed in the Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E
5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E

The club were advised that the planning permission required would not necessarily be granted, and chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> scheme further.|$|E
5|$|Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) offer Pembleton (Andre Braugher) a {{promotion}} to lieutenant and the vacant shift commander position working alongside Gee (Yaphet Kotto). Pembleton asks for {{time to consider}} it, and the duo ask him {{not to mention the}} offer to Gee. Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the discussion was nothing. After discussing the offer with his wife Mary (Ami Brabson), Pembleton decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> job and confesses to Gee, who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him sooner. The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which he seldom does.|$|E

5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> place because George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither of them should take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear}} that Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 2009 Stockport {{agreed to}} allow Gannon to hold talks with Brighton & Hove Albion, who were seeking to fill the {{managerial}} position left vacant by Micky Adams. He suggested that his family would play a large part in his decision to move clubs, with Stockport's financial troubles looming but uprooting his family to move to Brighton being undesirable. Gannon was made favourite {{to be given the}} job by several bookmakers, and he met with Brighton chairman Dick Knight on the 25th, before announcing on the 26th that he had chosen <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> job. Knight had indicated that Gannon was his first choice for the job, and former Stockport players now at Brighton had shown their desire for Gannon to be given the job. However, Gannon turned down the opportunity and vowed stay with at the Edgeley Park club.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died. Mary's husband {{ascended the}} throne as King George V, {{and she became}} queen consort. When her husband asked her to drop one of her two {{official}} names, Victoria Mary, she chose to be called Mary, preferring <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> name of her husband's grandmother, Queen Victoria. Queen Mary was crowned with the King on 22 June 1911 at Westminster Abbey. Later in the year, the new King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar held on 12 December 1911, and toured the sub-continent as Emperor and Empress of India, returning to Britain in February. The beginning of Mary's period as consort brought her into conflict with her mother-in-law, Queen Alexandra. Although the two were on friendly terms, Alexandra could be stubborn; she demanded precedence over Mary at the funeral of Edward VII, was slow in leaving Buckingham Palace, and kept some of the royal jewels {{that should have been}} passed to the new Queen.|$|E

5|$|The Lakers {{would lose}} 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, but were bounced {{in the first}} round. During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season {{that would result in}} the Lakers failing to make the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former {{teammate}} Michael Cooper as his lead assistant. Johnson decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.|$|E

25|$|From November to December 1863 he {{was sent}} by Magruder to direct the naval side of the defense of Indianola, Texas, where Colonel William R. Bradfute was {{commanding}} the land forces. As part of the engagement, the Confederates retreated in the Battle of Fort Esperanza. Smith commanded John F. Carr, Cora, and eleven small vessels with sharpshooters and artillery; however disagreements with Bradfute were a hindrance to operations. Smith chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive, fighting defensively.|$|E

He chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> salary dispute to arbitration, and instead played with Dynamo Moscow during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. On 4 September 2005, Datsyuk then signed a one-year contract with Avangard Omsk of the Russian Superleague (RSL), where Dynamo Moscow matched the offer two days later, retaining the player.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposing}} commanders {{communicated with}} each other, and on September 6 Essex advanced with 2,000 foot and 300 horse. On sighting O'Neill he readied his army {{in the formation of}} a St Andrew's cross, with cavalry on either flank and to the rear. The war council hoped for an Irish attack and determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> initiative. The next day O'Neill's envoy told Essex his master sought the Queen's mercy, and proposed a meeting with Essex at the ford of Bellaclinthe on the river Glyde.|$|E
25|$|Cardinals owner Chris O'Brien {{was later}} offered- {{but refused to}} accept- the Championship title for his team. At the owners' meeting {{after the end of}} the season, he argued that his team did not deserve to take the title over a team which had beaten them fairly. It appears that his reasons for {{scheduling}} the Milwaukee and Hammond games had been <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> title, but rather to convince the Chicago Bears to play his team again – the Bears, with Red Grange in their roster, were a very lucrative draw. The NFL said it would revisit the issue later, but never did. It was only after the Bidwill family purchased the team in 1933 that the Cardinals began claiming the championship title.|$|E

25|$|Ewbank got {{his first}} {{professional}} head coaching job in early 1954 for the NFL's Baltimore Colts, a franchise that had started play the previous year. While it was a step up for Ewbank, Brown encouraged him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> job {{and told him he}} would not be successful. After Ewbank took the job, Brown accused him of passing information about the Browns' draft targets to the Colts. Brown had insisted that he stay with the Browns through the 1954 draft, and NFL commissioner Bert Bell agreed. During the draft, Ewbank allegedly sent the names of players Brown liked to the Colts through Baltimore sportswriter John Steadman, including end Raymond Berry, who went on to have a long and successful career.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler's {{performance}} in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game {{that he went to}} hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.|$|E
25|$|The ICC {{created the}} Bowling Action Review Committee (BARC) in 1999, {{and on the}} {{recommendation}} of the WICB, Holding was one of the founding members of the committee. The role of the committee was to monitor players suspected of throwing using various video replays. The process of assessing a bowler’s action has since become more scientific with more technology used and though the committee disbanded in 2005 it was influential in the ICC establishing the 15 degree maximum for bowlers straightening their arms in delivery. Even when working for the BARC, Holding was a strident critic of the ICC so in 2007 when he was approached to join the newly formed ICC cricket committee he thought a friend was playing a joke on him. Holding joined the committee and though he was initially optimistic quit in July 2008 in protest against the ICC's decision to overturn the result of the Oval Test between Pakistan and England, which was changed from a forfeit by Pakistan (who chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> field in protest against being accused of ball tampering) to a draw. The forfeiture was later reinstated, and Holding resolved not to rejoin the committee.|$|E
