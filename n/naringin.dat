25|$|As with atorvastatin, simvastatin, {{and other}} statin drugs metabolized via CYP3A4, {{drinking}} grapefruit juice during lovastatin therapy {{may increase the}} risk of side effects. Components of grapefruit juice, the flavonoid <b>naringin,</b> or the furanocoumarin bergamottin inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, and may account for the in vivo effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of lovastatin, and increasing its plasma concentrations.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the extract of citrus grapefruit seed has antioxidant properties. Analysis shows the constituents of the seed extract and pulp are flavonoids, ascorbic acid (commonly known as vitamin C), tocopherols, citric acid, limonoids, sterols, and minerals. A study suggests the consumption of the bioactive compounds found in grapefruit seed and pulp may help suppress the development of colon cancer. Another study showed the flavonoid <b>naringin</b> is an excellent plasma lipid lowering and plasma antioxidant active elevating flavonone.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{in vitro}} studies have also shown that <b>naringin</b> in {{grapefruit}} is not what causes the inhibitory effects associated with grapefruit juice. <b>Naringin</b> solution when compared to grapefruit solution produced much less inhibition of CYP3A4. Furthermore, seville orange juice, which contains considerably less <b>naringin</b> content than grapefruit juice, was found to produce {{the same level of}} inhibition of CYP3A4 as grapefruit juice. This would suggest than an inhibitor other than <b>naringin,</b> such as furanocoumarin, which is also found in Seville oranges, may be at work. At the same time, naringenin is known to be a more potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 than <b>naringin</b> [...] and {{in vitro studies}} have been unable to effectively convert <b>naringin</b> into naringenin. This leaves open the possibility that in vivo, <b>naringin</b> converted into naringenin by naringinase is what causes the inhibitory effect on CY3PA4. Due to the contradictory results of the effect of <b>naringin</b> it is hard to tell whether it is <b>naringin</b> itself or other components of grapefruit juice that cause drug-drug interaction and lead to its toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|The typical {{concentration}} of <b>naringin</b> in grapefruit juice is around 400 mg L-1. [...] The reported LD50 of <b>naringin</b> in rodents in 2000 mgs/kg.|$|E
50|$|When <b>naringin</b> {{is treated}} with {{potassium}} hydroxide or another strong base, and then catalytically hydrogenated, {{it becomes a}} <b>naringin</b> dihydrochalcone, a compound roughly 300-1800 times sweeter than sugar at threshold concentrations.|$|E
50|$|Grapefruit, Seville oranges, bergamot, and {{possibly}} other citrus also contain {{large amounts of}} <b>naringin.</b> It {{can take up to}} 72 hours before the effects of the <b>naringin</b> on the CYP3A4 enzyme are seen. This is problematic as a 4 oz portion of grapefruit contains enough <b>naringin</b> to inhibit the metabolism of substrates of CYP3A4. Nagarin is a flavonoid which contributes to the bitter flavour of grapefruit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Naringin</b> {{belongs to}} the {{flavonoid}} family. Flavonoids consist of 15 carbon atoms in 3 rings, 2 of which must be benzene rings connected by a 3 carbon chain. <b>Naringin</b> contains the basic flavonoid structure along with two rhamnose units attached to its aglycone portion, called naringenin, at the 7-carbon position. The steric hindrance provided by the two rhamnose units makes <b>naringin</b> less potent than its aglycone counterpart, naringenin.|$|E
50|$|Alpha-L-rhamnosidase breaks <b>naringin</b> into prunin and rhamnose. Glucosidase breaks prunin into glucose and naringenin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Naringin</b> {{inhibits}} some drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, {{which may}} result in drug-drug interactions. Ingestion of <b>naringin</b> and related flavonoids can also affect the intestinal absorption of certain drugs, leading to either an increase or decrease in circulating drug levels. To avoid interference with drug absorption and metabolism, the consumption of citrus (especially grapefruit) and other juices with medications is advised against.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{evidence}} of anti-inflammatory activity of <b>naringin,</b> the anti-inflammatory activity of naringenin {{has been observed}} to be poor to nonexistent.|$|E
50|$|In humans, naringinase {{is found}} in the liver and rapidly metabolizes <b>naringin</b> into naringenin. This happens in two steps- first, <b>naringin</b> is hydrolyzed by α-L-rhamnosidase {{activity}} of naringinase to rhamnose and prunin. The prunin formed is then hydrolyzed by β-d-glucosidase activity of naringinase into naringenin and glucose. Naringinase is an enzyme that has a wide occurrence in nature and can be found in plants, yeasts, and fungi. It is commercially attractive due to its debittering properties.|$|E
5000|$|Naringinase is a {{debittering}} {{enzyme that}} {{is used in the}} commercial production of citrus juices. It breaks down the compound <b>naringin</b> that gives citrus juices its bitter taste. It is a multienzyme complex which possesses alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta glucosidase active centers. The E.C. No. (...) of the naringinase and rhamnosidase are the same. First rhamnosidase breaks <b>naringin</b> into prunin and rhamnose. Lastly glucosidase breaks prunin into glucose and naringenin, a flavorless flavanone also found in various citrus.|$|E

50|$|It is {{particularly}} effective in masking the bitter tastes of other compounds found in citrus, including limonin and <b>naringin.</b> Industrially, it {{is produced by}} extracting neohesperidin from the bitter orange, and then hydrogenating this to make NHDC.|$|E
5000|$|The active {{ingredients}} in bergamot juice are neoeriocitrin, <b>naringin,</b> neohesperidin, ponceritin, melitidin, and brutieridin. Melitidin and brutieridin, only recently discovered, exist only in citrus bergamot, and exhibit statin-like properties. [...] Synephrine {{is not present}} in citrus bergamot.|$|E
5000|$|Rutin {{is also an}} antioxidant; {{compared}} to quercetin, acacetin, morin, hispidulin, hesperidin, and <b>naringin,</b> it {{was found to be}} the strongest. [...] However, in other trials, the effects of rutin were lower or negligible {{compared to}} those of quercetin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Naringin</b> dihydrochalcone is a phloretin {{glycoside}} {{discovered at}} the same time as neohesperidin dihydrochalcone during the 1960s as part of a United States Department of Agriculture research program to find methods for minimizing the taste of bitter flavorants in citrus juices.|$|E
50|$|Hesperetin is the 4'-methoxy {{derivative}} of eriodictyol, a flavanone. Hesperetin's 7-O-glycoside, hesperidin, is a naturally occurring flavanon-glycoside, the main flavonoid in lemons and sweet oranges. Hesperetin (and naringenin, the parent flavanone of <b>naringin)</b> are {{not found to}} a significant extent in Citrus spp.|$|E
50|$|Citrus fruits {{may contain}} {{a number of}} {{polyphenol}} compounds, including the flavonoid <b>naringin</b> and furanocoumarins (such as bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, bergapten, and bergaptol).

5000|$|Naringenin {{has been}} shown to have an {{inhibitory}} effect on the human cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2, which can change pharmacokinetics in a human (or orthologous) host of several popular drugs in an adverse manner, even resulting in carcinogens of otherwise harmless substances. [...] The National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine in Taiwan conducted experiments on the effects of the grapefruit flavanones <b>naringin</b> and naringenin on CYP450 enzyme expression.

50|$|Consumption of {{grapefruit}} or {{grapefruit juice}} inhibits the metabolism of certain statins. Bitter oranges {{may have a}} similar effect.

This increases the levels of the statin, increasing the risk of dose-related adverse effects (including myopathy/rhabdomyolysis). The absolute prohibition of grapefruit juice consumption for users of some statins is controversial.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, Bailey has {{slightly}} {{shifted the}} focus of his research to assessing the effect of fruit juices on other potentially important mechanisms of drug absorption. Current research found that grapefruit and other juices (orange and apple) inhibited a specific intestinal drug uptake transporter (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2; OATP1A2) to diminish oral drug absorption discernibly in humans. The initial publication in 2002, which has been cited more than 100 times, supported {{a new model of}} intestinal drug absorption and novel mechanism of food-drug interactions. Most recently, he showed that the major flavonoid in grapefruit, <b>naringin,</b> was an important clinically active inhibitor of intestinal OATP1A2.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Naringin</b> esters {{are paid}} more {{attention}} in medical and functional food industry than <b>naringin</b> due to their higher stability and solubility in lipidic environments. <b>Naringin</b> palmitic acid esters were enzymatically synthesized with <b>naringin</b> and palmitic acid. The effects of solvent type, temperature, concentration and types of enzymes and the molar ratio of substrates on the conversion of <b>naringin</b> were investigated. Novozym 435 performed higher catalytic ability in tert-amyl alcohol in the esterification of <b>naringin</b> with palmitic acid. The conversion yield of <b>naringin</b> increased {{with the increase of}} temperature (30 - 70 °C) and of the concentration of enzyme. The structure of the <b>naringin</b> palmitate was characterized by FT-IR, 1 H-NMR and HPLC-MS. 1 H-NMR spectroscopic analysis indicated the presence of an ester bond on the C- 6 of the glucose moiety of <b>naringin</b> molecule...|$|E

The beneficial effect of <b>naringin</b> was assessed in rats with streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetes and high glucose-induced HBZY- 1 cells. According to our results, first we found that <b>naringin</b> relieved kidney injury, improved renal function and inhibited collagen formation and renal interstitial fibrosis.

40|$|Chaihu-Shu-Gan-San (CSGS), a {{traditional}} Chinese medicine (TCM) formula containing seven herbal medicines, {{has been used}} in the clinical treatment of gastritis, peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome and depression in China. In order to explore the interaction between <b>naringin</b> and other constituents in CSGS, the pharmacokinetic difference of <b>naringin</b> in rats after oral administration of CSGS aqueous extract and <b>naringin</b> alone was investigated. The pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>naringin</b> in rats were achieved by quantification of its aglycone, naringenin by LC-MS/MS method. The double peaks phenomenon was observed in both serum profiles of rats after orally administered CSGS aqueous extract and <b>naringin</b> alone.

40|$|Background: Bovine {{serum albumin}} (BSA) {{contains}} high affinity binding sites for several endogenous and exogenous compounds {{and has been}} used to replace human serum albumin (HSA), as these two compounds share a similar structure. <b>Naringin</b> palmitate is a modified product of <b>naringin</b> that is produced by an acylation reaction with palmitic acid, which is considered to be an effective substance for enhancing <b>naringin</b> lipophilicity. In this study, the interaction of <b>naringin</b> palmitate with BSA was characterised by spectroscopic and molecular docking techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings: The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the interactions between <b>naringin</b> palmitate and BSA under physiological conditions, and differences in <b>naringin</b> and <b>naringin</b> palmitate affinities for BSA were further compared and analysed. The formation of <b>naringin</b> palmitate-BSA was revealed by fluorescence quenching, and the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KSV) was found to decrease with increasing temperature, suggesting that a static quenching mechanism was involved. The changes in enthalpy (DH) and entropy (DS) for the interaction were detected at 24. 1160. 18 kJ?mol 21 and 276. 5960. 32 J?mol 21 ?K 21, respectively, which indicated that the <b>naringin</b> palmitate-BSA interaction occurred mainly through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bond formation. The negative free energy change (DG) values of <b>naringin</b> palmitate at different temperatures suggested a spontaneous interaction.
