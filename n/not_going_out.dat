5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>out,</b> and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch {{what happens in the}} wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

500|$|Hancock began filming in June 1977. However, {{after nearly}} a month of filming, Universal and MCA {{executives}} disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg's) wife, actress Lorraine Gary (Ellen Brody), [...] "should {{go out on a}} boat and help to rescue the kids." [...] When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, [...] "Over my dead body." [...] The next draft of the film's screenplay was turned in with Gary <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress {{who turned out to be}} a Universal executive's girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.|$|E
2500|$|Complications {{sometimes}} {{arise in}} the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: [...] "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>out?</b> No."), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French si and Swedish jo (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).|$|E

2500|$|... "At 6:30 {{we arrived}} {{close to the}} beach. We could not quite get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I looked up and said, we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of}} the soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment. [...] Only by cutting loose their equipment and then swimming to shore could most of them avoid drowning.|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{between new}} {{producer}} Freiberger and the Year One veterans were strained. Landau complained about stories he felt were light-weight or absurd {{when compared to}} the previous year's efforts. He wrote on the cover of a script: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> on a limb for this show because I'm not in accord with what you're (Freiberger) doing as a result... etc. I don't think I even want to do the promosâ€”I don't want to push the show any more as I have in the past. It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing to me if I am not the star of it and in the way I feel it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... I might as well work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger was a good man and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999. He had gotten them a second year after the cancellation, but the changes he made did not benefit the programme.|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
