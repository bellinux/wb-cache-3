Whereas the lack of success on the original goal of this research, which was to predict fuel consumption for intermodal trains in any random configuration under any condition of railroad track, the scope of the project was shortened to a very specific piece of section of the Canadian railway network for trains that travel full power.

40|$|In {{literature}} {{several studies}} have been performed to analyze the surface finish of rapid prototyped parts. These researches have been mainly aimed to the optimal build direction of prototypes to obtain the best possible surface finish on specific surfaces. Very diffuse technologies that suffers considerably of low surface quality are Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and extrusion based Rapid Prototyping machines in general. Hand finishing {{for even the most}} basic levels of part quality are often required by the customers, forcing the geometrical features of the prototypes to be controlled by the skill level of the operator.

40|$|Conformational {{and other}} defects {{can affect the}} {{soundness}} of a horse and impede athletic performance to varying degrees. This study sought to investigate the prevalence {{of a variety of}} anatomical defects, to determine heritability estimates for a selection of these defects and to investigate the effect of a variety of these defects on the racing performance in a large sample of young Thoroughbred horses presented for sale. The study population consisted of data from 13, 603 pre-purchase veterinary examination certificates for three and four year old Thoroughbred National Hunt (NH) horses. The information was gathered using the Pre-Purchase Veterinary Examination Certificates from eight years of Tattersalls Ireland’s Derby Sale, Goffs Ireland June Sale and Doncaster Bloodstock Sales Ltd. (DBS) Spring Sale (2002 - 2009) and seven years of Tattersalls Ireland’s August Sale (2002 - 2008). All conditions noted by the veterinarian were recorded {{in order to determine the}} true prevalence of defects in this National Hunt population. It was found that 73. 58 % of the sample population had one or more defects with 12. 02 % having serious defects likely to prejudice their use for racing. Metacarpal/metatarsal exostoses and tarsal plantar desmitis affected 17. 11 % and 19. 40 % of the sample, respectively, while 9. 81 % of the horses were found to make respiratory noises and 5. 26 % had recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Age, sex and year of birth had a significant effect on the occurrence of many of the defects and panel veterinarians were significantly more likely to diagnose defects than the private veterinarians (p € 20, 001 compared to 8. 19 + 0. 276 for horses € 20, 001 compared to 0. 47 + 0. 037 for horses € 20, 001 compared to 1. 14 + 0. 075 for horses <€ 5, 000) than horses in the lower price brackets (P < 0. 001). Horses with prejudicial defects were significantly less likely to race (70. 4 % raced compared to 83. 7 %) or to win a race (33. 8 % compared to 41. 3 %) and had significantly fewer career starts (8. 68 + 0. 379 compared to 9. 91 + 0. 131), wins (0. 69 + 0. 071 compared to 0. 92 + 0. 026) and places (1. 39 + 0. 115 compared to 1. 76 + 0. 040) than horses without prejudicial defects (P < 0. 01). Horses with RLN were significantly less likely to race (69. 4 % compared to 83. 6 %) than those without RLN and had significantly fewer career wins (0. 68 + 0. 092 compared to 0. 92 + 0. 026) and career places (1. 35 + 0. 155 compared to 1. 76 + 0. 040) than those without RLN. They also had a significantly higher proportion of <b>non-finished</b> races than those without RLN (34. 01 %+ 2. 147 compared to 25. 29 %+ 0. 456). Horses with tarsal plantar desmitis also had a significantly higher proportion of <b>non-finished</b> races than those without tarsal plantar desmitis (29. 96 %+ 1. 754 compared to 25. 71 %+ 0. 489). Papillomas significantly adversely affected the number of career starts (8. 45 + 0. 470 compared to 9. 87 + 0. 128), career wins (0. 59 + 0. 079 compared to 0. 91 + 0. 025), career places (1. 30 + 0. 126 compared to 1. 75 + 0. 039) and mean earnings per start (£ 241. 5 + 41. 85 compared to £ 454. 6 + 21. 93). Horses with papillomas had significantly more <b>non-finished</b> races than those without papillomas (33. 34 %+ 2. 124 compared to 25. 85 %+ 0. 448) while interestingly, horses with sarcoids had significantly fewer <b>non-finished</b> races than those without sarcoids (19. 44 %+ 1. 805 compared to 26. 58 %+ 0. 452). Overall, the results indicate that a large proportion of Thoroughbred National Hunt horses are affected by defects of some kind. The results show that the prevalence of a large number of defects increases with age and that certain defects are viewed negatively by purchasers, thereby affecting the selling status. There was a heritable component to each of the defects and each defect was found to affect racing performance to some degree. The results indicate that veterinary pre-purchase examinations make a significant contribution in the evaluation of potential racehorses and that buyers’ estimates of value appear to correspond with subsequent racing performance. It may be of benefit to the Thoroughbred industry to monitor the prevalence of defects within the population. The low heritability of the more serious defects does suggest that genetic progress in the reduction of these defects in the horse population would be slow...|$|E

40|$|This article {{suggests}} reflections about {{inclusive education}} thru {{the research of}} a teaching methodology used in a private school of Sao Paulo that intends to assist the diversity of students. At the researched school, the basic education is divided in two parts: the Collective Classes (CC) and the Personal Work (PW). In the personal working moments - {{the subject of this}} article - the students have the possibility of an individual assistance with the teachers. The goal of this research was to analyze how the Personal Work methodology can be effective and consistent as a strategy for teaching students with intellectual disabilities, inserting it into the inclusive education proposition. To think about this issue, there were made an interview with one of the school’s basic education principals, as well as a few interventions thru the assistance of a non-literate, 6 th grade student with intellectual disabilities. The results of the research showed that the PW methodology can engender possible interventions for the learning development of the students with intellectual disabilities, based on the perspective of the Inclusive Education, although it is a <b>non-finished,</b> team work. Este artigo apresenta reflexões sobre a educação inclusiva a partir de um estudo a respeito da metodologia de ensino adotada em uma escola particular do Estado de São Paulo que visa ao atendimento à diversidade de alunos. Na escola pesquisada, o ensino fundamental está organizado em dois momentos distintos: aula coletiva (AC) e trabalho pessoal (TP). Nas situações de aprendizagens durante o TP, objeto do estudo aqui em pauta, os alunos têm a possibilidade de atendimento individualizado com os professores. Assim, o objetivo desta pesquisa de campo foi analisar como tal metodologia pode ser efetiva e coerente em relação ao atendimento da proposta da educação inclusiva, enquanto estratégia de intervenção para os alunos com deficiência intelectual. Para refletir sobre essa questão, foi realizada uma entrevista com uma das diretoras do ensino fundamental e foram feitas intervenções a partir de observações com um aluno com deficiência intelectual matriculado no 6 o ano e ainda não alfabetizado. Os resultados da pesquisa mostraram que a metodologia do TP pode contemplar intervenções possíveis para o desenvolvimento da aprendizagem do aluno com deficiência intelectual na perspectiva da educação inclusiva, sendo este um caminho em construção que requer trabalho em equipe...|$|E
