40|$|A stellar {{attitude}} {{reference system}} concept for satellites was studied which promises to permit continuous precision pointing of payloads with accuracies of 0. 001 degree {{without the use}} of gyroscopes. It is accomplished {{with the use of a}} single, clustered star tracker assembly mounted on a non-orthogonal, two gimbal mechanism, driven so as to unwind satellite orbital and orbit precession rates. A set of eight stars was found which assures the presence of an adequate inertial reference on a continuous basis in an arbitrary orbit. Acquisition and operational considerations were investigated and inherent reference redundancy/reliability was established. Preliminary designs for the gimbal mechanism, its servo drive, and the star tracker cluster with its associated signal processing were developed for a baseline sun-synchronous, <b>noon-midnight</b> <b>orbit.</b> The functions required of the onboard computer were determined and the equations to be solved were found. In addition detailed error analyses were carried out, based on structural, thermal and other operational considerations...|$|E
40|$|The FORTE {{satellite}} is {{a collaborative}} effort between Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories. FORTE, which consists of a composite structure, has a total mass of approximately 180 kg. The satellite operates at a nominal circular orbit of 800 km (100 minute orbit period) with a minimum and maximum power dissipation of 13 Watts and 166 Watts, respectively. The FORTE instruments are attached to three decks (nadir, mid, and zenith) which are constructed of aluminum honeycomb with thin graphite facesheets. Body mounted solar panels are located on the outside surfaces of the octagonal shaped spacecraft. The outer surface of the nadir facing deck and two side panels are used as thermal radiators with their outer surfaces coated with white paint. All internal instruments are coated with black paint to enhance thermal radiation to the surrounding environment, and an intervening thermal interlace material is used between the mating surfaces of the instruments and the decks. A thermal model has been developed for the FORTE spacecraft using TRASYS, which calculates the thermal radiation conductances and orbital heat rates (earthshine, direct and reflected solar), and the thermal analyzer SINDA Quasi steady-state temperatures were obtained for both cold (minimum power, beginning-of-life optical properties and heat rates, and <b>noon-midnight</b> <b>orbit)</b> and hot (maximum power, end-of-life properties and heat rates, and dusk-dawn orbit) worst case orbits. Initial temperature results indicated {{that some of the}} high power electronics boxes (3 ̆e 30 Watts) needed to be relocated to the anti-sun side of the spacecraft, and that a thermally passive system was sufficient. In order to provide thermal input to instrument designers, detailed thermal models of the higher power instruments were developed using PATRAN/P-Thermal, COSMOS-M, and PCB-Explorer. The FORTE thermal design will be described and thermal model results presented...|$|E
40|$|A fine-energy-resolution survey (38 to 2700 keV) {{of the sky}} {{has been}} {{performed}} from a spinning polar-orbiting satellite with a cooled germanium spectrometer. The measurements, performed with a fast time resolution (32 ms), permit one to analyze the energy spectra from repeated <b>noon-midnight</b> <b>orbits</b> in selected portions of the local daytime or nighttime sky. During the initial period of the experiment, the sky was surveyed in two broad intervals spanning the galactic plane at longitudes of approximately 255 to 328 deg and 99 to 168 deg, respectively. In the former interval {{a significant increase in}} counting rate was observed when the spectrometer viewed the galactic plane. Locally generated backgrounds were removed from the galactic-plane spectrum by subtracting, on a spin-for-spin basis, the contribution measured at a viewing direction with a comparable declination north of the celestial equator. The net spectra from the galactic plane have been examined for evidence of gamma-ray lines. The possible presence of lines near 1121 and 1369 keV emitted from the galactic plane over the galactic longitudinal interval approximately 255 deg to approximately 328 deg is suggested by the data, but better statistics are needed to establish their existence firmly. Comparisons are made with previously reported extraterrestrial lines with assumed normalizations made for the different viewing directions in the two experiments...|$|R
40|$|Designing a {{solar array}} to power a {{spacecraft}} bus supporting {{a set of}} instruments making in situ plasma and neutral atmosphere measurements in the ionosphere at altitudes of 120 km or lower poses several challenges. The driving scientific requirements are the field-of-view constraints of the instruments resulting in a three-axis stabilized spacecraft, {{the need for an}} electromagnetically unperturbed environment accomplished by designing an electrostatically conducting solar array surface to avoid large potentials, making the spacecraft body as small and as symmetric as possible, and body-mounting the solar array. Furthermore, the life and thermal constraints, {{in the midst of the}} effects of the dense atmosphere at low altitude, drive the cross-sectional area of the spacecraft to be small particularly normal to the ram direction. Widely varying sun angles and eclipse durations add further complications, as does the growing desire for multiple spacecraft to resolve spatial and temporal variations packaged into a single launch vehicle. Novel approaches to insure adequate orbit-averaged power levels of approximately 250 W include an oval-shaped cross section to increase the solar array collecting area during <b>noon-midnight</b> <b>orbits</b> and the use of a flywheel energy storage system. The flywheel could also be used to help maintain the spacecraft's attitude, particularly during excursions to the lowest perigee altitudes. This paper discusses the approaches used in conceptual power designs for both the proposed Dipper and the Global Electrodynamics Connections (GEC) Mission currently being studied at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center...|$|R
50|$|The Space Test Program {{spacecraft}} P78-1 or Solwind {{was launched}} on February 24, 1979 and continued operating until September 13, 1985, {{when it was}} shot down in orbit during an Air Force ASM-135 ASAT test. The platform was of the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) type, with a solar-oriented sail and a rotating wheel section. P78-1 was in a <b>noon-midnight,</b> Sun-synchronous <b>orbit</b> at 600 km altitude. The orbital inclination of 96° implied that a substantial fraction of the orbit was spent at high latitude, where the particle background prevented detector operation. In-flight experience showed that good data were obtained between 35° N and 35° S geomagnetic latitude outside the South Atlantic Anomaly. This yields an instrument duty cycle of 25-30%. Telemetry data were obtained for about 40-50% of the orbits, yielding a net data return of 10-15%. Though this data rate appears low, it means that about 108 seconds of good data reside in the XMON data base.|$|R
40|$|Using {{results of}} the in situ {{measurements}} made by the DE 2 satellite, the nature of plasma structuring at high latitudes, caused by the gradient drift instability process, is described. Using <b>noon-midnight</b> and dawn-dusk <b>orbits</b> of the DE 2 satellite, {{it was possible to}} examine the simultaneous density and electric field spectra of convecting large-scale plasma density enhancements in the polar cap known as 'patches', in directions parallel and perpendicular to their antisunward convection. The results provide evidence for the existence of at least two generic classes of instabilities operating in the high-latitude ionosphere: one driven by large-scale density gradients in a homogeneous convection field with respect to the neutrals, and the other driven by the structured convection field itself in an ambient ionosphere where density fluctuations are ubiquitous...|$|R
30|$|The small Japanese {{scientific}} satellite Reimei was launched successfully from Baikonur Space Center into a sun-synchronous (<b>noon-midnight</b> meridian) polar <b>orbit</b> {{at an altitude}} of ∼ 630 km on August 23, 2005. Auroral fine structure observations have been performed by the multi-spectral auroral camera (MAC) and electron/ion spectrum analyzers (ESA/ISA) on board Reimei. The MAC is a three channel camera system used to simultaneously observe the temporal dynamics of the auroral fine structure at the wavelengths of 428 nm (N 2 + 1 NG), 558 nm (O), and 670 nm (N 2 1 PG). Since its successful launch, Reimei has been operated continuously and produced lots of unique data on the auroral fine structures with the MAC and ESA/ISA. The initial observation data from MAC has shown the temporal dynamics of auroral fine structure, such as the vortex street, appearing in the poleward edge of the auroral oval. The significant differences in the auroral shapes between the MAC channels suggest the existence of different emission processes. Further, the height profiles of the aurora and airglow are clearly seen in the image data in the limb direction. It is expected that the various mechanisms and dynamics of auroral fine structures can be investigated by analyzing the Reimei observation data.|$|R
