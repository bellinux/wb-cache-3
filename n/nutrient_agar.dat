While D. discoideum can be grown in liquid culture, it is usually grown in Petri dishes containing <b>nutrient</b> <b>agar</b> and the surfaces are kept moist. The cultures grow best at 22–24°C (room temperature). D. discoideum feed primarily on E. coli, which is adequate for all stages of the lifecycle. [...] When the food supply is diminished, the myxamoebae aggregate to form pseudoplasmodia. Soon, the dish is covered with various stages of the lifecycle. Checking the dish often allows for detailed observations of development. The cells can be harvested at any stage of development and grown quickly.|$|E

2500|$|Bacteriophages are {{the viruses}} that infect and {{replicate}} in bacteria. They {{were discovered in}} the early 20th century, by the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort (1877–1950). But before this time, in 1896, the bacteriologist Ernest Hanbury Hankin (1865–1939) reported that something {{in the waters of}} the River Ganges could kill Vibrio cholerae – the cause of cholera. Whatever it was in the water could be passed through filters that remove bacteria but was destroyed by boiling. Twort [...] discovered the action of bacteriophages on staphylococci bacteria. He noticed that when grown on <b>nutrient</b> <b>agar</b> some colonies of the bacteria became watery or [...] "glassy". He collected some of these watery colonies and passed them through a Chamberland filter to remove the bacteria and discovered that when the filtrate was added to fresh cultures of bacteria, they in turn became watery. He proposed that the agent might be [...] "an amoeba, an ultramicroscopic virus, a living protoplasm, or an enzyme with the power of growth".|$|E

50|$|Besides the asexual {{reproduction}} mode, {{under certain conditions}} (e.g. nutritional stress) Z. bailii produces sexual spores (ascospores) in a sac called ascus (plural: asci). Normally, each ascus contains one to four ascospores, which are generally smooth, thin-walled, spherical or ellipsoidal. It should be mentioned that the ascospores are rarely observed as it is difficult and may {{take a long time}} to induce their formation; besides many yeast strains lose the ability to produce ascospores on repeated sub-cultures in the laboratory. On various <b>nutrient</b> <b>agars,</b> Z. bailii colonies are smooth, round, convex and white to cream coloured, with a diameter of 2 - 3 mm at 3 - 7 days. As the morphology properties of Zygosaccharomyces are identical to other yeast genera such as Saccharomyces, Candida and Pichia, it is impossible to differentiate Zygosaccharomyces from other yeasts or individual species within the genus based on macroscopic and microscopic morphology observations. Therefore, the yeast identification to species level is more dependent on physiological and genetic characteristics than on morphological criteria.|$|R

Six per cent of strains of H influenzae were misidentified as H parainfluenzae by a test for satellitism using filter paper discs impregnated with X factor, V factor, or both, applied to Columbia Agar. None of seven <b>nutrient</b> <b>agars</b> tested grew Haemophilus species, and determined accurately the X factor requirement. Synthesis of porphyrins from delta-aminolaevulinic acid provided a reliable means of demonstrating that X factor was required. A test {{for the production of}} acid from sucrose discriminated successfully between strains of V-dependent Haemophilus species (positive) and H influenzae (negative). Most isolates were identified correctly by the ONPG test, but occasional V-dependent strains were negative and could be misidentified as H influenzae.

40|$|To {{address the}} {{possible}} limitations that financial restrictions {{may have on}} students’ independent experimentation at school, we developed and implemented an inexpensive approach for basic microbiology education.

We implemented our approach in microbiology education at school as well as in pre-service teacher education and in in-service teacher professional development courses at our university.
