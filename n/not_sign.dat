5|$|Fuller and Form {{said the}} casting process for Friday the 13th was more {{difficult}} than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in Friday the 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. s Richard Burgi, who was cast as Sheriff Bracke, did <b>not</b> <b>sign</b> his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes.|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films to be completely independently funded.

Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did <b>not</b> <b>sign</b> on as the film's distributor until {{near the end of}} production, and while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.|$|E
