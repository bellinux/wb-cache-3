40|$|The State of Wisconsin {{is located}} in an unusually water-rich portion {{of the world in}} the western part of the Great Lakes region of North America. This article {{presents}} an overview of the major groundwater quantity and quality concerns for this region in a geologic context. The water quantity concerns are most prominent in the central sand plain region and portions of a Paleozoic confined sandstone aquifer in eastern Wisconsin. Water quality concerns are more varied, with significant impacts from both naturally occurring inorganic contaminants and anthropogenic sources. Naturally occurring contaminants include radium, arsenic and associated heavy metals, fluoride, strontium, and others. Anthropogenic contaminants include <b>nitrate,</b> <b>bacteria,</b> viruses, as well as endocrine disrupting compounds. Groundwater quality in the region is highly dependent upon local geology and land use, but water bearing geologic units of all ages, Precambrian through Quaternary, are impacted by at least one kind of contaminant...|$|E

Prof. Chen and his group were the first to discover a sample of anaerobic <b>nitrate</b> <b>bacteria</b> in paddy field, from which they were able to obtain a pure culture, and subsequently reveal the nitrozation effect of facultatively anaerobic nitrifying microorganisms in paddy fields. This discovery was included in the keynote speech Facultatively Anaerobic Nitrification and Nitrate-forming Organism delivered on the 8 th World Congress of Soil Science (Bucharest) in 1964, and was published on the Soil Science (Zhou and Chen 1983), receiving a widespread response in the world.|$|E

When these fossil fuels are combusted, sulphur-di-oxide is released into the atmosphere causing acid rains which dissolves buildings, kills forest. Knowing the physiological groups of microorganisms present in the coal samples has an ecological importance, completing the knowledge in the field of the microorganism’s ecology and a practical importance, being a source of new microorganisms with biotechnological potential. The microbial communities evidenced in such sites include both groups of chemolithotrophic microorganisms involved in the metals biosolubilization processes and groups of heterotrophic microorganisms involved in the processes of bioaccumulation or biofixation of metallic ions. In this context, this paper presents the study regarding the main physiological groups of microorganisms present in the pit coal and lignite samples after the industrial processing of coal.

Thenumber of total viable cells and different types of microorganisms in the original sample was determined by serialdilution, agar plating procedure using selective media. The plates were incubated at 300 C for 24 - 72 hours. Distinctcolonies growing on each plate were selected, and stored at freezing temperatures.

40|$|Chromium {{is often}} found as a cocontaminant at sites {{polluted}} with organic compounds. For nitrate-respiring microbes, Cr(VI) may {{be not only}} directly toxic but may also specifically interfere with N reduction. In soil microcosms amended with organic electron donors, Cr(VI), and <b>nitrate,</b> <b>bacteria</b> oxidized added carbon, but relatively low doses of Cr(VI) caused a lag and then lower rates of CO 2 accumulation. Cr(VI) strongly inhibited nitrate reduction; it occurred only after soluble Cr(VI) could not be detected. However, Cr(VI) additions did not eliminate Cr-sensitive populations; after a second dose of Cr(VI), bacterial activity was strongly inhibited. Differences in microbial community composition (assayed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) driven by different organic substrates (glucose and protein) were smaller than when other electron acceptors had been used. However, the selection of bacterial phylotypes was modified by Cr(VI). Nine isolated clades of facultatively anaerobic Cr(VI) -resistant bacteria were closely related to cultivated members of the phylum Actinobacteria or Firmicutes. In Bacillus cereus GNCR- 4, {{the nature of the}} electron donor (fermentable or nonfermentable) affected Cr(VI) resistance level and anaerobic nitrate metabolism. Our results indicate that carbon utilization and nitrate reduction in these soils were contingent upon the reduction of added Cr(VI). The amount of Cr(VI) required to inhibit nitrate reduction was 10 -fold less than for aerobic catabolism of the same organic substrate.

In this study the effects of three levels of sodium nitrate (0, 5, 10 mM) on fermentation of three diets varying in their wheat straw to concentrate ratio (700 : 300, low concentrate, LC; 500 : 500, medium concentrate, MC and 300 : 700, high concentrate, HC diet) were investigated in vitro using buffalo rumen liquor as inoculum. <b>Nitrate</b> reducing <b>bacteria,</b> isolated from the rumen of buffalo were tested as a probiotic to study if it could help in enhancing methane inhibition in vitro. Inclusion of sodium nitrate at 5 or 10 mM reduced (p< 0. 01) methane production (9. 56, 7. 93 vs. 21. 76 ml/g DM; 12. 20, 10. 42 vs. 25. 76 ml/g DM; 15. 49, 12. 33 vs. 26. 86 ml/g DM) in LC, MC and HC diets, respectively. Inclusion of nitrate at both 5 and 10 mM also reduced (p< 0. 01) gas production in all the diets, but in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) of feed reduced (p< 0. 05) only in LC and MC diets. In the medium at 10 mM sodium nitrate level, there was 0. 76 to 1. 18 mM of residual nitrate and nitrite (p< 0. 01) also accumulated. In an attempt to eliminate residual nitrate and nitrite in the medium, the <b>nitrate</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> were isolated from buffalo adapted to nitrate feeding and introduced individually (3 ml containing 1. 2 to 2. 3 × 106 cfu/ml) into in vitro incubations containing the MC diet with 10 mM sodium nitrate.

40|$|Agricultural {{land use}} {{in areas that}} are located in karst {{groundwater}} basins negatively impact groundwater quality because karst terrains provide multiple, direct hydrologic connections from the surface into karst aquifers. The connections and rapid velocities associated with surface and subsurface flow in karst aquifers allow for contaminants to move quickly into and through a groundwater basin. When groundwater returns to the surface via a spring or springs, any contaminants within the water become part of surface streams and rivers. These in turn, impact water quality in areas located downstream of the spring or springs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the source and movement of agricultural contaminants in a karst groundwater basin within the context of local climate, hydrogeology and land use. The study area is a fluvio-karst groundwater basin located in the Corn Belt of northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota. Land use is predominantly agricultural in nature. Dye tracing, both qualitative and quantitative, resulted in the delineation of the Coldwater Cave Groundwater basin and illustrated that the boundaries of the basin could change as a result of precipitation events. Investigation of basin and aquifer characteristics, stream water temperature monitoring, and evaluation of cave map data and karst feature inventories determined that the surface and subsurface hydrogeology in the study area was very well integrated. Water sampling and analysis documented that agricultural contaminants, specifically <b>nitrates,</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and atrazine impact the quality of the surface water and groundwater within the basin. A ribotyping project that was done in conjunction with the thesis work showed the source of bacteria to be from cattle and humans. Nitrogen isotope analyses indicated that the source of nitrates was from ammonium fertilizers and from septic system wastes. Atrazine, at levels well below the MCL standards established by EPA, and its metabolite deethylatrzine (DEA) were detected in the groundwater year round. Contaminant load was calculated for <b>nitrates,</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and atrazine. Lowest contaminant loads occurred during the winter months of November, December, and January, when freezing temperatures minimized groundwater recharge.

Thirty-three wells were purged, measured for field parameters, and sampled for <b>nitrates</b> and <b>bacteria.</b> All <b>nitrate</b> and <b>bacteria</b> analyses were performed by an accredited laboratory. Nitrate results indicate that groundwater quality is generally excellent in the four rural regions studied relative to the drinking water standard of 10 ppm (there were no exceedances). However, seven of 33 wells tested (21 %) contain nitrates at or above 1 mg/L, the level considered to indicate human-caused degradation. The maximum level measured was 2. 19 mg/L and the median was 0. 6 mg/L. Nitrates are mapped in figures found in the Appendix; complete field and lab results are presented in Table 2. In addition collecting nitrate data via scientific protocols described in the QAPP, EHS staff researched nitrate results submitted to Clallam County Environmental Health by building permit applicants.

The nasA gene, encoding the nitrate assimilation enzyme, was selected as a functional marker to examine the nitrate assimilation community in the South China Sea (SCS). PCR amplification, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) screening, and phylogenetic analysis of nasA gene sequences were performed to characterize in situ <b>nitrate</b> assimilatory <b>bacteria.</b> Furthermore, the effects of nutrients and other environmental factors on the genetic heterogeneity of nasA fragments from the SCS were evaluated at the surface in three stations, and at two other depths in one of these stations. The diversity indices and rarefaction curves indicated that the nasA gene was more diverse in offshore waters than in the Pearl River estuary. The phylotype rank abundance curve showed an abundant and unique RFLP pattern in all five libraries, indicating that a high diversity but low abundance of nasA existed in the study areas. Phylogenetic analysis of environmental nasA gene sequences further revealed that the nasA gene fragments came from several common aquatic microbial groups, including the Proteobacteria, Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (CF), and Cyanobacteria. In addition to the direct PCR/sequence analysis of environmental samples, we also cultured a number of <b>nitrate</b> assimilatory <b>bacteria</b> isolated from the field.

However, how {{plant functional traits}} are shaping these communities has received less attention though linking plant and microbial traits is crucial for better understanding plant-microbe interactions. Our objective was to determine how plant-microbe interactions were affected by plant traits. Specifically we analyzed how interactions between plant species and microbes involved in nitrogen cycling were affected by plant traits related to nitrogen nutrition in interaction with soil nitrogen availability. Eleven plant species, selected along an oligotrophic-nitrophilic gradient, were grown individually in a nitrogen-poor soil with two levels of nitrate availability. Plant traits for both carbon and nitrogen nutrition were measured and the genetic structure and abundance of rhizosphere microbial communities, in particular the ammonia oxidizer and nitrate reducer guilds, were analyzed. The structure of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere differed significantly between plant species and these differences depended on nitrogen availability. The {{results suggest that the}} rate of nitrogen uptake per unit of root biomass and per day is a key plant trait, explaining why the effect of nitrogen availability on the structure of the bacterial community depends on the plant species. We also showed that the abundance of <b>nitrate</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> always decreased with increasing nitrogen uptake per unit of root biomass per day, indicating that there was competition for nitrate between plants and <b>nitrate</b> reducing <b>bacteria.</b> This study demonstrates that nitrate-reducing microorganisms may be adversely affected by plants with a high nitrogen uptake rate.

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16 S rRNA and nasA (encoding the large subunit of the assimilatory nitrate reductase) gene sequences indicated that the cultivable NAB in South China Sea belonged to the α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria and CFB (Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides) bacteri-al groups. In all the environmental samples of the present study, α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria and Bacteroideteswere found to be the dominant nasA-harboring bacteria. Almost all of the α-ProteobacteriaOTUs were classified into three Roseobacter-like groups (I to III). Clone library analysis revealed previously underestimated nasA diversity; e. g. the nasA gene sequences affiliated with β-Proteobacteria, ε-Proteobacteria and Lentisphaerae were observed in the field investigation for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.

40|$|Groundwater is a {{major source}} of water for many Canadians. It has been shown that in many parts of Canada, wells exceed the {{guidelines}} for <b>nitrate</b> and <b>bacteria</b> and {{there is a lack of}} detailed information available on the state of wells in general. Water samples from 54 private potable wells in the South Nation River and Raisin River watershed areas were collected for water quality analysis in 2003. Water quality indicators tested for in the well water samples consisted of the following: nitrate, total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (EC), background colonies (BC), conductivity, oxygen (dissolved oxygen), redox potential (Eh), pH, total inorganic carbon (TIC), total organic carbon (TOC) and methyl mercury (MeHg). Dug wells have a greater risk of contamination than drilled wells. I predicted that there would be a difference in the <b>bacteria</b> and <b>nitrate</b> levels in these two type of wells. Well water samples were subdivided based on three categories of land use: residential, agricultural and agricultural intensive. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{micro-organisms}} {{are able}} to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called mineralisation. Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to <b>nitrate.</b> Nitrogen-fixing <b>bacteria</b> are capable of metabolising N2 into the form of ammonia in a process called nitrogen fixation. Both ammonium and nitrate can be immobilized by their incorporation into the microbes' living cells, where it is temporarily sequestered {{in the form of}} amino acids and protein. Nitrate may also be lost from the soil when bacteria metabolise it to the gases N2 and N2O. The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called denitrification. Nitrogen may also be leached from the soil if it {{is in the form of}} nitrate or lost to the atmosphere as ammonia due to a chemical reaction of ammonium with alkaline soil by way of a process called volatilisation. Ammonium may also be sequestered in clay by fixation. A small amount of nitrogen is added to soil by rainfall.|$|R

The microbiological analyses consisted {{in determining the}} presence ofoligotrophs, aerobic heterotrophs, ammonifiers, <b>nitrate</b> and nitrite <b>bacteria,</b> denitrifiers and determining thepresence of micromycetes. In order to form a complete image on the microbial processes from this habitat,the bacteriological analyses were completed with quantitative and qualitative enzymological analyses. At allthe six samples of cave material the next quantitative enzymatic activities were performed: actual andpotential dehydrogenase, catalase and phosphatase.

The qualitative enzymatic activities: amylase, dextranase, saccharase, maltaseand levanase, were not present at studied samples...|$|R
50|$|The {{test for}} nitrites is a rapid {{screening}} method for possible asymptomatic infections caused by nitrate-reducing bacteria. Some of the gram negative bacteria species that most commonly cause urinary tract infections (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter and Proteus) have enzymes that reduce the nitrate present in urine to nitrite. The test is a rapid screen for possible infections by enteric bacteria, {{but it does}} not replace the urinalysis tests nor microscopic examination as diagnostic tools, nor subsequent monitoring as many other microorganisms that do not reduce <b>nitrate</b> (gram positive <b>bacteria</b> and yeasts) can also cause urinary infections.|$|R
