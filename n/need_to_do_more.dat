2500|$|Bisignano's early {{actions as}} CEO {{attracted}} {{a fair amount}} of attention in the business press. Bisignano immediately announced he would be avoiding the company's penchant for cost-cutting with layoffs, stating [...] "we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> with our existing customer base — that should be our first order of business.” He reportedly spent his first month [...] "meeting investors, talking to customers and staff," [...] and he also held a conference with the company's suppliers to discuss strategy. After starting an equity ownership plan that awarded all of First Data's 24,000 employees with shareholder status, Bisignano was involved with the creation of networking and support groups for female and LGBT employees.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{becoming}} Archbishop of Los Angeles in 1985, Mahony {{was active}} in addressing sexual abuse cases. Ray Boucher, a lawyer representing some of the plaintiffs in those cases, said the files released on Monday were “particularly damning,” because they showed the “wanton disregard for {{the health and safety}} of children, and a decision by the highest members of the church to put its self-interest and the interest of abusive priests ahead of those of children.” In 1988, the Archdiocese adopted a zero tolerance policy. [...] In 1992, at a national meeting of Catholic bishops, Mahony publicly addressed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to combat sexual abuse. In 2002, Mahony directed that as many as a dozen Southern California priests be forced to leave the church due to sexual abuse, in compliance with the church's promises in a 2001 settlement, resulting in praise from the victim's attorney in that case.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, General Richards {{and other}} senior NATO {{officers}} expressed a wish for backing from {{member states to}} intensify the war effort in Libya by directly targeting Col Gaddafi's regime, rather than simply protecting Libyan civilians. [...] "The military campaign to date {{has been a significant}} success for NATO and our Arab allies, but we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more.</b> If we do not up the ante now there is a risk that the conflict could result in Gaddafi clinging to power," [...] said Gen Richards. He added that, while NATO forces were not targeting Col Gaddafi directly, he could nevertheless become a legitimate target if he was caught directly attacks against Libyan civilians. [...] "The United Nations resolution allows Nato to use 'all necessary means' in Libya," [...] he said. [...] "We are not targeting Gaddafi directly, but if it happened that he was in a command and control centre that was hit by Nato and he was killed, then that is within the rules." ...|$|E

60|$|William of Montaubon, the cunning squire, {{had made}} his way across {{to the spot where}} the steeds were tethered, and had mounted his own great roussin. At first it was thought {{that he was about to}} ride from the field, but the howl of execration from the Breton peasants changed {{suddenly}} to a yell of applause and delight as he turned the beast's head for the English circle and thrust his long prick spurs into its side. Those who faced him saw this sudden and unexpected appearance. Time was when both horse and rider must have winced away from the shower of their blows. But now they were in no state to meet such a rush. They could scarce raise their arms. Their blows were too feeble to hurt this mighty creature. In a moment it had plunged through the ranks, and seven of them were on the grass. It turned and rushed through them again, leaving five others helpless beneath its hoofs. No <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more!</b> Already Beaumanoir and his companions were inside the circle, the prostrate men were helpless, and Josselin had won.|$|E
