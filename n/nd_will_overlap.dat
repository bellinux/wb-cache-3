30|$|It is as {{a product}} of these three {{dimensions}} of classification that we can best define and identify register. The criteria are not absolute or independent; they are all variable in delicacy, and the more delicate the classification the more the three <b>will</b> <b>overlap.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{connected}} {{components of}} a space, the irreducible components need not be disjoint (i.e. they need not form a partition).

50|$|In {{order to}} get a {{meaningful}} sulfur signal from the analysis, the buffer should not contain sulfur (i.e. no BES, DDT, HEPES, MES, MOPSO or PIPES compounds). Excessive amounts of chlorine in the buffer should also be avoided, since this <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> with the sulfur peak; KBr and NaBr are suitable alternatives.|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} that the proton does not decay {{according}} to the GUT theories above, the Degenerate Era will last longer, and <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> or surpass the Black Hole Era. However, degenerate stellar objects can still experience proton decay, for example via processes involving virtual black hole, or higher-dimension supersymmetry with a half-life of under 10200 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} small number of atomic absorption lines (compared to atomic emission lines) and their narrow width (a few pm) make spectral overlap rare; there are only few examples known that an absorption line from one element <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> with another. Molecular absorption, in contrast, is much broader, so that {{it is more likely that}} some molecular absorption band <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> with an atomic line. This kind of absorption might be caused by un-dissociated molecules of concomitant elements of the sample or by flame gases. We have to distinguish between the spectra of di-atomic molecules, which exhibit a pronounced fine structure, and those of larger (usually tri-atomic) molecules that don’t show such fine structure. Another source of background absorption, particularly in ET AAS, is scattering of the primary radiation at particles that are generated in the atomization stage, when the matrix could not be removed sufficiently in the pyrolysis stage.|$|R
50|$|Slitless {{spectroscopy}} is astronomical spectroscopy {{done without}} a small slit to allow only {{light from a}} small region to be diffracted. It works best in sparsely populated fields, as it spreads each point source out into its spectrum, and crowded fields will be too confused to be useful. It also faces the problem that for extended sources, nearby emission lines <b>will</b> <b>overlap.</b>|$|R
50|$|The spot-bellied bobwhite (Colinus leucopogon) is a ground-dwelling {{bird in the}} New World quail family. It is {{sometimes}} considered to be conspecific with the crested bobwhite, Colinus cristatus. As the latter species expands north into Costa Rica, {{it is likely that}} the two species <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> in range in the future, but the Costa Rican subspecies of spot-bellied is the least similar to crested.|$|R

The length of the {{prototype}} filter is KM, with K being the overlapping factor and M the number of subcarriers. In the frequency domain, neighboring subchannels <b>will</b> <b>overlap,</b> and this causes interference. When we send an impulse on one subcarrier, contributions will be received on the neighboring subcarriers. Other subcarriers only have negligible contributions. By using OQAM, this interference can easily be removed.|$|R
40|$|The {{interference}} pattern of many beams includes multiple fringe sets, each for a corresponding pair of beams. These fringes {{must have a}} limited spectral band, {{so that they can}} extend far from the central, white-light fringe. It is possible instead to use a chromatic corrector in order to match the fringe spacing at different wave lengths. As a result, they <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> over a much larger area, and thus improve the selectivity of the beam pairs...|$|R
