He stated that [...] "The {{showdown}} at Five Corners played out just like 'Cape Feare,' complete with rake gag, which is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing.</b> If The Simpsons intends to self-plagiarize (and it obviously does), that's a good episode to copy." [...] Sharon Knolle of AOL TV said, [...] "I'd say overall this ep ranks {{with some of the}} better Sideshow Bob eps, if not the very best. Certainly, it beats the heck out of 'The Italian Bob' and 'Funeral for a Fiend.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Marge is a caring, understanding, and {{nurturing}} parent to Bart, but {{she refers to}} him as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (season seven, 1995), {{she felt she was}} mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her [...] "over-mothering", but as she started acting more distant towards him, he felt guilty about it and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing...</b> Of course, it makes him do bad things." [...] Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge. In [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] (season four, 1992) When Marge was playing the role of Blanche DuBois, she hit Ned Flanders naked with a bottle and she tells him 'What's this bottle in your face!'.|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{brought forth}} controversial legislation, known as Bill 29, that reformed the province's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The {{amendments to the}} act expanded the government's ability to deny access to information by keeping ministerial briefings secret, ignoring requests for information that cabinet ministers deem to be [...] "frivolous," [...] and barring the auditor general from a wider array of records. Deadlines to respond to requests were pushed back, and fees were increased from $15 to $25. The opposition leaders immediately condemned the bill and said they would team up to filibuster the bill. An expert on international access-to-information laws, Toby Mendel, called key changes to the act “breathtaking,” and said the province will rank lower than some third world countries with the new legislation. As well 75 people also assembled outside the Confederation Building to protest the bill. However, Newfoundland and Labrador's information commissioner, Ed Ring, said bill 29 was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> {{and that it would}} not stop the Access to the Information and Protection of Privacy Act from doing its job. Bill 29 led to a four-day filibuster in the House of Assembly, which eventually ended when the government invoked closure to the debate. NDP leader Lorraine Michael's accusation that the government was being racist, when referring to Mendel's criticism of the bill, was cited by the government as reasons to end debate.|$|E

500|$|Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the {{two have}} a {{turbulent}} relationship. Bart regularly addresses Homer by his given name instead of [...] "Dad", while Homer in turn often refers to him as [...] "the boy". Homer has a short temper and when enraged by Bart will strangle him on impulse in a cartoonishly violent manner. One of the original ideas for the show was that Homer would be [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as their characters were explored. Marge {{is a much more}} caring, understanding and nurturing parent than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud", (season seven, 1995) she felt she was mothering Bart too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. At the beginning of the episode, Bart protested at her over-mothering but as her attitude changed, he felt bad and made it up to her. Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to experience humiliation if it means pleasing his mom. Marge has expressed an understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing...</b> Of course, it makes him do bad things." ...|$|E
500|$|Most critics felt KMFDM {{stayed close}} to its usual sound on WTF?!. [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic commented, [...] "The 'ultra heavy beat' sounds as 'ultra' and 'heavy' as ever on WTF?!" [...] He {{went on to say}} the album was [...] "an {{outstanding}} blast of dark dancefloor destruction" [...] and saying the album should be on [...] "the top shelf". [...] Gregory Burkart of FearNet mostly praised the album, saying that while the band doesn't [...] "break new creative ground" [...] on WTF?!, which he said wasn't the [...] "heaviest, fastest or most experimental album", it was [...] "still rock-solid, sporting some outstanding melodies and rhythms, and many memorable moments". [...] Ilker Yücel of ReGen Magazine called WTF?! a [...] "hard-hitting dose of industrial rock that is as familiar as it is unusual". [...] He concluded his review by saying, [...] "In short, it’s KMFDM by-the-numbers, and after 27 years, that's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> at all." [...] Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, [...] "WTF? is typical: electronic used to augment electric to over-human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd-person". [...] He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, [...] "This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking for a bit of roughage on their playlist." [...] Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF?! [...] "a solid release bursting with power and determination". [...] She also said of KMFDM, [...] "musically they are not far of their centre and typical sound, which is not a bad thing".|$|E
500|$|Other critics {{praised the}} album's overall quality, both in {{comparison}} to the band's previous work and the Christian music genre. Ed Cardinal of Crosswalk.com described Thrive as [...] "top quality" [...] and described the majority of the album was marked by [...] "intensity", and said [...] "It may not be the easiest, breeziest listen... but this album can help fight that dark enemy with every play". Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday rated Thrive four and a half stars, ranking the album's songs as among the best he had heard from group and saying that it is [...] "sure {{to be one of the}} year's best [...] ". Laura Chambers of Christian Music Review rated the album 4.9 out of 5, describing it as [...] "one of the best albums I’ve heard in a long time". Although she noted the album covered some lyrical topics the band had discussed before, she felt this was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing,</b> considering it [...] "less of a rehash and more of a reminder". Jeremy Armstrong of Worship Leader rated Thrive three and a half out of five stars, praising the band as having a [...] "broad appeal" [...] and describing the album as a [...] "fine release". At CM Addict, Brianne Bellomy rated the album four stars out of five, remarking that the release [...] "is another power packed album full of songs that speak to everyone". At About.com, Kim Jones rated Thrive four-and-a-half stars out of five, praising the album as being [...] "delivered with [...] passion" [...] and saying that it has [...] "arrows [...] straight to the heart".|$|E

500|$|Upon the video's release, several {{media outlets}} noticed a {{resemblance}} between the colorful aesthetics of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{and those of}} British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz". Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, [...] "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video... video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, if you ask me, is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with [...] "a kaleidoscope of prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes." ...|$|E

[...] A writer on Terror Hook has stated that [...] " [...] 'Pretty Little Liars' gets off to a very promising start. Great production all around, the writing keeps the viewer on their toes, and the acting just reinforces it. The overall mystery of the show in the end is dark and unpredictable, even stepping into the slasher film realm." [...] The New York Post gave the show three out of five stars, stating, [...] "OK, so we've established {{that there is no}} socially redeeming value in this series and that your kids shouldn't watch it if they are too young and impressionable. But if you can distract them enough to miss the first 15 minutes, the show isn't half-bad. Actually, it is half-good, if that makes sense."
