50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> {{affects the}} growth of plants. Seedlings are often heaved to this surface by <b>needle</b> <b>ice.</b> When the ground hardens the stems and roots of the seedling, they are gripped by the soil and then the {{formation}} of <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> is what pushes them up and out the ground. When the <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> melts, the seedlings do not settle correctly back into the ground causing these seedling to die. Even if the seedlings are partially heaved by the <b>needle</b> <b>ice,</b> they can still die due to root desiccation. Heaving accounts for 95% of all seedlings deaths. Not only does <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> affect the soil around it but it also kills the vegetation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> {{was observed in}} East Tennessee. Through the observation, the air temperature was above freezing where it leads {{to the fact that}} a form of ice called Pebble ice grew on a few rocks. In fact, the phenomenon has been studied in a climatologic experience at Vancouver, Canada. In this sense, the experiment involves the analysis of the soil surface temperature, net radiation. Therefore, the researchers inform that the growth of <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> occur during a single freeze-thaw cycle. In addition, the <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> may become less abundant as the soil surface dried out.

50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> {{grows up}} slowly from the moist and water-penetrable soil, and melts {{gradually}} in the sun. It can vary in appearance but always shows the consistent growth of ice {{perpendicular to the}} land surface. <b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> looks {{like a bunch of}} filamentous crystals, and is in straight or curve shape. It usually forms in the morning when temperature drops below freezing point (0 °C).|$|E
5000|$|Mechanisms of {{producing}} precipitation include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall. [...] Convective processes involve strong vertical motions {{that can cause}} the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation, while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation. [...] Precipitation {{can be divided into}} three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice. Mixtures of different types of precipitation, including types in different categories, can fall simultaneously. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle. Rain or drizzle that freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass is called [...] "freezing rain" [...] or [...] "freezing drizzle". Frozen forms of precipitation include snow, <b>ice</b> <b>needles,</b> <b>ice</b> pellets, hail, and graupel.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the small}} loss tangent of ice at 30 - 50 GHz, {{significant}} depolarization of satellite-to-ground communication signals could occur due {{to the presence of}} cirrus clouds in their paths. It is known that cirrus clouds basically consist of <b>ice</b> <b>needles</b> and plates. Extensive calculations have been performed for the problem of scattering by a family of <b>ice</b> <b>needles</b> and plates for various length-to-width ratios ranging from 1 to 10.

6000|$|Time rolled on, {{and with}} it the sunbeams of summer went--the snowflakes of winter came. <b>Needles</b> of <b>ice</b> began to shoot across the surface of Red River, and {{gradually}} narrowed its bed. Crystalline trees formed upon the window-panes. Icicles depended from the eaves of the houses. Snow fell in abundance on the plains; liquid nature began rapidly to solidify, and not many weeks after the first frost made its appearance everything was (as the settlers expressed it) [...] "hard and fast." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> {{has been recognized}} as a geomorphic agent of soil disturbance. The growth of <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> lifts a detached, frozen soil crust riding {{on top of the}} layer of ice. When the crust and the ice melt, the soil surface settles back irregularly. This process is what loosens the soil surface, destroying the cohesion of the soil. Once all of it dries, the wind can just remove the soil particles resulting in erosion. This erosion is most commonly seen on banks, which has a major effect on them. <b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> tends to move rocks in the soil upwards toward the surface. Then, the soil becomes infertile in those areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> - Infiltrating {{water that}} freezes within the bedrock can {{sometimes}} be forced into the cave passage.|$|E
50|$|The ice needles are {{typically}} a few centimetres long. While growing, they may lift or push away small soil particles. On sloped surfaces, <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> {{may be a}} factor contributing to soil creep.|$|E
50|$|Soft rime {{formations}} {{have the}} appearance of white <b>ice</b> <b>needles</b> and scales; they are fragile and can be easily shaken off objects.Factors that favour soft rime are small drop size, slow accretion of liquid water, high degree of supercooling, and fast dissipation of latent heat of fusion. The opposite conditions favour ice with higher densities, such as hard rime or clear ice.|$|R
40|$|Further {{insight into}} the {{structure}} and dynamics of amorphous water ice, at low temperatures, was obtained by trapping in it Ar, Ne, H 2, and D 2. Ballistic water-vapor deposition results {{in the growth of}} smooth, approximately 1 x 0. 2 micrometer 2, <b>ice</b> <b>needles.</b> The amorphous <b>ice</b> seems to exist in at least two separate forms, at T < 85 K and at 85 < T < 136. 8 K, and transform irreversibly from one form to the other through a series of temperature-dependent metastable states. The channels formed by the water hexagons in the ice are wide enough to allow the free penetration of H 2 and D 2 into the ice matrix even in the relatively compact cubic ice, resulting in H 2 -(D 2 -) to-ice ratios (by number) as high as 0. 63. The larger Ar atoms can penetrate only into the wider channels of amorphous ice, and Ne is an intermediate case. Dynamic percolation behavior explains the emergence of Ar and Ne (but not H 2 and D 2) for the ice, upon warming, in small and big gas jets. The big jets, each containing approximately 5 x 10 (10) atoms, break and propel the <b>ice</b> <b>needles.</b> Dynamic percolation also explains the collapse of the ice matrix under bombardment by Ar, at a pressure exceeding 2. 6 dyn cm- 2, and the burial of huge amounts of gas inside the collapsed matrix, up to an Ar-to-ice of 3. 3 (by number). The experimental results could be relevant to comets, icy satellites, and icy grain mantles in dense interstellar clouds...|$|R
5000|$|Precipitation {{can also}} fall in either liquid or solid phases, or {{transition}} between them. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle. Rain or drizzle which freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass gains the preceding adjective [...] "freezing", becoming known as freezing rain or freezing drizzle. Frozen forms of precipitation include snow, <b>ice</b> <b>needles,</b> sleet, hail, and graupel. Intensity is classified either by rate of fall, or by visibility restriction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> is {{essentially}} frost heaving that {{occurs at the}} beginning of the freezing season, before the freezing front has penetrated very far into the soil and there is no soil overburden to lift as a frost heave.|$|E
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when {{the temperature of the}} soil is above 0 C and the surface temperature of the air is below 0 C. The subterranean liquid water is brought to the surface via capillary action, where it freezes and contributes to a growing needle-like ice column.|$|E
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>ice</b> {{requires}} a flowing form of water underneath the surface, {{from that point}} it comes into contact with air that is below freezing. This area of the process usually occurs at night when temperature peaks its low point. From then on, it produces a needle like structure as we know as “Needle Ice”.|$|E
5000|$|Meteorological Reckoning is {{the method}} of {{measuring}} the winter season used by meteorologists based on [...] "sensible weather patterns" [...] for record keeping purposes, so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. This corresponds to the months of December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere, and June, July and August in the Southern Hemisphere. The coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in January or February in the Northern Hemisphere and in June, July or August in the Southern Hemisphere. Nighttime predominates in the winter season, and in some regions winter has {{the highest rate of}} precipitation as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures, precluding evaporation. Blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays. Diamond dust, also known as <b>ice</b> <b>needles</b> or <b>ice</b> crystals, forms at temperatures approaching -40 F due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air. [...] They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape. The Swedish meteorological institute (SMHI) define winter as when the daily mean temperatures go below 0 C for five consecutive days. According to the SMHI, winter in Scandinavia is more pronounced when Atlantic low-pressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes, leaving the path open for high-pressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur. As a result, the coldest January on record in 1987 was also the sunniest in Stockholm.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the solvability theory for free dendrite growth that includes the effects of electrically enhanced diffusion of neutral polar molecules. Our theory reveals a new instability mechanism in free dendrite growth, which arises when electrically enhanced diffusion near the dendrite tip overwhelms the stabilizing influence of surface tension. This phenomenon is closely related to the growth instability responsible for the visualization of charged particle tracks in cloud chambers, and is expected for enhanced diffusion of neutral molecules, but not for the case of ionic diffusion. Above a threshold applied potential, the crystal growth can no longer be described by the usual solvability theory, and requires a new physical mechanism to limit the growth velocity. We also describe experimental observations of the free dendrite growth of ice crystals from water vapor in supersaturated normal air. These observations demonstrate the calculated growth instability, which results in the rapid growth of branchless <b>ice</b> <b>needles</b> with a tip velocity 5 – 50 times the normal dendrite tip velocity. The production of clean <b>ice</b> <b>needles</b> is useful for the study of ice crystal growth from vapor, allowing the controlled growth of isolated single-crystal samples. This instability mechanism may find further application in crystal growth {{from a wide variety of}} polar molecules...|$|R
60|$|Winter {{was nearing}} its end when {{one morning in}} late July I ventured out of doors for the first time, though still but a skeleton, a shadow of my former self. It was a windy day of {{brilliant}} sunshine, a day I shall never forget, {{and the effect of}} the air and the sun and smell of earth and early flowers, and the sounds of wild birds, with the sight of the intensely green young grass and the vast crystal dome of heaven above, was like deep draughts of some potent liquor that made the blood dance in my veins. Oh what an inexpressible, immeasurable joy to be alive and not dead, to have my feet still on the earth, and drink in the wind and sunshine once more! But the pleasure was more than I could endure in that feeble state; the chilly wind pierced me like <b>needles</b> of <b>ice,</b> my senses swam, and I would have fallen to the ground if my elder brother had not caught me in his arms and taken me back to the house.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> to form {{there needs to}} be a process of Ice Segregation, which only occurs in a porous medium when {{supercooled}} water freezes into existing ice, growing away from the ice/water interface. As water permeates the ice, it becomes segregated into separate pieces of ice in the form of lenses, ribbons, needles, layers or strands of ice.|$|E
50|$|Types {{of frost}} flowers include <b>needle</b> <b>ice,</b> frost pillars or frost columns, {{extruded}} from pores in the soil, and ice ribbons, rabbit frost or rabbit ice, extruded from linear fissures in plant stems. While the term ice flower {{is also used}} as synonym to ice ribbons, it {{may be used to}} describe the unrelated phenomenon of window frost as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being manipulated for medical and energy applications, capillary pressure is the cause behind various natural phenomena as well. For example, <b>needle</b> <b>ice,</b> seen in cold soil, occurs via capillary action. The first major contributions {{to the study of}} <b>needle</b> <b>ice,</b> or simply, frost heaving were made by Stephen Taber (1929) and Gunnar Beskow (1935), who independently aimed to understand soil freezing. Taber’s initial work was related to understanding how the size of pores within the ground influenced the amount of frost heave. He also discovered that frost heave is favorable for crystal growth and that a gradient of soil moisture tension drives water upward toward the freezing front {{near the top of the}} ground. In Beskow’s studies, he defined this soil moisture tension as “capillary pressure” (and soil water as “capillary water”). Beskow determined that the soil type and effective stress on the soil particles influenced frost heave, where effective stress is the sum of pressure from above ground and the capillary pressure.|$|E
40|$|Multiparameter {{radar and}} {{polarized}} microwave radiative transfer models for arbitrarily shaped particles are developed. The ice crystals modeled are horizontally oriented hexagonal plates, columns, and <b>needles.</b> The <b>ice</b> water content is fixed at 0. 1 g/cu m, and a realistic size distribution is used. The radar modeling {{is done for}} S through K-band, and the passive microwave calculations are at 37, 85, and 157 GHz. The modeling results show that particle shape is important for both multiparameter radar and passive microwave radiometry. Radar reflectivity and upwelling microwave brightness temperatures depend strongly on the individual particle volume, which in turn depends on the ice crystal shape. Radar differential reflectivity is high for the plates and lower for needles and columns. Linear depolarization calculations indicate that oblate ice crystals such as plates can be distinguished from prolate crystals such as columns. At 85 and 157 GHz, significant polarization brightness temperature differences are calculated for plates and columns. The particle bulk density strongly affects the radar and radiometer observables. Recent measurements of ice crystals are discussed {{to show that the}} model results have practical applicability...|$|R
50|$|There {{are seven}} {{different}} copy abilities, and any two can be merged {{to create a}} new one. The seven basic abilities are Burning, Stone, <b>Ice,</b> <b>Needle,</b> Bomb, Spark, and Cutter. Though Kirby only needs one element in his body to gain an extra attack, copy abilities can also be merged with abilities of the same type for more powerful versions of the basic abilities. In total, there are 35 abilities to combine and stand-alone. Usually, combined ones are stronger or have added effects. This is the only game in the Kirby series where Kirby can combine copy abilities (save for the very restricted combinations with the Sword and Bomb abilities in Kirby: Squeak Squad).|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a dual diffusion chamber for observing ice crystal growth from water vapor in air {{as a function}} of temperature and supersaturation. In the first diffusion chamber, thin c-axis <b>ice</b> <b>needles</b> with tip radii ~ 100 nm are grown to lengths of ~ 2 mm. The needle crystals are then transported to a second diffusion chamber where the temperature and supersaturation can be independently controlled. By creating a linear temperature gradient in the second chamber, convection currents are suppressed and the supersaturation can be modeled with high accuracy. The c-axis needle crystals provide a unique starting geometry compared with other experiments, and the dual diffusion chamber allows rapid quantitative observations of ice growth behavior over a wide range of environmental conditions...|$|R

50|$|With this {{equation}} and model, Everett noted {{the behavior of}} water and ice given different pressure conditions at the solid-liquid interface. Everett determined that if {{the pressure of the}} ice is equal to the pressure of the liquid underneath the surface, ice growth is unable to continue into the capillary. Thus, with additional heat loss, it is most favorable for water to travel up the capillary and freeze in the top cylinder (as <b>needle</b> <b>ice</b> continues to grow atop itself above the soil surface). As the pressure of the ice increases, a curved interface between the solid and liquid arises and the ice will either melt, or equilibrium will be reestablished so that further heat loss again leads to ice formation. Overall, Everett determined that frost heaving (analogous to the development of <b>needle</b> <b>ice)</b> occurs {{as a function of the}} pore size in the soil and the energy at the interface of ice and water. Unfortunately, the downside to Everett's model is that he did not consider soil particle effects on the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Stratiform or dynamic {{precipitation}} {{occurs as}} a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as over surface cold fronts, and over and ahead of warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. [...] A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. [...] Precipitation may occur on celestial bodies other than Earth. When it gets cold, Mars has precipitation that most likely takes the form of <b>ice</b> <b>needles,</b> rather than rain or snow.|$|R
40|$|We present {{measurements}} {{of the growth of}} long columnar ice crystals from water vapor over a broad range of temperatures and supersaturation levels in air. Starting with thin, c-axis <b>ice</b> <b>needle</b> crystals, we observed their subsequent growth behavior in a vapor diffusion chamber, extracting the initial radial growth velocities of the needles under controlled conditions. Approximating the hexagonal needle crystals as infinitely long cylinders, we created an analytical growth model that includes effects from particle diffusion of water molecules through the surrounding air along with the diffusion of heat generated by solidification. With only minimal adjustment of model parameters, we obtained excellent agreement with our experimental data. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the combined effects from particle and heat diffusion have been measured in ice growth from water vapor. This analysis further provides an accurate method for calibration of the water-vapor supersaturation levels in experimental growth chambers...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the electrically enhanced growth of needle crystals from the vapor phase, {{for which there}} exists a morphological instability above a threshold applied potential. Our improved theoretical treatment of this phenomenon shows that the instability is present in both polar and non-polar systems, and we provide an extension of solvability theory to include electrical effects. We present extensive experimental data for <b>ice</b> <b>needle</b> growth above the electrical threshold, where at T=- 5 C high-velocity shape-preserving growth is observed. These data indicate that the needle tip assumes an effective radius R^∗ which is nearly independent of both supersaturation and the applied potential. The small scale of R^∗ and its response to chemical additives suggest that the needle growth rate is being limited primarily by structural instabilities, possibly related to surface melting. We also demonstrate experimentally that non-polar systems exhibit this same electrically induced morphological instability...|$|R
