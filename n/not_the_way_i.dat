500|$|In 2005 and 2006, {{after making}} several public {{appearances}} clearly intoxicated (on the Late Show with David Letterman and the Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson) and suffering drug-related arrests and probation violations, Love {{was sentenced to}} six months in lockdown rehab due to struggles with prescription drugs and cocaine. She has stated she has been sober since 2007, and cited her Buddhist practice as vital to her sobriety. In a 2011 interview, she said: [...] "I've been maligned as this drug freak for years, [...] that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> live anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{international}} fixtures, Arsenal {{did not play}} another game for two weeks. On the resumption of club football, they faced newly promoted Portsmouth at home. Striker Teddy Sheringham gave the visitors a deserved lead, before Arsenal were awarded a penalty when Pirès was adjudged to have been fouled in the penalty area by Dejan Stefanović. Henry scored, and though their performance noticeably improved in the second half, the game ended in a draw. Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp complained about the penalty decision post-match and felt Pirès [...] "…was {{going to get a}} yellow card [...]" [...] The player himself denied accusations that he deceived the referee: [...] "I did not dive and I am not a cheat. That is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knowing My Enemy (2002) was a {{large-scale}} installation created by Emin for her Modern Art Oxford solo show of that year. Consisting of reclaimed wood and steel, Emin created a wooden [...] "look-out" [...] house upon a long, broken, wooden pier. It's <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> Want to Die (2005) was another large-scale installation, part of Emin's 2005 solo show at White Cube. Emin created a large rollercoaster track with reclaimed timber and metal. Displayed {{in the same}} show was a smaller installation work called Self Portrait (2005) which consisted of a tin bath, bamboo, wire and neon light. Another related installation Sleeping With You (2005) consisted of painted reclaimed timber and a thin neon light across a dark wall.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} for Yorkshire, he {{struggled}} for form and was {{left out of}} the England Test and ODI squads to face Sri Lanka. In the County Championship he managed 25wickets at an average of 41.00. In September, Shahzad was reprimanded for scuffing the pitch during the penultimate Championship match against Warwickshire and fined £750. The club was relegated from the First Division in the final match of the season. Shahzad regretted the incident, explaining [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> want to play my game. I don't {{want to be seen as}} a cheat, or a pitch-damager.... It's one mistake I've made in an eight- or nine-year career so far. It's out of the blue for me, and I definitely would never do anything like it again. It was just a random, stupid act." [...] Despite a trying year, Shahzad was selected in the England Performance Programme held over the English off-season.|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Michael Schumacher accused Coulthard of [...] "unsporting behaviour" [...] in {{the battle}} for the race lead. The {{accusation}} arose from Coulthard's minor collision with the Ferrari driver. Michael Schumacher believed that Coulthard was driving dangerously: [...] "He [...] ran in a way that he thought it [...] could happen, and he didn't try to avoid that, that's pretty simple. As he is not fighting for the championship.....I {{just want to make sure}} that we don't see teammates helping the drivers fighting for the championship in the way which is not appropriate." [...] Coulthard denied any wrongdoing: [...] "I could have easily pushed him off the circuit. But I didn't and I won't in the future because it is not sporting and it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> do things." [...] There was similar ill-feeling between Trulli and Button after their collision on lap two. Trulli called the Williams driver an [...] "idiot" [...] and accused him of [...] "driving like a crazy". Button defended his actions and suggested that Trulli had moved slightly towards him although he believed he took the right line. He also believed Trulli moved towards him under braking.|$|E
2500|$|But {{despite all}} the fanfare {{surrounding}} the big-money contract the Nets gave Borg {{and the presence of}} one of the world's top male players on the team, Nets owner Joe Zingale found a way to shine the spotlight even brighter on his team when he signed transsexual Renée Richards to a contract on June 2. At the press conference announcing her signing, Richards said, [...] "I am thankful that I'm being given the opportunity to play professional tennis at the level that I have tried to play, but which has been met with so much frustration that I have been unable to do." [...] When he was asked about whether WTT had approved Richards as a female player, Zingale said, [...] "I didn't ask them. That's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> work. There's a lot of politics involved when you try to get approval from everybody for such a move." [...] At the time of the signing, Richards was embroiled in litigation with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) which had denied her entry into the United States Open Tennis Championships as a female player, because she refused to take the Barr body test of her chromosomes as required by USTA rules. Not wanting to lock horns with the USTA, WTT ruled Richards not eligible to play as a female player until her court case was decided.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” he said; “but <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> {{think you}} mean. She {{was my best}} friend’s sweetheart, and nothing to me. No doubt she has married him by now.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] replied Oldbuck, knowingly,--"I {{begin to}} {{understand}} your application of my ancestor's motto. You are a candidate for public favour, though <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> first suspected,--you are ambitious to shine as a literary character, and you hope to merit favour by labour and perseverance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me {{all about}} it," [...] Elma cried, {{nestling}} close to her new friend with a wild burst of relief. [...] "I don't know why, but I'm not at all ashamed of it all before you, Miss Ewes--at least, <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> am before mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, Mr. Reynolds, I cannot oblige you in {{this little}} matter, but that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> do business. Come along, Killeen; hurry, it's getting d----d cold here by the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, George, congratulate you! <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> {{should have}} ridden the race myself. He should have lain {{off to the}} distance. Remarkable turn of speed that horse. There's no riding nowadays!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Vanderbank was but too {{ready to}} satisfy him. [...] "I dare say {{we seem to}} you a vulgar lot of people. That's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> can see, you speak of ladies at Beccles." ...|$|E
30|$|The pattern applied on {{the paper}} with Hubba-Bubba-chewing gum is ugly. It did <b>not</b> turn out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> thought or felt in my mouth (Table 1 : Picture 1).|$|R
5000|$|... “If I {{could shoot}} a game bird and still <b>not</b> hurt it, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> {{can take a}} trout and release it, I doubt if I would kill another one.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, It's all serene. I think I {{know how}} to fix it now. You two can get behind those trees, or where you like, as long as you're <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> don't want no 'sistance. When Jem Burt takes a job in hand he carries it through in a workmanlike manner. I don't want nobody else foolin' around." ...|$|R
60|$|That was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> {{ended it}} first--but unsymmetrically, preposterously, illogically, out of passion, without art--like {{a song of}} the people. Will you have it? The last Parthian shaft of a forlorn Cupid at the King's left breast, and all left-handedness and under-handedness.|$|E
6000|$|Hilda {{looked back}} at him with a sudden look of earnest deprecation. 'Not that way, Mr. Berkeley,' she said quietly: 'not that way, please: you'll hurt me if you do: you know that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> look at the matter. Why not simply [...] "Hilda"?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, dame, I {{promised that}} you should have it your own way with the poor lass,' said my father; 'and I see no harm in the lad, but I own I should like to know more of him, and Meg would not object either. It was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> took thee, Margaret.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{loved you}} first, Paula, and, though you did respond, it was <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> same <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> never took you off your feet. It seems {{pretty clear that}} Evan has." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, it did decide it, but <b>not</b> {{exactly in}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> anticipated. I {{can look back}} on the whole affair quite calmly now, but I wouldn't live it over again for all the wealth of Ind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all points!" [...] I said impulsively. [...] "There {{must have}} been a weak spot somewhere, or he wouldn't be lying here like that!" [...] Somehow his impassiveness {{surprised}} me. I had expected that he would find a valid argument in my phrase; but it did not move him, at least <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> thought. Something like a smile flickered over his swarthy face as he answered me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you want}} to look like the portico of the Madeleine when it's draped for a funeral?" [...] her instructress mocked. [...] "Never, never. I don't believe you're various: that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> see you. You're pure tragedy, with de grands éclats de voix in the great style, or you're nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a particle, nor {{in most of}} these. I {{have given}} them what they wanted and taken back the {{confidence}} and respect they didn't care for. It is wrong, I know, but I can't bear to think all the seeming goodwill and friendliness I've been enjoying was insincere and for a purpose. That's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> treat people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, but I do; {{everything}} {{to give and}} nothin to get--that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> have managed to live. But it's not that altogether, neither. I'm not begrudging Anty anything for herself; but that I'd be dhriven to let that blagguard of a brother of hers into the house, and that as a frind like, is what I didn't think I'd ever have put upon me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! it {{is nothing}} very much," [...] {{answered}} Lady Bellamy for him; [...] "only he requires care. What a lovely garden this is--is it <b>not?</b> By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> forgot to inquire after the ladies who shared your tumble. I hope that they were none the worse. I was much struck with one of them, the very pretty person with the brown hair, whom you {{pulled out of the}} gutter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{in which}} <b>I</b> {{desire to keep}} a good hat on my head," [...] said Hamel, as he seated himself in the little {{carriage}} which was to take him down to Callerfoot.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Joly began {{appearing}} in the ITV hidden camera show Fool Britannia. After two series Joly quit saying - [...] "it's <b>not</b> panning out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> wanted - once you add canned laughter, {{a little piece of}} me dies...".|$|R
6000|$|... "You may do so, my child. After {{this night}} I dare not hinder you. Go with my blessing, and may God guide and keep you, {{and make you}} strong to do His work and tell His message to {{humanity}} in you own appointed way. It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> desired for you--but I see that I was mistaken. Old Abel spoke truly when {{he said there was}} a Christ in your violin as well as a devil. I understand what he meant now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, {{there are}} sacrifices {{for both of}} us, and I can't make them either. I daresay it's all right for you, but for me {{it would be a}} terrible mistake. When I think I'm doing a certain thing I mustn't do just the opposite," [...] she kept on as for true lucidity. [...] "There are things I've thought of, the things I like best; and they're not what you mean. It would be a great deception, and it's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> see my life, and it would be misery if we don't understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There wasn't any moral {{government}} of the universe? <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> see it," [...] said Westover. [...] "A tree brings forth of its kind. As a man sows he reaps. It's dead sure, pitilessly sure. Jeff Durgin sowed success, in a certain way, and he's reaping it. He once said to me, when I tried to waken his conscience, that he should get where {{he was trying to}} go if he was strong enough, and being good {{had nothing to do with}} it. I believe now he was right. But he was wrong too, as such a man always is. That kind of tree bears Dead Sea apples, after all. He sowed evil, and he must reap evil. He may never know it, but he will reap what he has sown. The dreadful thing is that others must share in his harvest. What do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you think, father, {{that you}} ought to talk to me quite like that?" [...] she asked. [...] "Don't you know me well enough to be sure that I should never get into what you call a mess--at least, <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> suppose you mean? My heart and thought are my own, and I shall be {{prepared}} to render account of them; for the rest, you need not be afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will think}} {{no more of}} it," [...] she said resolutely to herself. [...] "I have chosen to be a nurse and I will go through with it. I think when I get home after this is over I will become a nursing sister--at any rate I may do some good at that; {{there is plenty of}} work in the world, even if it is <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> thought of doing it." ...|$|R
60|$|I mounted {{and rode}} amain, <b>not</b> by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> had come, but westward; not by road, but by bridle-paths, through meadow-land and forest, up hill and down, {{like a man}} entranced, not knowing whither I went nor caring.|$|R
