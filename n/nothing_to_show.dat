5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E
25|$|By 1966, {{despite being}} one of the highest-grossing live acts in the country and scoring many {{successful}} singles, including four UK Top 10 chart hits, financially the band had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for their efforts. After a messy confrontation with the notorious Arden who tried to face down the boys' parents by claiming that the whole band were using drugs, they broke with both Arden and Decca.|$|E
25|$|Disturbed at {{how easily}} {{the party is}} {{defeated}} in combat by Ravus, Gladiolus begins to question his ability to protect Noctis {{in his role as}} the King's Shield. Seeking the means to acquire greater power, he calls upon Cor Leonis to accompany him to the Tempering Grounds, a network of millennia-old caverns where generations of Crownsguard soldiers have sought to prove their strength against Gilgamesh, the Blademaster. Cor agrees, but warns Gladiolus that by venturing into the caverns he faces certain death and that even if he survives, he may have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for it.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese Augustinians {{were the}} next missionaries to follow; they {{took charge of}} the oratory built over the grave of the Apostle, and built their priory and church {{adjoining}} it. In the meantime the Dominican missions in the surrounding country gained so much in importance, that in 1540 Fre. Bernardo da Cruz, O.P., was consecrated and sent out to tend them. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> when the Fathers of the Society of Jesus settled at Saint Thomas, but by 1648 they had a college in the place and a church and residence at Mylapur, while St. Francis Xavier spent three months in 1545 at Saint Thomas praying at the grave of the Apostle for light in regard to his projected mission to Japan.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of General Flagg, Hawk assumes command of the G.I. Joe team, but is still advised by General Austin. Operations at The Pit keep him busy, so Hawk relegates field command to Duke. When General Austin later suffers a heart attack, he retires and {{promotes}} Hawk to Brigadier General, giving him command of the entire G.I. Joe operation. After the G.I. Joe team invades the Cobra-controlled town of Springfield and has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for it, the team {{is in danger of}} being shut down. Hawk accepts full responsibility, and meets with three high-ranking military officers deep in the otherwise empty Pit, when the facility is attacked by Cobra's Battle Android Troopers. Two of the generals are killed, but the survivor General Hollingsworth reactivates the team, and puts Hawk back in command.|$|E
25|$|While Dupont lingered at Andújar {{with two}} {{divisions}} (Generals Barbou and Fresia), attempting {{to master the}} strategic Madrid—Seville highway and the wide plains which it crossed, Castaños' four divisions advanced steadily {{from the south and}} guerrillas from Granada marched to bar the road to the sierra and La Mancha beyond. Vedel's division was posted east to Bailén with a view to guarding these nearby mountain passes and on July 1 Vedel was forced to dispatch a brigade under General Cassagne to curb the advance of the guerrillas on Jaén and La Carolina, stretching the French line still further east. Meanwhile, General Liger-Belair with 1,500 men moved into a forward post at Mengibar, a village on the south bank of the Guadalquivir. At Andújar a tower by the river was fortified and small field works constructed on the south bank to forestall an enemy crossing, but, the Guadalquivir being fordable at so many points, and open to fire from the surrounding hills, Dupont's defences did not inspire much confidence. Cassagne, after driving the guerrillas off in rout, returned to Bailén on July 5 with 200 dead or wounded and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for his exertion—the Spaniards having plundered the towns of all provisions.|$|E
50|$|One final {{attempt was}} made by ABC <b>to</b> save the <b>show</b> by putting it on in prime time. The episode (broadcast on April 23, 1982) was {{scheduled}} against Dallas, which did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> help the <b>show's</b> moribund ratings. The series was promptly canceled.|$|R
60|$|Roderick {{said that}} he could offer them <b>nothing</b> but <b>to</b> <b>show</b> them the great terrace, with its view; and ten minutes later the group was {{assembled}} there. Mrs. Light was extravagant in her satisfaction; Christina looked away at the Sabine mountains, in silence. The prince stood by, frowning at the rapture of the elder lady.|$|R
60|$|I {{have found}} <b>nothing</b> tending <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that King James was ever {{made aware of}} Sprot’s confessions of forgery. It is true that Sir William Hart, the Lord Justice, went to Court after Sprot’s death, and, in September, the Scottish Privy Council asked James to send him home again. {239} But Hart need not have told all the truth to James.|$|R
25|$|Three Union {{troops were}} {{known to have been}} killed in the battle and more than forty were {{slightly}} wounded by splinters. The Onondaga was only slightly damaged in the action and none of her crew are known to have been harmed. According to official records the rebels lost four killed on the Drewry and the Scorpion plus fifteen wounded. However, some sources cite the rebels as having lost at least six men on the Virginia II alone. Ultimately the Confederate force failed in its main objective of attacking City Point and they had to return to Chaffin's Bluff with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for the advance other than a mess for ships, most of which sustained some type of battle damage. Commodore Mitchell was relieved of command and replaced by Admiral Raphael Semmes, who commanded CSS Alabama in her battle with USS Kearsarge off Cherbourg, France. Exactly two months after the battle, the Petersburg Campaign ended with General Robert E. Lee's final decision to evacuate the city. When the Southern capital of Richmond fell on April 3, the James River Squadron was scuttled to prevent their falling into enemy hands. The battle of Trent's Reach was the last important naval engagement of the Main Eastern Theater.|$|E
25|$|Japanese espionage against Pearl Harbor {{involved}} {{at least two}} Abwehr agents. One of them, Otto Kuhn, was a sleeper agent living in Hawaii with his family. Kuhn was incompetent {{and there is no}} evidence he provided information of value. The other, Yugoslavian businessman Dusko Popov, was a double agent, working for the XX Committee of MI5. In August 1941, he was sent by the Abwehr to the U.S., with an assignment list that included specific questions about military facilities in Oahu, including Pearl Harbor. Although British Security Coordination introduced Popov to the FBI, the Americans seem to have paid little attention. It is possible that previous propaganda and forged or unreliable intelligence from the British contributed to J. Edgar Hoover's dismissing Popov's interest in Pearl Harbor as unimportant. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his assignment list was passed on to military intelligence, nor was he allowed to visit Hawaii. Popov later asserted his list was a clear warning of the attack, ignored by the bungling FBI. The questions in his list were rambling and general, and in no way pointed to air attack on Pearl Harbor. Prange considered Popov's claim overblown, and argued the notorious questionnaire was a product of Abwehr thoroughness.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer's Enemy" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{directed}} by Jim Reardon and executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein.

[...] The idea for the episode was first conceived by Bill Oakley who thought that Homer should have an enemy. The thought evolved into the concept of a [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results.

500|$|Despite {{the lower}} price console's {{positioning}} as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega {{had a difficult}} time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. [...] Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems. The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz. [...] Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was [...] "a technological dead-end", many developers decided not to make games for the system. [...] Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X. [...] According to Bayless, [...] "games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way. [...] Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch. [...] By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off what the hardware was capable of." ...|$|E

2500|$|Negative {{stories about}} Wolfe {{by the women}} who {{wrestled}} for him are legend.

Due to his managerial contract with her {{he was able to}} leave Burke penniless when she divorced him, taking all of their marital assets and leaving her with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for decades of hundreds of wrestling matches per year. The horror stories of Wolfe led {{to the success of the}} far more ethical manager Jack Pfeffer and of Moolah herself. In her autobiography, Moolah ultimately felt great sorrow for Wolfe because of the number of personal tragedies he suffered later in life. Despite being highly criticized for his morals, Wolfe was responsible for making women’s wrestling profitable. Instead of being viewed as a sideshow, Wolfe tried to make it respectable. Part of Wolfe’s contributions to women’s wrestling was the creation of a tag team title and the integration of African-American wrestlers.|$|E
2500|$|More revolts followed, some led by {{champions of}} the {{traditional}} Ethiopian Church. One revolt which resisted all of Susenyos' efforts to put down was by the Agaw in Lasta. Their first leader was Melka Krestos, a distant member of the Solomonic dynasty, whom the Agaw had recruited. Susenyos' first campaign against them, which began in February 1629 with raising an army of 30,000 men in Gojjam, was defeated and his son-in-law Gebra Krestos slain. While Melka Krestos' master of horse was slain along with 4000 men not long after while pillaging Tigray, {{at the same time}} the men of Lasta made a successful raid out of their mountains into Susenyos' territory. When he attempted a second expedition against the rebels in Lasta, Susenyos found his men's morale so low that he was forced to allow them to observe one of the traditional Wednesday fasts—which brought an immediate reproach from the Catholic Patriarch. Although Susenyos eloquently defended himself, Bruce notes that [...] "from this time, it plainly appears, that Socinios began to entertain ideas, at least of the church discipline and government, very opposite to those he had when he first embraced the Romish religion."
