They've been carrying out atrocities since 1992. We must not permit the genocide that Milosevic has in mind for Kosovo to continue. We are at a critical hour." [...] He was critical of past inaction by the Clinton administration in the matter, and within days was urging {{that the use of}} ground troops not be ruled out. [...] McCain became a very frequent guest on television talk shows discussing the conflict, and his [...] "We are in it, <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> win it" [...] stance drew much attention. [...] On March 31, three American soldiers were captured by Yugoslavia; the next day, McCain canceled his planned roadshow, stating [...] "this is not an appropriate time to launch a political campaign." [...] He received media praise for his action and continued to be a highly visible spokesman for strong action regarding Kosovo; CNN pundit Mark Shields said that, [...] "In thirty-five years in Washington, I have never seen a debate dominated by an individual in the minority party as I've seen this one dominated by John McCain." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, the United States {{attempted}} {{to weaken the}} Cuban Economy by bombing {{thousands of acres of}} sugarcane fields. After the USSR and Cuba reestablished their diplomatic relations in May 1960, the USSR began to buy Cuban sugar in exchange for oil. When oil refineries like, Shell, Texaco, and Esso refused to refine Soviet oil, Castro nationalized that industry as well, taking over the refineries on the island. Days later in response, the United States cut the Cuban Sugar Quota completely, Eisenhower was quoted saying [...] "This action amounts to economic sanctions against, Cuba. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> look ahead to other moves - economic, diplomatic, and strategic".|$|E

[...] "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." [...] Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 527, 559, [...] (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting). It has been nearly 140 years since Frederick Douglass asked the intellectual ancestors of the Law School to [...] "o nothing with us!" [...] and the Nation adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> wait another 25 years to see this principle of equality vindicated. I therefore respectfully dissent from {{the remainder of the}} Court's opinion and the judgment.|$|E
