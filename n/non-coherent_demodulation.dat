After introducing {{the theory behind}} the <b>Non-Coherent</b> BFSK <b>demodulation</b> implemented at the receiver, the design of transmitter and receiver is illustrated. The design environment of choice is Mathworks'Â® Simulink and XilinxÂ® System Generator, a dedicated library for Mathworks' Simulink. The design is downloaded to a Virtex- 4 FPGA. The receiver is Non-Coherent (NC) {{in the sense that}} the receiver need not know the phase of the incoming signal. A feedback circuit is responsible for both packet and bit synchronization. Also, the receiver is implemented using non-coherent match filters instead of low pass filters which would be easier, but would degrade the performance. Finally, some interesting experiences that were gained during the learning process are discussed. In Appendix A, we evaluate different technological options in implementing communication modulating techniques and Software Defined Radio.

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{analysis}} and design of ultra-low power radio transceivers operating at microwave frequencies. Hybrid prototypes and Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) which achieve power consumptions of less than 1 mW and theoretical operating ranges of over 10 m are described. The motivation behind the design of circuits exhibiting ultra low power consumption and, {{in the case of}} the MMICs, small size is the emerging technology of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). WSNs consist of spatially distributed ‘nodes’ or ‘specks’ each with their own renewable energy source, one or more sensors, limited memory, processing capability and radio or optical link. The idea is that specks within a ‘speckzone’ cooperate and share computational resources to perform complex tasks such as monitoring fire hazards, radiation levels or for motion tracking. The radio section must be ultra low power e. g. sub 1 mW in order not to drain the limited battery capacity. The radio must also be small in size e. g. less than 5 x 5 mm so that the overall speck size is small. Also, the radio must still be able to operate over a range of at least a metre so as to allow radio contact between, for example, rooms or relatively distant specks. The unsuitability of conventional homodyne topologies to WSNs is discussed and more efficient methods of modulation (On-Off Keying) and <b>demodulation</b> (<b>non-coherent)</b> are presented. Furthermore, it is shown how Super-Regenerative Receivers (SRR) can be used to achieve relatively large output voltages for small input powers. This is important because baseband Op-Amps connected at the RF receiver output generally cannot amplify small signals at the input without the output being saturated in noise (10 mV is the smallest measured input for 741 Op-Amp). Instrumentation amplifiers are used in this work as they can amplify signals below 1 mV. The thesis details {{the analysis and}} design of basic RF building blocks: amplifiers, oscillators, switches and detectors. It also details how the circuits can be put together to make transceivers as well as describing various strategies to lower power consumption. In addition, novel techniques in both circuit and system design are presented which allow the power consumption of the radio to be reduced by as much as 97 % whilst still retaining adequate performance. These techniques are based on duty cycling the transmitter and receiver and are possible because of the discontinuous nature of the On-Off Keying signal. In order to ease the sensitivity requirements of the baseband receive amplifier a design methodology for large output voltage receivers is presented. The designed receiver is measured to give a 5 mV output for an input power of - 90 dBm and yet consumes less than 0. 7 mW. There is also an appendix on the non linear modelling of the Glasgow University 50 nm InP meta-morphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (50 nm mHEMT) and one on the non linear modelling of a commercial Step Recovery diode (SRD).

The proposed algorithm shows improved performance over previously proposed communication schemes, both coherent and non-coherent, for channels with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and high carrier phase noise. The novel algorithm utilizes a modified “two dimensional ” Bit-Carrierphase A Posteriori Probability (BCAPP) decoder containing additional states representing the received carrier phase. The BCAPP decoder calculates two extrinsic metrics; one representing the bit soft value and the other representing the received carrier phase Probability Density Function (PDF) approximation.

The CMX 9600 is a 9. 6 KC/s, Bi-Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) modem using a 70 -MHz IF and synchronous matched-filter detection. As we reported at the 1989 Small Satellite Conference, many small satellite systems use Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) for communications. FSK is a sub-optimal modulation which suffers a best-case 3 dB degradation in signal-to-noise ratio when coherently demodulated. When <b>non-coherent</b> <b>demodulation</b> is used, as it often is, additional degradation in signal-to-noise ratio occurs. Antipodal phase modulations, such as Bi-Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and Quadra-Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) are optimal modulations which do not suffer the signal-to-noise ratio degradations of FSK. Thus, when phase-modulation is used for downlinking, the satellite 2 ̆ 7 s transmitter power can be decreased. This saved power is available for payload and bus operations. Or, a smaller satellite with less solar cell area may be used.

Based on this analysis, an asymptotic optimization is performed in order to design the optimized LDPC channel code profiles, for a CSK-modulated signal, in an AWGN propagation channel and for iterative decoding. From these results, finite length parity-check matrices have been generated thanks to state of the art algorithms such as the Progressive Edge Growth (PEG) algorithm, and simulation results are presented. Finally, in an AWGN context, the current GPS L 1 C subframe 2 (used as a benchmark) demodulation performance is compared to the demodulation performance obtained for CSK-modulated signals with 2 bits and 6 bits per CSK symbol, protected by different optimized LDPC channel codes and iteratively decoded. The results show that a CSK-modulated signal iteratively decoded and implementing the LDPC codes optimized in this work, exhibits a decoding gain of 0. 6 dB for 2 bits per CSK symbol and of 1. 2 dB for 6 bits per CSK symbol with respect to the current GPS L 1 C subframe 2 LDPC code. The study has been made in an AWGN propagation channel as a first step, but results are really promising for urban propagation channels...|$|E
40|$|MEMS Sensors {{are widely}} used for sensing {{inertial}} displacements. The displacements arising out of acceleration /Coriolis effect are typically {{in the range of}} 1 nm- 1 m. This work investigates the realization of high resolution MEMS inertial sensors using novel displacement sensing mechanisms. Capacitance sensing ASIC is developed as part of conventional electronics interface with MEMS sensor under the conventional CMOS-MEMS integration strategy. The capacitance sense ASIC based on Continuous Time Voltage scheme with coherent and <b>non-coherent</b> <b>demodulation</b> is prototyped on AMS 0. 35 m technology. The ASIC was tested to sense C = 3. 125 fF over a base of 2 pF using on-chip built-in test capacitors. Dynamic performance of this ASIC was validated by interfacing with a DaCM MEMS accelerometer. 200 milli-g of acceleration (equivalent to a C = 2. 8 fF) over an input frequency of 20 Hz is measurable using the developed ASIC. The observed sensitivity is 90 mV/g. The ASIC has several programmable features such as variation in trim capacitance (3. 125 fF- 12. 5 pF), bandwidth selection (500 Hz- 20 kHz) and variable gain options (2 - 100). Capacitance detection, a dominant sensing principle in MEMs sensors, experiences inherent limitation due to the role of parasitics when the displacements of interest are below 5 nm range. The capacitive equivalence (C) for the range of displacements of the order of 5 nm and below would vary in the range atto-to-zepto farad. Hence {{there is a need to}} explore alternative sensing schemes which preferably yield higher sensitivity (than those offered by the conventional integration schemes) and are based on the principle of built-in transduction to help overcome the influence of parasitics on sensitivity. In this regard, 3 non-conventional architectures are explored which fall under the direct integration classification namely: (a) 	Sub-threshold based sensing (b) 	Fringe field based sensing and (c) 	Tunneling current based sensing. a) 	In Sub-threshold based sensing, FET with a suspended gate is used for displacement sensing. The FET is biased in the sub-threshold region of operation. The exponential modulation of drain current for a change in displacement of 1 nm is evaluated using TCAD, and the in uence of initial air-gap variation on the sensitivity factor (ID=ID) is brought out. For 1 % change in air gap displacement (i. e., TGap/TGap, the gap variation resulting due to the inertial force / mass loading) nearly 1050 % change in drain current(ID=ID) is observed (considering initial air gaps of the order 100 nm). This validates the high sensitivity offered by the device in this regime of operation. A comparison of sensitivity estimate using the capacitive equivalence model and TCAD simulated model for different initial air-gaps in a FD-SOI FET is brought out. The influence of FDSOI FET device parameters on sensitivity, namely the variation of TSi, TBox, NA and TGap are explored. CMOS compatibility and fabrication feasibility of this architecture was looked into by resorting to the post processing approach used for validating the sub-threshold bias concept. The IMD layers of the Bulk FETs fabricated through AMS 0. 35 technology were etched using BHF and IPA mixture to result in a free standing metal (Al) layers acting as the suspended gate. The performance estimate is carried out considering specific Equivalent Gap Thickness (EGT) of 573 nm and 235 nm, to help overcome the role of coupled electrostatics in influencing the sensitivity metric. The sensitivity observed by biasing this post processed bulk FET in sub-threshold is 114 % (ID=ID change) for a 59 % (d/d change). The equivalent C in this case is 370 aF. b) In Fringe eld based sensing approach, a JunctionLess FET (JLFET) is used as a depletion mode device and an out-of-plane gate displacement would help modulate the device pinch-o voltage due to fringe field coupling. The resulting change in the gate fringe field due to this displacement modulates the drain current of the JunctionLess FET. The displacement induced fringe field change (relative to the FET channel) brings about a distinct shift in the ID-VG characteristics of the JLFET. For displacement d = 2 nm, the JLFET with a channel doping of ND = 8 X 1018 cm 3 and a bias point of VG = - 47. 7 V, 98 % enhancement in sensitivity is observed in 3 D TCAD simulations. The equivalent C in this case is 29 zF. The role of ground-planes in the device operation is explored. c) In the tunneling current based sensing approach, the beams fabricated using the SOI-MUMPS process are FIB milled so as to create very ne air gaps of the order of nearly 85 nm. Under high electric fields of the order > 8 MV/cm, the lateral displacement based tunneling sensor offers enhanced change in sensitivity for an induced external force at a fixed DC bias. When integrated as an array with varying electrode overlap, this technique can track displacements over a wide range. With the initial beam overlap as 1. 2 m, for a lateral displacement of 1. 2 m, a 100 % change in sensitivity (ID=ID) is observed. The effect of fringe field can be completely neglected here unlike its capacitive beam equivalent...|$|E
