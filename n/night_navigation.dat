25|$|The RAF night bombing {{campaign}} against military objectives in German towns began on 11 May. The small forces available were given ambitious objectives, but lacked <b>night</b> <b>navigation</b> capability and their isolated inaccurate attacks were thought by the Germans to be intended to terrorise civilians. From 4 July the RAF achieved some successes with raids on Channel ports, anticipating the build {{up for an}} invasion.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} National Waterways was {{introduced}} in 1982 to promote the development of inland water transport in the country. At present, out of six declared National Waterways, developmental works are being carried out on NW-1, 2, and 3 only by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI). The first three National Waterways (NW-1, 2 & 3) are being developed for shipping and navigation by providing basic inland transport infrastructural facilities, including navigational channel with required depth and width, aids for day and <b>night</b> <b>navigation,</b> and terminals at selected locations for berthing and loading/unloading of vessels.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{inaccuracy}} {{of celestial}} navigation for <b>night</b> <b>navigation</b> and target finding in a fast moving aircraft, the Luftwaffe developed radio navigation devices and relied on three systems: Knickebein (Crooked leg), X-Gerät (X-Device), and Y-Gerät (Y-Device). This led the British to develop countermeasures, which {{became known as}} the Battle of the Beams. Bomber crews already had some experience with the Lorenz beam, a commercial blind-landing aid for night or bad weather landings. The Germans adapted the short-range Lorenz system into Knickebein, a 30–33MHz system, which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signals. Two aerials at ground stations were rotated so that their beams converged over the target. The German bombers would fly along either beam until they picked up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and dropped their bombs.|$|E

25|$|On 1 July 1948, No. 11 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Rathmines, drawing {{personnel}} and aircraft {{from the former}} Search and Rescue Wing. At this time it operated Catalinas again, undertaking search and rescue and courier tasks. In September that year, the squadron lost one aircraft in a crash on Lord Howe Island during a <b>night</b> <b>navigation</b> exercise, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of seven of the nine crewmembers. The squadron ceased operations on 1 May 1950 and was briefly disbanded between then and 1 November 1950, when it re-formed at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland, operating modified Lincoln heavy bombers. Two weeks later, the squadron was transferred to RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia, from where it conducted patrols over the Indian Ocean. It was re-equipped with Lockheed P-2 Neptune aircraft throughout 1951–53, sending crews to the United States to fly the aircraft back, and in May 1954 the squadron relocated to RAAF Base Richmond.|$|E
25|$|Night {{operations}} {{gave the}} Luftwaffe valuable experience in using <b>night</b> <b>navigation</b> equipment, such at the Knickebein (crooked leg). By taking bearings and cross-bearings on German medium-wave transmitters, aircraft could find their position sufficiently accurately {{to make the}} discovery of landmarks easy. On the night of 6/7 June, the first Luftwaffe bomb to fall on Greater London was dropped on at Addington, and small raids continued through the month. Thirteen airfields, 16 factories and 14 ports were bombed to little effect. By flying at low altitudes, {{it was possible for}} British defences to detect German bombers with searchlights. Two were shot down in June by anti-aircraft guns. After this period, the bombers flew too high for anti-aircraft fire to be effective. Fighter Command claimed 21 German bombers at night over Britain in June. Seven German aircraft crashed and were credited to fighters. Fighter Command defences at night were weak. The British lacked a specialised night fighter or widespread use of reliable Airborne interception radar. Coastal radar looked out to sea, once a raider had penetrated into the interior, they became difficult to track. Until the following year, night fighter defences remained ineffective at finding enemy aircraft and shooting them down. At the beginning of The Blitz in October, the Luftwaffe flew 5,900 sorties and lost 23—a 0.4 percent loss rate. The failures would cost Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Hugh Dowding, his command in November 1940.|$|E
500|$|As {{darkness}} fell at {{the close}} of Adlertag, Sperrle sent nine Kampfgruppe 100 (Bombing Group 100) He 111s to conduct a strategic bombing raid against the Supermarine Spitfire factory at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. Despite the group being a specialist night strike unit which had high expertise in <b>night</b> <b>navigation,</b> only four of the crews found their targets. The eleven [...] bombs dropped were not sufficient to disrupt fighter production. Around five of the 11 fell inside the compound. Casualties were small as workers had gone to shelter. Serious damage was done only to offices and a tool room, while a gas main was fractured. Another group, led by Gruppenkommandeur Hauptmann (Captain) Friedrich Achenbrenner, dispatched 15 He 111s from bases in Brittany across the Irish Sea to strike at the Short Brothers factory at Queen's Island, Belfast Northern Ireland. Five Short Stirling aircraft were destroyed.kg 27 also took part in the missions, and bombed Glasgow during the night although their specific target is unclear. Other bombers, commencing the night stage of Adlertag, resolutely flew the length and breadth of Great Britain, bombing Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, Liverpool, Sheffield, Norwich, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Very little damage was done, though some rail tracks were cut temporarily and around 100 casualties were suffered. It is unknown if any German aircraft were lost. One German airman was found wandering around the countryside in Balcombe, Somerset. No other traces of the aircraft or other crew members were found.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Britain {{began in}} early July 1940, with attacks on {{shipping}} and ports in the Kanalkampf which forced RAF Fighter Command into defensive action. In addition, wider raids gave aircrew experience {{of day and}} <b>night</b> <b>navigation,</b> and tested the defences. On 13 August, the German Luftwaffe {{began a series of}} concentrated aerial attacks (designated Unternehmen Adlerangriff or Operation Eagle Attack) on targets throughout the United Kingdom in an attempt to destroy the RAF and establish air superiority over Great Britain. [...] The change in emphasis of the bombing from RAF bases to bombing London, however, turned Adlerangriff into a strategic bombing operation.|$|E
2500|$|At Kissimmee, {{the first}} {{operational}} night fighter combat squadrons were activated (414th and 415th NFS) and Operational Training was carried out. [...] Each squadron was manned with graduates of Training Command's twin-engine flying training and Training Command’s B–25 transition school before beginning night fighter training. [...] Once accepted for night fighter training, the student received eight weeks {{of training in}} the Douglas DB7 or P-70s. Training consisted of two phases; night flying and night fighting. First came 78 daylight flying hours and 137 hours of ground school, followed by 76 flying hours and 30 hours of ground school in night fighting. Subjects included instruments, airborne radar, <b>night</b> <b>navigation,</b> meteorology, aircraft recognition, searchlight coordination, and ground control radar coordination. Lacking real nighttime combat experience, the AAF created a training program that was ad hoc from the beginning. In all, the night fighter crew would receive 93 hours of instrument flying, 90 hours in a Link trainer, 15 hours of night interceptions, and 10 ground control radar intercepts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attitude}} of the Air Ministry was {{in contrast to the}} experiences of the First World War when German bombers caused physical and psychological damage out of all proportion to their numbers. Around [...] (9,000 bombs) had been dropped, killing 1,413 people and injuring 3,500 more. Many people aged 35 or over remembered the bombing and greeted the threat of more with great trepidation. From 1916–1918, German raids had diminished against countermeasures which demonstrated defence against night air raids was possible. Although night air defence was causing greater concern before the war, it was not at the forefront of RAF planning after 1935, when funds were directed into the new ground-based radar day fighter interception system. The difficulty RAF bombers had in <b>night</b> <b>navigation</b> and target finding, led the British to believe that it would be the same for German bomber crews. There was also a mentality in all air forces that flying by day would obviate the need for night operations and their inherent disadvantages.|$|E

The lit sign atop the building served sailors as a navigation aid for many years. Morse Hardware had a similar sign saying [...] "MORSE" [...] on top of it for decades - and boaters would use the two signs at <b>night</b> for <b>navigation.</b>|$|R

2500|$|While {{the primary}} goal of the Instrument Branch was {{effective}} instrumentation, development of an all-weather and <b>night</b> <b>navigation</b> capability contributed to a larger goal espoused by the Air Service's Assistant Director, Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell: extending the mission of the Air Service beyond the doctrinal role of [...] "auxiliary" [...] ground support. Mitchell's strategy was to generate public support for growth of military aeronautics and funding of the Air Service by a publicity campaign using air shows, flight demonstrations, and the setting of various aviation records. [...] Among those participating in the varied events was 1st Lt. Lester J. Maitland, assigned to the Testing Squadron at Wilbur Wright Field, Ohio. Maitland was transferred to Hawaii in May 1919 for a two-year tour. There he submitted a request to the Chief of the Air Service to organize a transpacific flight between Hawaii and the mainland using the new two-engined Martin NBS-1 bomber, a prototype of which had been at McCook Field. When his first request was refused, he renewed the request in 1924 from Wilbur Wright Field, now called the Fairfield Air Intermediate Depot (FAID), while on temporary duty as a staff officer for Major Augustine Warner Robins.|$|E
2500|$|An {{hour after}} the {{declaration}} of war, Bomber Command launched raids on warships and naval ports by day, and in night raids dropped leaflets as it was considered illegal to bomb targets which could affect civilians. After the initial disasters of the war, with Vickers Wellington bombers shot down in large numbers attacking Wilhelmshaven and the slaughter of the Fairey Battle squadrons sent to France, {{it became clear that}} they would have to operate mainly at night to avoid incurring very high losses. Churchill came to power on 10 May 1940, [...] and night raids on German towns began with the bombing of Mönchen-Gladbach on the night of 11 May. The War Cabinet on 12 May agreed that German actions justified [...] "unrestricted warfare", and on 14 May they authorised an attack on the night of 14/15 May against oil and rail targets in Germany. At the urging of Clement Attlee, the Cabinet on 15 May authorised a full bombing strategy against [...] "suitable military objectives", even where there could be civilian casualties. That evening, a night time bomber campaign began against the German oil industry, communications, and forests/crops, mainly in the Ruhr area. [...] The RAF lacked accurate <b>night</b> <b>navigation,</b> and carried small bomb loads.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem was}} navigation.

To {{make up for the}} lack of visual aids initially, converted bomber pilots had to be used, because they already had experience with navigating at <b>night.</b> Another <b>navigation</b> aid was simply the Allied bombing target; a city illuminated as it burned would guide the fighters to their target.|$|R
