40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} in which spot and contract market exchange co-exist. A <b>contract</b> consists <b>of</b> a delivery requirement between an upstream and a downstream party. Contract formation determines {{to a certain extent}} the probability distribution of the spot market price. This contract formation externality entails the removal of high reservation price buyers and various sellers from the spot market. The first effect decreases the expected spot market price when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is small, whereas the decrease in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sellers and additional residual contract demand increase the expected spot market price beyond a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> It implies an endogenous upper bound on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Contract prices are positively related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Finally, additional contracts reduce the variance of the spot market price when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is sufficiently large.

40|$|The European Commission {{encourages}} {{public authorities}} to split procurement contracts into multiple contracts {{in order to}} increase the competiveness of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In this paper, I use data from Swedish public procurement auctions for internal regular cleaning service contracts to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> size and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> on SME participation and the probability of submitting the winning bid. I found that SME participation is negatively related to both contract size and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in the procurement. A possible interpretation is that reduced contract size in order to stimulate SME participation is counteracted by reduced incentives for them to enter into procurements with multiple contracts. Medium-sized firms are also more successful when bidding for smaller contracts relative to large firms. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the SMEs’ award rate is positively correlated with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in the procurement.

50|$|A Ratio spread is a complex, multileg options {{position}} {{that is a}} variation of a vertical spread.

An unequal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> options <b>contracts</b> gives this spread certain unique properties compared to a regular vertical spread.

We {{do this by}} assuming that the company issuing a mortality-contingent claim requires compensation for this risk {{in the form of}} a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. We prove that our ensuing valuation formula satisfies a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> desirable properties. For example, we show that it is subadditive in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> sold. A key result is that if the hazard rate is stochastic, then the risk-adjusted survival probability is greater than the physical survival probability, even as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> approaches infinity...|$|R

40|$|Contractual {{breaches}} {{are very}} common in developing countries such as China. In order to prevent breaches <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> the contractual designs between farmers and agricultural processors (Dragon Head Firms) in China are innovating in two ways: organizational innovations and contractual innovations. Due to contractual innovations, simple price-quantity contracts are evolving into complex cooperation contracts. Using data for over 500 state key processors in 2003 from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, we construct econometric models to study contractual choices, contract intensity, and their impacts on sales and profits for agricultural processors in China. The results indicate that capital and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracted</b> farmers are endogenous to contract choices. Processors {{are more likely to}} use cooperation contracts compared with price-quantity <b>contracts</b> as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracted</b> farmers increases, because the costs of coordinating, monitoring and enforcing price-quantity contracts may increase dramatically under these circumstances. On the other hand, contract types are not important for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracted</b> farmers, the intensity <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> or sales and profits for processors. The results also indicate that the elasticity of profits with respect to capital is 0. 52, which implies that the returns to investing in the food processing industry are relatively high in China.

The major result of the paper is that the price per contract solves a linear partial differential equation as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> approaches infinity. One can interpret the limiting price as an expectation with respect to an equivalent martingale measure. Another important result is that if the hazard rate is stochastic, then the risk-adjusted premium is greater than the net premium, even as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> approaches infinity. We present a numerical example to illustrate our results, along with the corresponding algorithms...|$|R
