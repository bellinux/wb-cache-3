40|$|Glycosphingolipids comprize a small (typically 5 – 10 % by weight) but vital {{fraction}} of membrane lipids in eukaryotes (Holthuis et al., 2001). They provide the plasma membrane with chemical and mechanical stabilities and {{take part in}} fundamental biological processes including differentiation, cell–cell interaction, and transmembrane signaling. For these lipids, as for most lipids in general, local metabolism and selective transport are important determinants (Sprong et al., 2001). Little is known about these processes, {{but it is clear}} that several key players in the organization and control of sphingolipid composition remain to be identified. A protein purified from bovine spleen cytosol specifically transferring glycolipids was already described more than 20 years ago ([Metz and Radin, 1980] and [Radin and Metz, 1982]). An absolute specificity was found for glycolipids containing a β-linked sugar to the hydrophobic backbone (Yamada et al., 1986). Glycolipid transfer proteins (GLTPs, EC <b>number</b> <b>not</b> <b>assigned)</b> are water-soluble proteins of average size of 24 kDa that have been studied extensively in vitro ([Abe and Sasaki, 1985], [Abe et al., 1982], [Brown et al., 1990], [Gammon et al., 1987] and [Metz and Radin, 1982]). Very recently, their structural and in vitro functional properties were reviewed in detail (Brown and Mattjus, 2007). These proteins have been isolated from different sources ranging from spinach chloroplasts to mammalian brain, liver and kidney ([Brown et al., 1990], [Sasaki, 1985] and [Sasaki, 1990]). GLTP orthologs in fungi and plants were found to be involved in programmed cell death ([Brodersen et al., 2002], [Mattjus et al., 2003] and [Saupe et al., 1994]) but their function in mammals is largely unknown. The activity of GLTP is preserved after expression in E. coli ([Godi et al., 2004], Lin et al., 2000 X. Lin, P. Mattjus, H. M. Pike, A. J. Windebank and R. E.

50|$|In the {{administration}} of the North American Numbering Plan, central office code protection was a numbering policy intended to ensure that the same local telephone <b>number</b> was <b>not</b> <b>assigned</b> in both of a pair of adjacent communities on opposite sides of an area code boundary.

25|$|In {{the middle}} 20th century in North America when a call {{could not be}} completed, for example because the phone <b>number</b> was <b>not</b> <b>assigned,</b> had been disconnected, or was {{experiencing}} technical difficulties, the call was routed to an intercept operator who informed the caller. In the 1970s this service was converted to Automatic Intercept Systems which automatically choose and present an appropriate intercept message.

50|$|Also, {{whenever}} warships {{are constructed}} in American shipyards for foreign navies, any hull numbers {{used to identify}} the ships during their construction are never reused by the U.S. Navy.

50|$|This was {{intended}} as a long-term solution, but within two years both 412 and 724 were close to exhaustion once again due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. By this time, overlays had gained more acceptance, and for this reason area code 878 was overlaid onto both 412 and 724 on August 17, 2001. Although <b>numbers</b> were <b>not</b> <b>assigned</b> in 878 until 2013 (and are only being assigned in the 724 area until 412 runs out of prefixes), ten-digit dialing has been mandatory across southwestern Pennsylvania since 2001.|$|R
50|$|While {{many smaller}} rate centres don't need nearly that many numbers {{in order to}} {{adequately}} serve their customers, a <b>number</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>assigned</b> elsewhere once allocated to a carrier and rate centre.

50|$|In seven-digit dialing {{the area}} code is only dialed when the area {{code of the}} called number is {{different}} {{than that of the}} calling number. Some communities on an area code boundary, such as Ottawa-Hull (613/819), Kansas City MO/KS (816/913) or Washington, D.C. (202) implemented central office code protection to ensure the same seven-digit local <b>number</b> was <b>not</b> <b>assigned</b> in two different area codes in the same city to retain seven-digit dialing in the entire community. Code protection is not possible for calls across area code boundaries within split plan cities where area codes have been added due to a shortage of available local numbers; these local calls became ten digits when the code was split.|$|R

5000|$|In Germany, the 1981 Spider Murphy Gang song Skandal im Sperrbezirk (Scandal in the Blocked Zone) {{contains}} a telephone number, zweiunddreißig, sechzehn, acht: 32 16 8.

50|$|In {{large cities}} located {{directly}} on area code boundaries (such as Ottawa-Hull in 613/819, the sixth-largest Canadian metropolitan area), this {{can lead to}} a situation where none of the many vacant prefixes can be assigned without breaking seven-digit calling across the area code boundary. Code protection in Ottawa-Hull broke down in 2006 for this reason. The 1-819 versions of Ottawa 1-613 <b>numbers</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>assigned</b> anywhere in western Quebec, even to areas a safe distance from the National Capital Region, such as the Eastern Townships or northwestern Quebec. Eventually, the few remaining prefixes in area code 819 could <b>not</b> be <b>assigned</b> without requiring ten-digit dialing from Ottawa to Hull.|$|R
40|$|Data sets with a {{large numbers}} of nominal variables, {{including}} some with large number of distinct values, are becoming increasingly common {{and need to be}} explored. Unfortunately, most existing visual exploration tools are designed to handle numeric variables only. When importing data sets with nominal values into such visualization tools, most solutions to date are rather simplistic. Often, techniques that map nominal values to <b>numbers</b> do <b>not</b> <b>assign</b> order or spacing among the values in a manner that conveys semantic relationships. Moreover, displays designed for nominal variables usually cannot handle high cardinality variables well. This paper addresses {{the problem of how to}} display nominal variables in general-purpose visual exploration tools designed for numeric variables. Specifically, we investigate (1) how to assign order and spacing among the nominal values, and (2) how to reduce the number of distinct values to display. We propose a new technique, calle...|$|R
25|$|Residents and {{businesses}} identify their locations mostly by building number, and occasionally {{by the name}} of a prominent structure. Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, so someone might say that they live in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street <b>numbers</b> have <b>not</b> been <b>assigned,</b> and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{each region}} has {{different}} area codes, the pre-merger territories of Ottawa and Hull are a single local calling area. Previously, Ottawa and Hull also had exchange protection {{in place to}} preserve seven-digit dialing between the two cities, implemented {{in such a way}} that if a number was in use in Ottawa the equivalent 819 <b>number</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>assigned</b> anywhere in western Quebec. Similarly, the 613 equivalent of a number used in Hull could <b>not</b> be <b>assigned</b> anywhere in eastern Ontario. This is no longer the case, as ten-digit local dialing has been in place since 2006. The sole legacy of the old system is a [...] "dual dialability" [...] system for federal government numbers on both sides of the provincial border; all federal government offices on the Quebec side duplicated several exchanges worth of their counterparts on the Ontario side.|$|R
