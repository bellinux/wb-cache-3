25|$|The Kiev Pechersk Lavra caverns are a {{very complex}} system of narrow {{underground}} corridors (about 1-1½ metres wide and 2-2½ metres high), along with numerous living quarters and underground chapels. In 1051, the monk Anthony settled in an old cave in a hill near the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. This cave received additions including corridors and a church, and is <b>now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know as the Far Caves. In 1057, Anthony moved to a cave near the Upper Lavra, now called the Near Caves.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good of it!" [...] exclaimed the captain. [...] "Don't {{talk that}} way, Burke. If {{we can get}} it on shore, there is a chance for us. But if it goes to the bottom, out in deep water, there is none. There is no time to talk <b>now.</b> <b>What</b> <b>we</b> must do is to go to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That might be," [...] Teddy replied, thoughtfully. [...] "But we've {{got plenty}} of time to think it over. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want is to earn a news-stand the very first thing.

[...] "We have <b>now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{never had}} before--a fine army {{collected}} {{together in one}} spot, a promise of succour from faithful England, and a strong probability of ultimate success. After all, what are we giving up but an old barrack? Let the rascal blues burn it; cannot we build a better Durbellière when the King shall have his own again?" ...|$|E

"I {{will hit}} {{you in the}} eye, Tom Jackson, if you don't shut up; you are as bad as a girl; I am ashamed of you. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have got to do, is to find some sort of shelter, either a wall or bush, and we must keep on until we come to something.

6000|$|But {{there was}} a day when we felt that we must have $3 right away--$3 at once. That was how I met the General. It doesn't matter <b>now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted so much money at one time for, but that Scot and I did {{occasionally}} want it. The Scot sent me out one day to get it. He had a great belief in Providence, that Scottish friend of mine. He said: [...] "The Lord will provide." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wish {{to secure}} {{is a word}} that shall contain within itself all the {{essential}} principles of downright abuse; the mere pronouncing of which in the public street would subject one to the inconvenience of being rent asunder by an infuriated populace-something so atrociously apt and so exquisitely diabolical that any person to whom it should be applied would go right away out and kick himself to death with a jackass. We covenant that the inventor shall be slain the moment we are in possession of his infernal secret, as life would of course be a miserable burden to him ever afterward.|$|E

6000|$|In a {{few words}} Arthur told him {{the nature of the}} shock, but without {{describing}} the particular symptoms on which the opinion of his supposed approaching insanity was based. Freeling listened with an incredulous smile, and at the end he said to his friend gently, [...] "My dear Arthur, I wish you had told me all this before. If you had done so, we might have saved Miss Abury a shock which may perhaps be fatal. You are no more going mad than I am; on the contrary, you're about the sanest and most clear-headed fellow of my acquaintance. But these mad-doctors are always finding madness everywhere. If you had come to me and told me the symptoms that troubled you, I should soon have set you right again in your own opinion. To have gone to Warminster was most unfortunate, but it can't be helped <b>now.</b> <b>What</b> <b>we</b> have to do at present is to take care of Miss Abury." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> notice {{front and}} {{foremost}} is [...] That this convulsion speaks not, pictures not [...] The heart of France. It comes of artifice-- [...] From the unique and sinister influence [...] Of a smart army-gamester--upon men [...] Who have shared his own excitements, spoils, and crimes.-- [...] This man, {{who calls himself}} most impiously [...] The Emperor of France by Grace of God, [...] Has, in the scale of human character, [...] Dropt down so low, that he has set at nought [...] All pledges, stipulations, guarantees, [...] And stepped upon the only pedestal [...] On which he cares to stand--his lawless will. [...] Indeed, {{it is a fact}} scarce credible [...] That so mysteriously in his own breast [...] Did this adventurer lock the scheme he planned, [...] That his companion Bertrand, chief in trust, [...] Was unapprised thereof until the hour [...] In which the order to embark was given! ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 3. This {{first step}} in the {{analysis}} of the object of belief, which, though so obvious, will be found to be not unimportant, is the only one which we shall find it practicable to make without a preliminary survey of language. If we attempt to proceed further in the same path, that is, to analyze any further the import of Propositions; we find forced upon us, as a subject of previous consideration, the import of Names. For every proposition consists of two names; and every proposition affirms or denies one of these names, of the other. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do, what passes in our mind, when we affirm or deny two names of one another, must depend on what they are names of; since it is with reference to that, and not to the mere names themselves, that we make the affirmation or denial. Here, therefore, we find a new reason why the signification of names, and the relation generally between names and the things signified by them, must occupy the preliminary stage of the inquiry we are engaged in.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it is {{astonishing}} {{until you get}} used to the idea, and see how it makes everything fit in. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> are <b>we</b> to do? Of course, it will be generally known to-morrow." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And <b>now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> need to enliven this detestable {{place is}} the {{presence}} of Beauty herself. Our worthy friends should be back soon--bringing their sheaves with them, let us hope, for otherwise matters will be complicated. Let me see: have I thought of everything, for in such affairs one oversight--He is a Catholic, therefore can contract a legal marriage under the Proclamations--it was lucky I remembered that point of law, though it nearly cost us all our lives--and the priest, I can lay my hands on him, a discreet man, who won't hear if the lady says No, but filled beyond a question with the power and virtue of his holy office. No, I have nothing to reproach myself with in the way of precaution, nothing at all. I have sown the seed well and truly, it remains only for Providence to give the increase, or shall I say--no, I think not, for between the general and the private familiarity is always odious. Well, it is time that you met with a little success and settled down, for you have worked hard, Juan, my friend, and you are getting old--yes, Juan, you are getting old. Bah! what a hole and what weather!" [...] and Montalvo established himself by the fireside to doze away his ennui.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Ireland {{rises in}} favour of King James, {{it will not be}} for any love for the Stuarts; but it will be to recover the land which has been {{illegally}} wrested from us, and which, if Dutch William and his Whig adherents gain the upper hand, will be taken from us forever. The religious element will, of course, count for much. Already we have suffered persecution for our religion; and, if the Whigs could have their way, they would stamp it out utterly, with fire and sword. Things have looked better, during the last five or six years, than they have done since Cromwell first put foot in Ireland. We have begun to hope for justice. Tyrconnell has stood up for us, and, with the goodwill of James, has gained many concessions. We have <b>now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> never had before, an Irish army. The land thieves have been fairly alarmed, for they have seen that the long delayed justice will be done us at last. Many have sold back their lands to the original owners, and have left the country. Others are only holding out for better terms. Another ten years of James's reign, and things would have righted themselves; but, if the Dutchman ascends the throne of England, there is no hope for Ireland, save in the sword." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 107. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{especially}} need {{at present}} for educational purposes is to know, not {{the anatomy of}} plants, but their biography--how and where they live and die, their tempers, benevolences, malignities, distresses, and virtues. We want them drawn from their youth to their age, from bud to fruit. We ought to see {{the various forms of}} their diminished but hardy growth in cold climates, or poor soils; and their rank or wild luxuriance, when full-fed, and warmly nursed. And all this we ought to have drawn so accurately, that we might at once compare any given part of a plant with the same part of any other, drawn on the like conditions. Now, is not this a work which we may set about here in Oxford, with good hope and much pleasure? I think it is so important, that the first exercise in drawing I shall put before you will be an outline of a laurel leaf. You will find in the opening sentence of Lionardo's treatise, our present text-book, that you must not at first draw from nature, but from a good master's work, [...] "per assuefarsi a buone membra," [...] to accustom yourselves, that is, to entirely good representative organic forms. So your first exercise shall be the top of the laurel sceptre of Apollo, drawn by an Italian engraver of Lionardo's own time; then we will draw a laurel leaf itself; and little by little, I think we may both learn ourselves, and teach to many besides, somewhat more than we know yet, of the wild olives of Greece, and the wild roses of England.|$|E
