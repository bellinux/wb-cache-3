40|$|Abstract Introduction Congenital cystic adenomatoid {{malformation}} of {{the lung}} is an uncommon cause of respiratory distress in neonates and babies. The disorder is usually diagnosed in the neonatal {{period and the}} first two years of life. This anomaly has been described in association with bronchopulmonary sequestration, extralobar intra-abdominal sequestration or bronchial atresia in live and stillborn babies. It is rarely encountered in adults, in whom the diagnosis is made incidentally from mass lesion features seen on chest radiographs. The oldest patients recorded with this malformation have been about 35 years old, and only 10 % of primary diagnoses are made after the first year of life. Delayed diagnosis can be related to infection or serendipitous discovery. Case presentation We describe the radiological findings of a 34 -year-old Caucasian woman with a clinical history of recurrent pneumonia, intermittent anterior pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung associated with bronchial atresia involving a different lobe was discovered. Conclusion Although rare in adults, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation should be suspected in adult patients who suffer from recurrent or persistent <b>non-productive</b> <b>coughs.</b> The discovery of an association of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with bronchial atresia in adulthood is rare but possible, even in different lobes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2003. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 12 - 13). Tobey Jones, a 13 year-old male castrated Domestic Shorthair cat, {{presented to}} the Emergency Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals for evaluation of dypsnea and acute onset, episodic open-mouth breathing. The cat's history included many months of inappetance, weight loss, and episodic, <b>non-productive</b> <b>coughing.</b> Physical examination revealed generalized poor body condition (body score: II/V), multiple skin nodules, and increased lung sounds. Cytology of multiple skin nodules and of pleural fluid showed a predominance of round cells with abundant cytoplasm. The morphologic of the round cells, combined {{with a history of}} pulmonary disease, lead to a cytologic diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis (MH). Malignant histiocytosis (also termed disseminated histiocytic sarcoma) is a type of round cell tumor composed of antigen presenting cells of dendritic cell origin. Histiocytic disease can be broadly classified as either a reactive or neoplastic process, distinguished by clinical behavior, histopathologic features, and immunohistochemical markers. Malignant histiocytosis is an aggressive, systemic, neoplastic condition that is uncommon in the dog, although Bernese Mountain Dogs, Rottweilers, and Retrievers are overrepresented. It is rare in the cat. In both species, MH has a rapidly progressing clinical course and is poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Its prognosis is grave. This paper will focus on the classification of histiocytic disease, and what is known to date about MH in feline patients. Dr. Dennis Bailey, Dr. John Randolp...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Following a {{pulmonary}} resection, {{some patients}} suffer from persistent coughing, {{which may have}} a relationship with acid regurgitation. Since few physiological studies have been reported regarding this issue, we conducted the present observational study. Methods Persistent cough after pulmonary resection (CAP) was defined as <b>non-productive</b> <b>coughing</b> that occurred after a pulmonary resection in patients with stable chest X-ray results and no postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, or history of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor administration. A 24 -hour esophageal pH monitor was used with patients with coughing (n = 13) and patients with no coughing (n = 4) after undergoing a lobectomy, and the relationship between acid regurgitation and CAP was assessed using symptom association probability. Results Based on the results of pH monitoring conducted within 4 weeks of the operation we divided the patients into 3 groups: Type A had frequent gastroesophageal refluxes (> 50 occurrences in 24 hours) and frequent coughing (> 30 occurrences in 24 hours), Type B had frequent gastroesophageal refluxes and infrequent coughing, and type C had infrequent gastroesophageal refluxes and infrequent coughing. Type A patients (n = 10) were exclusively those with CAP and the symptom association probability was greater than 95 %. Five from that group underwent esophageal pH monitoring more than 1 year after surgery and none showed significant improvements in acid regurgitation. Conclusion There was a relationship seen between acid regurgitation and CAP in some patients shortly after surgery, while acid regurgitation remained unimproved after improvement of coughing in most of those 1 year after surgery. </p...|$|R
50|$|Treatment with mTOR inhibitors can be {{complicated}} by adverse events. The most frequently occurring adverse events are stomatitis, rash, anemia, fatigue, hyperglycemia/hypertriglyceridemia, decreased appetite, nausea, and diarrhea. Additionally, {{interstitial lung disease}} is an adverse event of particular importance. mTORi-induced ILD often is asymptomatic (with ground glass abnormalities on chest CT) or mild symptomatic (with a <b>non-productive</b> <b>cough),</b> but can be very severe as well. Even fatalities have been described. Careful diagnosis and treatment therefore is essential. Recently, a new diagnostic and therapeutic management approach has been proposed.|$|E
5000|$|After a {{respiratory}} tract infection has cleared, the {{person may be}} left with a postinfectious cough. This typically is a dry, <b>non-productive</b> <b>cough</b> that produces no phlegm. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, and a tickle in the throat. This cough may often persist for weeks after an illness. The cause of the cough may be inflammation similar to that observed in repetitive stress disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome. The repetition of coughing produces inflammation which produces discomfort, which in turn produces more coughing. Postinfectious cough typically does not respond to conventional cough treatments. Treatment consists of any anti-inflammatory medicine (such as ipratropium) [...] to treat the inflammation, and a cough suppressant to reduce frequency of the cough until inflammation clears. Inflammation may increase sensitivity to other existing issues such as allergies, and treatment of other causes of coughs (such as use of an air purifier or allergy medicines) may help speed recovery. A bronchodilator, which helps open up the airways, may also help treat this type of cough.|$|E
50|$|This {{disease is}} an {{inflammation}} of the alveoli in the lungs. Initial symptoms are breathlessness especially after sudden exertion or when exposed to temperature change and can be very similar to asthma, hyperventilation syndrome or pulmonary embolism. One of the defining characteristics of bird fanciers lung is that many medical tests will show a normal range of results {{and it will be}} identified by X-ray or CT scans showing physical changes to the lung structure (a ground glass appearance). If someone with BFL has been exposed to avian proteins they will see symptoms within 4-6 hours. Symptoms include chills, fever, breathlessness, <b>non-productive</b> <b>cough</b> and chest discomfort. In the chronic form there is usually anorexia, weight loss, extreme tiredness and progressive interstitial fibrosis which is the most disabling feature of the disease as this causes scarring on the lungs which reduces the lungs ability to move air in and out, and as a result sufferers have repeated chest infections and ultimately struggle to breathe. This condition is occasionally fatal.|$|E
