40|$|Abstract Aims: The {{promotion}} of sports participation {{during the early}} years of life is important not only because it promotes health during childhood and adolescence, but also because it has benefits in adulthood. This study was developed to identify the association between sports participation {{during the early years}} of life and adulthood, to analyze the <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> sports throughout life and to identify the correlates of <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> sports. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The sample was composed of 743 adults randomly selected in a medium-size Brazilian city. <b>Non-participation</b> <b>in</b> sports during childhood and adolescence was assessed through specific questions, and <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> sports in adulthood was assessed using the second section of Baecke questionnaire. Answering “no” in the three periods assessed (childhood, adolescence and adulthood) was characterized as <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> sports throughout life. Chronological age, sex, formal education, BMI, current job and ethnicity were considered covariates. Categorical data were expressed as rates and compared using chi-square test and binary logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of adults not engaged in sports throughout life was 58. 5 % (95 % CI= 55. 1 - 62. 1). Females (OR = 2. 41 [1. 71 - 3. 38]), those more advanced in age (OR = 3. 29 [1. 82 - 5. 94]) and/or possessing a lower level of education (OR = 4. 47 [2. 45 - 8. 17]) were associated with the non-engagement <b>in</b> sports. Conclusion: <b>Non-participation</b> <b>in</b> sports during childhood can influence <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> sports during adulthood, which is significantly affected by sex, age and education level...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Non-participation</b> <b>in</b> {{epidemiological}} studies threatens {{the generalizability of}} findings. Objective: To investigate the change <b>in</b> <b>non-participation</b> between the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) I and II. Design: A comparison of two {{epidemiological studies}} of older people using identical methods. Setting: Three geographical areas of the United Kingdom. Subjects: Older people aged 65 years and over. Methods: The two studies were conducted approximately two decades apart between 1989 and 1994 (CFAS I) and between 2008 and 2011 (CFAS II). Random samples were drawn from primary care lists. We compared demographic factors associated with <b>non-participation.</b> Results: <b>Non-participation</b> <b>in</b> CFAS II was higher than in CFAS I (45. 3 % versus 18. 3 %). After adjustment for confounders, in both CFAS I and CFAS II {{women were more likely}} to decline to take part (CFAS I: OR 1. 3 95 % CI 1. 2 to 1. 4; CFAS II: 1. 1 95 % CI 1. 1 to 1. 2). Deprivation was associated with <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> both studies (highest vs lowest Townsend deprivation quintile, CFAS I: OR 1. 4 95 % CI 1. 2 to 1. 6; CFAS II: 2. 0 95 % CI 1. 8 to 2. 2). Age was not associated with <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> either study (CFAS I p= 0. 21, CFAS II p= 0. 47). Conclusions: <b>Non-participation</b> <b>in</b> epidemiological studies of older people has increased substantially {{in the past two decades}} and public willingness to take part in studies of this kind would appear to be declining. As communities become more diverse and older people have increasing commitments on their time, new ways to engage prospective participants are urgently needed...|$|R

Understanding the origins of <b>non‐participation</b> <b>in</b> screening is therefore important. Objective To explore the beliefs and experiences of individuals who had not responded either to their screening invitation or reminder. Design A qualitative study using in‐depth interviews with non‐participants from England's population‐based {{colorectal cancer}} screening programme. Data collection and analysis were carried out using a grounded theory approach, with an emphasis on the constant comparison method, and continued until saturation (27 interviews). Findings The interviews provided an in‐depth understanding of a range of reasons and circumstances surrounding <b>non‐participation</b> <b>in</b> screening, including contextual and environmental influences as well as factors specific to the screening test. <b>Non‐participation</b> <b>in</b> screening was not necessarily associated with negative attitudes towards screening or a decision to not return a kit. Reasons for <b>non‐participation</b> <b>in</b> screening included not feeling that participation is personally necessary, avoiding or delaying decision making, and having some degree of intention to take part but failing to do so because of practicalities, conflicting priorities or external circumstances. Beliefs, awareness and intention change over time. Discussion and conclusions A range of approaches may be required to improve screening uptake.

40|$|Background and objective: Asthma is a {{major public}} health concern. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{characterize}} a large population-based cohort of adults with asthma, and to study factors associated with all-cause mortality and <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> a long-term follow-up. Design: Random and stratified samples from five population-based cohorts were clinically examined during 1986 - 2001, and all subjects with asthma were included in the study (n = 2055, age 19 - 72 years, 55 % women). Independent associations between different risk factors and (i) mortality and (ii) <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> a clinical follow-up in 2012 - 2014 were estimated. Results: In 1986 - 2001, 95 % reported any wheeze and/or attacks of shortness of breath in the past 12 months, and/or asthma medication use. Over the up to 28 years of follow-up time, the cumulative mortality was 22. 7 %. Male gender, current smoking, and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 sec of predicted (FEV 1 % of predicted) were independent risk factors for mortality, while obesity was associated with <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> the follow-up. Older ages, ischemic heart disease, and low socioeconomic status were associated with both mortality and non-participation. Conclusions: The risk factors associated with mortality in this adult population-based asthma cohort were similar to those commonly identified in general population samples, i. e. male gender, current smoking, and lower FEV 1 % of predicted, while obesity was associated with <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> a long-term follow-up.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} framework for analysing ethnic differences in determinants of participation and <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> prenatal screening for Down syndrome. METHODS: We applied Weinstein's Precaution Adoption Process (PAP) Model to the decision {{of whether or not}} to participate in prenatal screening for Down syndrome. The prenatal screening stage model was specified by reviewing the empirical literature and by data from seven focus group interviews with Dutch, Turkish and Surinamese pregnant women in the Netherlands. RESULTS: We identified 11 empirical studies on ethnic differences in determinants of participation and <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> prenatal screening for Down syndrome. The focus group interviews showed that almost all stages and determinants in the stage model were relevant in women's decision-making process. However, there were ethnic variations in the relevance of determinants, such as beliefs about personal consequences of having a child with Down syndrome or cultural and religious norms. DISCUSSION: The prenatal screening stage model can be applied as a framework to describe the decision-making process of pregnant women from different ethnic backgrounds. It provides scope for developing culturally sensitive, tailored methods to guide pregnant women towards informed decision-making on participation or <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> prenatal screening for Down syndrom...|$|R

40|$|Participation in {{community}} activities can confer social and health benefits {{and is considered}} {{an important aspect of}} social inclusion. This paper presents results of research that assessed whether factors identified in the literature as likely to influence travel and activity generally, are also associated with participation and <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> community activities. The data set (N= 784) is from the Investigating transport disadvantage, social exclusion and wellbeing in metropolitan, regional and rural Victoria (TDSE) project. Logistic regression was used to identify which of these factors have a significant association with participation or nonparticipation. The TDSE data was selected for this analysis because it differentiates between two groups. People who have not participated because they choose not to and those who have not participated because facilities are not available, or are insufficient for their needs. Analysis of this data provides the opportunity to consider different influences on participation and nonparticipation, either by choice or caused by constraints. Results indicate that social exclusion and low wellbeing are both associated with constrained <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> community activity. People reporting social exclusion or low wellbeing were unable to participate in the activities they wanted to due to the activity being unavailable or inadequate to their needs. However, reported transport problems are associated with choice <b>non-participation</b> <b>in</b> community activities. These results raise questions about the role of constraint in choice and the influence of structural barriers to participation and agency. These questions are examined and implications for policy are discussed. 1 ATRF 2011 Proceedings...|$|R
