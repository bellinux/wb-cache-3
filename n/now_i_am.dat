25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E

K periodically helps arrange Beatles' conventions and other Beatles' {{events in the}} Hamburg area. She has no children, and now lives alone: [...] ""My [...] marriage ended in 1985...

60|$|As to sleep, I had {{dreams of}} poverty {{in all sorts of}} shapes, but I seemed to dream without the {{previous}} ceremony of going to sleep. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ragged, wanting to sell Dora matches, six bundles for a halfpenny; <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the office in a nightgown and boots, remonstrated with by Mr. Spenlow on appearing before the clients in that airy attire; <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell from old Tiffey's daily biscuit, regularly eaten when St. Paul's struck one; <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hopelessly endeavouring to get a licence to marry Dora, having nothing but one of Uriah Heep's gloves to offer in exchange, which the whole Commons rejected; and still, more or less conscious of my own room, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed-clothes.|$|R

500|$|Arsenal {{dropped into}} mid-table {{throughout}} the 1973–74 season, with McLintock's departure signalling {{the demise of}} the Double-winning team. Kennedy failed to score from 6 October to mid-January, and speculation rose of possible moves to Sunderland, Newcastle United, or Aston Villa. In February, he released a statement saying that [...] "my game has gone downhill since I got married but has started to pick up again <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in bachelordom... I feel that I am better off without her". He ended the season in good form, though Mee had already decided to move him on and replace him with Brian Kidd.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Horsfield was {{diagnosed}} with testicular cancer, and advised that his playing career was over. As the disease was discovered in its early stages, no chemotherapy or radiotherapy was needed, surgery proved successful and {{less than two months}} later he was given the all-clear. Horsfield decided to make his illness public to help spread awareness of the disease, and lent his support to a Premier League-backed project launched in 2009 to promote men's health issues. He said: [...] "Getting cancer was something I had to get over. I got it, wanted to beat it and I did. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> just glad that I've got another chance in football." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{out against}} homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service {{announcements}} in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. [...] "I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it," [...] {{he said in a}} 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.|$|E

500|$|Zinta used {{to visit}} her native town Shimla when she was not busy shooting. In 2006, she moved into her own home in Mumbai. She does not {{identify}} with any particular religion. In an interview with The Times of India, she comments, [...] "I believe in good deeds, in karma, I don't believe in going to temples. For me, religion is very personal. It's all about having faith... We have heard and read that all religions are equal. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> increasingly believing in this." [...] She narrowly escaped death twice in late 2004: first after an explosion at a Temptation concert in Colombo, Sri Lanka; and second during the Indian Ocean earthquake.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{was elected}} in November 1888 over President Cleveland. [...] By 1889, Foraker was openly opposed by a faction of Ohio Republicans, led by Hanna, Sherman and McKinley. [...] Foraker felt {{relieved}} at the break, writing to a friend, [...] "From Toledo to Chicago, my neck was under a yoke, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> free." [...] Despite the factional opposition, he sought a third term in 1889, hoping that if Republicans kept their majority in the legislature, he could be elected to the Senate as Sherman's junior colleague in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1890. [...] He was renominated at the 1889 state convention in Columbus on the second ballot, as the opposition to him was divided.|$|E
500|$|Larter next {{appeared}} as Zerelda Mimms {{in the western}} comedy American Outlaws. Directed by Les Mayfield and co-starring Colin Farrell and Scott Caan, the movie was poorly received by critics and at the box office, garnering US$13 million {{at the end of}} its theatrical run. She also starred in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. That year, Larter appeared on the cover of Maxim magazine and performed in the stage play The Vagina Monologues in New York City. In Spring 2002, Larter moved from Los Angeles to New York. [...] "I was too young and impressionable to handle the pressures of L.A." [...] Larter recalled in an interview, [...] "I'm a woman <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> no longer the little girl who could be easily influenced." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewing Beresford's after action report, Wellington {{was unhappy}} with its despondent tone and commented to a staff officer [...] "This won't do. It will drive the people in England mad. Write me down a victory." [...] The report was duly rewritten, {{although}} Wellington privately acknowledged that another such battle would ruin his army. Soult, {{on the basis of}} higher allied casualties, also claimed [...] "a signal victory". He generously paid tribute to the steadfastness of the allied troops, writing [...] "There is no beating these troops, in spite of their generals. I always thought they were bad soldiers, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure of it. I had turned their right, pierced their centre and everywhere victory was mine– but they {{did not know how to}} run!" ...|$|E
500|$|Bågenholm {{soon began}} {{to show signs of}} vitality, and woke up paralyzed from the neck down on 30 May. She feared she would spend {{the rest of her life}} on her back, and was angry with her colleagues for saving her. Bågenholm soon {{recovered}} from the paralysis, however, and later apologized to her friends; [...] "I was very irritated when I realized they had saved me. I feared a meaningless life, without any dignity. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very happy to be alive and want to apologize." [...] Bågenholm's kidneys and digestive system were not working properly, so she had to recover in an intensive care unit for two more months. After spending 28days in the Tromsø intensive care unit, she was flown to Sweden in an ambulance helicopter for the remainder of her recovery.|$|E
500|$|Now {{my great}} plan, which was {{conceived}} of old, ... {{is to let}} nothing be wilfully left unexamined. Nothing is to be holy ground consecrated to Stationary Faith, whether positive or negative. All fallow land is to be ploughed up and a regular system of rotation followed. ... Never hide anything, be it weed or no, nor seem to wish it hidden. ... Again I assert the Right of Trespass on any plot of Holy Ground which any man has set apart. ... <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> convinced that no one but a Christian can actually purge his land of these holy spots. ... I do not say that no Christians have enclosed places of this sort. Many have a great deal, and every one has some.

500|$|In May 2015, Ron Paul ended all {{relationships}} with the Voices of Liberty and the Ron Paul Channel {{to start a new}} internet broadcast called the Ron Paul Liberty Report. According to Paul himself, it will not cost a thing, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, [...] "But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to the Ron Paul Liberty Report, {{and that is what we}} do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news." [...] Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California.|$|E
500|$|In Act 1, Macbeth and Banquo {{meet the}} Three Witches who foretell that Macbeth will be king and that Banquo [...] "shalt get kings, though thou be none". Fleance also briefly {{appears in the}} first scene of Act 2, when his father tells him of [...] "cursed {{thoughts}} that nature / Gives way to in repose!". Macbeth, aware of the threat Banquo and his son pose to his new throne, plans to have them murdered. Before Banquo goes travelling, Macbeth asks [...] "Goes Fleance with you?" [...] Macbeth sends three men to follow and kill them both, saying [...] "Fleance absence is no less material to me / Than is his father's." [...] Macbeth holds a banquet that night and reveals to his wife his fears of what might happen unless Fleance and Banquo are both killed. Banquo and Fleance are ambushed and while Banquo holds the assailants off he cries [...] "Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! / Thou mayst revenge." [...] When the murderers return to Macbeth and report their failure to kill Fleance, he says, [...] "Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect, / Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, / As broad and general as the casing air: / But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in / To saucy doubts and fears." [...] Macbeth later meets the Three Witches again and is shown {{a vision of a}} long line of kings descended from Banquo.|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{was next}} {{scheduled}} {{to play against}} Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen. [...] "Spassky predicted a tight struggle: 'Larsen is a little stronger in spirit. Before the match, Botvinnik had told a Soviet television audience:It {{is hard to say}} how their match will end, {{but it is clear that}} such an easy victory as in Vancouver [...] will not be given to Fischer. I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for , all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus, Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible. Fischer beat Larsen by the score of 6–0. Robert Byrne writes: [...] "To a certain extent I could grasp the Taimanov match as a kind of curiosity–almost a freak, a strange chess occurrence that would never occur again. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at a loss for anything whatever to say... So, it is out of the question for me to explain how Bobby, how anyone, could win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen". Just a year before, Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer, and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal. Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer's [...] "incredible" [...] 12–0 score in the two matches. Chess statistician Jeff Sonas concludes that the victory over Larsen gave Fischer the [...] "highest single-match performance rating ever".|$|E
