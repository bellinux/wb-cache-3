5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the <b>normal</b> <b>value.</b> It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

25|$|Pregnancy-induced {{hypercoagulability}} {{is probably}} a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, which can rise up to three times its <b>normal</b> <b>value.</b> Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and antithrombin III, remain constant. Fibrinolysis is impaired {{by an increase in}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta. Venous stasis may occur {{at the end of the}} first trimester, due to enhanced compliance of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the earthquake, Unit 4 had been shut down for shroud {{replacement}} and refueling since 29 November 2010. All 548 fuel assemblies had been transferred in December 2010 from the reactor to the spent fuel pool on an upper floor of the reactor building where they were held in racks containing boron to damp down any nuclear reaction. The pool is used to store rods for some time after removal from the reactor and contains 1,331 rods. Recently active fuel rods produce more decay heat than older ones. At 04:00 JST on Monday 14 March, water in the pool had reached a temperature of 84°C compared to a <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> of 40–50°C. The IAEA was advised that the temperature value remained 84°C at 19:00 JST on 15 March.

2500|$|On 27 March, TEPCO {{reported}} {{stagnant water}} {{in the basement of}} unit 2 (inside the reactor/turbine building complex, but outside the primary containment) was measured at 1000mSv/h or more, which prompted evacuation. The exact dose rate remains unknown as the technicians fled the place after their first measurement went off-scale. Additional basement and trench-area measurements indicated 60mSv/h in unit 1, [...] "over 1000"mSv/h in unit 2, and 750mSv/h in unit 3. The report indicated the main source was iodine-134 with a half-life of less than an hour, which resulted in a radioactive iodine concentration 10million times the <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> in the reactor. TEPCO later retracted its report, stating that the measurements were inaccurate and attributed the error to comparing the isotope responsible, iodine-134, to normal levels of another isotope. Measurements were then corrected, stating that the iodine levels were 100,000 times the normal level. On 28 March, the erroneous radiation measurement caused TEPCO to reevaluate the software used in analysis.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, {{the town}} was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (Harat al-Kadim) near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (Harat al-Kazaz), {{inhabited}} by Jews; the Mameluke-era Sheikh's Quarter (Harat ash Sheikh) to the north-west;and further north, the Dense Quarter (Harat al-Harbah). In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman pasha ("governor") of the sanjak ("district") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to subdue the rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, with representatives from the English, French and other Western consulates as witnesses. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, the brother and strong rival of Abd al Rachman, as [...] of the Hebron region. After this relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years. Hungarian Jews of the Karlin Hasidic court settled {{in another part of}} the city in 1866. According to Nadav Shragai Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council. Hebron suffered from a severe drought during 1869–71 and food sold for ten times the <b>normal</b> <b>value.</b> From 1874 the Hebron district as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem was administered directly from Istanbul.|$|E
2500|$|The {{time value}} of some notes could change {{according}} to their immediate context in certain situations. The rules for this were developed {{on the basis of}} the typical rhythmic nature of medieval music in the 13th century. Most of this music followed the same basic metric pattern, which in modern notation would be written as a swift [...] (or [...] ) meter. Thus, melodies consisted mainly of ternary long notes (in modern notation, dotted minims), or alternating sequences of binary long notes and short notes (minims and crotchets), or groups of three short notes. In the 13th century, all of these were notated using only the longa and breve notes. A longa was automatically understood to fill a whole ternary metric group whenever it was in the neighborhood of other notes that did the same, i.e., whenever it was followed either by another longa or by a full group of three breves. When, however, the longa was preceded or followed by a single breve, then both filled a ternary group together. Thus, the longa had to be reduced to a value of two (it was [...] "imperfected"). When, finally, there were only two breves in between two longae, then the two breves had to fill up a metrical group together. This was done by lengthening the second breve (brevis altera) to a value of two, while the first (brevis recta) kept its <b>normal</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to summarize current information about the <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> on infant sleep polysomnography for clinical use. MethodsMEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and CINAHL (Ovid) from January 1976 to May 2007 were searched. Two reviewers independently reviewed all relevant articles, using preset inclusion criteria. The population of interest included children aged less than 1 year. Studies in infants with known major anomalies were excluded. The results on apneas were extracted and analyzed. ResultsFor obstructive apnea, the upper limit of <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> was less than 1. 0 per hour, and for mixed apnea, the current data suggested the upper limit of <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> was less than 1. 0 per hour. For central apnea defined as cessation of respiratory efforts for more than 3 seconds, the current data suggested that the upper limit of the normal central apnea index was 45 per hour for 1 -month-old infants, 30 per hour for 2 -month-old infants, 22 per hour for 3 -month-old infants, and between 10 and 20 for the older age groups. For the desaturation episode defined as SpO 2 less than 80 % for any length of time, the current data suggested the upper limit of <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> to be 14. 7 episodes per hour for day 1, 41 episodes for day 4, and 15. 1 episodes for day 39. ConclusionThe <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> of obstructive apnea, mixed apnea, and central apnea are well established for neonates and infants. With these <b>normal</b> <b>values,</b> sleep polysomnography study should be routinely used to quantify the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in those neonates at risk for these disorders...|$|R
40|$|History and Objectives: Arterial blood gases (ABG) have various {{clinical}} diagnostic <b>values,</b> however their <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> are {{not known}} in our country. Therefore, this investigation was conducted {{in order to determine}} <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> for PaO 2, PaCO 2, HCO 3 - and pH among healthy 18 - 74 years old in autumn and winter of 1995 in Kashan. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study on 121 randomly selected healthy individuals from medical records. Arterial blood was taken from the radial blood arteries {{in order to determine the}} <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> and the confidence intervals. Results: <b>Normal</b> <b>values</b> of PaO 2 were 91. 9 Â± 9. 8 mmHg and 94. 4 Â± 11. 5 mmHg in men and women respectively. The linear formula was PaO 2 = 103. 59 - 0. 29 X age (year) and PaCO 2 values were 38 Â± 3. 5 mmHg and 36 Â± 4. 36 mmHg for men and women respectively. The <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> for HCO 3 - were 22. 6 Â± 2. 12 meq/L and 21. 4 Â± 1. 96 meq/L for men and women respectively and pH values were 7. 4 Â± 0. 02 and 7. 4 Â± 0. 04 for men and women respectively.
