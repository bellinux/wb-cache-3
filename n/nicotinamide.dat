5|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine {{dinucleotide}} (NAD) is a coenzyme {{found in}} all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other <b>nicotinamide.</b> <b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD and NADH respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with <b>nicotinamide</b> at this position. The <b>nicotinamide</b> moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a <b>nicotinamide</b> (Nam) moiety, forming <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide.|$|E
5|$|NAD is {{synthesized}} {{through two}} metabolic pathways. It is produced {{either in a}} de novo pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as <b>nicotinamide</b> back to NAD.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. <b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. <b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts <b>nicotinamide</b> to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{assembling}} NAD de novo {{from simple}} amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors {{used in these}} salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), <b>nicotinamide</b> (Nam) and <b>nicotinamide</b> riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for {{the high level of}} reactions that consume NAD in this organelle. salvage pathway delays aging without altering steady-state NAD+ levels | journal = J.

Chem. | volume = 277 | issue = 21 | pages = 18881–90 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11884393 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111773200 }} There are some reports that mammalian cells can take up extracellular NAD from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|An {{example for}} the fission and fusion {{mechanism}} {{can be found in}} <b>nicotinamide</b> nucleotide transhydrogenases. These are membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion between NAD(H) and NADP(H) in a reaction that is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation. They consist of three major functional units (I, II, and III) that can be found in different arrangement in bacteria, protozoa, and higher eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three groups of domain arrangements were acquired and fused independently.|$|E
5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in <b>nicotinamide</b> nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
5|$|From the hydride {{electron}} pair, one electron {{is transferred}} to the positively charged nitrogen of the <b>nicotinamide</b> ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a strong reducing agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, <b>nicotinamide,</b> retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases <b>nicotinamide</b> and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide {{are used in}} these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the <b>nicotinamide</b> portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
5|$|In metabolism, <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{is involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then {{be used as a}} reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|In metabolism, the {{compound}} accepts or donates electrons in redox reactions. metabolism {{in health and}} disease | journal = Trends Biochem.

The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH is oxidized and NAD reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the <b>nicotinamide</b> ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of <b>nicotinamide</b> (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> may be {{obtained}} from the diet where it is present primarily as NAD+ and NADP+. These are hydrolysed in the intestine and the resulting <b>nicotinamide</b> is absorbed either as such, or following its hydrolysis to nicotinic acid. <b>Nicotinamide</b> is present in nature in only small amounts. In unprepared foods, niacin is present mainly {{in the form of the}} cellular pyridine nucleotides NAD and NADP. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the co-enzymes can occur during the course of food preparation. Boiling releases most of the total niacin present in sweet corn as <b>nicotinamide</b> (up to 55mg/kg).|$|E
25|$|Oral <b>nicotinamide</b> {{has been}} {{promoted}} as an over-the-counter drug {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's dementia. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as <b>nicotinamide</b> administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that <b>nicotinamide</b> may treat dementia as related to pellegra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia.|$|E
25|$|Niacin supplementation has {{not been}} found useful for {{decreasing}} the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already on a statin, but appears {{to be effective in}} those not taking a statin. Although niacin and <b>nicotinamide</b> are identical in their vitamin activity, <b>nicotinamide</b> does not have the same pharmacological effects (lipid modifying effects) as niacin. <b>Nicotinamide</b> does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing. As the precursor for NAD and NADP, niacin is also involved in DNA repair.|$|E
25|$|If untreated, {{pellagra}} {{can kill}} within {{four or five}} years. Treatment is with <b>nicotinamide,</b> which has the same vitamin function as niacin and a similar chemical structure, but has lower toxicity. The frequency and amount of <b>nicotinamide</b> administered depends on {{the degree to which}} the condition has progressed.|$|E
25|$|Flushing {{occurs in}} many {{patients}} treated therapeutically with nicotinic acid, {{and as a}} result, <b>nicotinamide</b> holds more clinical value as it is not associated with the same uncomfortable flushing. The adult dose of <b>nicotinamide</b> is 100mg taken orally every 6 hours until resolution of major acute symptoms, followed with oral administration of 50mg every 8–12 hours until skin lesions heal. For children, treatment involves oral ingestion of 10–15mg of <b>nicotinamide,</b> depending on weight, every 6hours until signs and symptoms are resolved. Severe cases require 1gram every 3–4 hours, administered parenterally.|$|E
25|$|Niacin {{cannot be}} {{directly}} converted to <b>nicotinamide,</b> but both compounds are precursors of the coenzymes <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in vivo. NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation {{in the presence}} of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. NADP and NAD are coenzymes for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nicotinamide</b> may be {{toxic to}} the liver at doses {{exceeding}} 3 g/day for adults.|$|E
25|$|Abbreviations: ACP – Acyl carrier protein, CoA – Coenzyme A, NADP – <b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine {{dinucleotide}} phosphate.|$|E
25|$|In animal {{models and}} in vitro, niacin {{produces}} marked anti-inflammatory effects {{in a variety}} of tissues– including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and vascular tissue– through the activation of NIACR1. Niacin has been shown to attenuate neuroinflammation and may have efficacy in treating neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Unlike niacin, <b>nicotinamide</b> does not activate NIACR1, however both niacin and <b>nicotinamide</b> activate the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Saliva stimulants – {{organic acids}} (ascorbic acid, malic acid), chewing gum, {{parasympathomimetic}} drugs (choline esters, e.g. pilocarpine hydrochloride, cholinesterase inhibitors), and other substances (sugar-free mints, <b>nicotinamide).</b>|$|E

25|$|Nicotinic acid– {{involved}} in the synthesis of <b>Nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a co-enzyme that is important in maintaining the redox balance of the cell {{as well as in}} the process of ethanol fermentation itself.|$|E
25|$|ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 is {{reversed}} by giving {{high doses of}} <b>nicotinamide</b> (a form of vitamin B3), since {{this is one of}} the reaction's end products, and high amounts drive the reaction in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|Recurrent {{bacterial}} and {{fungal infections}} and chronic {{inflammation of the}} gut and lungs are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) as well. CGD is a caused by decreased production of <b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by neutrophils.|$|E
25|$|Glucose {{is mainly}} metabolized {{by a very}} {{important}} ten-step pathway called glycolysis, the net result {{of which is to}} break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This also produces a net two molecules of ATP, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting NAD+ (<b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (<b>nicotinamide</b> adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) (e.g., in humans) or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in yeast). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.|$|E
