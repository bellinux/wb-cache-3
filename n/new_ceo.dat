40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} CEO turnover from an internal capital allocation perspective. We test whether <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> make different divisional investment decisions than their predecessors, and if yes, how would this difference affect firm performance. We find that segment investments respond to factors, such as segment investment opportunity, segment cash flow, and other segments’ cash flows, differently after CEO turnover. Evidence also indicates that <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> adjust the segments’ previous over-investment /under-investment status to match industry average investment level, and they adjust the relative investment preference among divisions. These findings support the argument that different CEOs have their own set of skills and incentives, which directly affect their internal capital allocation decisions after they take over the office. We also examine the affiliation relationship between certain divisions and <b>new</b> <b>CEOs,</b> and find that <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> do not make capital allocation in favor their affiliated divisions. Furthermore, the analyses on firm-level internal capital allocation sensitivity {{do not support the}} literature about positive relationship between firm performance and the “Q-sensitivity”. But, our analyses do find a positive and robust relationship between changes in firm performance and changes in the “cash flow-sensitivity”. This suggests that <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> making internal capital allocation in favor of their “cash cow” segments are more likely to improve firm performance after CEO turnover...|$|R

Our research contributes to literature on <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> and impression management. We draw out implications both for management and for further research...|$|R

40|$|Accounting for {{purchased}} goodwill {{has changed from}} amortisation to impairment approach. The standard setters argue that the impairment-only approach will better reflect the underlying economic attributes of goodwill. However, due to the great subjectivity involved in fair values estimate, the impairment approach is susceptible to manipulation. We examine the influence of chief executive officer (CEO) tenure {{on the amount of}} goodwill impairment for a sample of 727 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia from years 2011 to 2012. Our empirical results are contradictory to previous research findings that CEOs with shorter tenure are insignificantly associated with magnitude of goodwill impairment. Further analysis reveals that <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> are associated with a greater magnitude of impairments only when earnings are positive. The result is consistent with the premise of <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> involving in income smoothing, where the incentives to expense goodwill is greatest for profitable firms...|$|R

30|$|Chief {{executive}} officer (CEO) {{commitment to the}} status quo (CSQ) is expected {{to play an important role}} in any firm’s strategic adaptation. CSQ is used often as an explanation for strategic change occurring after <b>CEO</b> succession: <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> are expected to reveal a lower CSQ than established CEOs. Although widely accepted in the literature, this relationship remains imputed but unobserved. We address this research gap and analyze whether <b>new</b> <b>CEOs</b> reveal lower CSQ than established CEOs. By analyzing the letters to the shareholders of German HDAX firms, we find empirical support for our hypothesis of a lower CSQ of newly appointed CEOs compared to established CEOs. However, our detailed analyses provide a differentiated picture. We find support for a lower CSQ of successors after a forced CEO turnover compared to successors after a voluntary turnover, which indicates an influence of the mandate for change on the CEO’s CSQ. However, against the widespread assumption, we do not find support for a lower CSQ of outside successors compared to inside successors, which calls for deeper analyses of the insiderness of <b>new</b> <b>CEOs.</b> Further, our supplementary analyses propose a revised tenure effect: the widely assumed relationship of an increase in CSQ when CEO tenure increases might be driven mainly by the event of CEO succession and may not universally and continuously increase over time, pointing to a “window of opportunity” to initiate strategic change shortly after the succession event. By analyzing the relationship between CEO succession and CEO CSQ, our results contribute to the CSQ literature and provide fruitful impulses for the CEO succession literature.|$|R

It was known by then that Arnold Schwarzenegger's role would be limited, as he had assumed office as Governor of California. The producers sought to have Warner Bros. finance the picture as they did for Terminator 3. In 2005, Stahl said John and Kate would be recast as the story jumped forward in time.

He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E
