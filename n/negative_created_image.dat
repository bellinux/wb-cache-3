Through the means of advertising, a product with all its characteristics and qualities was being introduced to the public. The ad creators competitively search ideas to construct an attractive ad. The depiction of women becomes one of the old-but-believed-to-be-effective-formula for such advertisings. In the world of advertising and marketing, women are not only becoming models for women products, but also for men products. Women figures were depicted beside men models in cigarettes advertising and in turn seemed problematic. A strong and unending debate has been circulating amongst public concerning advertising who significantly exploited women’s sensuality.

This article explores the stereotypical characterization and clichéd narrative devices deployed to create the fictitious character of Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club and examines the ongoing problematic of trans representation within mainstream cinematic texts by comparing Dallas Buyers Club with The Crying Game (1992), Boys Don’t Cry (1999), and Transamerica (2005). To contextualize the ongoing {{issues raised by the}} film and its screenplay, this article reads Rayon as one example {{in a long line of}} socially proscribed Hollywood “fallen women,” here, with the narrative displaced onto the transgender body...|$|R

Primary data source is obtained from DE tweets and NS news {{article on the}} topic of no-hijab policy. The data is analyzed by Pan and Kosicki’s framing model studied comprehensively by Borah (2011) and other relevant resources. The analysis shows that the negative image to BUMN Minister roots from Bare Noun (BN) shift from indefinite to generic that is the source of generalization. Visual marking (by boldfaced, red marks), quotation preferences and other emphasis to muslim related attributes seemed to be by-design-foregrounding method to <b>create</b> <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> to one person, which can be the base to doubt the originality of supporting documents uploaded by DE.

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between women and}} literature inmedieval English literature is a relationship that stressesthe powerlessness of women in literature. Women findthemselves represented in the books because of thewrongs they have committed and literature is often ameans of <b>creating</b> <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of women. Chaucer isconcerned with the place of women in books and heexamines in this context the role of literature and booksas discursive practices. Thus particularly in the Wife ofBath’s Prologue and in the Prologue to the Legend ofGood Women Chaucer questions the truths literaturedevelops about women. This paper argues that Chaucer’squestionings reveal that the patriarchal discourse ofwomen developed by medieval English literature cannotbe trusted because as a discourse it is produced by thepower/knowledge that women lack. Chaucer’s treatmentof the mechanics of literary representation shows that theknowledge about women is produced by a literature thatserves {{the interests of the}} dominant and it producesknowledge about women who lack the power toconstruct or re-construct the truth promoted byliterature. It is this problematic that underlies theobjections of the Wife of Bath and the God of Love to thetruth presented by literature about women...|$|R

Senator Mike Mansfield (D-MT) claimed the referendum [...] "was a reflection of their [...] search for a leader who would respond to their needs... they sensed that Diệm could provide that kind of leadership." [...] Mansfield had been a professor of Asian history before entering politics; as a result his opinions about Vietnam were more influential and held in high regard by his fellow senators. Archives of policy discussions show that the Americans were concerned more about the <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> <b>created</b> by Diem's autocratic and antidemocratic style among the international community, rather than its possible effects on national cohesion.

Its position in the public administration is extremely dissfavorable, because of the role, public procurement stands between public and private sector, therefore such position gives a certain scale of incredulity. Involved parties in the procurement procedures are also parties with diametrically opposite interests and therefore: Public Administration, which is represented by Contracting Authority in the procurement intercourse as the main objective intends to get value for money through these procedures, so it can use the process to satisfy the last buyer, as a pre-condition to establish the images of a good governance, and also to save political jurisdiction as the main objective of every government. The Economic Operator, in this respect, entered the clearest objective, which means achieving the highest profit from the contractual relationship, which stems from a procurement procedure. To achieve this goal, companies oft en reduce the costs of building, service or product quality in order to achieve the highest profit. And this goal only rarely seriously damages the quality of service or labor, and it also <b>creates</b> <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of public procurement...|$|R

Moreover, graphics hardware is utilized to accelerate the image generation.
