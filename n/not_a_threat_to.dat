Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Dolores {{continued}} to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed of , a strong Category 1 hurricane, two days later. Meanwhile, Dolores {{became the first}} hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125°W. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters. The eye dissipated from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared. Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone then crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (west of longitude 140°W) while producing minimal shower activity. It dissipated on July 12. The hurricane was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> any land.|$|E
5|$|On August22, governments {{across the}} Lesser Antilles issued {{tropical}} storm watches. The islands of Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Kitts were placed under {{a tropical storm}} warning the following day. These advisories were discontinued following Danny's degradation to a tropical depression on August24. Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40flights across the eastern Caribbean due to the hurricane and cruise ships altered their courses. Although members of the Haiti Office of Civil Protection issued an official statement to residents saying Danny was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the country, they convened to discuss potential preparations {{and the status of}} emergency supplies. Officials in the United States Virgin Islands distributed sandbags and opened shelters.|$|E

A board of Alien Enemy Hearing judged that Dr. Reich was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the security of the U.S. In 1947, a security investigation concluded that neither the Orgone Project nor any of its staff were engaged in subversive activities or were in violation of any statute within the jurisdiction of the FBI.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems, and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|In 1409, Jelena {{decided to}} travel to Venice to {{negotiate}} peace in person. At the end of May, she arrived in Dubrovnik but {{had to wait for}} almost two months because her hosts warned her that there were Napolitan galleys in the Adriatic Sea. On 9 July 1409, while she was still waiting in Dubrovnik, Venice purchased the entire Dalmatian coast from Ladislaus of Naples for 100,000 ducats. The Kingdom of Naples was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Venetians anymore. By gaining the Dalmatian coast, Venetians further increased their influence and power in the region of the Adriatic Sea, which made Jelena's negotiating position difficult. When she finally arrived in Venice at the end of July, she was financially broken because of her long voyage. The Venetians had to support her with three ducats a day during negotiations which lasted for the next three months. On 26 October 1409, a year-long peace agreement with the Venetian doge, Michele Steno, was signed without territorial changes for any of the parties. Jelena traveled back to Zeta through Dubrovnik where she received 100 ducats worth of presents. Although both she and the Venetian representative swore on the Gospel to respect the truce, in reality there was no peace.|$|E

The authorities concluded that the wrecks were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the water quality. The Norwegian Aviation Museum received permission from the Ministry of Defense in 1995 to raise the wrecks, as they never determined what to do with {{the aircraft}}.|$|E

25|$|Luke {{needed to}} define the {{position}} of Christians in relation to two political and social entities, the Roman Empire and Judaism. Regarding the Empire Luke makes clear that, while Christians are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the established order, the rulers of this world hold their power from Satan, and the essential loyalty of Christ's followers is to God and this world will be the kingdom of God, ruled by Christ the King. Regarding the Jews, Luke emphasises the fact that Jesus and all his earliest followers were Jews, although by his time the majority of Christ-followers were gentiles; nevertheless, the Jews had rejected and killed the Messiah, and the Christian mission now lay with the gentiles.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{military}} defeats {{shook the}} public's {{faith in the}} French Directory. The Coup of 30 Prairial VII occurred on 18 June which pushed Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès and Paul Barras into leading roles and elevated Jean Baptiste Bernadotte to the post of Minister of War. There were two major forces in Italy, the 19,000-strong Army of the Alps under Jean Étienne Championnet and 40,713 men of the Army of Italy. The French government placed its hopes on Barthélemy Catherine Joubert to retrieve the situation as the new commander of the Army of Italy. Not only was Joubert a talented general, but he {{was believed to be}} lacking political ambitions and thus <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the government. When Joubert arrived in the theater on 4 August, Moreau gracefully stepped aside and offered his assistance.|$|E

25|$|The sand tiger {{is often}} {{associated}} with being vicious or deadly, due to its relatively large size and sharp, protruding teeth that point outward from its jaws; however, these sharks are quite docile, and are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> humans. Their mouths are not large enough to cause a human fatality. Sand tigers roam the surf, sometimes in close proximity to humans, and there have been only a few instances of unprovoked sand tiger shark attacks on humans, usually associated with spear fishing, line fishing, or shark feeding. As of 2013, the database of Shark Attack Survivors does not list any fatalities due to sand tiger sharks. When the sharks become aggressive, they tend to steal fish or bait from fishing lines rather than attack humans. Owing to its large size and docile temperament, the sand tiger is commonly displayed in aquariums around the world.|$|E
25|$|When Ray Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1968 it {{appeared}} that the Test career of the 36-year-old off-spinner was over, but he transferred to Leicestershire and was made captain. Although he had never been captain before his experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have helped Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The selectors had long regarded Colin Cowdrey as England's natural cricket captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had {{been in and out of}} the national side for years, but had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was originally chosen over his rivals like Brian Close as he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's in 1969, England collapsed to 61–5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2–0 and was confirmed as captain even when Cowdrey recovered.|$|E

500|$|Further {{criticism}} was leveled against the sheriff's office's deputies for {{the shooting of}} Calvo's two dogs. [...] Contrary to the official internal investigations conducted by the sheriff's office and the county, Calvo stated his dogs were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the deputies. [...] To support his claims, Calvo paid for a necropsy to be conducted on each dog by the Maryland Department of Agriculture. [...] According to the results, one dog was shot four times, including twice {{in the head and}} chest. [...] The other dog was shot twice, including once {{in the back of the}} leg which bolsters Calvo's argument that the dog was fleeing and that the force used was [...] "unbelievably excessive". This version of events was also confirmed by the later testimony of a law enforcement officer present at the raid.|$|E
500|$|Most predators {{in their}} habitat were {{relatively}} smallabout {{the size of}} a wolfand were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Paraceratherium. Adult individuals would be too large for most predators to attack, but the young would have been vulnerable. Bite marks on bones from the Bugti beds indicate that even adults may have been preyed on by -long crocodiles, Crocodylus bugtiensis. As in elephants, the gestation period of Paraceratherium may have been lengthy and individuals may have had long lifespans. Paraceratherium may have lived in small herds, perhaps consisting of females and their calves, which they protected from predators. It has been proposed that [...] may be the maximum weight possible for land mammals, and Paraceratherium was close to this limit. The reasons mammals cannot reach the much larger size of sauropod dinosaurs are unknown. The reason may be ecological instead of biomechanical, and perhaps related to reproduction strategies. Movement, sound, and other behaviours seen in CGI documentaries such as [...] "Walking With Beasts" [...] are entirely conjectural.|$|E
