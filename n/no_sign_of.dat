5|$|Van Gogh painted {{several groups}} of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he {{completed}} numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped crossbow bolts at the site showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> corrosion after more than 2,000 years, {{because they had been}} coated in chromium. Chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E
30|$|Ischemic kidneys of scid beige mice {{exhibited}} tubular dilatation and cytoplasmic degeneration as <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> hypoxia. Tissue viability {{was excellent}} with <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> necrosis. In addition, no inflammatory infiltration was found (Figure 4 C). Contralateral non-ischemic kidneys showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> structural damage (Figure 4 D).|$|R

5|$|Ellen {{became a}} tourist {{attraction}} for the village, and her family made considerable money from visitors' donations. As the years progressed with <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> Ellen's waking, speculation grew that her illness was either a hoax or caused by her mother, an issue that was never resolved. In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen horses {{started at}} the 2013 Belmont Stakes. Oxbow drew the number seven post position, with rival Orb at post five. There were {{concerns}} about Stevens' fitness as he had missed races after being thrown from a horse the previous week, but medical tests showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> injury. Oxbow was the third favorite at 5–1 on the morning line, but by race time his odds were at 10–1.|$|E
5|$|Nutrients are transported {{throughout}} the coelom, including the mantle lobes, by cilia. The wastes produced by metabolism are broken into ammonia, which is eliminated by diffusion through the mantle and lophophore. Brachiopods have metanephridia, {{used by many}} phyla to excrete ammonia and other dissolved wastes. However, brachiopods have <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the podocytes, which perform {{the first phase of}} excretion in this process, and brachiopod metanephridia appear to be used only to emit sperm and ova.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, 1868, {{two weeks}} after Carpenter had {{returned}} to Fort Wallace with the survivors of Forsyth’s command, he was ordered out once again. Troops H and I of the 10th Cavalry sallied forth to escort Major Carr of the 5th Cavalry to his new command with supplies to Beaver Creek. Near there Carpenter's supply train and command was attacked by a force of about 500 Indians with <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the 5th Cavalry present.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} haemorrhage, {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and even that he had drunk himself to death. Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> Roman occupation, but the Anglo-Saxons took Watchet {{from the}} native Britons around AD 680. Under Alfred the Great (AD 871−901) Watchet became an {{important}} port, and coins minted here have been found {{as far away as}} Copenhagen and Stockholm. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the early port being plundered by Danes led by Earl Ottir and a 'Hroald' (possibly Ottir's king Ragnall) in 987 and 997.|$|E

Walter nearly suffocates from an agent left by Hoffman, but Olivia and Peter are able to save him in time. As the FBI search the premises, they find evidence that points to a convention being held to promote world equality. Olivia and Peter depart {{to try to find}} Hoffman, while Walter remains behind, examining Hoffman's equipment.|$|E
5|$|Videos with {{progressive}} scanning or {{interlaced scanning}} can be uploaded, {{but for the}} best video quality, YouTube suggests interlaced videos be deinterlaced before uploading. All the video formats on YouTube use progressive scanning. YouTube's statistics shows that interlaced videos are still being uploaded to YouTube, and there is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> that actually dwindling. YouTube attributes this to uploading of made-for-TV content.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten days}} she was {{returned}} to sea and reached Port Dalrymple {{on the morning of}} 5 November. Buffalo had already arrived, but there was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building a settlement {{in the area of}} the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, with <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} {{that one of}} them should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the Custom of the Sea and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E

In this serial we see his daughter, Paula Quatermass, who works as an assistant at the Rocket Group, but there is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a wife or other children. In the fourth episode of the serial he mentions that he never reached his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, tying in with The Quatermass Memoirs later assertion of his wife's early death.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the health}} of the Dry Island Albertosaurus {{assembly}} was reported upon. Most specimens showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
