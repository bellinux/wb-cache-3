5|$|All studies {{revealed}} minor {{improvements in}} household <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability,</b> with the 1985 study revealing an improvement of vitamin and mineral consumption over non-participating {{families and the}} 1993 study partially confirming these results. The most extensive study on <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> was published in 1996, which concluded that nutrition did not change significantly after {{the implementation of the}} NAP program for all beneficiaries, however most improvements were noted for very low-income beneficiaries versus their non-participating equivalents.|$|E
5|$|The insects {{captured}} by the glandular trichomes {{are too small to}} serve any role in pollination. It is unclear, however, whether these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the program}} started in 1982, only three formal studies over the {{nutritional}} {{impact of the}} benefits provided to each family have been publicly released, in 1985, 1993, and 1996, respectively. All studies were designed to analyze {{the impact of the}} program with respect to the previous food stamps program, focusing on changes in household <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability,</b> while the 1985 and 1993 studies also focused on changes in household food expenditures (the amount of money households spent on acquiring food).|$|E
50|$|In strain CTC 494, the {{presence}} of salt and a curing agent (sodium chloride and sodium nitrite) reduces {{the production of the}} antilisterial bacteriocin sakacin K. Growth of CTC 494 is also dependent on <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of soil types on the forest soil fertility in the subtropical region. Three sampling points were established for each soil type (limestone, marlstone and silicate). Samples were taken from surface and subsurface soils in each site and analysed for total C, total N, total P, organic P and soil pH. The main objectives were; (1) quantification and comparison of nutrients distribution and cycling in forests under different soil types. (2) Evaluation of impact of acidic soils on the forest soil fertility. The soil pH showed that limestone and marlstone soils were neutral to alkaline with pH range (5. 84 - 7. 81), while that from silicate rock was strongly acidic with pH range (3. 41 - 4. 99). The quantities of <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> are different within these three geological sites of soil formation. Limestone soils shows to have much more <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> followed by marlstone and silicate soils. In comparison to soil layers, surface soils (0 - 10 cm) also have much <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> than subsurface soils (10 - 20 cm) in all sampling stations. All three types of soils show to be more favourable with C/N ratio than C/P ratio. The C/N ratio in this study varied between 10 to 70; while C/P ratio varied between 150 to 2070...|$|R
50|$|Caloric {{restriction}} {{lowers the}} core body temperature, a phenomenon {{believed to be}} an adaptive response to reduce energy expenditure when <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> is limited. Lowering the temperature may prolong the lifespan of cold blooded animals. Mice, which are warm blooded, have been engineered to have a reduced core body temperature which increased the lifespan independently of calorie restriction.|$|R
5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> is low, competition from other plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E
5|$|The mallard is {{omnivorous}} {{and very}} flexible in its choice of food. Its diet may vary based on several factors, including {{the stage of}} the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability,</b> and interspecific and intraspecific competition. The majority of the mallard's diet seems to be made up of gastropods, invertebrates (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies), crustaceans, worms, many varieties of seeds and plant matter, and roots and tubers. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter. Plants generally make up the larger part of a bird's diet, especially during autumn migration and in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability.</b> The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
30|$|Present {{study showed}} that {{vermicomposting}} helps to enhance the transformation of P from RP into various organic or inorganic P forms, which would be readily or moderately available. Thus, increase the availability of P from both RPs. RPs application helped the decrease of pH through vermicomposting which would cause higher <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability.</b> EC increased by vermicomposting but RP addition had a little effect on it.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the basic soil testing, micro nutrient analysis is also becoming increasingly important, especially since many soils in India {{are found to be}} deficient in {{one or more of the}} micro <b>nutrients.</b> <b>Availability</b> of micronutrients in the right proportion in the soil ensures higher productivity of farming. RCF's Trombay laboratory is engaged in the analysis of micronutrients. This analysis is done at a nominal rate of â‚¹80/- per sample.|$|R
30|$|Vermicomposting could {{increase}} <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> including phosphorus. During vermicomposting, a decomposition of organic substrates {{leads to the}} production of several organic acids, such as malonic, fumaric, succinic acids. Microorganisms both in the intestinal organ of the worms and the organic waste have the ability to convert insoluble P into soluble forms. Little information exists about the effects of vermicomposting on rock phosphate (RP) solubilization. Present study was conducted to evaluate the solubilization of powdered RP during vermicomposting.|$|R
5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{distribution}} of extracellular enzyme activities in particle-size fractions of sediments {{was investigated in}} a subtropical mangrove ecosystem. Five enzymes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling were analyzed in the sand, silt, and clay of sediments. Among these fractions, the highest activities of phenol oxidase (PHO), Î²-D-glucosidase (GLU), and N-acetyl-glucosiminidase (NAG) were found in sand, and greater than bulk sediments of both intertidal zone (IZ) and mangrove forest (MG). This result implied that sand fractions might protect selective enzymes through the adsorption without affecting their activities. Additionally, the enzyme-based resource allocation in various particle-size fractions demonstrated that <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> varied with different particle-size fractions and only sand fraction of MG with highest total C showed high N and P availability among fractions. Besides, the analysis between elemental contents and enzyme activities in particle size fractions suggested that enzymes could monitor the changes of <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> and be good indicators of ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Thus, these results provided a means to assess the <b>availability</b> of different <b>nutrients</b> (C, N, and P) during decomposition of sediment organic matter (SOM), and thus helping to better manage the subtropical mangrove ecosystems to sequester C into SOM...|$|R

30|$|Vermicompost is an {{efficient}} tool {{to manage the}} utilization of organic residues (Garg et al. 2006) and increase <b>nutrients</b> <b>availability</b> including phosphorus (Ghosh et al. 1999; Venkatesh and Eevera 2008). During vermicomposting, a decomposition of organic substrates leads {{to the production of}} several organic acids such as malonic, fumaric, succinic acids (Epstein 1997), and soluble humic molecules (Atiyeh et al. 2002). Both assimilation and mineralization of phosphorus are microorganisms mediated processes and application of vermicompost increases the rates of these two processes in soil.|$|R
25|$|Enriching {{soil with}} compost adds {{substantial}} nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, carbon and calcium. In this regard compost {{is equivalent to}} many fertilizers and manures purchased in garden stores. Compost from composting toilets has a higher <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> than the dried feces that result from a urine-diverting dry toilet.|$|E
25|$|Disturbance {{of native}} plant {{communities}} in desertification-threatened areas is often followed by degradation {{of physical and}} biological soil properties, soil structure, <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability,</b> and organic matter.

25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of septate hyphae, a coenocytic, {{transfer}} cell-like structure {{characterizes the}} Hartig net of many ectomycorrhizas, which facilitates interhyphal transport. Wall ingrowths in Pisonia, for example, resemble those found in other plant species where transfer cells yield high rates of nutrient transport between apoplast and symplast. Overall, ectomycorrhizal fungi receive approximately 15% of the net primary production and can provide up to 86% of a hostâ€™s nitrogen needs. Carbon allocation {{has been shown to be}} correlated with growth rates and <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability.</b> Belowground allocation is highest when <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> is low and when growth rates are reduced. Phosphorus is another typically limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems. Evidence suggests that phosphorus is transferred largely as inorganic orthophosphate. Some mat-forming ectomycorrhizas contain ribonucleases capable of rapidly hydrolyzing DNA in order to obtain phosphorus from nuclei.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} forage fish, driven by <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> and their {{life-cycle}} stage, form vast schools at predictable locations {{and times of}} the year. Normally, schooling works well as protection from occasional predators. Fish schooling in vast numbers may attract correspondingly huge numbers of predators, including seabirds, sharks, tuna, billfish, pods of dolphins, and killer and humpback whales. Aggregations of predators on such a scale means the schools can be attacked on all sides and panicked into forming bait balls.|$|E

25|$|The {{intertidal}} and benthic estuary {{is presently}} dominated by mudflats that are largely {{the result of}} sedimentation derived from gold mining in the Sierra Nevada in the late 19th century. The trend toward high sediment loads was reversed in the 1950s {{with the advent of}} the Central Valley Project, locking up most sediment behind dams, and resulting in an annual net loss of sediments from the estuary. Thus the mudflats appear to be slowly receding, although turbidity remains extremely high. The high turbidity of the water is responsible for the unique condition that exists in the San Francisco Estuary wherein high <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability</b> does not lead to high phytoplankton production. Instead, most algae photosynthetic organisms are light-limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{islands are}} part of the Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra {{ecoregion}} that includes several subantarctic islands. In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, lichens, and mosses. Low plant diversity reflects the islandsâ€™ isolation, small size, severe climate, the short, cool growing season and, for Heard Island, substantial permanent ice cover. The main environmental determinants of vegetation on subantarctic islands are wind exposure, water availability, parent soil composition, salt spray exposure, <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability,</b> disturbance by trampling (from seabirds and seals) and, possibly, altitude. At Heard Island, exposure to salt spray and the presence of breeding and moulting seabirds and seals are particularly strong influences on vegetation composition and structure in coastal areas.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{functions}} as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals. For example, in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which feeds on bacteria, serotonin is released as a signal in response to positive events, such as finding {{a new source of}} food or in male animals finding a female with which to mate. When a well-fed worm feels bacteria on its cuticle, dopamine is released, which slows it down; if it is starved, serotonin also is released, which slows the animal down further. This mechanism increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. The released serotonin activates the muscles used for feeding, while octopamine suppresses them. Serotonin diffuses to serotonin-sensitive neurons, which control the animal's perception of <b>nutrient</b> <b>availability.</b>|$|E
