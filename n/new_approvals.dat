30|$|Six {{thousand}} years B.C. the old Egyptians {{already used}} plants to treat ailments, thus many centuries empirical knowledge was collected {{on use of}} herbal remedies. As yet, the majority of phytotherapeutics in use in the European community is approved merely based on such empirical knowledge. At {{the very end of}} the XX. century however, in medicine evidence based scientific guidelines were introduced and <b>new</b> <b>approvals</b> request scientific evidence of efficacy. There are different tools in use for assessment of evidence and for generating recommendations, but all those systems require controlled trials to show efficacy against placebo or at least a proven comparator drug.

30|$|Nowadays getting RCT’s {{sponsored}} for {{herbal remedies}} is feasible as the proven evidence is related {{not to a}} plant {{or a combination of}} plants but only to the proven, unique remedy (see dot 5 above). Efficacy of herbal compounds is highly dependent on the plants used, extraction and standardization methods. Results of clinical trials for a distinct preparation cannot be transferred for other preparations using the same plant or combination of plants. Many patented herbal remedies are available for trials and treatment. Moreover, for acute bronchitis/common cold, a 15  years old tool, BSS (bronchitis severity scale) is now a validated outcome measure [31, 32]. Also recommendations for cough monitoring now exist [10]. Thus, in contrast to synthetic drugs, each herbal compound needs independent RCT’s for proof of efficacy.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundEmergency {{physicians}} make treatment {{decisions in}} patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). They also encounter patients on target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) who require urgent intervention. <b>New</b> <b>approvals</b> and increasing prescriptions for TSOACs (e. g., apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) {{for the management of}} several thromboembolic disorders warrant an evaluation of the impact of these agents in the ED setting. Objective of the ReviewThis review discusses the use of TSOACs in the ED for the treatment of acute VTE, and highlights strategies for the management of patients on TSOACs who present to the ED with other complications, such as bleeding complications or requiring emergency surgery. DiscussionApixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban have been approved for the treatment of acute VTE. We discuss the impact of this on ED management of TSOAC-naïve patients and highlight results with TSOACs in high-risk subgroups including the elderly and those with prior VTE or active cancer. This review also discusses management strategies for patients on TSOACs. For emergency physicians, strategies for the management of bleeding, approaches to patient care when emergency surgery is needed, laboratory assays for measuring plasma concentrations of TSOACs, and drug–drug interactions are of special importance. ConclusionsFamiliarity with TSOACs will better position emergency physicians to provide state-of-the art care to their patients with VTE and help them manage potentially complicated circumstances related to the chronic use of these drugs...|$|E

40|$|PurposeThe International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry {{monitored}} for {{a signal}} of {{a substantial increase in}} the frequency of major congenital malformations associated with lamotrigine exposures in pregnancy over an 18 -year period. Key methodological lessons are discussed. Methods The strengths and weaknesses of the Registry were assessed using quantifiable methodological and operational parameters including enrollment, completeness of exposure and outcome data reporting, and lost to follow-up. The choice of comparator groups and stopping rules for registry closure were critically evaluated. ResultsThe reliance on voluntary reporting was associated with a clustered geographical distribution of registered pregnancies. The enrollment rate increased over time with <b>new</b> <b>approvals</b> and indications for lamotrigine and publication of interim data. Reporter burden was minimized through a streamlined data collection approach resulting in a high level of completeness of exposure and primary outcome data. Lost to follow-up rates were high (28. 5 % overall) representing a major limitation; incentives to increase the completeness of reporting failed to reduce rates. A lack of an internal comparator group complicated data interpretation; but external comparisons with multiple external groups allowed an assessment of consistency of outcome data across multiple data sources. A lack of a priori closure criteria prolonged the life of the Registry, and consideration of regulatory guidelines on this subject is encouraged at the time of conception of future registries. ConclusionsA successful pregnancy exposure registry requires ongoing flexibility and continuous re-assessment of enrollment, recruitment, and retention methods and the availability of comparison data, throughout its lifecycle.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prior {{research}} on neglected disease drug development suggested inadequate funding {{was responsible for}} relatively few <b>new</b> <b>approvals.</b> In response, significantly more resources have been allocated towards development of drugs targeting neglected diseases. Our objective was to reassess drug development between 1975 and 1999, evaluate progress in neglected disease drug development since 2000, and explain how increased numbers of approvals are a necessary but insufficient condition to improving access. METHODS: To assess numbers of approvals targeting neglected diseases, we employed two distinct methodologies: First, to revisit numbers published in Trouiller et al. (2002) we used their method to count marketed new chemical entities (NCEs) between 1975 and 1999. Second, using the G-Finder report as a benchmark, we identified which diseases are currently considered "neglected" to tally approvals in the 1975 - 1999 and 2000 - 2009 periods. Searching PharmaProjects and IMS R&D Focus databases as well as websites from numerous drug regulatory agencies, we identified new drug approvals and indications. Also, we examined the World Health Organization's (WHO) Essential Drug List (EDL) to see which drugs and indications were on the list. FINDINGS: Upon recount, using Trouiller et al. methodology, we found that between 1975 and 1999 more NCEs (n = 32) targeting tropical diseases and tuberculosis were approved than reported in Trouiller et al. (n = 16). Using the G-Finder method of defining neglected diseases, we found 46 new drug approvals between 1975 and 1999. WHO included 85 % of these drugs on the EDL. In the period 2000 to May 2009, despite much greater funding, only 26 new drugs and vaccines for neglected diseases were marketed. Of these, WHO placed 50 % on the EDL. CONCLUSIONS: Product approvals for neglected diseases have increased, though progress has been uneven, with malaria appearing to benefit most {{in the short run}} from increased funding, while less success has been booked in other disease categories. Uneven progress suggests funding could be better targeted, particularly with regard to neglected diseases that have hitherto received scant attention. In addition, policymakers should focus on other aspects related to access. Besides drug development, there are the issues of EDL listing, architecture, availability, affordability, and adoption...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I study {{a policy}} process that led into a {{possibility}} {{to ban the}} cultivation of GMOs in the member states of the European Union. In practice, this happened by adding a new article to the directive 2001 / 18 /EC. Before the policy process, all the member states were required to allow the cultivation of GMOs that were authorized at the EU level. However, this prior “one-size-fits-all approach” did not work as planned. A number of member states invoked safeguard clauses to prevent the cultivation of the authorized GMO crops, while the pro-GMO countries could not cultivate as great {{of a variety of}} different GMO crops because other countries were blocking the authorization of them. In addition, because of a continuous blocking of <b>new</b> <b>approvals</b> on GMOs, the EU had in place an unofficial de facto moratorium of new GMO approvals which was problematic {{from the point of view}} of the rules of the international trade. In this thesis, I study the legislative process that led into amending the directive 2001 / 18 /EC and to some extent, renationalizing the decision-making on GMO cultivation. The focus is on the roles of the main EU decision-making bodies in the process, namely the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The interest lied in the interplay between the institutions, the expected preferences of them and dynamics within the Council. The analysis is done by using three different approaches. The model used in this thesis regarding the expected preferences of the institutions is based on Mark. A. Pollack’s (2003) perception of the principal-agent analysis in rational choice institutionalism. In addition to this, the Parliament’s environmental ambition is analyzed by using typology developed by Burns and Carter (2010). The strategy used by the “leader” countries within the Council are analyzed by using the classification by Liefferink and Andersen (1998). Key material for this research consists of the official drafting documents of the directive, as well as journalistic reports. The method of the thesis is an intrinsic case study. The case that is studied is the policy process 2010 - 2015 that led to member states’ right to ban the cultivation of GMO crops in their territory. The decision was made under the rules of the co-decision procedure. The analysis revealed a political environment unfavorable to the continuance of the centralized approach. The Commission and the Parliament both acted in a counterintuitive manner throughout the policy process as they are generally believed to be both pro-integration and for maximizing competences, both for themselves and for the Union as a whole. A slightly deeper look into the history of the food-related risk regulation, the prevalent political environment of the time and the policy documents provide a few possible reasons for their actions such as increased Euroscepticism, that has also in the past affected in a similar manner the Commission. In addition, the analysis revealed that the Parliament demonstrated pro-environmental preferences, as it made pro-environmental amendments to the initial proposal for the directive despite many of them being blocked by the two other institutions. Still, the Parliament was able to ‘green’ the proposal, even though the final text was closer to the common position of the Council. Within the Council, a pushing effect of certain “green member states”, especially Austria’s, was prominent...|$|E
40|$|The Personal Protective Technology (PPT) Program is a {{world leader}} in keeping American workers safe through PPT research, {{standards}} de- velopment, respirator conformity assessment, public outreach and in- formation dissemination. This snap- shot shows recent accomplishments and upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Personal Protective Technology (PPT) Program works to evaluate, and improve equipment worn by workers and develop interventions {{to protect them from}} hazards. Technologies include respirators, protective clothing, gloves, eye, fall and hearing protection, hard hats, and sensors to detect hazardous substances. The PPT program works collaboratively with industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia. The program focuses on these areas: 1. Providing processes to ensure PPT meet the requirements of the appropriate standards. Respirator approval and post approval evaluation is especially important. 2. Ensuring PPT effectiveness including research to evaluate performance, comfort, fit and usability 3. Improving protection provided by all types of PPT by developing science-based standards, guidance and interventions. What do we do? 1. Certify that new respirators meet minimum construction, performance, and respiratory protection standards before they enter the market. 2. Conduct site and field audits to ensure respirators continue to meet standards after approval. 3. Develop and implement science-based national guidance for respiratory and other PPT. 4. Develop new methods to test effectiveness of PPT for workers, including workers engaged in infectious disease work. 5. Create guidance and tools to help employers and workers use PPT as effectively and economically as possible 6. Develop and evaluate innovative PPT designs and test methods to improve comfort, fit and usability. What have we accomplished? 1. Completed 364 respirator certification decisions resulting in 733 <b>new</b> <b>approvals.</b> 2.
