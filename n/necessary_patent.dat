Further, the international and technological scope of a company's patent strategy can be assessed. This information is particularly interesting for the evaluation of a firm's innovative potential. Besides, it allows conclusions to be drawn on the innovative dynamics of the considered market segment, in this case dietary supplements. The results are shown in graphs and spider charts. In sum, we can make conclusions about the relative innovative power and patent strength of a company within the selected market segment. We draw conclusions on the importance of patents as a method of knowledge protection in this market and gather insights about the availability of companies that are potentially suitable for co-operations or acquisitions.

Cap arrangement tests (e. g. Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue, Farnsworth D- 15, L'Anthony D- 15 Desaturated, etc.) are among the most valid and reliable color vision tests to quantify color deficits currently available. However, these tests, particularly the FM 100, are time consuming to score and are highly susceptible to transcription errors. Researchers at the University of Missouri-St. Louis have developed the Automatic Cap Arrangement Scoring Device (ACASD) to significantly reduce testing time and improve measurement reliability of cap arrangement tests by electronically automating scoring and data entry. Once the patient places the caps in the test tray, the rest will be automatic [...] scoring, data entry and printing of results.

40|$|Innovative {{activities}} have public good characteristics {{in the sense}} that the cost of producing the innovation is high compared to the cost of producing subsequent units. Moreover, knowledge of how to produce subsequent units is widely known once the innovation has occurred and is, therefore, non-rivalrous. The main question of this paper is whether mechanisms can be found which exploit market information to provide appropriate incentives for innovation. The ability of the mechanism designer to exploit such information depends crucially on the ability of the innovator to manipulate market signals. We show that if the innovator cannot manipulate market signals, then the efficient levels of innovation can be implemented without deadweight losses - for example, by using appropriately designed prizes. If the innovator can use bribes, buybacks, or other ways of manipulating market signals, <b>patents</b> are <b>necessary.</b> Public goods; <b>Patents...</b>|$|R

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} the dogma of U. S. patent law that direct infringement is a strict liability tort. Impermissibly practicing a patented invention does create liability {{even if the}} infringer {{did not intend to}} infringe or know about the patent. The consensus {{is that this is a}} form of strict liability. The flaw in the consensus is that it proves too little, for the same is true of intentional torts: intent to commit the tort is unnecessary, and ignorance of the legal right is no excuse. What is relevant is intent to perform the action that the law deems tortious. So for the tort of patent infringement, the question is whether liability should require that the infringer intended to perform the actions that constitute infringement. The patent statute and the few cases that have broached the question suggest the answer is yes‚Äîtortious intent should be <b>necessary.</b> However, <b>patent</b> law currently takes no position on tortious intent. The strict liability view is merely a default. This Article fills that gap by applying ordinary tort principles to patent infringement. The proposed framework offers a powerful policy lever for important issues implicating the notice function of patents, including divided infringement, claim construction, and inherency. This framework also mitigates the effects of patent assertion on risk allocation in the patent system by differentiating among makers, sellers, and users of patented innovation‚Äîa distinction that is economically important but has no principled basis in patent doctrine...|$|R

The appointment of eight additional senators allowed a slight majority for the Progressive Conservative Party. There was one unsuccessful attempt to use Section 26, by Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1874. It was denied by Queen Victoria, on the advice of the British Cabinet. The invocation of Section 26 does not oblige the Governor General to appoint four or eight senators - it could theoretically be used to appoint just a single extra senator (for example, the representation of a senator under 75 who has been permanently incapaciated could be replaced by invoking Section 26 without the need to appoint senators from other regions) although the clause has never been used in such a manner. Also, this clause does not result in a permanent {{increase in the number of}} Senate seats, however. Instead, an attrition process is applied by which senators leaving office through normal means are not replaced until after their province has returned to its normal number of seats.|$|R

However, {{most of these are}} subjective methods. This thesis strives to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new device, the Dorsiflexometer {{that can be used to}} objectively assess one‚Äôs balance abilities. The Dorsiflexometer was constructed and mathematically modelled using appropriate simplifying assumptions. After its construction, the Dorsiflexometer was tested using two experimental set-ups to obtain raw data. Both these set-ups consisted of the two tiltable platforms equipped with three load cells each, the bridge amplifiers and the personal computer (PC). The only difference in the two experimental set-ups is in the type of test that was performed as well as the bridge amplifiers used. Numerous parameters, such as the radius of movement and the Lyapunov number can be extracted from the raw data. A computer program was written to analyse the raw data and present the results in a user-friendly manner. A new parameter, the Sway Index, was used to obtain a single balance value for the tested individual. This parameter proved useful in quantifying balance.

MethodsBetween November 1991 and June 2001, a total of 54 patients (median age 3. 2 years, range 7 weeks‚Äì 40 years) with either congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (n = 51) or atrioventricular discordance with double-outlet right ventricle (n = 3) underwent anatomic repair. This comprised a Senning procedure in all cases plus arterial switch (double-switch group) in 29 cases (53. 7 %), plus a Rastelli procedure (Rastelli-Senning group) in 22 cases (40. 7 %), and plus intraventricular rerouting (Senning-tunnel group) in 3 cases (5. 6 %). Left ventricular training by PA banding was performed before the double-switch operation in 9 of 29 cases (31 %). Follow-up is complete (median 4. 4 years). ResultsEarly mortality was 5. 6 % (n = 3), with 2 late deaths. Kaplan-Meier survivals (¬± SEM) were 94. 4 % ¬± 3. 1 % at 1 year and 89. 7 % ¬± 4. 4 % at 9 years. Survivals at 7 years were 84. 9 % ¬± 7. 1 % in the double-switch group and 95. 5 % ¬± 4. 4 % in the Rastelli-Senning group (P =. 32). Of the 49 survivors, 46 (94 %) were in New York Heart Association functional class I. Six have acquired new left ventricular dilatation or impaired systolic ventricular function. Four patients in the double-switch group had moderate aortic valve regurgitation develop, and 2 of them required valve replacement.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between IPRs and standards has lately raised growing {{concerns in the}} information and communication technology (ICT) industry. These highly controversial issues include industry standards embracing proprietary technologies, excessive royalties {{for the use of}} proprietary technologies, and the refusal to grant licenses for the use of proprietary technologies. This study examines the patent licensing practice in the ICT industry, the EU‚Äôs regulation on intellectual property licensing and standardization, aims to find out how best to balance standardization and access to essential patents. The study applies entitlement theory to examine the two traditional approaches to facilitating exploitation of patented technology. The market approach that suggests transaction can distribute technological resource to the one that value it most may not be effective because of the poor quality of patents in the industry and the high transaction costs resulting from the high fragmentation of technology and the use of patent for strategy purpose. The intervention approach that suggests applying compulsory license or rules of abuse of patent against patent holders may ignores right holder‚Äôs subjective valuation of rights and disrupt right holder‚Äôs plan to exploit the right based on that valuation, therefore the application of this approach is limited to only exceptional circumstances. Given that, the study suggests that a cooperative scheme that facilitates licensing of industry wide generally used technology, which mixes the market and intervention approaches, may be effective. Firstly, global patent explosion, the division of technology creation from technology implementation, the convergence of complex technologies, and highly standard-dependent in the industry lead to the problems. Industry wide cooperation is needed in dealing with these common problems. Secondly, standards and patents are not in contradiction inherently. Patent holders may favor standardization as a way to share its innovation with those who could commercialize and use the technology, and as an opportunity to reap the fruits of their R&D investment. Indeed both standards and patents serve a same purpose of promoting innovation. Therefore the cooperation may be desirable. A cooperative scheme may not only manage and share existing resources but also engage in producing those resources and encourage the creation of new resources in the future. Nonetheless this study finds that the collective action problems such as free riding, prisoner dilemma, which usually leads to non-corporation, are main obstacle for creating a cooperative scheme. To overcome these problems, standard setting and selection process can be improved in order to develop such a cooperative scheme. Moreover, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing conditions established in intellectual property rules of standard-setting organizations or in competition rules could be a flexible mean in creating an optimal arrangement to balance encouragement of individuals to contribute to standardization and encouragement of exploitation of patented technology. Patent system is designed to stimulate investment in R&D and invention and to stimulate public disclosure of technological information and further stimulate commercial exploitation of technology by granting paten owners exclusive rights over his invention. Industry standards are common language of industry which is generally used by each member of an industry. A patent grants an individual the right to exploit a piece of technology exclusively, while a standard is intended to identify a common pool of technology to be used by everyone. There is an obvious tension between the private character of patents and the public nature of standards. Because standards define design or performance characteristics that products or services must have, they inevitably overlap some claims of patents. When these patents are essential to a standard, it is unlikely for anyone to bypass them in implementing a standard. In the wireless technology industry, on one hand, the technologies have been standardized to secure the seamless roaming worldwide, on the other hand, there are a larger number patents in the industry held by various companies. As a result, since 2001, almost all of the market players have been involved in patent infringement suits. These patent battles indicate the high transaction cost for acquiring <b>necessary</b> <b>patents,</b> which may impede the commercialization of technology and further innovation. This study examines the patent licensing practice in the ICT industry, the EU‚Äôs regulation on intellectual property licensing and standardization, aims to find out how best to balance standardization and access to essential patents. Traditionally the market approach suggests transaction can distribute technology to the one that value it most may not be effective. But the poor quality of patents and the high transaction costs may make the market approach inefficient. The intervention approach suggests applying compulsory license or rules of abuse of patent to force patent holders to share their technology with others. But this approach may disrupt right holder‚Äôs interests in exploiting its own property, therefore stifling the incentive to innovation. Given that, the study suggests that a cooperative scheme that facilitates licensing of industry wide generally used technology, which mixes the market and intervention approaches, may be effective. Firstly, global patent explosion, the division of technology creation from technology implementation, the convergence of complex technologies, and highly standard-dependent in the industry lead to the problems.

Not all the rabbits treated with small repeated doses of the serum survive. Those that succumb do so not to a general infection but to a pneumococcus meningitis. The explanation of this phenomenon is simple. When the number of pneumococci originally inoculated is very great a small number penetrate into the subdural space. Those in this space do not come {{under the influence of the}} serum, hence they are not agglutinated and prepared for phagocytosis, whence they multiply and set up a fatal meningitis. The activity of the immune serum administered in this way against virulent pneumococci is so great that a revision of our notions in the limit of powers of the anti-infectious sera seems <b>necessary.</b> It is <b>patent</b> that the problem is not simply a relation between quantity of immune bodies and number of bacteria. It is more complex than that conception indicates. The factor of the leucocytes and the degree of their possible activities under the conditions of the experiment come into play. Hereafter, in defining the mode and power of action of anti-infectious sera the condition of cooperation of the body-forces will have to be more strictly considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{examined the}} printing {{characteristics of the}} association product plate, a continuous tone lithographic process which utilizes a synthetic, light-sensitive coating variably ink-receptive according {{to the degree of}} exposure it receives. The methodology was designed to determine (1) the printing range of the plate, (2) the effective sensitivity of the coating to varying amounts of exposure within this range, and (3) the degree to which adherence to ideal tone reproduction could be achieved through systematic variation of exposure. The plate is not commercially available, therefore it was <b>necessary</b> to consult <b>patent</b> literature and prior research to obtain details of the coating composition and plate manufacture. A number of pre-trial tests were conducted to optimize the manufacturing process and achieve a desirable balance of coating resiliency and printability. After optimizing plate manufacture, equal-interval continuous tone gray scales were printed on a conventional lithographic press to determine the printing characteristics of the plate. The characteristic curves which were generated by plotting printed densities against negative densities revealed low highlight contrast and high midtone and shadow contrast within a relatively narrow log exposure range of. 75 - 1. 10. Faulty tone reproduction can often be corrected by modifying the contrast gradients of the film negative(s) used for plate exposure. In halftone lithography, this procedure selectively alters dot area to achieve desired print reflectance. In the case of continuous tone processes, tone corrected negatives selectively modify the ink receptivity of the plate coating. VIII In order to test the effects of exposure modulation on the tone reproduction characteristics of the plate, an optical matrix was sensitometrically generated from continuous tone panchromatic film. Various film development techniques were used to alter negative contrast and obtain gray scales with diverse equal-interval log E increments within the response range of the plate. The matrix was used for exposing plates of similar manufacture to generate print data for analysis. Printed densities obtained from the matrix were used to construct conventional characteristic curves, as well as response profiles relating printed density differences to log exposure increments. A mathematical model of the Jones tone reproduction diagram was used to calculate tone correction factors in terms of relative log exposure and to reconstruct tone corrected negative scales. Printed densities obtained from the test matrix were used to gauge the effect of the corrected scales on tone reproduction. This method, in essence, emulated the Jones-type approach to tone correction in a single print run, thereby reducing manufacturing and printing variables. The data revealed a high degree of success in correcting mid-tone and shadow reproduction through exposure modification. Although some areas of non-linear plate response were persistent, these were primarily due to shortcomings in the methodology rather than plate failure. Optical tone correction of the low highlight contrast was significantly more problematic. Given the relatively short printing range of the plate, the required negative gradient eliminates many original tonal values. Other means physical and/or chemical are required to lengthen the tonal range and raise highlight contrast in order to improve overall plate performance...|$|R
