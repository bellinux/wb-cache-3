50|$|HACE is {{generally}} preventable by ascending gradually with frequent rest days while climbing or trekking. Not ascending more than 1000 m daily and not sleeping at a greater height than 300 m {{more than the}} previous night is recommended. The risk of developing HACE is diminished if acetazolamide or dexamethasone are administered. Generally, the use of acetazolamide is preferred, but dexamethasone {{can be used for}} prevention if there are side effects or contraindications. Some individuals are more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>HACE</b> than others, and physical fitness is not preventative. Age and sex do not by themselves affect vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>HACE.</b>|$|R
50|$|Common {{symptoms}} of altitude sickness include severe headache, sleep problems, nausea, lack of appetite, lethargy and body ache. Mountain sickness may progress <b>to</b> <b>HACE</b> (High Altitude Cerebral Edema) and HAPE (High Altitude Pulmonary Edema), {{both of which}} can be fatal within 24 hours.|$|R
50|$|Generally, high-altitude {{pulmonary}} edema (HAPE) or AMS precede HACE. In patients with AMS, {{the onset of}} HACE is usually indicated by vomiting, headache that does <b>not</b> respond <b>to</b> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hallucinations, and stupor. In some situations, however, AMS progresses <b>to</b> <b>HACE</b> without these symptoms. HACE must be distinguished from conditions with similar symptoms, including stroke, intoxication, psychosis, diabetic symptoms, meningitis, or ingestion of toxic substances. It {{should be the first}} diagnosis ruled out when sickness occurs while ascending to a high altitude.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} why some are more {{vulnerable}} <b>to</b> <b>HACE</b> than others. One theory is that variations in brain size play a role, but the increase in brain volume from edema does not likely cause cranial vault impingement. The presence of large sulci indicate the condition {{may be influenced by}} the brain tightly fitting. Elevated intracranial pressure is generally accepted to be a late effect of HACE. High central venous pressure may also occur late in the condition's progression.|$|R

50|$|Another {{theory about}} the cause of HACE is that hypoxia may induce nitrous oxide synthase. Vasodilation {{is caused by the}} release of nitric oxide and adenosine. This in turn can {{increase}} vascular permeability and causes edema. This may combine with low levels of cytokines <b>to</b> cause <b>HACE.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cellular hypoxia is {{the common}} final pathway of brain injury that occurs not just after asphyxia, but also when {{cerebral}} perfusion is impaired directly (eg, embolic stroke) or indirectly (eg, raised intracranial pressure after head injury). We Review recent advances {{in the understanding of}} neurological clinical syndromes that occur on exposure to high altitudes, including high altitude headache (HAH), acute mountain sickness (AMS), and high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), and the genetics, molecular mechanisms, and physiology that underpin them. We also present the vasogenic and cytotoxic bases for HACE and explore venous hypertension as a possible contributory factor. Although the factors that control susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>HACE</b> are poorly understood, the effects of exposure to altitude (and thus hypobaric hypoxia) might provide a reproducible model for the study of cerebral cellular hypoxia in healthy individuals. The effects of hypobaric hypoxia might also provide new insights into the understanding of hypoxia in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|Background The goal of {{the study}} was to {{characterize}} high altitude illness in Nepali pilgrims. Methods We kept standardized records at the Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) Temporary Health Camp at Gosainkund Lake (4380 m) in the Nepal Himalaya during the annual Janai Purnima Festival in 2014. Records included rate of ascent and Lake Louise Score (LLS). We defined High Altitude Headache (HAH) as headache alone or LLS= 2. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) was LLS≥ 3. High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) was AMS with ataxia or altered mental status. Results An estimated 10, 000 pilgrims ascended rapidly, most in 1 - 2 days, from Dhunche (1960 m) to Gosainkund Lake (4380 m). We saw 769 patients, of whom 86 had HAH. There were 226 patients with AMS, including 11 patients with HACE. We treated patients with HACE using dexamethasone and supplemental oxygen prior to rapid descent. Each patient with HACE descended carried by a porter. There were no fatalities due <b>to</b> <b>HACE.</b> There were no cases of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). Conclusions HAH and AMS were common in pilgrims ascending rapidly to 4380 m. There were 11 cases of HACE, treated with dexamethasone, supplemental oxygen and descent.

Meteor (March-June 1987) in three hydrographically and ecologically {{different areas of the}} Arabian Sea (Indian Ocean) : an upwelling area at the coast of Oman; an oligotroph area in the central Arabian Sea; and a shelf area off the coast of Pakistan. All three areas were expected <b>to</b> <b>hace</b> similar ichthyoplankton and cephalopod components and similar light conditions. These are important prerequisites for the present comparative study, which is concerned with the importance {{of the structure of the}} water column (physical stability and prey availability), compared with the influence of the light intensity (day/night) on the vertical distribution of species and size classes of fish larvae and cephalopod paralarvae in the subtropical pelagial. First results show that the vertical structure of the water column, especially the occurrence of a pynocline and the varying mixed-layer width, either directly or indirectly had important impact on the vertical distribution patterns of both fish larvae and cephalopod paralarvae. In addition, cephalopods were influenced more consistently by the diurnal change of light intensity than fish larvae. Both taxa occurred mainly below the mixed surface layer. However, cephalopod paralarvae preferred shallower depths than fish larvae in all three areas and were closer related to the pycnocline than fish larvae in most cases. In the absence of a significant pycnocline, larvae appeared close to the surface...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la VI European Conference on Neutron Scaterring, celebrada en Zaragoza (España) del 30 de agosto al 4 de septiembre de 2015. Single-chain polymer nano-particles (SCNP's) {{obtained}} by intramolecular cross-linking of linear macromolecules (precursors) are emerging soft nano-objects showing unique and remarkable physicochemical, rheological, and sensing properties {{as a result}} of their locally collapsed structure and ultrasmall size. In principe, tuning the synthesis procedure, these SCNP's can exhibit tailor-made bio-mimetic properties. For example, through one of the possible routes - 'Michael' addition-mediated self-assembly- SCNPs can offer a controlled delivery of substances like vitamin B 9 or even a combined delivery of dermal protective and anti-cancer bioactive cargos. recently, the topology of these nano-particles in solution (good solvent) has been found to strongly resemble that of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP), currently believed to be a key ingredient in bioogical processes. In both cases, it is clear that the properties/functionally have <b>to</b> be determined <b>not</b> only by the structure but also by the dynamics of solutions of SCNPs obtained through two different synthesis methods, namely the above mentioned 'Michael' route and through cu-complexation. As reference, the precursor (the same for both kinds of SCNPs) in solution has also been characterized. In a first step, the form factor has been characterized by SANS experiments, determining thereby the degree of internal compaction achieved in each case. Then, NSE experiments have allowed us <b>to</b> <b>hace</b> unique insight into the internal modes of the SCNPs, while by means of DLS independent information about the diffusion of their center of mass has been obtained. we compare the outcome of this study with recently published results on the dynamics of the IDP myelin.

40|$|SummaryRac 1 small GTPase {{controls}} essential {{aspects of}} cell biology {{and is a}} direct target of numerous bacterial virulence factors. The CNF 1 toxin of pathogenic Escherichia coli addresses Rac 1 to ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We report the essential role of the tumor suppressor HACE 1, a HECT-domain containing E 3 ubiquitin-ligase, in the targeting of Rac 1 <b>to</b> UPS. <b>HACE</b> 1 binds preferentially GTP-bound Rac 1 and catalyzes its polyubiquitylation. HACE 1 expression increases the ubiquitylation of Rac 1, when the GTPase is activated by point mutations or by the GEF-domain of Dbl. RNAi-mediated depletion of HACE 1 blocks the ubiquitylation of active Rac 1 and increases GTP-bound Rac 1 cellular levels. HACE 1 antagonizes cell isotropic spreading, a hallmark of Rac 1 activation, and is required for endothelial cell monolayer invasion by bacteria. Together, these data establish {{the role of the}} HACE 1 E 3 ubiquitin-ligase in controlling Rac 1 ubiquitylation and activity...|$|R
