We compare and contrast the behavior of MCA with that of the model on simulations and discuss new insights on the properties of both exploratory multivariate methods and their cognate models. One main conclusion is that we could recommend to approximate the multilogit model parameters using MCA. Indeed, estimating the parameters of the model is not a trivial task whereas MCA has the great advantage of being easily solved by singular value decomposition and scalable to large data...|$|R

Two notions of density (<b>natural</b> and <b>exponential</b> density) are defined {{and some of their}} properties are studied. A class of subsets of the free group (graphical sets) is defined restricting the occurrence of adjacent letters in the reduced word for an element, and the relation between graphical sets and the set of primitive elements is studied and used to prove the above result. Primitive elements in free groups are those that can be part of a free basis of the group. There has been a large body of research concerning primitive elements, dating back to the original paper by Whitehead [W]. It is well known, for instance, what a primitive element looks like in the free group of rank 2 (Cohen et. al., [CMZ] and Hoare, [H]). In this paper w...|$|R

The models are based on a new family of priors that are generally usable for all such factorizations.

The weights in the norm of the function space depend on two sequences of real numbers and decay exponentially. As a consequence the functions are infinitely often differentiable, and therefore it is <b>natural</b> to expect <b>exponential</b> convergence of the worst-case error. We give conditions on the weight sequences under which we have exponential convergence for the integration {{as well as the}} approximation problem. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of the errors on the dimension by considering various notions of tractability.
