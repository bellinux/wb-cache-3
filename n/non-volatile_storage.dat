25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive, or hard drive, hard disk, or fixed disk drive, is a <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage</b> device which stores {{digitally}} encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces. The {{hard disk drive}} was invented by Reynold Johnson and commercially introduced in 1956 with the IBM 305 RAMAC computer.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{mode and}} {{hibernation}} can be combined: The contents of RAM are copied to the <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage</b> {{and the computer}} enters sleep mode. This approach combines the benefits of sleep mode and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, and its state, including open and unsaved files, survives a power outage. Hybrid sleep consumes as much power as sleep mode while hibernation powers down the computer.|$|E
25|$|Purely {{electronic}} circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoffâ€“Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or punched paper tape for input and as the main (<b>non-volatile)</b> <b>storage</b> medium.|$|E

25|$|With {{the aid of}} the {{firmware}} and device drivers, the kernel {{provides the}} most basic level of control over all of the computer's hardware devices. It manages memory access for programs in the RAM, it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources, it sets up or resets the CPU's operating states for optimal operation at all times, and it organizes the data for long-term <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage</b> with file systems on such media as disks, tapes, flash memory, etc.|$|E
25|$|The first rotating-drum {{storage device}} {{was used in}} the Birkbeck Automatic Relay Computer {{developed}} by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth in 1948. By 1954, magnetic core memory was rapidly displacing most other forms of temporary storage, including the Williams tube. It went on to dominate the field through the mid-1970s. A key feature of the American UNIVAC I system of 1951 was the implementation of a newly invented type of metal magnetic tape, and a high-speed tape unit, for <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage.</b> Magnetic tape is still used in many computers.|$|E
25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk is a data storage device that uses {{magnetic}} storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage,</b> retaining stored data even when powered off.|$|E

50|$|As the RAM types {{used for}} primary storage are {{volatile}} (uninitialized at start up), a computer containing only such storage {{would not have}} a source to read instructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, <b>non-volatile</b> primary <b>storage</b> containing a small startup program (BIOS) is used to bootstrap the computer, that is, to read a larger program from <b>non-volatile</b> secondary <b>storage</b> to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM, for read-only memory (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of random access).|$|R
40|$|Checkpointing is an {{important}} feature in distributed computing systems. It gives fault tolerance without requiring additional efforts from the programmer[1]. In order to provide fault tolerance for distributed systems, the checkpointing technique has widely been used and many researchers have been performed to reduce the overhead of checkpointing coordination. A checkpoint is {{a snapshot of the}} current state of a process. It saves enough information in <b>non-volatile</b> stable <b>storage</b> such that, if the contents of the volatile storage are lost due to process failure, one can reconstruct the process state from the information saved in the <b>non-volatile</b> stable <b>storage</b> [1]...|$|R
2500|$|Hibernation (or suspend to disk) in {{computing}} is {{powering down}} a computer while retaining its state. Upon hibernation, the computer saves {{the contents of}} its random access memory (RAM) to a hard disk or other <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage.</b> Upon resumption, the computer is exactly {{as it was before}} entering hibernation.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern {{microcontrollers}} have built-in SPI {{logic that}} can interface to an SD card operating in its SPI mode, providing <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage.</b> Even if a microcontroller lacks the SPI feature, the feature can be emulated by bit banging.

5000|$|Most importantly, the {{application}} must store {{as much of}} its state on <b>non-volatile</b> shared <b>storage</b> as possible. Equally important {{is the ability to}} restart on another node at the last state before failure using the saved state from the shared storage.|$|R
50|$|Flash memory: An {{electronic}} <b>non-volatile</b> computer <b>storage</b> {{device that}} can be electrically erased and reprogrammed, and works without any moving parts.

50|$|<b>Non-volatile</b> data <b>storage</b> can be {{categorized}} into electrically addressed systems (read-only memory) and mechanically addressed systems (hard disks, optical disc, magnetic tape, holographic memory, and such).
