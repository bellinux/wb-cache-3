5|$|In 1735, <b>Naples</b> and Sicily were reconquered by King Philip V of Spain, a Bourbon, who {{installed}} {{his younger}} son, Duke Charles of Parma, as King CharlesVII of <b>Naples</b> and Sicily, starting a cadet {{branch of the}} house of Bourbon. In 1799 Napoleon conquered <b>Naples,</b> governed by FerdinandIV of <b>Naples</b> (later FerdinandI of the Two Sicilies) at the time. It was formed into the Parthenopaean Republic with French support. Under British pressure, especially from Lord William Bentinck, who was commander of British troops in Sicily, <b>Naples</b> was then handed back to Ferdinand, being forced to create a constitution for the Kingdom of Sicily. The island was under British occupation from 1806-14.|$|E
5|$|Leone de Casaldi is an exiled {{soldier who}} makes a {{forbidden}} journey to the island of Nisida, outside <b>Naples,</b> Italy, to see Sylvia, with whom he is infatuated. Leone knows she is a noble but little else. While on Nisida, Leone encounters Don Gaspar, Chamberlain to King Fernand of <b>Naples.</b> After hearing Leone's plight, Don Gaspar convinces him to travel to <b>Naples</b> to have his exile lifted. Leone and Sylvia meet in <b>Naples,</b> at which time Leone discovers that she is actually Sylvia de Linares, the King's mistress. She declares her love for Leone but implores him to abandon her and his plans in <b>Naples.</b> When he refuses, the King discovers him and orders Don Gaspar to arrest and imprison him.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1849, in <b>Naples,</b> Italy, {{astronomer}} Annibale de Gasparis (age 29) discovered Hygiea. It was {{the first}} of his nine asteroid discoveries. The director of the <b>Naples</b> observatory, Ernesto Capocci, named the asteroid. He chose to call it Igea Borbonica ("Bourbon Hygieia") in honor of the ruling family of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies where <b>Naples</b> was located.|$|E
5|$|Sicily {{was ruled}} as an {{independent}} kingdom by relatives or cadet branch {{of the house of}} Aragon until 1409 and thence as part of the Crown of Aragon. The Kingdom of <b>Naples</b> was ruled by the Angevin ruler René of Anjou until the two thrones were reunited by AlfonsoV of Aragon, after the successful siege of <b>Naples</b> and the defeat of René on June 6, 1443. Eventually, Alfonso of Aragon divided the two kingdoms during his rule. He gave the rule of <b>Naples</b> to his illegitimate son FerdinandI of <b>Naples,</b> who ruled from 1458 to 1494, {{and the rest of the}} Crown of Aragon and Sicily to Alfonso's brother JohnII of Aragon. From 1494 to 1503 successive kings of France CharlesVIII and LouisXII, who were heirs of Angevins, tried to conquer <b>Naples</b> (see Italian Wars) but failed. Eventually the Kingdom of <b>Naples</b> was reunited with the Crown of Aragon. The titles were held by the Aragonese kings of the Crown of Aragon until the end of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg in 1700.|$|E
5|$|Back in Italy, Alfano stood {{trial at}} Viterbo for the Cuocolo murders. On March 27, 1909, the Assistant Public Prosecutor {{committed}} 47 persons for trial by the Court of Assizes in <b>Naples.</b> However, due to many attempts to corrupt the authorities and other obstacles {{the trial was}} transferred to the Court of Assizes in Viterbo, 250kilometres from <b>Naples</b> and 80kilometres north of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Born in <b>Naples,</b> Italy, {{he came to}} the United States in 1895 {{with his}} parents at the age of nine. His father Francesco Cotillo, had been a caterer in <b>Naples.</b> The family {{originally}} came from Avellino (Montella), in the hinterland of <b>Naples.</b> The family settled in East Harlem in East 113th Street among the increasing numbers of Italian immigrants. His father took up catering again and opened a popular pastry and confectionery shop. He has been credited with introducing the Italian ice cream spumoni into the United States.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz were {{fighting}} against the anti-French forces from the Kingdom of <b>Naples,</b> defeating them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December. Soon afterward, supplies from the captured Gaeta fortress allowed {{the creation of a}} Legion cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski. The Poles then fought at Magliano, Falari, Calvi and Capua before <b>Naples</b> capitulated on 23 January.|$|E
5|$|In December 1818, the Shelleys {{travelled}} {{south with}} Claire Clairmont and their servants to <b>Naples,</b> where they stayed for three months, receiving only one visitor, a physician. In 1820, {{they found themselves}} plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi, former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in <b>Naples</b> shortly after the Foggis had married. The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 in <b>Naples,</b> Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two-month-old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby's mother. Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events: that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child; that the baby was his by Elise, Claire, or an unknown woman; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant, but {{it is unclear how}} much she really knew. The events in <b>Naples,</b> a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils, remain shrouded in mystery. The only certainty is that she herself was not the child’s mother. Elena Adelaide Shelley died in <b>Naples</b> on 9 June 1820.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{proposed}} to renounce the Kingdom of <b>Naples</b> if Clement dethroned Joanna. After the pope refused, Louis departed {{for his second}} Neapolitan campaign in April 1350. He suppressed a mutiny that occurred among his mercenaries while he and his troops {{were waiting for the}} arrival of further troops in Barletta. While marching towards <b>Naples,</b> he faced resistance at many towns because his vanguards, which were under the command of Stephen Lackfi, had become notorious for their cruelty.|$|E
5|$|Matthias's {{third wife}} Beatrice of <b>Naples</b> {{was born in}} 1457. Their {{engagement}} was announced in Breslau on 30 October 1474, during the siege of the town by Casimir IV and Vladislaus Jagiellon. Her dowry amounted to 200,000 gold pieces. Beatrice survived her husband and returned to <b>Naples</b> where she died in 1508.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1458, Alfonso V of Aragon, Skanderbeg's most {{important}} and helpful ally after the stipulation of the Treaty of Gaeta, died. In 1448, as gesture of friendship with Alfonso, Skanderbeg sent a detachment of Albanian troops commanded by General Demetrios Reres to Crotone to quell a rebellion against Alfonso. The next year, many of these men were allowed to settle four villages in Sicily which Alfonso controlled. Upon hearing of his ally's death, Skanderbeg sent emissaries to the new King of <b>Naples,</b> Ferdinand I, to give condolence for his father's death, but also to congratulate him on his accession to the throne of <b>Naples.</b> The succession was not without turbulence, however: René d'Anjou laid claim to the throne since his family had controlled <b>Naples</b> before Aragon had taken control of it, and also because Ferdinand was Alfonso's illegitimate son. The Southern Italian nobility, many of Angevin background, supported René d'Anjou over the Aragonese Ferdinand. Among them was Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini, the Prince of Taranto, and Jacopo Piccinino, a famed condottieri who had been invited by the Angevins. Francisco Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who was wary of a French presence in Italy, sided with Ferdinand and sent his nephew, Alessandro Sforza, to command his army in southern Italy. Pope Calixtus, a Spaniard who wished to see his compatriot in control of <b>Naples,</b> was {{in no position to}} help the weak Ferdinand, so he turned to Skanderbeg for help. However, by that time, Piccinino and his men had conquered all of southern Italy except <b>Naples,</b> Capua, Aversa, Gaeta, Troia, and Barletta, where Ferdinand was besieged.|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of Vitozzi's {{declarations}} and the testimony of Giacomo Ascrittore, a regular police informer {{and member of the}} Camorra, the local police and judiciary of <b>Naples</b> identified Gaetano Amodeo and Tommaso De Angelis as the real killers. However, the murder investigation was transferred to the Carabinieri and delegated to Captain Carlo Fabbroni. Fabbroni accused the <b>Naples</b> police of inefficiency and corruption. The investigation got new momentum when Gennaro Abbatemaggio, a young camorrista and a former Carabinieri informer serving a jail sentence in <b>Naples,</b> testified that the decision to kill Cuocolo, suspected of being a police spy, had been taken at a meeting at the restaurant chaired by Alfano. The developments of the case and suspected police corruption were discussed in parliament several times.|$|E
5|$|Several {{portions}} of current NY21 south of <b>Naples</b> had carried designations prior to 1930. In 1924, the Andover–Hornell segment was designated {{as part of}} NY17; at the same time, the short piece between modern NY415 {{and the center of}} Wayland became part of NY4. By 1926, the portion connecting Wayland to <b>Naples</b> was included in the new NY52. NY4 was renumbered to NY2 in 1927 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US4.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} who {{had turned}} against Pope Urban VI elected a new pope, Clement VII on 20 September 1378, which {{gave rise to the}} Western Schism. Louis acknowledged Urban VI as the legitimate pope and offered him support to fight against his opponents in Italy. As Joanna I of <b>Naples</b> decided to join Clement VII's camp, Pope Urban excommunicated and dethroned her on 17 June 1380. The pope acknowledged Charles of Durazzo, who had lived in Louis's court, as the lawful king of <b>Naples.</b> After Charles of Durazzo promised that he would not claim Hungary against Louis's daughters, Louis dispatched him to invade Southern Italy {{at the head of a}} large army. Within a year, Charles of Durazzo occupied the Kingdom of <b>Naples,</b> and forced Queen Joanna to surrender to him on 26 August 1381.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of April 05 in 1906, {{killed more than}} 100 people and ejected the most lava ever recorded from a Vesuvian eruption. Italian authorities were preparing to hold the 1908 Summer Olympics when Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, devastating the city of <b>Naples</b> and surrounding comunes. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction of <b>Naples,</b> requiring a new location for the Olympics to be found.|$|E
5|$|The royal group {{spent two}} hours at <b>Naples</b> National Archaeological Museum before having an {{audience}} with King Umberto I and Queen Margherita.

5|$|To elevate {{his son to}} Mary's rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip {{the crown}} of <b>Naples</b> {{as well as his}} claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Therefore, Mary became Queen of <b>Naples</b> and titular Queen of Jerusalem upon marriage. Their wedding at Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip could not speak English, and so they spoke in a mixture of Spanish, French, and Latin.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the musical score of L'incoronazione exist, both from the 1650s. The first was rediscovered in Venice in 1888, the second in <b>Naples</b> in 1930. The <b>Naples</b> score {{is linked to the}} revival of the opera in that city in 1651. Both scores contain essentially the same music, though each differs from the printed libretto and has unique additions and omissions. In each score the vocal lines are shown with basso continuo accompaniment; the instrumental sections are written in three parts in the Venice score, four parts in the <b>Naples</b> version, without in either case specifying the instruments. Conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, a leading Monteverdi interpreter, refers to the contemporary practice of leaving much of a score open, to allow for differing local performance conditions. Another convention made it unnecessary to write down detail that performers would take for granted. Neither Venice nor <b>Naples</b> score can be linked to the original performance; although the Venice version is generally regarded as the more authentic, modern productions tend to use material from both.|$|E
5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at <b>Naples</b> as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, <b>Naples,</b> Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission {{of the year was}} a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E

5|$|All royal {{charters}} issued {{during the}} first six months of Mary's reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father's crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. They regarded Charles III of <b>Naples</b> as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of <b>Naples,</b> Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.|$|E

5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria.

5|$|Charles III of <b>Naples</b> {{landed at}} Senj in Dalmatia in September 1385 and marched to Zagreb. Sigismund of Luxembourg came to Buda and persuaded {{the queen mother}} to give her consent to his {{marriage}} to Mary. The marriage took place in Buda in October, but Sigismund was not crowned king and received no governmental function. The queen mother convoked a new Diet and Mary again confirmed the noblemen's liberties, but the queens' rule remained unpopular. Sigismund left Buda and mortgaged the territories west of the River Vág to his Moravian cousins. Charles of <b>Naples</b> had meanwhile left Zagreb, stating {{that he wanted to}} restore peace and public order in Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Early {{into its}} existence, the Italian Football Championship {{was limited to}} just Northern clubs, so Southern clubs competed against sailors or in cups such as Thomas Lipton's Lipton Challenge Cup. In the cup competed between <b>Naples</b> and Palermo FBC, <b>Naples</b> won three finals. The foreign {{contingent}} at the club broke off in 1912 to form Internazionale Napoli, in time for both club's debut in the Italian Championship of 1912–13. Though the sides had a keen rivalry in the Campania section, they were not as successful outside of it {{and a few years}} after World War I, they merged as Foot-Ball Club Internazionale-Naples, also known as FBC Internaples.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte {{advanced}} into Italy, achieving victories {{against the}} Austrian Empire {{at the battle}} of Marengo. After a year of warfare, the French and Austrians signed the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, which divided Northern Italy between the states and awarded the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to the French. Included in this division was the island of Elba in the Ligurian Sea off the Western Italian coast, which at that time was shared between Tuscany and the Kingdom of <b>Naples.</b> On 28 March 1801, the Treaty of Florence was signed between <b>Naples</b> and France, officially turning the entirety of Elba over to French control, although it had not yet been surrendered by its Neapolitan and Tuscan commanders.|$|E
5|$|Louis I of Anjou died on 10 September 1384, {{enabling}} his rival, CharlesIII of <b>Naples,</b> {{to stabilize}} his rule in Southern Italy {{during the next}} months. The consolidation of CharlesIII's position in <b>Naples</b> {{also contributed to the}} formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary. John Horvat, Ban of Macsó (now Mačva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading figures of their movement. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary, but she refused him. He left Hungary in early 1385.|$|E
5|$|Louis was of {{age when}} succeeded {{his father in}} 1342, but his deeply {{religious}} mother exerted a powerful influence on him. He inherited a centralized kingdom and a rich treasury from his father. During {{the first years of}} his reign, Louis launched a crusade against the Lithuanians and restored royal power in Croatia; his troops defeated a Tatar army, expanding his authority towards the Black Sea. When his brother, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, husband of Queen Joanna I of <b>Naples,</b> was assassinated in 1345, Louis accused the queen of his murder and punishing her became the principal goal of his foreign policy. He launched two campaigns to the Kingdom of <b>Naples</b> between 1347 and 1350. His troops occupied large territories on both occasions, and Louis adopted the styles of Neapolitan sovereigns (including the title of King of Sicily and Jerusalem), but the Holy See never recognized his claim. Louis's arbitrary acts and atrocities committed by his mercenaries made his rule unpopular in Southern Italy. He withdrew all his troops from the Kingdom of <b>Naples</b> in 1351.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{was dismayed}} by Spencer's decision, and {{declared}} that he would rather have received no title {{than that of a}} mere barony. He was however cheered by the attention showered on him by the citizens of <b>Naples,</b> the prestige accorded him by the kingdom's elite, and the comforts he received at the Hamiltons' residence. He made frequent visits to attend functions in his honour, or to tour nearby attractions with Emma, with whom he had by now fallen deeply in love, almost constantly at his side. Orders arrived from the Admiralty to blockade the French forces in Alexandria and Malta, a task Nelson delegated to his captains, Samuel Hood and Alexander Ball. Despite enjoying his lifestyle in <b>Naples,</b> Nelson began to think of returning to England, but King Ferdinand of <b>Naples,</b> after a long period of pressure from his wife Maria Carolina of Austria and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian General Mack and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to <b>Naples,</b> with the pursuing French close behind. Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons. The evacuation got under way on 23 December and sailed through heavy gales before reaching the safety of Palermo on 26 December.|$|E
