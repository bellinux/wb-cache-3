25|$|The {{member nations}} agreed that any free-trade zones that in August 1994 {{were already in}} {{operation}} could operate normally under Mercosur, along with any that are set up in light of legal guidelines prevailing or in course in congress during this same time period.

25|$|The system's {{reliability}} is {{assessed in}} a number of objective ways, which includes predictions of current strength and responds to changes in form. The system takes into account home advantage, in that the home nation is treated as though it has an extra three rating points, effectively handicapping them, as they will gain fewer ranking points for a win, and lose more should they lose. In the case of a freak result, there is a maximum number of movements on the ranking that any <b>nation</b> <b>can</b> gain from one match.|$|E
25|$|The act of {{domestic}} violence towards women is a human rights violation {{as well as an}} illegal act under Indian law. It is therefore widely considered a threat to women’s agency through any lens, and there is a growing recognition in many Indian regions that the <b>nation</b> <b>can</b> reach a higher potential through obtaining greater social and economic capital than by reducing women’s participation in society. Domestic violence {{is one of the most}} significant determinants of this denial. Greater gender equality through greater women’s agency cannot be achieved if basic health needs are not being met and if cultural biases that allow for domestic violence in India persist.|$|E
25|$|On September 26, 2008, Congress {{cleared the}} housing bill H.R. 2786. The reauthorization of the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act {{included}} a provision {{stating that the}} Cherokee <b>Nation</b> <b>can</b> receive federal housing benefits {{as long as a}} tribal court order allowing the citizenship for Cherokee Freedmen descendants is intact or some settlement is reached in the citizenship issue and litigation involving the Cherokee Freedmen descendants. The House Of Representatives version of the bill would have denied funds unless the Freedmen descendants were restored to citizenship. The Senate version of the bill had no mention of the Cherokee Nation or the Cherokee Freedmen descendants. Paul Lumley, executive director of the National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC), said that the NAIHC worked with members of the Congressional Black Caucus to create a compromise, resulting in the addition of the Cherokee Freedmen stipulation in the bill.|$|E

500|$|Hirschman {{stressed}} {{the fact that}} underdeveloped economies are called underdeveloped because they face a lack of resources, maybe not natural resources, but resources such as skilled labour and technology. Thus, to hypothesise that an underdeveloped <b>nation</b> <b>can</b> undertake large scale investment in many industries of its economy simultaneously is unrealistic due to the paucity of resources. To quote Hirschman, ...|$|E

500|$|Douglas MacArthur died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on 5 April 1964, of biliary cirrhosis.

[...] On 7 April his body was taken to New York City, where it lay in an open casket at the Seventh Regiment Armory for about 12 hours. That night it was taken on a funeral train to Union Station and transported by a funeral procession to the Capitol, where it lay in state. An estimated 150,000 people filed by the bier.|$|E

500|$|Each nation plays {{each other}} thrice {{on a home}} and away basis, though the amount of games against each side was {{expanded}} from two to three in 2006. [...] A nation receives four points for a win, two for a draw and none for a loss. A <b>nation</b> <b>can</b> obtain a bonus point by either scoring four tries in a match or by losing by seven points or less to the opposition. If nations finish level on points (points for winning, drawing and bonus match points), the first tiebreaker is point differential (the actual in game scoreline, a cumulative scoreline difference). The scoreline difference is [...] worked out by subtracting the amount of points a nation has had scored against them from the total points they have scored in the series. Should teams still be level, {{this is followed by}} number of tries scored by a nation during the series.|$|E
500|$|... "I cannot {{consider}} the Bill of Rights {{to be an}} outworn 18th century 'strait jacket.' ... Its provisions may be thought outdated abstractions by some. And {{it is true that}} they were designed to meet ancient evils. But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few {{at the expense of the}} many. In my judgment the people of no <b>nation</b> <b>can</b> lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced, and respected... I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.|$|E
500|$|During 1936 and 1937, the Air Staff {{had been}} {{fighting}} with the Cabinet over the rearmament plans; the Air Staff wanted a substantial bomber force and only minor increases in fighters, whilst the Minister for Defence Co-ordination, Sir Thomas Inskip, successfully pushed for a greater role for the fighter force. Newall was promoted {{during the middle of}} this debate, and proved perhaps more flexible than might have been expected. In 1938 he supported sharp increases in aircraft production, including double-shift working and duplication of factories, and pushed {{for the creation of a}} dedicated organisation to repair and refit damaged aircraft. He supported expenditure on the new, heavily armed, Hurricane and Spitfire fighters, essential to re-equip Fighter Command. He even began to distance himself, albeit slightly, from orthodox bomber philosophy, noting to the Minister for Air that [...] "no one can say with absolute certainty that a <b>nation</b> <b>can</b> be knocked out from the air, because no-one has yet attempted it". Discussing plans for reacting to a war with Italy, in early 1939, he opposed a French proposal to force Italy's surrender by the use of heavy bombing raids against the north, arguing that it would be unlikely to force the country out of the war without the need for ground combat.|$|E
