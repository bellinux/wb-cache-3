50|$|Another {{problem was}} {{exercise}} hardware {{that was built}} and launched but failed to meet science requirements. (The Resistive Exercise Device RED science requirement {{was to provide a}} load of up to an equivalent of 600 lbs., but the interim RED iRED provides only half of that amount. Ground-based studies have shown that it does produce a positive training effect similar to equivalent free weights when used in a high-intensity program, but it will likely not provide sufficient load in a zero-gravity environment to prevent loss of muscle and bone tissue, as determined from parabolic flight studies.) Other problems were failure {{at one time or another}} of each piece of onboard exercise hardware with reduced utilization at other times, and other limitations imposed because transmission of forces to the space frame have confounded inflight exercise sessions. In fact, during the first eleven ISS Expeditions, only for 2 short periods during Expeditions 3 and 4 were all three U.S. onboard exercise devices (Cycle Egometer with Vibration Isolation System CEVIS, Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System TVIS, and iRED) capable of being used under <b>nominal</b> <b>conditions</b> (Figure 6-10).

40|$|A {{computational}} procedure able {{to describe}} the coupled hot-gas/wall/coolant environment that occurs in most liquid rocket engines is presented and demonstrated. The coupled analysis is performed by loose coupling of the two-dimensional axisymmetric Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the hot-gas flow and the conjugate three-dimensional model for the coolant flow and solid material heat transfer in the regenerative cooling circuit. The latter model is in turn based on the coupled Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the coolant flow and Fourier equation for the thermal conduction in the solid material. In this study, the thermal behavior of a regeneratively cooled oxygen/methane engine demonstrator is analyzed in detail. Starting from a <b>nominal</b> operative <b>condition</b> of the engine, different levels of channel surface roughness and coolant mass flow rate are considered {{in order to understand}} their influence on the heat transfer capability of the cooling system.
