Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut {{with the other hand}} helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest.

40|$|BACKGROUND: At present, {{some authors}} prefer cutting forceps to {{conventional}} <b>non-cutting</b> forceps in Endoscopic Sinus Surgery, {{based on the}} assumption of superior wound healing due to mucosal preservation, without any proof of better clinical outcome. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elaborate our previously reported short-term results, by evaluating the long-term outcome. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients, who underwent a bilateral Endoscopic Sinus Surgery procedure, received follow-up in a prospective, double-blinded way. Cutting forceps had been randomly used on one side and <b>non-cutting</b> forceps on the other side. Lateralised symptoms (headache, maxillary pressure, nasal obstruction and secretions) and endoscopic findings (secretion, pus, blood, crusts, oedema, polyps and adhesions) were evaluated on both sides 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: Both types of instruments gave satisfactory healing situations. Similar to the short-term follow-up results, no significant difference in the global symptom and endoscopic score between the 2 types of instruments was found. The analysis of individual symptoms and endoscopic parameters also showed no difference. CONCLUSION: Cutting forceps do not result in a better subjective or endoscopic healing evaluation after one year, compared to <b>non-cutting</b> forceps. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{years of}} Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery have {{brought about a}} large amount of {{innovations}} and a variety of instruments, all claiming to result in better endoscopic procedures and/or better postoperative outcome. An example of such an innovation is the cutting forceps, which has been claimed to result in better wound healing. However, like several other instruments, it has never been proven to be superior to conventional <b>non-cutting</b> forceps techniques. A prospective, randomised double-blind study in 100 consecutive patients, undergoing bilateral FESS, compared the short term clinical outcome of surgery using cutting instruments to that of <b>non-cutting</b> instruments. Symptoms and endoscopic findings were evaluated at four time points during the first three postoperative weeks. Both types of surgery resulted in reduction of symptoms and in endoscopically visible healing over time, but {{no significant difference between the}} two methods was found, neither in symptom relief, nor in endoscopic impression of improvement. In conclusion, endoscopic sinus surgery with cutting instruments can be considered effective in resolving sinus disease. However, these instruments do not generate a better healing process than <b>non-cutting</b> instruments in the first weeks postoperatively. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of energy consumed by machine tools is attributable to <b>non-cutting</b> operations, including tool path, tool change, and change of spindle rotation speed. The <b>non-cutting</b> energy consumption of the machine tool (NCE) {{is affected by the}} processing sequence of the features of a specific part (PFS), because the plans of <b>non-cutting</b> operations will vary based on the different PFS. This article aims to understand the NCE between processing a specific feature and its pre- or post- feature, especially the energy consumed during the speed change of the spindle rotation. Based on the developed model, a single objective optimisation problem is introduced that minimises the NCE. Then, Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is employed to search for the optimal PFS. A case study is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Two parts with 12 and 15 features are processed on a machining centre. The simulation experiment results show that the optimal or near-optimal PFS can be found. Consequently, 8. 70 % and 30. 42 % reductions in NCE are achieved for part A and part B, respectively. Further, the performance of ACO for our specific optimisation problem is discussed and validated based on comparisons with other algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Machining {{processes}} {{are responsible for}} substantial environmental impacts due to their great energy consumption. Accurately characterizing the energy consumption of machining processes is a starting point to increase manufacturing energy efficiency and reduce their associated environmental impacts. The energy calculation of machining processes depends {{on the availability of}} energy supply data of machine tools. However, the energy supply can vary greatly among different types of machine tools so {{that it is difficult to}} obtain the energy data theoretically. The aim of this research was to investigate the energy characteristics and obtain the power models of computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools through an experimental study. Four CNC lathes, two CNC milling machines and one machining center were selected for experiments. Power consumption of <b>non-cutting</b> motions and material removal was measured and compared for the selected machine tools. Here, <b>non-cutting</b> motions include standby, cutting fluid spraying, spindle rotation and feeding operations of machine tools. Material removal includes turning and milling. Results show that the power consumption of <b>non-cutting</b> motions and milling is dependent on machine tools while the power consumption of turning is almost independent from the machine tools. The results imply that the energy saving potential of machining processes is tremendous...|$|R

50|$|A general {{solution}} {{is to use a}} window function on the sinc filter, which cuts off or reduces the negative lobes: these respectively eliminate and reduce overshoot and ringing. Note that truncating some but not all of the lobes eliminates the ringing beyond that point, but does not reduce the amplitude of the ringing that is not truncated (because this is determined {{by the size of the}} lobe), and increases the magnitude of the overshoot if the last <b>non-cut</b> lobe is negative, since the magnitude of the overshoot is the integral of the tail, which is no longer canceled by positive lobes.|$|E

ESSO-themed packaging was a main {{theme of the}} mid-1950s models and the boxes portrayed the name in 'portrait' style with box standing on end. Morestone's ESSO packaging is reminiscent of other companies that attempted to claim a market niche with unique box styles. Whereas Matchbox had 'Match'-boxes, Aurora had 'Cigar'-boxes, Charbens had little suitcases and Benbros had boxes that looked like TV sets, Morestone's ESSO line packaged vehicles in little boxes that looked like gas pumps (Rixon 2005, p. 39). One side of the box looked like (with end flap open) {{the face of an}} 'ESSO-Extra' petrol pump with a gallons gauge, while opposite sides illustrated the toy. The box front states [...] "ESSO Petrol Pump Series manufactured and produced by Morris & Stone (London) Ltd. by permission of the owners of the ESSO trademark" [...] (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Stores were supplied with colorful ESSO display stands which held the 20 Morestone vehicles in the series. Buyers could get a free 'garage' by sending in coupons off of the boxes (which most certainly hinders the search for <b>non-cut,</b> perfectly boxed models).|$|E
