40|$|We devise and {{implement}} quasi-Monte Carlo methods for computing {{the expectations of}} nonlinear functionals of solutions of a class of elliptic partial differential equations with random coefficients. Our motivation comes from fluid flow in random porous media, where relevant functionals include the fluid pressure/velocity {{at any point in}} space or the breakthrough time of a pollution plume being transported by the velocity field. Our emphasis is on situations where {{a very large number of}} random variables is needed to model the coefficient field. As an alternative to classical Monte Carlo, we here employ quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which use deterministically chosen sample points in an appropriate (usually high-dimensional) parameter space. Each realization of the PDE solution requires a finite element (FE) approximation in space, and this is done using a realization of the coefficient field restricted to a suitable regular spatial grid (not necessarily the same as the FE grid). In the statistically homogeneous case the corresponding covariance matrix can be diagonalized and the required coefficient realizations can be computed efficiently using FFT. In this way we avoid the use of a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion, but introduce high <b>nominal</b> <b>dimension</b> in parameter space. Numerical experiments with 2 -dimensional rough random fields, high variance and small length scale are reported, showing that the quasi-Monte Carlo method consistently outperforms the Monte Carlo method, with a smaller error and a noticeably better than O(N- 1 / 2) convergence rate, where N is the number of samples. Moreover, the rate of convergence of the quasi-Monte Carlo method does not appear to degrade as the <b>nominal</b> <b>dimension</b> increases.

This study reports {{on the effectiveness of}} the testing methods based on the natural frequencies of vibration versus static bending to obtain the elastic properties of reforested structural wood components usually employed in civil construction. The following components were evaluated: 24 beams of Eucalyptus sp. with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (40 x 60 x 2. 000 mm) and 14 beams of Pinus oocarpa with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (45 x 90 x 2. 300 mm) both without treatment; 30 boards with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (40 x 240 x 2. 010 mm) and 30 boards with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (40 x 240 x 3. 050 mm), both of Pinus oocarpa and with chromate copper arsenate (CCA) preservative treatment. The results obtained in thiswork show good correlation when compared to the results obtained by the static bending mechanical method, especially when applying the natural frequency of longitudinal vibration. The use of longitudinal frequency was reliable and practical, therefore recommended for determining the modulus of elasticity of wood structural elements. It was also found that no specific support is needed for the specimens using the longitudinal frequency, as well as no previous calibrations, reducing the execution time and enabling to test many samples...|$|R

The quantity of injected parts in unit time is directly proportional with the injection cycle time.

Filling time depends by the rheological properties of thermoplastics, and the openingejection-closing time depends by mechanical characteristics of the injection molding machine.
