5|$|The episode opens as sisters Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Amy (Emma Bell) are {{fishing for}} the {{survivors}} {{in a nearby}} quarry lake, discussing their childhood and hopes that Florida, where their parents live, was <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> as hard by the zombie epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The {{sisters were}} attacked, but <b>not</b> <b>hit,</b> during the American aerial attack on Kure in July 1945. However, the shockwaves from near misses caused {{extensive}} flooding in both ships. Iwate sank {{in shallow water}} on 25 July and Izumo capsized three days later. Both ships {{were removed from the}} navy list on 20 November and their wrecks were raised and scrapped in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|Cressy {{attempted}} to ram the submarine, but did <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> anything and resumed her rescue efforts until she too was torpedoed at 07:20. She too {{took on a}} heavy list and then capsized before sinking at 07:55. Several Dutch ships began rescuing survivors at 08:30 and were joined by British fishing trawlers before Tyrwhitt and his ships arrived at 10:45. The combined total from all three ships was 837 men rescued and 62 officers and 1,397 enlisted men lost. Of these, Hogue lost a total of 48 men.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May-1 June 1916, the 1st LCS was {{assigned}} to screen Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers and were the first British ships to spot and engage the ships of the German High Seas Fleet {{on the afternoon of}} 31 May. Cordelia fired four rounds from her main armament at the light cruiser , but they fell short of the target. The ship was not heavily engaged during the battle and only fired a total of a dozen rounds from her 6-inch (152-mm) guns and three from her 4-inch (102-mm) guns. So far as is known, she did <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> anything, nor was she damaged herself. By October 1917, she had been transferred to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1940, Kommandøren steamed in the Sognefjord, {{carrying}} regular passengers, {{as well as}} a load {{of around}} 100 soldiers bound for Gudvangen and Voss for service with the Norwegian Army's 4th Division. The soldiers brought in that day belonged to an older age group not called up in the initial mobilization drive. While en route from Vik to Balestrand, the steamer was bombed and strafed by a German bomber. The bombs did <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> the ship, and the machine gun bullets only did minor damage and caused no casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June, St. Laurent {{was ordered}} to Le Havre, France to {{evacuate}} British troops, but none were to be found and the ship evacuated {{a small group of}} French soldiers further up the coast on 11 June. The ship was taken under fire by a German artillery battery near Saint-Valery-en-Caux, but she was <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> and Lieutenant Commander H.G. DeWolf, the ship's captain, ordered her to return fire although no results were noted. After returning to England, St. Laurent escorted several troop convoys on the last legs of their journeys from Canada, Australia and New Zealand in mid-June and was assigned to escort duties with Western Approaches Command afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Shikishima was <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> {{during the}} Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, {{although}} a shell exploded prematurely {{in one of}} her 12-inch guns, disabling it. During the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, she was hit nine times; the most serious of which penetrated beneath a six-inch gun, killing or wounding the entire gun crew. Again the ship had another 12-inch shell prematurely detonate in one of the forward guns, wrecking it completely. Shikishima was reclassified as a first-class coast defence ship in September 1921, and was used for training duties in various capacities until disarmed and reclassified as a transport in 1923. Her hulk continued {{to be used as a}} training ship until she was scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making {{their way down the}} hill to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but <b>not</b> <b>hit.</b> American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered the bodies of the American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
50|$|While {{most of the}} {{international}} singles {{are the same as}} those that were released in the US, there are some singles that were international <b>hits</b> that were <b>not</b> <b>hits</b> in the US, such as “Party” and “Wooden Heart”.|$|R

5|$|The {{two ships}} entered service in 1916, and were based in Taranto {{with the rest}} of the main fleet for the {{duration}} of World War I. Both ships were involved in the Corfu incident in 1923. The ships' modernization work was completed after Italy entered World War II. Caio Duilio was damaged at the Battle of Taranto, while Andrea Doria was <b>not</b> <b>hit.</b> Both ships were present at the First Battle of Sirte, though only Andrea Doria engaged British forces. The two ships survived the war, and were the only battleships the Allies permitted Italy to retain after the conclusion of hostilities. They served in the Italian Navy for another decade until they were discarded in the mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|Though it did <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> Puerto Rico, Hurricane David passed {{less than}} 100 miles (160 km) {{south of the}} island, {{bringing}} strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. Portions of southwestern Puerto Rico experienced sustained winds of up to 85 mph (135 km/h), {{while the rest of}} the island received tropical storm-force winds. While passing by the island, the hurricane caused strong seas and torrential rainfall, amounting to 19.9 inches (505 mm) in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico and up to 20 inches (510 mm) in the central mountainous region.|$|E
5|$|While near peak intensity, Hurricane Linda passed near Socorro Island, {{where it}} damaged {{meteorological}} instruments. The hurricane produced high waves along the southwestern Mexican coastline, forcing {{the closure of}} five ports. If Linda had made landfall on southern California as predicted, {{it would have been}} the strongest storm to do so since a storm in 1939. Though it did <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> the state, the hurricane produced light to moderate rainfall across the region, causing mudslides and flooding in the San Gorgonio Wilderness; two houses were destroyed and 77others were damaged, and damage totaled $3.2million (1997USD, $4.3million 2008USD). Despite the intensity, the name was not retired.|$|E

5000|$|September 22, 1926: Tommy Thevenow hit {{the second}} and last home run of the season, and of his career. Thevenow would play for another 12 seasons and set a major league record by <b>not</b> <b>hitting</b> a home run in 3,347 at-bats.|$|R
5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if {{the ball}} did <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), {{even if the}} ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
5|$|A {{pitch that}} is <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> {{into the field}} of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|As the VPAF {{pilots were}} {{completing}} the final phases of their conversion training, the VPAF Command chose to attack Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. On {{the afternoon of}} April 27, the pilots were flown out to Phù Cát Air Base in Bình Định Province where Major-General Le Van Tri, commander of the VPAF, briefed them on the upcoming operation. Tri also instructed the pilots {{to ensure that their}} bombs should <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> civilian areas in Saigon. From the original group of trainees, Luc, De, Quang, Vuong, Trung and On were selected {{to take part in the}} attack. Meanwhile, On and Xanh were also instructed to test-fly five captured A-37 bombers, which would be the mainstay of the Quyet Thang Squadron. On the morning of April 28, the Quyet Thang Squadron became operational with Luc as the squadron's commander, when it was transferred to Phan Rang Air Base.|$|E

5000|$|On February 3, 2015, Belt and the Giants avoided {{arbitration}} {{by agreeing}} to a one-year, $3.6 million contract. [...] On May 17th, Belt accomplished a rare feat when he collected 3 hits, including a home run, for 3 {{games in a row}} against the Cincinnati Reds. He was only the second Giants player to do so since 1900. Barry Bonds had a similar three-game streak in 2000. Belt recorded another unusual statistic since he hit the home runs on 3 consecutive days after <b>not</b> <b>hitting</b> any in his first 30 games. The last player to have done so was also Belt in the 2012 season when he hit home runs in 3 consecutive games after <b>not</b> <b>hitting</b> any in his first 48 games that season.|$|R
25|$|One day, he {{corrected}} a college mate for <b>not</b> <b>hitting</b> right notes while singing a song. The boy took offense and rudely questioned his musical credentials.

5|$|Levels {{include a}} variety of {{anthropomorphic}} vegetable enemies, such as potatoes and squash, each with different movement patterns and attacks. Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to throw at enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> an enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items {{in the form of}} sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final boss of the game.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} lest {{he and his}} men should be engaged when they reached the Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by the Canadians on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the Australians, the Canadian fire did <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> them. This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the Canadians and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E
5|$|Temple Owls' {{season ended}} on March 19 with a 71–64 loss to second-seeded San Diego State in double overtime. The Aztecs took an 11-point {{lead in the}} first half, but Temple Owls recovered. Off a turnover, Lavoy Allen made a seven-footer {{to tie the game}} at 54 with 51 seconds left in the second half. Chase Tapley of San Diego State missed a {{baseline}} shot at the end of regulation, and the game went into overtime. At the beginning of the first overtime period, Juan Fernandez hit a three-pointer to give the Owls a 57–54 lead. Malcolm Thomas responded with a three-point play to tie the game at 61. Thomas could <b>not</b> <b>hit</b> a shot and the game went into a second overtime. With SDSU maintaining a 69–64 lead, Aztec star Kawhi Leonard stole the ball from Khalif Wyatt and his uncontested dunk assured his team's victory. Ramone Moore had 17 points, and Allen had 12 points and 11 rebounds in his final game as a Temple Owl.|$|E
