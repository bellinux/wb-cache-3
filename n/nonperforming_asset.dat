If NPA's are not properly managed, it can cause financial and economic degradation which in turn signals an adverse investment climate. This study highlight on management of nonperforming assets in the perspective/viewpoint of the Indian public sector banks under stringent asset classification norms, use of latest technological platform based on Core Banking Solution (CBS), recovery procedures and other bank specific indicators in the perspective of stringent regulatory framework of the Reserve Bank of India.

40|$|Total {{business}} loans under $ {{1 million}} held by small U. S. banks continue to dwindle. Disproportionate negative growth at financially weak small banks {{has been an}} important factor in this decline. Loan volumes at strong small banks actually grew in 2011. The finding supports the view that supply conditions, not just tepid demand for credit, have affected bank lending to small businesses. Total business loans under $ 1 million held by small U.

A previous Economic Letter (Laderman and Gillan 2011) presented data suggesting that trends in aggregate <b>nonperforming</b> <b>asset</b> ratios for business loans under $ 1 million held by small banks may be related to trends in the growth of those loans. This Letter shows the relationship between growth in business loans of this size and the lender’s overall financial condition. Financially weak small banks, though they are in the minority, have accounted for most of this loan shrinkage. In fact, business loans under $ 1 million at strong small banks actually grew in 2011.

40|$|East Asian {{countries}} were {{hit hard by}} the financial crisis in 1997 and have shown significant and remarkable recovery with far-reaching economic and regulatory reforms since then. A decade later, the Asian countries are suffering again from the on-going global economic crises beginning {{in the summer of}} 2007. If this current crisis is not managed effectively, the Asian economic situation could escalate into a more serious crisis mode than that of 1997 - 8. Due to the increased globalization of financial markets, crises tend to become more severe and contagious even if the effected countries have strong macroeconomic fundamentals. This paper focuses on the Korean economy, which experienced the hardest crisis hit as well as most successful recovery from the 1997 crisis, and discusses interrelated and general policy lessons from the 1997 and 2008 crises to help prevent from the reoccurrence of similar financial crises and economic downturns in the future. Specific lessons, among many, to be analyzed in this paper are drawn on 1) monitoring international capital flows and conducting better international debt management, 2) maintaining a competitive, efficient and well-regulated financial system to be protected from international contagion, 3) establishing an effective <b>nonperforming</b> <b>asset</b> management mechanism, such as the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO) of Korea, and 4) enhancing regional financial cooperation among the East Asian countries, like a renewed Chiang Mai Initiative, to provide a short-term liquidity support, defend Asian currencies from speculative attack, and assist long-term economic growth in the East Asian region. In deriving the main policy lessons, both the commonalities and uniqueness of the two crises-old in 1997 and new in 2008 -are examined {{from the perspective of the}} Korean economy. ...|$|E

In this paper, we approximate these measures by using global liquidity data for 391 hand-selected, LIBOR-based, Basel II compliant banks in 36 countries for the period 2002 to 2012. In particular, we compare the risk sensitivity of the aforementioned Basel III liquidity risk measures to those of traditional measures such as the <b>nonperforming</b> <b>assets</b> ratio, return-on-assets, LIBOR-OISS, Basel II Tier 1 capital ratio, government securities ratio, and brokered deposits ratio. Furthermore, we use a discrete-time hazard model to study bank failure.

An important result is that a higher liquidity coverage ratio {{is associated with a}} higher bank failure rate. We also find that market-wide liquidity risk (proxied by LIBOR-OISS) was the major predictor of bank failures in 2009 and 2010 while idiosyncratic liquidity risk (proxied by other liquidity risk measures) was less.

The success of rural credit in India is largely depends on their financial strength. RRBs are key financing institution at the rural level which shoulders responsibility of meeting credit needs of different types of agriculture credit in rural areas. At present, most of the regional rural banks are facing the problems of overdue, recovery, <b>nonperforming</b> <b>assets</b> and other problems. The first recommendation for the establishment of regional rural banks was made by Banking Commission in 1972. As the result of this recommendation a working group headed by Mr. M. Narsimham Rao, RRB’s came into existence in 26 th September, 1975 and RRB Act, 1976 with an objective to ensure sufficient institutional credit for agriculture and other rural sectors. RRBs were established to mobilize rural areas small saving and provide other banking facilities to the small and backward areas. RRB’s are usually sponsored by public sector banks thus they keep their deposit with these bank & are also dependent for their loan operations & finance on sponsor bank and NABARD. The main objective of RRB’s is also to promote saving investment hands which helps to collect adequate deposits that enable them to work at low cost as compared to commercial banks...|$|R
