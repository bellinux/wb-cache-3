2500|$|The 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36hp 1200cc four {{cylinder}} air-cooled flat-four opposed OHV engine made {{of aluminum}} alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 {{came with a}} 1300 engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500 engine, and 1600 in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favor in the USA market {{with the advent of}} <b>non-leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW Production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the USA West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularized on the USA West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} the present study are {{compared}} to others in Table  1. According to the results, mean mercury, cadmium and lead concentrations in the soft tissues of S. cucullata found during this study fell within the range of concentrations reported in previous studies. Also, we compared our data with an earlier study conducted by de Mora et al. (2004) in the same study area for S. cucullata to find inter annual variability in metal concentrations. No significant changes in metal concentrations were observed between both the study areas, except lead (Table  1). A decrease in lead content between years in the same study area can possibly be explained by the increase in use of <b>non-leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and fishing equipment in these regions. Although mercury and lead concentrations do not seem to be problematic in terms of human consumption, caution should be taken in regard to their consumption because despite being low, cadmium concentrations in their soft tissue are considerable.|$|E
