25|$|Levels of mRNA can be quantitatively {{measured}} by <b>northern</b> <b>blotting,</b> which provides size and sequence {{information about the}} mRNA molecules. A sample of RNA is separated on an agarose gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an autoradiograph. Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and biotin chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting</b> are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in {{an image of a}} gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the Northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.|$|E
25|$|In biology {{methylene}} blue {{is used as}} a dye for a number of different staining procedures, such as Wright's stain and Jenner's stain. Since it is a temporary staining technique, {{methylene blue}} {{can also be used to}} examine RNA or DNA under the microscope or in a gel: as an example, a solution of methylene blue can be used to stain RNA on hybridization membranes in <b>northern</b> <b>blotting</b> to verify the amount of nucleic acid present. While methylene blue is not as sensitive as ethidium bromide, it is less toxic and it does not intercalate in nucleic acid chains, thus avoiding interference with nucleic acid retention on hybridization membranes or with the hybridization process itself.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{individual}} transcripts were being performed several decades before any transcriptomics approaches were available. Libraries of silkmoth mRNAs were collected and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for storage using reverse transcriptase {{in the late}} 1970s. In the 1980s, low-throughput Sanger sequencing began {{to be used to}} sequence random individual transcripts from these libraries, called Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). ESTs came to prominence during the 1990s as an efficient method to determine the gene content of an organism without sequencing the entire genome. Quantification {{of individual}} transcripts by <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting,</b> nylon membrane arrays, and later Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were also popular, but these methods are laborious and can only capture a tiny subsection of a transcriptome. Consequently, the manner in which a transcriptome as a whole is expressed and regulated remained unknown until higher-throughput techniques were developed.|$|E
50|$|Reverse <b>Northern</b> <b>blot,</b> {{much like}} the <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> upon which it is based, is used to {{determine}} levels of gene expression in particular tissues. In comparison to the <b>Northern</b> <b>blot,</b> the reverse <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> is able to probe {{a large number of}} transcripts at once with less specificity with regard to probes than is required for <b>Northern</b> <b>blot.</b> Often this will involve the use of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries or differential display to isolate differentially expressed transcripts and create bacterial clones containing inserts for these sequences. These will serve as the targets hybridized to the membrane and will be probed by sample RNA. Expression levels can be quantified by increase or decrease in fluorescent or radioactive signal over a control treatment. Bands or dots which appear darker and larger signify transcripts which are over-expressed in a sample of interest and lighter dots indicate that a transcript is down-regulated versus a control sample.|$|R

5000|$|With <b>northern</b> <b>blotting</b> it is {{possible}} to observe cellular control over structure and function by determining the particular gene expression rates during differentiation and morphogenesis, as well as in abnormal or diseased conditions. [...] <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting</b> involves the use of electrophoresis to separate RNA samples by size, and detection with a hybridization probe complementary to part of or the entire target sequence. The term 'northern blot' actually refers specifically to the capillary transfer of RNA from the electrophoresis gel to the blotting membrane. However, the entire process is commonly referred to as <b>northern</b> <b>blotting.</b> [...] The northern blot technique was developed in 1977 by James Alwine, David Kemp, and George Stark at Stanford University. [...] <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting</b> takes its name from its similarity to the first blotting technique, the Southern blot, named for biologist Edwin Southern. [...] The major difference is that RNA, rather than DNA, is analyzed in the northern blot.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: High {{levels of}} mRNA (as {{assessed}} by <b>northern</b> <b>blot)</b> for the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p 140 (TRK)) are predictive of favourable outcome in neuroblastoma. The feasibility of determining p 140 (trk) on frozen sections using a recently developed monoclonal antibody was evaluated, and immunohistochemical findings {{were compared to}} those obtained from <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. Primary tumour samples from 28 untreated patients were quick frozen and an indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed on 4 -mu m acetone-fixed cryostat sections. 9 cases were positive with immunohistochemistry, and these were among the 15 cases also positive by <b>northern</b> <b>blot.</b> None of the cases negative by <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> were positive with immunohistochemistry. The concordance rate was 79 % (P < 0. 03), with a sensitivity of 60 % and a specificity of 100 %. Immunohistochemistry can thus be rather reliable for assessing p 140 (trk) expression, even when only very small amounts of tissue are available, such as with needle biopsy...|$|R
40|$|The use of cell {{cultures}} {{as a model}} system for studying thyroid diseases requires establishment of appropriate culture conditions that allow in vitro propagation of populations that correspond to in vivo ones. We have defined these conditions and verified functional parameters such as thyrotropin-dependent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and thymidine incorporation, and molecular markers such as thyroglobulin (by radioimmunoassay [RIA] and <b>Northern</b> <b>blot),</b> thyroperoxidase (by <b>Northern</b> <b>blot),</b> thyroid-specific transcription factor 1 (by immunohistochemistry and <b>Northern</b> <b>blot)</b> and PAX- 8 (by <b>Northern</b> <b>blot).</b> The "in vitro profile" (functional parameters and molecular markers) was found to correlate with the degree of differentiation of the starting specimens and the pathological diagnosis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} create a {{reference}} data collection of <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> results and demonstrate how such a collection can enable a quantitative comparison of modern expression profiling techniques, a central component of functional genomics studies. Historically, <b>Northern</b> <b>blots</b> were the de facto standard for determining RNA transcript levels. However, driven by the demand for analysis of large sets of genes in parallel, high-throughput methods, such as microarrays, dominate modern profiling efforts. To facilitate assessment of these methods, in comparison to <b>Northern</b> <b>blots,</b> we created a database of published Northern results obtained with a standardized commercial multiple tissue blot (dbMTN). In order {{to demonstrate the utility}} of the dbMTN collection for technology comparison, we also generated expression profiles for genes across a set of human tissues, using multiple profiling techniques. No method produced profiles that were strongly correlated with the <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> data. The highest correlations to the <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> data were determined with microarrays for the subset of genes observed to be specifically expressed in a single tissue in the Northern analyses. The database and expression profiling data are available via the project website ([URL] We believe that emphasis on multitechnique validation of expression profiles is justified, as the correlation results between platforms are not encouraging on the whole.

40|$|Abstract: In neuroblastoma, {{high levels}} of mRNA for p 140 (trkA) and p 75 (LNGFR) {{neurotrophin}} receptors are predictive of favorable outcome. Their evaluation by <b>Northern</b> <b>blot,</b> however, requires substantial amounts of tissue and this prevents their routine evaluation {{as well as the}} possibility for multicenter studies to be easily carried out. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, the feasibility and reliability of determining both neurotrophin receptors on cryostat sections by immunohistochemistry were assessed, and these findings were compared to those obtained from <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. Primary tumor samples from 28 untreated patients at all stages were evaluated by using H 10 anti-p 140 (trkA) and ME 20. 4 anti-p 75 (LNGFR) mAbs. Although weak, positive immunostaining was found in 9 of 28 tumors for p 140 (trkA) and in 5 of 28 tumors for p 75 (LNGFR). AS compared to <b>Northern</b> <b>blot,</b> the concordance rate was 79 % (22 of 28 cases) for p 140 (trkA) (p < 0. 05) and 71 % (20 of 23 cases) for p 75 (LNGFR) (p < 0. 05). No case negative for <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> was found to be positive with immunohistochemistry. Since only high mRNA levels for both receptors {{have been shown to be}} clinically relevant: their immunohistochemical detection, although less sensitive than <b>Northern</b> <b>blot,</b> can be just as sufficient and reliable as a prognostic tool, and possibly with a better cost-benefit ratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> {{analysis}} is effective for quantifying gene expression, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) {{is much more}} sensitive. Obtaining quantitative RT-PCR results, however, can be challenging. Relative RT-PCR uses standard PCR techniques but permits the comparison of transcript quantities between samples by coamplifying the gene of interest with a housekeeping gene that acts as an internal control. To analyze {{the expression of a}} plant gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein, such as β- 1, 3 -glucanase, a translation elongation factor 1 α (EF- 1 α) gene was selected as an internal control. <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis demonstrated constitutive expression of the plant EF- 1 α gene following infection of Nicotiana benthamiana by Colletotrichum destructivum. Primers for the gene of interest and internal control were compatible, and 35 cycles of amplification gave reproducible relative RT-PCR results for β- 1, 3 -glucanase gene expression. A high correlation was observed between the relative quantification of β- 1, 3 -glucanase gene expression as determined by <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> and relative RT-PCR analyses, demonstrating the validity of relative RT-PCR with a plant EF- 1 α gene as a control.
