By reversing the spin states of the He- 3 nuclei the polarization of a neutron beam can be efficiently reversed allowing for the transmission of a neutron beam polarized in either spin state. Using an amplitude modulated frequency sweep lasting 500 ms we can spin flip a polarized He- 3 <b>neutron</b> spin <b>filter</b> with only 1. 8 x 10 (- 5) loss in He- 3 polarization.

40|$|The neutronic {{efficiency}} of target/filters for accelerator-based BNCT applications {{is measured by}} the proton current required to achieve a desirable neutron current at the treatment port (10 {sup 9 } n/cm{sup 2 }/s). In this paper the authors describe two possible targeyt/filter concepts wihch minimize the required current. Both concepts are based on the Li- 7 (p,n) Be- 7 reaction. Targets that operate near the threshold energy generate neutrons that are close tothe desired energy for BNCT treatment. Thus, the filter can be extremely thin ({approximately} 5 cm iron). However, this approach has an extremely low neutron yield (n/p {approximately} 1. 0 ({minus} 6)), thus requiring a high proton current. The proposed solutino is to design a target consisting of multiple extremely thin targets (proton energy loss per target {approximately} 10 keV), and re-accelerate the protons between each target. Targets operating at ihgher proton energies ({approximately} 2. 5 MeV) have a much higher yield (n/p {approximately} 1. 0 ({minus} 4)). However, at these energies the maximum neutron energy is approximately 800 keV, and thus a <b>neutron</b> <b>filter</b> is required to degrade the average neutron energy to the range of interest for BNCT (10 [...] 20 keV). A <b>neutron</b> <b>filter</b> consisting of fluorine compounds and iron has been investigated for this case.

The measurements were done using a pulsed neutron source driven by an electron LINAC. The neutron beam passed through a 30 -cm-thick iron filter, which results in neutron transmission only in energies where resonance scattering and potential interference exist. The <b>neutron</b> <b>filter</b> removes most of the neutrons at other energies and significantly attenuates the gamma background resulting in 20 energy windows and a high signal-to-background ratio.

30|$|The Dalat {{research}} reactor was originally a TRIGA MARK II reactor with a nominal power of 250  kW completed construction {{and reached the}} critical state in 1963. The reactor then has been upgraded to the nominal power of 500  kW since 1984. There are three radial and one tangential neutron beam ports at DRR, each of which penetrates the concrete shield structure and the reactor water to provide external beams of neutron originated from the reactor core. The horizontal channel No. 4 {{is one of the}} radial channels of the Dalat nuclear {{research reactor}}. Several compositions of neutron filters have been installed in the channel to produce quasi-monoenergetic neutron beams of 0.0253, 54 and 148  keV, with neutron fluxes of 1.7  ×  106, 6.7  ×  105 and 3.9  ×  106  cm− 2  s− 1, respectively. The filtered neutron beams have been applied for measurement of neutron capture cross section, and for development of a prompt gamma neutron activation analysis system (PGNAA) in recent years. However, this neutron facility has been proposed to be renovated in order to enhance the quality of the experimental instruments, and to characterize the neutron beams parameters for calibrations of neutron detectors and dosimeters. This work is also required for expanding the channel for new filtered neutron beams of 2, 24, 59 and 133  keV. In this progress, it is requested to measure precisely the neutron energy spectrum, at the inner beam port position of the radial channel No. 4, for optimal simulation and design of the <b>neutron</b> <b>filter</b> configurations and the radiation shielding structure.

40|$|Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) is an {{effective}} method for treatment of deep seated brain tumors. This method consists of two stages: injection of boron compound in the patient body, and then irradiation of the region tumors with the neutron beam. It allows for delivery of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation (particles 4 He and 7 Li nuclei) to tumors at the cellular level whilst avoiding unnecessary dose deposition to healthy tissue. The proper neutron energies for BNCT is 1 eV– 10 keV, namely epithermal energy range. Neutrons can slow down to the thermal energies via passing through the different tissue before reaching the tumor. Neutrons with higher or lower energies and &gamma-radiation are extremely undesirable and should be avoided {{as much as possible}} of the spectrum. Therefore, a good spectrum shaping is an essential requirement for BNCT. The following neutron-producing charged particles reactions are considered mainly for use in accelerator based neutron capture therapy: 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be, 9 Be(p,n) 9 B, 9 Be(d,n) 10 B and 13 C(d,n) 13 N. The 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be reaction is excellent for producing neutron. Neutrons from this reaction have a relatively narrow energy spectrum which requires less moderation than those generated from other reactions. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be reaction with irradiation of 2. 5 MeV- 20 mA proton beam for neutron production in order to treatment deep seated brain tumors. the serious drawback of this source is the low melting point of Li target (180 °C) and its low thermal conductivity (84. 7 W/m °k). To overcome this problem, a cooling system was optimized and a beam shaping assembly (BSA) was proposed for decreasing of the flux of fast neutrons (E> 10 keV). The proposed BSA based on 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be reaction contains: BeO as moderator, graphite as reflector, Cd as thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>filter</b> and BeO as collimator. Our results show 1. 08 × 109 n/cm 2 s epithermal neutron flux at the beam port of the proposed BSA. Although the designed beam meet IAEA criteria, however, considering the differences between skin and healthy tissue in BNCT leads to high neutron dose in skin. To overcome this problem, the BSA is designed so that the dose in skin reduced as much as possible. The simulated Snyder head phantom is used to evaluate dose in tissues due to the irradiation of designed neutron beam. Dosimetric evaluation in the simulated head phantom shows that our designed beam is effective to treat deep-seated brain tumors with the reduction of damage to the skin in a reasonable time. Our optimization is based on Monte Carlo calculation using MCNPX code. Keywords: BNCT, 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be Reaction, deep-seated tumors, Skin, Dose evaluatio...|$|E

A significant number of DOE supported modifications {{were made to the}} WSU reactor in order to create an epithermal neutron beam {{while at the same time}} maintaining the other activities of the 1 MW reactor. These modifications were: (1) Removal of the old thermal column. (2) Construction and insertion of a new epithermal filter, collimator and shield. (3) Construction of a shielded room that could accommodate the very high radiation field created by an intense neutron beam. (4) Removal of the previous reactor core fuel cluster arrangement. (5) Design and loading of the new reactor core fuel cluster arrangement in order to optimize the neutron flux entering the epithermal <b>neutron</b> <b>filter.</b> (6) The integration of the shielded rooms interlocks and radiological controls into the SCRAM chain and operating electronics of the reactor. (7) Construction of a motorized mechanism for moving and remotely controlling the position of the entire reactor bridge. (8) The integration of the reactor bridge control electronics into the SCRAM chain and operating electronics of the reactor. (9) The design, construction and attachment to the support structure of the reactor of an irradiation box that could be inserted into position next to the face of the reactor. (Necessitated by the previously mentioned core rearrangement). All of the above modifications were successfully completed and tested. The resulting epithermal beam of 1 x 10 {sup 9 } n/sec-cm{sup 2 } was measured by Idaho National Laboratory with assistance from WSU's Neutron Activation Analysis Group. The beam is as good as our initial proposals for the project had predicted. In addition to all of the design, construction and insertion of the hardware, shielding, electronics and radiation monitoring systems there was considerable manpower and effort put into changes in the Technical Specifications of the reactor and implementing procedures for use of the new facility. This staff involvement is one of the reasons we requested special facility support from the DOE. Once the facility was competed and all of the recalibrations and measurements made to characterize the differences between this reactor core and the previous core we began to assist INL in making their beam measurements with foils and phantoms. Although we proposed support for only one additional staff position to support this new NCT facility the staff support provided by the WSU Nuclear Radiation Center was greater than had been anticipated by our initial proposal. INL was also assisted in the testing of a heavy water (deuterated water) bladder that can be inserted into the collimator in order to produce an intense, external thermal neutron beam.

The insertion of neutron detectors wrapped with different neutron absorbing materials, or <b>neutron</b> <b>filters,</b> in the central guide tube of a PWR fuel assembly is envisaged to measure the neutron flux in the energy region close to the 0. 3 eV resonance of 239 Pu. In addition, the measurement of the fast neutron flux is foreseen.

Moreover, several detector types are compared to identify the optimal condition and to assess the expected total neutron counts that can be obtained with the SINRD measurements. Results from Monte Carlo simulations showed that ranges between 0. 1 - 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm ensure the optimal conditions for the Gd and Cd filters, respectively. Moreover, a 239 Pu fission chamber is better suited to measure neutrons close to the 0. 3 eV resonance and it has the highest sensitivity to 239 Pu, in comparison with a 235 U fission chamber, with a 3 He proportional counter, and with a 10 B proportional counter. The use of a thin Gd filter and a thick Cd filter is suggested for the 239 Pu and 235 U fission chambers to increase the total counts achieved in a measurement, while a thick Gd filter and a thin Cd filter are envisaged for the 3 He and 10 B proportional counters to increase the sensitivity to 239 Pu. We concluded that an optimization process that takes into account measurement time, filters thickness, and detector size is needed to develop a SINRD detector that can meet the requirement for an efficient verification of spent fuel assemblies.

40|$|Natural carbon is {{well known}} as reactor {{structure}} material {{and at the same}} time as one of the most important neutron scattering standards, especially at energies less than 2 MeV, where the neutron total and neutron scattering cross sections are essentially identical. The best neutron total cross section experimental data for natural carbon in the range 1 - 500 keV have uncertainties of 1 - 4 %. However, the difference between these data and those based on R-matrix analysis and used in the ENDF libraries is evident, especially in the energy range 1 - 60 keV. Experimental data for total scattering neutron cross sections for this element in the energy range 1 - 200 keV are scanty. The use of the technique of <b>neutron</b> <b>filtered</b> beams developed at the Kyiv Research Reactor makes it possible to reduce the uncertainty of the experimental data and to measure the neutron scattering cross sections on natural carbon in the energy range 2 - 149 keV with accuracies of 3 - 6 %. Investigations of the neutron scattering cross section on carbon were carried out using 5 filters with energies 2, 3. 5, 24, 54 and 133 keV. The neutron scattering cross sections were measured using a detector system covering nearly 2 {pi}. The detector consisting of {sup 3 }He counters (58 units), was located just above the carbon samples. The {sup 3 }He counters (CHM- 37, 7 atm, diameter = 18 mm, L= 50 cm) are placed in five layers (12 or 11 in each layer).

40|$|We have {{observed}} depolarization effects when high intensity cold neutron beams are incident on alkali-metal-spin-exchange polarized He- 3 cells used as <b>neutron</b> spin <b>filters.</b> This was first observed as {{a reduction of}} the maximum attainable He- 3 polarization and was attributed to a decrease of alkali-metal polarization, which led us to directly measure alkali-metal polarization and spin relaxation over a range of neutron fluxes at LANSCE and ILL. The data reveal a new alkali-metal spin-relaxation mechanism that approximately scales as the square root of the neutron capture-flux density incident on the cell. This is consistent with an effect proportional to the recombination-limited ion concentration, but is much larger than expected from earlier work. Comment: submitted to Physical Review Letter...|$|R
40|$|Since in ITER the {{radiation}} field {{will be much}} more demanding than that of present day devices, research programmes at JET are aimed at developing radiation hard diagnostics and related components. Initially, significant efforts are devoted to determining {{the radiation}} field of both the plasma and in the immediate environment with better accuracy. New developments in MCNP calculations and dedicated measurements provide useful information about the radiation field in the Torus Hall, even during non-operational periods. The effect of using Beryllium in the near future for JET first wall, is being assessed. New materials for activation samples are under consideration and will be tested to improve the calibration accuracy of JET neutron diagnostics. The long-term goal of this work is to obtain spectrometric information from an appropriate combination of different materials. Several studies are under way to modify the radiation field at the detectors by using LiH or pure water as <b>neutron</b> <b>filters,</b> to alleviate the problem of the background in gamma-ray measurements. A suite of radiation hard detectors for neutrons, magnetic field and charged particles are being developed. Super-heated fluid neutron detectors, used for yield and imaging, are being upgraded, in order to provide a broadband spectrometric capability. Chemical vapour deposited diamond diodes are being qualified as counters and as spectrometers. Prototypes of Hall probes made of InSb have been installed on the machine and have provided some preliminary results. Si-on-insulator detectors are under development for use in neutral particle analysers and are currently being bench-tested. Some attention is being devoted to optical components, fibres and mirrors, and to investigating radiation hard electronics using reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Arrays...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the field}} of the {{treatment}} by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), an optimized neutron system was proposed. This study (simulation) was conducted to optimize the geometry and composition of neutron system and increase the epithermal neutron flux {{for the treatment of}} deep tumors is performed. Materials and Methods: A neutron system for BNCT was proposed. The system included 252 Cf neutron source, <b>neutron</b> moderator/reflector arrangement, <b>filter</b> and concrete. To capture fast <b>neutrons,</b> different <b>neutron</b> <b>filters</b> Fe, Pb, Ni and PbF 2 with various thicknesses were simulated and studied. Li (with 1 mm thick) was used for <b>filtering</b> of thermal <b>neutrons.</b> Bi with thickness of 1 cm was used to minimize the intensity of gamma rays. Monte Carlo simulation code MCNPX 2. 4. 0 was used for design of the neutron system and calculation of the neutron components at the output port of the system. Results: For different thicknesses of the <b>filters,</b> the fast <b>neutron</b> flux, the epithermal and thermal flux were calculated at the output port of the system. The spatial distribution of the fast neutron flux, the epithermal flux and gamma flux in human head phantom with the presence of 40 ppm of 10 B were obtained. The present calculations showed that Pb filter (about 1 cm) at the output port is suitable for fast neutron capture. The thickness of Li filter was determined due to its high absorption cross-section in thermal region. Bi was used as a gamma filter by the reason of it is good for shielding gamma rays, while having high transmission epithermal neutrons. Conclusion: The epithermal neutron flux has enhanced about 38 percent at the output port of the present system, compared with recent system proposed by Ghassoun et al. At 2 cm depth inside the head phantom, the neutron flux reaches a maximum value about. At this depth, the ratio of the thermal neutron flux to the epithermal flux is about three times, that suggests such a neutron system to treat tumors in the proximity of the depth. In the presence of 10 B in the brain, at 2 cm depth the neutron absorption takes place more than other areas of the brain, and consequently the thermal flux is depressed uniformly in the head phantom. Due to high LET and RBE of alpha and 7 Li particles (obtained by reaction of boron-neutron), the tumor at the mentioned depth is damaged rather than the around...|$|R
