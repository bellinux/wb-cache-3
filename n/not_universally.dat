5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|In 1168, his great-uncle, Marco Polo, {{borrowed}} money and commanded a ship in Constantinople. His grandfather, Andrea Polo {{of the parish}} of San Felice, had three sons, Maffeo, yet another Marco, and the traveller's father Niccolò. This genealogy, described by Ramusio, is <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> accepted {{as there is no}} additional evidence to support it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the US Navy was growing rapidly. The Navy {{commissioned}} its first battleships in 1895, {{and by the}} middle of the next decade, Jane's Fighting Ships ranked its battle line second only to the British Navy. However, this rapid growth was <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> supported either within the government or within the Navy. Compromises between powerful groups were frequently necessary to get funding.|$|E
5|$|No Admiralty {{camouflage}} {{section was}} established until October 1940. Admiralty camouflage schemes promulgated in 1941 were <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments. Nearly all destroyers and larger ships wore an Admiralty disruptive camouflage scheme by late 1942; but Commonwealth captains executed official camouflage schemes with greater variation than was customary with American measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} are {{a sample of}} the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> taught in numeric order.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{can also}} be classified by duration as acute, sub-chronic (also known as sub-acute), or chronic. The specific duration required to meet each of these is <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> agreed upon, but generally pain lasting less than six weeks is classified as acute, pain lasting six to twelve weeks is sub-chronic, and more than twelve weeks is chronic. Management and prognosis may change based on the duration of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Usermaatre Osorkon IV was {{an ancient}} Egyptian pharaoh {{during the late}} Third Intermediate Period. Traditionally {{considered}} the very last king of the 22nd Dynasty, he was de facto little more than ruler in Tanis and Bubastis, in Lower Egypt. He is generally – though <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> – identified with the King Shilkanni mentioned by Assyrian sources, and with the biblical So, King of Egypt from the Books of Kings.|$|E
5|$|Wind's view of Wodehouse's naïveté is <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> held. Biographers {{including}} Donaldson, McCrum and Phelps {{suggest that}} his unworldliness was {{only part of}} a complex character, and that in some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse's sharpest and most biting satire.|$|E

5|$|After {{the coup}} on 1 November 1963, in which Diệm and Nhu were killed the {{following}} day, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He {{was the leading}} civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Thơ's appointment was <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Diệm era.|$|E
5|$|Historically Leigh {{was well}} {{connected}} to the local transport infrastructure, but with {{the closure of the}} railway in 1969 this is no longer the case. Public transport is co-ordinated by the Transport for Greater Manchester. There are bus services operated by First Greater Manchester, Jim Stones, Maytree Travel, Diamond Bus North West, Stagecoach Manchester and Network Warrington from Leigh bus station to many local destinations including Wigan, Bolton, Warrington, Manchester and St Helens. There had been suggestions to reopen the railway via Tyldesley to Manchester, but a guided busway scheme was chosen for the route; this decision was <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> popular.|$|E
5|$|Lochlann, {{originally}} Laithlinn or Lothlend, {{the land}} where Amlaíb's father was king, is often identified with Norway, but it is <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> accepted that it had such a meaning in early times. Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly {{as late as the}} Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland. Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, it had come to mean Norway.|$|E

5|$|Mass is {{also the}} prime {{attribute}} by which planets are distinguished from stars. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type isotopic abundance, beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion. Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System; but there are exoplanets of this size. The 13-Jupiter-mass limit is <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> agreed upon and the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 20 Jupiter masses, and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses.|$|E
5|$|One last Scottish attempt {{against the}} king's person {{occurred}} in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by Alexander Ruthven, the Earl of Gowrie's younger brother, at Gowrie House, {{the seat of}} the Ruthvens. Ruthven was run through by James's page John Ramsay and the Earl of Gowrie was killed in the ensuing fracas; there were few surviving witnesses. Given James's history with the Ruthvens {{and the fact that he}} owed them a great deal of money, his account of the circumstances was <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> believed.|$|E
5|$|Radar studies {{preceding}} {{and following}} the Lunar Prospector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters. In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is <b>not</b> <b>universally</b> agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E
