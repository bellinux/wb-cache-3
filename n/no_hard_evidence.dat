5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203, {{which suggests that}} Ragnall may {{have been responsible for}} its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald. Be that as it may, there is <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>evidence</b> linking Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by other leading members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E

During 1881-1884, 1903–1906 and 1914–1921, waves of antisemitic pogroms swept Russian Jewish communities. At least some pogroms {{are believed to have}} been organized or supported by the Russian Okhrana.

40|$|Software {{development}} is a cornerstone of information technology and computer programming {{is a key element}} of software development. Teaching computer programming to undergraduates can be challenging. Adding to the challenge is the near universality of the object-oriented paradigm in computer programming courses. A key question facing programming instructors is whether to take an objects-first approach or a structures-first approach in the classroom. Conventional wisdom seems to favor an objects-first approach, but <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> empirical <b>evidence</b> exists on this question. This study performs a field experiment by having two nearly equivalent sections of introductory Java programming test these two fundamental approaches to OO programming education. The results clearly indicate that students who take an objects-first approach to OO programming outperform those who take a structures-first approach...|$|R

5000|$|December 19, 16.15h, the {{abovementioned}} {{chairman of}} the Court of Cassation came into parliament with a six-page letter. His conclusion {{was that there was}} <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> legal <b>evidence</b> of interference by the government, but that there were strong indications of it, nevertheless. He pointed out several persons as out of bounds, including the Minister of Justice and the procureur-generaal at the Court of Appeal, who together had taken some highly questionable actions on the afternoon of Friday December 12. As a consequence of this report, the Minister of Justice stepped down immediately. On the proposal of the Prime Minister the rest of the cabinet followed, after consulting for an hour or so. The resignation of the Leterme government, fallen over its handling of the Fortis-affair, was accepted by the King on Monday December 22. Leterme himself emphasized repeatedly that he was innocent of any interference with the law courts, and was convinced that the inquiry by parliament would clear his name, but that it was not realistic for the cabinet to continue and that he was not available for a new cabinet.|$|R

2500|$|Patrick Matthew (20 October 1790 – 8 June 1874) was a Scottish grain merchant, fruit farmer, forester, and landowner, {{who contributed}} to the {{understanding}} of horticulture, silviculture, and agriculture in general, with a focus on maintaining the British navy and feeding new colonies. [...] He published the basic concept of natural selection as a mechanism in evolutionary adaptation and speciation (i.e. resulting from positive natural selection, in contrast to its already, widely known, negative rôle in removal of individuals in the Struggle for Survival), but failed to develop or publicise his ideas. Consequently, when Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, he and Alfred Russel Wallace were regarded by their scientific peers as having originated (independently of each other) the theory of evolution by natural selection; {{it has been suggested that}} Darwin and/or Wallace had encountered Matthew's earlier work, but there is <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> [...] <b>evidence</b> of this. After the publication of On the Origin of Species, Matthew contacted Darwin, who in subsequent editions of the book acknowledged that the principle of natural selection had been anticipated by Matthew's brief statement, mostly contained in the appendices and addendum of his 1831 book, On Naval Timber and Aboriculture.|$|R

40|$|Spectroscopic {{investigations}} of the N = Z system, 72 Kr and N = Z + 1 system 73 Kr were performed using the national γ-ray facility Gammasphere. The systems were populated via the 2 p 2 n and 2 pn channels of the 36 Ar + 40 Ca reaction at a nominal Ar beam energy of 145 MeV. An array of 15 liquid scintillation neutron detectors was installed in Gammasphere {{for the purpose of}} exit channel selection. The present work represents the first use of Gammasphere in conjunction with an array of neutron detectors and the first use of Gammasphere with complex trigger conditions. The investigations yielded improved spectroscopic data as well as the design of an optimum array for use with Gammasphere. ^ The high spin data in 72 Kr and 73 Kr were considerably extended. The data were compared with the predictions of pairing and deformation self-consistent total Routhian surface calculations.

Runkle also may have volunteered at the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center in Bay Village {{at the time of the}} murder. All four girls who received suspicious phone calls (with Mihaljevic being the last one) had visited it in the weeks before the abduction, and may have written their names and other personal information in the Center's visitor logbook.

Although Renner describes Runkle as an eccentric teacher, <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>evidence</b> supports this view. Runkle himself denies any involvement in the murder of Mihaljevic and the FBI has never officially declared him a suspect. Since Runkle is exceptionally well liked as a teacher by many former students, Renner became the subject of strong criticism, unlike anything he had faced from naming previous suspects, when he named Runkle.|$|E

25|$|Queen-regent Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont and Queen Wilhelmina {{were able}} to recover much of the popular support lost under William III. They {{successfully}} changed {{the role of the}} royal family to symbolise the nation's unity, determinacy and virtuousness. In 1890, when Wilhelmina took office, rumours were spread by Socialist satirical magazine De Roode Duivel ("The Red Devil") that William III was not her real father, but Emma's confidant S.M.S. de Ranitz. This would undermine the legitimacy of Wilhelmina's reign. Although <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>evidence</b> exists for the allegations, and the consensus amongst historians is that they are false, the rumours were stubborn, and still feature in conspiracy theories circulating in republican circles. The author of the rumour, the later parliamentarian and senator Louis Maximiliaan Hermans, was sentenced to six months imprisonment for lèse-majesté in 1895 for a different article and cartoon in De Roode Duivel, mocking the two queens. There were considerably more concerns over the royal dynasty's future, when Wilhelmina's marriage with Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (since 1901) repeatedly resulted in miscarriage. Had the House of Orange died out, the throne would likely have passed to Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz, leading the Netherlands into an undesirable strong influence of the German Empire that would threaten Dutch independence. Not just Socialists, but now also Anti-Revolutionary politicians including Prime Minister Abraham Kuyper and Liberals such as Samuel van Houten advocated the restoration of the Republic in Parliament in case the marriage remained childless. The birth of Princess Juliana in 1909 put the question to rest.|$|E

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease {{virus is}} a {{single-stranded}} RNA virus {{that belongs to}} the genus aphthoviruses, in the family Picornaviridae, and causes disease in cloven-hoofed animals. It {{is one of the}} biggest hindrances to the international trade of animals and animal products in the world. The virus capsids readily dissociate into pentamers at acidic pH. While there have been several studies on enterovirus uncoating, this process is poorly-understood for aphthoviruses, and there are no published structures elucidating how FMDV undergoes this transformation to infect cells. Furthermore, there are no structures available for a dissociated FMDV pentamer. Thus far, there has been only one paper claiming to show, at low resolution, a disassembly intermediate for another aphthovirus, Equine Rhinitis A Virus (ERAV). Here, a 5. 2 Å-structure of an FMDV assembly formed from acid dissociated pentamers, visualised using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), is presented. This inside-out assembly of the pentamers highlights the extensive conformational changes in the pentamers that may have lead to the disassembly of the native capsid. Also presented here is a lower-resolution structure of the isolated dissociated pentamer (8. 2 Å), enabling a comparison of the differences between native FMDV particles, the dissociated- and the re-assembled pentamers. These analyses elucidate why the pentamers may have been unable to re-assemble properly. Together, these data suggest that the ERAV structure mooted to be a disassembly intermediate may have formed from re-assembled dissociated pentamers. Furthermore, it is concluded that there is still <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> structural <b>evidence</b> that aphthoviruses form an intermediate particle during disassembly. The thesis also includes high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the FMDV serotypes SAT 1 and SAT 3 (3. 8 Å and 3. 1 Å respectively), derived from inactivated virus-pellets, thus completing the repository of high-resolution structures for all SAT serotypes. The results provide an insight into the reasons for SAT 3 being the most thermally-unstable picornaviruses, and also include predictions and comparative analyses with known antigenic sites of other FMDV serotypes. </p...|$|R
