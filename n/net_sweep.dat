40|$|The {{life history}} of the water-bug, Corixa germari (Fieb.) was studied quantitatively in a Derbyshire {{reservoir}} and observations on the biology of the species were also made. The eggs of C. germari are firmly attached to stones and are laid chiefly on the undersides or in crevices. The oviposition rate and egg mortality during 1958 were estimated by direct counts of eggs in the field, the abundance of the adults and nymphs was {{measured in terms of}} a Standard <b>Net</b> <b>Sweep</b> and the number of eggs laid per female per season was calculated from these data. By means of these methods, it was found that in I 958 the breeding adults gave mean catches of 10 per Standard <b>Net</b> <b>Sweep</b> (43 % of the adults were females) and that these adults produced 916 eggs. About 530 hatched and, of the nymphs produced, about 80 survived to become adults in the autumn. About 20 of these survived to breed in 1959. Estimates of the density of eggs laid per m(^ 2) of substratum in 1958 show that the catch per Standard <b>Net</b> <b>Sweep</b> represents about 1 / 38 of the number of C. germari per m(^ 2) of substratum. By weighing the various stages in the life history it was shown that the standing crop of C. germari gives a biomass value of 2 about 20 g. dry weight per m of substratum in the autumn. This is the highest value reached {{in the course of the}} season. C. germari has been shown to live at greater depths than most other British species and this may be a means of avoiding the the effects of wave action. Its ability to exploit deep water is coupled with the fact that it visits the surface less often and swims more rapidly than certain shallow water species...|$|E
40|$|This {{quantitative}} {{study investigated the}} contribution of discrete littoral habitats, the whole littoral and the Pelagic habitat to zooplankton abundance, biomass and diversity within shallow lakes. Intensive sampling {{was carried out in}} the main study lake, Enagh Lough East where samples were collected biweekly in the Alisma, Elodea, Gravel, Mud, Phalaris and Stone habitats using a quantitative littoral sampling method, the Active Tube and fifteen replicates were collected biweekly in the Pelagic habitat. In 2009 sampling was also carried out in Ballysaggart Lough and Lough Creeve to test the findings from the main study lake. The Active Tube has been designed to sample zooplankton quantitatively in discrete habitats within the littoral zone of lakes. It collects a representative sample of zooplankton within lake littoral habitats compared with the high margins of uncertainty associated with semi quantitative sampling methods. When compared with a commonly used method the Horizontal Timed <b>Net</b> <b>Sweep,</b> the Active Tube collected 50 % more cladoceran species over three plant habitats than the Timed <b>Net</b> <b>Sweep</b> method and the Active Tube samples had cladoceran abundances per unit volume that were at least 2000 times greater than those collected using the Timed <b>Net</b> <b>Sweep.</b> The Active Tube method produces a more detailed description of littoral zooplankton assemblages than semi quantitative methods and it allows discrete littoral habitats to be described. In Enagh Lough East the discrete littoral habitats and the whole littoral habitat provided a greater contribution to zooplankton abundance, biomass and diversity than the Pelagic habitat per unit volume and in absolute values. The higher abundance, biomass and diversity values in the littoral habitats were due to the presence of resident littoral cladoceran species and not a result of peIagic cladoceran visitors undergoing diel horizontal migration. Littoral cladocerans made up half of the assemblage within the Pelagic habitat and 20 % of the Pelagic habitat biomass. Cladoceran assemblages differed between each of the habitats. Findings from Enagh Lough East were tested in Ballysaggart Lough and Lough Creeve. Results from these test lakes strongly supported the findings in Enagh Lough East and indicated that a similarly important role of littoral zooplankton could be expected in other shallow lakes.

40|$|Abstract The {{transformation}} of natural habitats into areas destined to agriculture or projects of energy production has generated {{a growing concern}} about the impact on biological diversity. Thus, this study evaluated the diversity of ants in agroecosystems {{in the area of}} direct influence of three wind farms in the municipality of Marmeleiro, State of Paraná and examined the association of occurrences with sampling periods. To this end, four samplings were conducted in 2013, one per season. Pitfalls, Malaise trap and <b>Net</b> <b>sweep</b> were used. The assemblages were characterized and compared using richness and number of occurrences of ants. Chao 2 estimates were calculated and a comparison (rarefaction analysis) of the assemblages was performed. The association of the species with the samples was evaluated by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Altogether, there were 1, 576 occurrences of ants, totaling 55 species. The obtained estimate indicated that richness may be up to 35 % higher. Our study adds important information about richness and occurrence of ants in a region poorly analyzed for this group. Most of all, it presents a survey of species occurring in agricultural ecosystems that may serve as a parameter for future evaluations when wind farms are installed...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates hourly {{variation}} in nocturnal abundance £uctuations in a tropical, Caribbean sea grass bed. As expected, {{results indicate that}} signi¢cant diel variation is present. In addition all dominant species show an abundance peak shortly after sunset, with numbers gradually declining throughout the night. It is therefore suggested that nocturnal samples are not only incorporated into any sampling regime, but that nocturnal samples are taken within two hours after sunset. Tropical sea grass beds and their associated epiphytes form a habitat for a diverse assemblage of organisms, ranging from micro£ora and fauna through to manatees (Nakaoka, 2005). Although numerous studies have described the structural elements of the sea grass habitat, the basic functional relationships of {{the community as a}} whole remain only partly understood (Nakaoka, 2005). In part this is due to a plethora of temporal sampling regimes and di¡ering sampling techniques (e. g. beam trawl, drop <b>net,</b> <b>sweep</b> nets) being employed. This is particularly evident for the epifaunal assemblage, where caridean and dendrobranchiate shrimps dominate (e. g. Greening & Livingston, 1982; Barba et al., 2005; Garc|¤a Raso et al., 2006). In view of this numerical dominance, sea grass dwelling shrimps constitute an important trophic link between primary production and higher trophic levels.

40|$|Investigations {{were made}} {{examining}} {{the relationships between}} gastropod species richness and abundance across 20 phosphate and 20 natural lakes in Central Florida. In additional to lake category, age of phosphate lakes {{was used to determine}} if phosphate lakes ever approximate natural lakes. Additional physical, chemical, and biological parameters, including chlorophyll a, Ca, secchi, phosphorous, conductance, fish predation, and recreational lake use were investigated in order to determine if they affected gastropods with lake age. Comparisons were also made between gastropod species richness and average abundance and two groups of dominant vegetation categories: Panicum, a structurally complex macrophyte, and Typha, a less structurally complex macrophyte. After phosphate mining operations are completed, Florida state regulations require the establishment of ecologically viable habitat (created lakes) which reflects the properties of regional natural lakes including vegetation structure, littoral zone, bank slope, and lake depth. The littoral zone is part of the mandated structure of the lake, and is of considerable importance to the uptake, storage, transformation and release of nutrients. Within the littoral zone, gastropods are a critical link in the food web with implications for the long term structure and function of a lake. They are known for their close associations with macrophytes and are common environmental indicators since they have limited mobility, high diversity, are well studied, are representative of their habitat type and have a widespread geographic range. They are also an important food sources for many predators in aquatic environments, include migratory waterfowl and game fish. Gastropod species richness and abundance data were collected via standard <b>net</b> <b>sweep</b> methodology. Abundance was presented in catch per unit effort, therefore all abundance data were averages. Initial comparisons between gastropod species richness and average abundance yielded no significant differences between natural and phosphate lakes. However, when age was applied as a covariate, {{there was a significant difference}} between lake age as a continuous variable in species richness comparisons. Additionally, categorical comparisons between lakes older or younger than 30 years indicated significantly higher species richness and average abundance of gastropods in lakes phosphate lakes older than 30 years. Physical and chemical properties of the lakes did not appear to influence gastropod populations between lakes of different ages. Fish predation interactions did not indicate any significant influence either. However, the presence of boat ramps did indicate a positive relationship between average gastropod abundance and species richness and recreational lake use. Littoral zone macrophyte comparisons between dominant vegetation Typha and Panicum indicated a significantly positive relationship between gastropod species richness and average abundance in older phosphate lakes dominated by the more structurally complex Panicum macrophytes. Confidence in the Typha and Panicum results was confounded by lack of access to younger, Typha dominated, phosphate lakes. An increase in sample size for younger Typha lakes, with additional site access, may further support these findings...|$|E

The methods have been used to sample in-sect species diversity patterns in three replicate ooe hectare plots each in twelve selected sites in the Uttara Kannada district of Kamataka, India. During this case study, we have encountered 16, 852 adult individuals belooging to 1, 789 species. 219 families and 19 orders of insects. Here, we provide evidence that this methodology is adequate for sam-pling insects and differentiating habitats 00 the basis of the distribution of insect species. Some interesting biological problems that tropical ecologists can study with the data generated from the applicatioo of these methods are also brief-Iy illustrated. !NrRODUCI 10 N from studies of temperate species. This is expressed most dramatically in the statement that the number One of the few relatively undisputed of biologists is negatively correlated with the num...|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} {{deals with}} the results of comparative fishing operations conducted to study the effectiveness of rectangular flat and rectangular curved otter boards. Based on the analysis of data gathered during the course of actual field trials, following conclusions have been drawn: the average catch per hour of trawling was more by 22 kg during attachment of rectangular curved otter boards. The average horizontal spread between rectangular curved otter boards in action was more by 13 % and works out to 50 % of the head-rope length of the <b>net</b> including <b>sweeps.</b> The towing resistance of the gear with horizontally curved otter boards was more by 10 %...|$|R
