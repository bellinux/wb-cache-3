5|$|A {{central hub}} of the {{national}} rail network, Paris's six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: the TGV serving four high-speed rail lines, the <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> Corail trains, and the suburban rails (Transilien).|$|E
5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days later}} the band {{reassembled}} to try a different arrangement. The second version of the song featured McCartney's Mellotron introduction followed by the refrain. They recorded five takes of the basic tracks for this arrangement (two of which were false starts) with the last being chosen as best and subjected to further overdubs. Lennon's final vocal was recorded with the tape running fast so that when played back at <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> the tonality would be altered, giving his voice a slurred sound. This version {{was used for the}} first minute of the released recording.|$|E

5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at <b>normal</b> <b>speed,</b> to produce a haunting effect.|$|E
5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature flow (in which the <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the mean curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at <b>normal</b> <b>speed.</b> Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E
25|$|During the post-election {{protests in}} Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was {{reported}} to have slowed to less than a tenth of its <b>normal</b> <b>speeds,</b> which experts suspected was due to use of deep packet inspection.|$|R

5|$|Each side then {{attempted}} to rush all available pilots into the system, and the game's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation {{is a game}} feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the game lagging or disconnecting players. In time dilation, the game slows to ten percent <b>normal</b> <b>speed,</b> with each second of game time displaying as ten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every hour, when their Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles, making extraction difficult. For a while neither side gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on-line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead {{in the number of}} enemy Titans destroyed. Throughout the engagement, related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements, destroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 it {{introduced}} the first inspection train that could find any {{flaws in the}} tracks in real time by simply having the inspection train run along the tracks at <b>normal</b> <b>speeds.</b> This allowed for inspection of the tracks without having to shut down or slow the other traffic on that route.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{cartoons}} {{have used}} pitch shifters to produce distinctive animal voices. Alvin and the Chipmunks recordings with David Seville (aka Ross Bagdasarian) {{were created by}} recording vocal tracks at slow speeds, then playing them back at <b>normal</b> <b>speeds.</b> Voice artist Mel Blanc used pitch shifting techniques to create the voices of Tweety and Daffy Duck.|$|R
25|$|A double {{junction}} is a railway junction where a double track railway splits into two double track lines. Usually, one {{line is the}} main line and carries traffic through the junction at <b>normal</b> <b>speed,</b> while the other track is a branch line that carries traffic through the junction at reduced speed.|$|E
25|$|Thomas' {{use of the}} lasso {{requires}} the player to point the crosshairs at an appropriate spot, and then move the analog stick or mouse in a circular motion, mimicking the action of using an actual lasso. Once sufficient speed has been reached, the lasso will be thrown automatically. When he uses the bow and arrow, the player has the option of going into slow motion for more precise aiming, or firing in <b>normal</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{report of}} the inquiry was issued on 3 December 1953 and stated that the cause was unascertainable. The court found the loss was not contributed by any {{wrongful}} act or default of any person or party. It was concluded that the urgency signal was transmitted at a <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> and possibly not an indication that urgent assistance was required, quickly followed by a hasty distress signal indicated that whatever the trouble it developed in a sudden and violent manner.|$|E

They were installed for 140mph (225km/h) running {{in connection with}} the testing of the new InterCity 225 electric trains, with a steady green limiting test trains to the <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> limit of 125mph (200km/h). They no longer have official meaning, but remain in place and {{there are a couple of}} locations where the presence or absence of flashing provides useful information to drivers.|$|E
25|$|Tolls on the Lantau Link—of which Tsing Ma Bridge is part—for motorcycles, private cars, public {{double-decker}} buses and heavy goods vehicles are HK$20, $30, $60 and $80 respectively, charged {{only for the}} eastbound direction from Lantau to Tsing Yi. The <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> limit on the bridge is , subject to lowering {{in the event of}} road work or strong wind. Traffic may also be directed to the sheltered carriageways on the lower deck when there are very strong winds. There is no sidewalk on the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The other {{component}} of Agrippa's sections {{in the game}} involves chariot racing. In this mode, Agrippa must race against other chariots, and can win by either crossing the finish line first, or eliminating all of his opponents, either by killing them or destroying their chariots. Agrippa can whip his horses to give a speed boost, but doing do drains the horses stamina gauge. When it is empty, the horses can only run at <b>normal</b> <b>speed,</b> until the gauge begins to fill up again. Agrippa can eliminate opponents by driving alongside their chariots and attacking them or by forcing their chariots into obstacles. Longer weapons {{can be found on}} the track itself, carried by slaves.|$|E

25|$|The bullet time {{effect is}} similar but {{slightly}} more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so {{that rather than}} appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, {{as opposed to the}} normal 24 frames per second of film. Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side. To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.|$|E
25|$|Australia weren't able {{to equal}} that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They {{took on the}} Kiwis in {{the second of the}} double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue {{continued}} to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata'utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see {{whether or not it was}} Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in <b>normal</b> <b>speed</b> it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18–22.|$|E

However, an important advantage to using I-Pass is that the main toll plazas were rebuilt to use open road tolling so that I-Pass users can drive straight through the toll plaza passing under transponder antennas at <b>normal</b> <b>speeds,</b> while cash customers must pull {{off to the side}} of the road and stop at conventional tollbooths.|$|R
50|$|The ICE3 is a German {{high-speed}} {{train that}} runs between Amsterdam and Utrecht in the Netherlands, onto Frankfurt and Cologne in Germany.
