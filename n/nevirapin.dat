40|$|Introduction: It is {{estimated}} that 22000 - 61000 of pregnant women living with HIV in India have mother to child transmission (MTCT) rate of 12 - 97 %. This study was done to evaluate transmission rate of HIV from mother to child in a tertiary care hospital and evaluate role of different interventions. Methodology: In this study all babies of HIV positive mothers who were diagnosed antenatal and also babies less than 18 months of age of HIV positive mother who came to paediatric OPD were enrolled. Informed consent was taken and assurance about secrecy was given. Detailed background information, antenatal history, obstetric history, birth history, mother investigation and treatment history were recorded. Single dose <b>nevirapin</b> was given to all mother and baby pairs. All babies were followed up to 18 months of age. Sero diagnoses of all babies were checked at different ages with different diagnostic tests and confirmed {{at the end of}} 18 months of age with 3 rapid diagnostic tests. Result and Conclusion &# 150; Mother to child transmission rate was 11. 4 % in this study. Single dose <b>nevirapin</b> to mother baby pair had 93 - 97 % protectivity. Anti retroviral treatment was 80 - 83 % protective in mother with low CD 4 count and high viral load. Due to limitation of sources breast feeding was still adopted as acceptable feeding option.

40|$|Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) {{has been}} {{associated}} with the development of a clinical group and metabolic disorders in AIDS. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the lipid profile, of HIV- 1 infected individuals treated with or without Protease Inhibitor (PI) during the highly active antiretroviral therapy. A retrospective study was carried out on 40 healthy individuals (Control Group), 36 HIV- 1 infected individuals not following antiretroviral therapy and 65 HIV- 1 infected patients on antiviral therapy. The different HAARTs comprised: Lamivudin+Zidovudin+Indinavir (n = 10), Lamivudin+Zidovudin +Nevirapin (n = 7), Lamivudin+Zidovudin+Efavirenz (n = 7), Stavudin+Lamivudin+Efavirenz (n = 12) and Stavudin+Lamivudin+Nevirapin (n = 29). The duration of the antiviral therapy was comprised between 9 and 12 months. There were no differences between HAARTs in relation to the triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels. The association of a protease inhibitor [Indinavir] with Zidovudin and Lamivudin induced a significant increase of total cholesterol compare to HIV negative as well as the LDL: HDL and total cholesterol: HDL ratios than in others HAARTs. The use of Efavirenz as Non Nucleotidic Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) was associated with elevated triglyceride levels while <b>nevirapin</b> increase the total cholesterol and both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels but a great improvement in LDL: HDL and cholesterol: HDL ratios was observed with the combination of Stavudin and lamivudin with <b>Nevirapin</b> compare to Efavirenz.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} some highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), used {{in the management of}} HIV/AIDS in Cameroon, on oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (as TBARs), albumin, protein carbonyl content and protein sulfhydryls groups. 85 HIV positive patients (34. 8 ± 9. 3 years) were on three different highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART patients). 65 HIV positive patients (32. 2 ± 10. 9 years) on no treatment (Pre-HAART patients), and 90 non-HIV infected patients (32. 6 ± 9. 3 years), were the control groups. Plasma TBARs as well as carbonyl levels were significantly higher in HIV patients on HAART compared to pre-HAART patients or non-HIV infected controls. On the other hand, the protein sulfhydryl group content was not different for patients on HAART compared to pre-HAART patients, but both were significantly lower than non-HIV infected controls (P < 0. 0001, 0. 001). The combination treatment Therapy I [stavudin (80 mg) + Lamivudin (600 mg) + <b>Nevirapin</b> + (400 mg) zidovudin (600 mg) ] brought about a significant (p < 0. 05) reduction in the plasma concentration of protein sulfhydrl groups as well as TBARs compared to Therapy II [stavudin (80 mg) + Lamivudin (300 mg) + <b>nevirapin</b> (400 mg) ] or with combination Therapy III of [zidovudine (600 mg) + lamivudin(300 mg) with efavirenz (600 mg) ] (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Dharmais Cancer Hospital {{is one of}} 237 {{hospital}} {{appointed by}} the government of Indonesia to give treatment, support and ARV therapy for HIV/AIDS patients. Ev-ery year, there is a significant increasing number of HIV/AIDS patients in DharmaisCancer Hospital, therefore successfully of therapy is needed to be carried out regularly for the optimum result to the patients. One of methods to evaluating therapy is by reviewing efficacy of ARV combinations toward escalation of immunity respond (es-calation of CD 4). The ARV combinations give a good efficacy if increasing CD 4 > 50 cell/mm 3. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the efficacy of four ARV combina-tion (each type consists of two Nucleosides Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor and one Non-Nucleosides Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor) base on increasing CD 4 mean HIV/AIDS patients after 6 – 12 months treatment in Dharmais Cancer Hospital from 2005 – 2006, and to compare the efficacy of four ARV combinations. The four ARVcombinations are combination I (Lamivudin + Zidovudin + Efavirenz), combina-tions II (Lamivudin + Zidovudin + <b>Nevirapin),</b> combination III (Lamivudin + Stavudin + Efavirenz), and combination IV (Lamivudin + Stavudin + <b>Nevirapin).</b> This study was analytical, cross-sectional design. Samples for this study were taken by total sampling using all data of HIV/AIDS patients in Dharmais Cancer Hospital from the year 2005 – 2006. The inclusion criteria were patients of fifteen years of age or more, baseline count CD 4   < 200 cell/mm 3, received ARV treatment for 6 – 12 months, received treatment of either one of the four ARV combination, and had dataof CD 4 from laboratory result before and after the treatment. Data were taken from patients’ medical record and analyzed with ANOVA-test. The result of this study from 151 patients showed that all the four combinations gave good efficacy based on the increasing CD 4 mean. There was a significant difference increasing CD 4 mean to HIV/AIDS patients between those received ARV combination II and those received ARV combination III (p value = 0, 032). And there was not a significant difference for the other combinations. This study was from the four ARV combinations gave two the best efficacy are combination II and combination III...|$|E
40|$|The {{log-rank test}} {{has been widely}} used to test a {{treatment}} effect under the Cox model for censored time-to-event outcomes, though it may lose power substantially when the model 2 ̆ 7 s proportional hazards assumption does not hold. In this paper, we consider an extended Cox model that uses B-splines or smoothing splines to model a time-varying treatment effect and propose score test statistics for the treatment effect. Our proposed new tests combine statistical evidence from both the magnitude and {{the shape of the}} time-varying hazard ratio function, and thus are omnibus and powerful against various types of alternatives. In addition, the new testing framework is applicable to any choices of spline basis functions, including B-splines and smoothing splines. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed tests perform well in finite samples and were frequently more powerful than conventional tests alone in many settings. The new methods are applied to the HIVNET 012 Study, a randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of single-dose <b>Nevirapin</b> against mother-to-child HIV transmission conducted by the HIV Prevention Trial Network...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the applicability of saliva as an alternative body fluid for therapeutic drug monitoring of nevirapine. The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in plasma and saliva during a dosing interval was assessed in HIV- 1 -infected patients taking nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) to explore the relation between the concentration of nevirapine in plasma and saliva. To validate the anticipated relationship prospectively, single, paired plasma and saliva samples were obtained from nevirapine-treated HIV- 1 -infected outpatients. The plasma nevirapine concentration was strongly correlated with the salivary concentration. The mean saliva/plasma concentration ratio was 0. 51 and was independent of the time after ingestion. Salivary nevirapine concentrations were used to estimate the corresponding plasma concentrations for 31 outpatients. Compared with the true plasma concentrations, the estimated concentrations were biased by - 4. 2 %, with a precision of 13. 3 %. These data show a strong correlation between the salivary and plasma concentrations of nevirapine at a dosage of 200 mg twice daily. This relation has been validated prospectively, and the prediction of plasma concentrations was accurate and precise. Therefore, the authors conclude that saliva can be a useful body fluid for therapeutic drug monitoring of <b>nevirapin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The new {{way with}} {{nevirapine}} {{was reported to}} prevent mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus (HIV) that also is less costly and markedly more eŠective than the standard therapy with AZT in the third world. The more practical therapy comes from substituting one marketed drug, nevirapine, for the standard drug, AZT. It was proposed that wide-scale use of nevirapine in developing countries could potentially prevent 300000 to 400000 newborns each year from be-ginning life infected with HIV. But in September, 2000, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received reports of life-threatening hepatotoxicity (liver damage) among health care workers taking nevirapine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after occupational exposure to HIV. Furthermore, persons taking nevirapine regimens for PEP after HIV exposure also {{are at risk for}} serious and adverse events. The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had identiˆed 22 cases of severe liver, skin and muscle damage related to nevirapine taken after possible exposure to HIV from March 1997 through September 2000. <b>Nevirapin</b> has not been recommended for PEP use, and has previously been associated with instances of serious skin or muscle conditions, liver damage, and death when used for treating HIV-in-fected individuals. In most circumstances, the risks associated with nevirapine as part of an occupational PEP regimen might outweigh the anticipated beneˆts...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{relationships}} between exposure to nevirapine and the virological response in HIV- 1 -infected individuals {{participating in the}} INCAS trial. METHODS: The elimination rate constant of plasma HIV- 1 RNA (k) was calculated during the first 2 weeks of treatment with nevirapine, zidovudine and didanosine in 51 antiretroviral-naive HIV- 1 -infected patients. The {{relationships between}} the value of k, the time to reach an undetectable HIV- 1 RNA concentration in plasma (< 20 copies/ml) {{and the success of}} therapy after 52 weeks of treatment as dependent variables and the exposure to nevirapine, baseline HIV- 1 RNA and baseline CD 4 cell count as independent variables, were explored using linear regression analyses, proportional hazard models and logistic analyses, respectively. RESULTS: The value of k for HIV- 1 RNA in plasma was positively and significantly associated with the mean plasma nevirapine concentration during the first 2 weeks of therapy (P = 0. 011) and the baseline HIV- 1 RNA (P = 0. 008). Patients with a higher exposure to nevirapine reached undetectable levels of HIV- 1 RNA in plasma more rapidly (P = 0. 03). From 12 weeks on, the median nevirapine plasma concentration was significantly correlated with success of therapy after 52 weeks (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: A high exposure to nevirapine (in a twice daily regimen) is significantly associated with improved virological response in the short {{as well as in the}} long term. These findings suggest that optimization of nevirapine concentration might be used as a tool to improve virological outcome in (antiretroviral-naive) patients treated with <b>nevirapin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction The aim of {{the study}} was the {{evaluation}} of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a rural, ressource-limited region in Western Kenya. Methods ART was part of the routine health care of the Migori-Hospital and was applied by the health personnel. Standard treatment was Stavudine, Lamivudine and <b>Nevirapin.</b> The follow-up period was 12 months. Within regular consultations side effects, treatment response and adherence were documented. Adherence was measured by pill count, patient self report and visual analogue scale. Factors influencing treatment response, survival, adherence, occurrence of side effects and loss to follow-up were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analysis. Results 159 patients had a treatment indication and were enrolled into the study. 124 patients started ART and 22 % denied treatment. A low educational level and in women pregnancy were identified as independent risk factors for treatment denial. 71 % of the treated patients were female, the median age was 31 years. At start of ART 45 % of the patients had AIDS and the median CD 4 cell count was 189 /µl. The median viral load was 5. 03 log 10 and the median weight 55 kg. The CD 4 cell count after 6 months of ART increased by a median of 121 /ml and after 12 months by 142 /µl, the viral load decreased by 2. 4 and 2. 5 log, respectively. The body weight increased by 5 and 4 kg, respectively. After 6 months of ART, 28 % of the patients had a virologic treatment failure (viral load > 400 c/ml), after 12 months 32 %. A mean adherence of less than 95 % after 4 months of ART was significantly associated with virologic treatment failure at 6 months. The probability to survive or to stay free of opportunistic infections during 12 months of follow-up was 67. 7 %. A low body weight and having AIDS at baseline were independently associated with disease progression under ART. The mean adherence after 12 months of ART was 91 %, 77. 6 % of the patients had an adherence of more than 95 %. A history of incomplete adherence was identified as risk factor for repeated non-adherence at each follow-up. During 12 months of ART, 15 % of the patients were lost to follow-up; incomplete adherence within the first 2 months of ART was identified as independent risk factor. Additionally, there was a trend for lower educational level to be associated with loss to follow-up (p= 0. 05). Gender differences were not detected regarding treatment response, treatment failure, adherence and side effects. Conclusion The clinical, immunological and virological treatment response as well as the adherence was comparable to other ART studies from Africa and developed countries. In our setting, targeting adequate counselling to special patient groups such as pregnant women, those with lower educational level and with non-adherence could possibly help to decrease loss to follow-up and to increase adherence and virologic treatment response...|$|E
