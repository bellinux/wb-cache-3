25|$|Examples {{of other}} {{experiments}} {{not based on}} the Michelson–Morley principle, i.e. <b>non-optical</b> isotropy tests achieving an even higher level of precision, are Clock comparison or Hughes–Drever experiments. In Drever's 1961 experiment, 7Li nuclei in the ground state, which has total angular momentum J=3/2, were split into four equally spaced levels by a magnetic field. Each transition between a pair of adjacent levels should emit a photon of equal frequency, resulting in a single, sharp spectral line. However, since the nuclear wave functions for different MJ have different orientations in space relative to the magnetic field, any orientation dependence, whether from an aether wind or from a dependence on the large-scale distribution of mass in space (see Mach's principle), would perturb the energy spacings between the four levels, resulting in an anomalous broadening or splitting of the line. No such broadening was observed. Modern repeats {{of this kind of}} experiment have provided some of the most accurate confirmations of the principle of Lorentz invariance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to skyglow, light trespass can impact observations when artificial light directly enters the tube {{of the telescope}} and is reflected from <b>non-optical</b> surfaces until it eventually reaches the eyepiece. This direct form of light pollution causes a glow across {{the field of view}} which reduces contrast. Light trespass also makes it hard for a visual observer to become sufficiently dark adapted. The usual measures to reduce this glare, if reducing the light directly is not an option, include flocking the telescope tube and accessories to reduce reflection, and putting a light shield (also usable as a dew shield) on the telescope to reduce light entering from angles other than those near the target. Under these conditions, some astronomers prefer to observe under a black cloth to ensure maximum dark adaptation. In one Italian regional lighting code this effect of stray light is defined as [...] "optical pollution", {{due to the fact that}} there is a direct path from the light source to the [...] "optic" [...] – the observer's eye or telescope.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip printability are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of opposite polarity. In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other <b>non-optical</b> causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E
2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a <b>non-optical</b> electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E

50|$|All optical {{experiments}} {{are affected by}} this problem, having typical efficiencies around 5-30%.

Unfortunately, they are all still vulnerable to the communication loophole.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} is the confinement of light by caustics. Instead of light being confined by two reflective surfaces, it is confined by a reflective surface and a caustic {{of the edge}} rays. This provides the possibility to add lossless <b>non-optical</b> surfaces to the optics.|$|E
50|$|Radiotelescopes are {{frequently}} diffraction-limited, because the wavelengths they use (from millimeters to meters) are {{so long that}} the atmospheric distortion is negligible.

50|$|Current {{non-invasive}} {{imaging techniques}} cannot capture the brain's activity on a neuron-by-neuron level.

50|$|A {{spectrometer}} {{is used in}} spectroscopy {{for producing}} spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities. Spectrometers may also operate {{over a wide range}} of <b>non-optical</b> wavelengths, from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared. If the instrument is designed to measure the spectrum in absolute units rather than relative units, then it is typically called a spectrophotometer. The majority of spectrophotometers are used in spectral regions near the visible spectrum.|$|E

50|$|Some {{people who}} {{fall into this}} {{category}} can use their considerable residual vision - their remaining sight - to complete daily tasks without relying on alternative methods. The role of a low vision specialist (optometrist or ophthalmologist) is to maximize the functional level of a patient's vision by optical or <b>non-optical</b> means.

50|$|In {{physics and}} in {{electronic}} engineering, dark current is {{the relatively small}} electric current that flows through photosensitive devices such as a photomultiplier tube, photodiode, or charge-coupled device even when no photons are entering the device; it consists of the charges generated in the detector when no outside radiation is entering the detector. It {{is referred to as}} reverse bias leakage current in <b>non-optical</b> devices and is present in all diodes. Physically, dark current is due to the random generation of electrons and holes within the depletion region of the device.|$|E

The Arkyd-3 testbed satellite was packaged in a 3U CubeSat form-factor of 10 * 10 * 30 cm. The first attempt to validate and mature the technology met a setback on 28 October 2014, when the first Arkyd-3 test satellite was destroyed during launch in the explosion of the Antares rocket carrying it to the International Space Station (ISS).|$|E
50|$|The ghost ring sight is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the fastest type of aperture sight. It is fairly accurate, easy to use, and obscures the target less than nearly all other <b>non-optical</b> sights. Because of this, ghost ring sights are commonly installed on combat shotguns and submachine guns (and to a much lesser extent, rifles). The ghost ring is a fairly recent innovation, and differs from traditional aperture sights in the extreme thinness of the rear ring, and the slightly thicker front sight. The thin ring minimizes the occlusion of the target, while the thicker front post makes it easy to find quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Arkyd-3 was a 3U CubeSat {{technology}} demonstrator from private company Planetary Resources (PRI).

50|$|ASTN (Automatic Switched Transport Network) allows traffic {{paths to}} be set up through a {{switched}} network automatically. The term ASTN replaces the term ASON (Automatically Switched Optical Network) and is often used interchangeably with GMPLS (Generalized MPLS). This is not completely correct as GMPLS is a family of protocols, but ASON/ASTN is an optical/transport network architecture. The requirements of the ASON/ASTN architecture can be satisfied using GMPLS protocols developed by the IETF or by GMPLS protocols that have been modified by the ITU. Furthermore, the GMPLS protocols are applicable to optical and <b>non-optical</b> (e.g., packet and frame) networks, and can be used in transport or client networks. Thus, GMPLS is a wider concept than ASTN.|$|E
50|$|The {{drawback}} {{of interference}} lithography {{is that it}} is limited to patterning arrayed features or uniformly distributed aperiodic patterns only. Hence, for drawing arbitrarily shaped patterns, other photolithography techniques are required. In addition, for electron interference lithography <b>non-optical</b> effects, such as secondary electrons from ionizing radiation or photoacid generation and diffusion, cannot be avoided with interference lithography. For instance, the secondary electron range is roughly indicated by the width of carbon contamination (~20 nm) at the surface induced by a focused (2 nm) electron beam. This indicates that the lithographic patterning of 20 nm half-pitch features or smaller will be significantly affected by factors other than the interference pattern, such as the cleanliness of the vacuum.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Bell test experiments, if there are sources of error (that are not {{accounted}} for by the experimentalists) that might be of enough importance to explain why a particular experiment gives results in favor of quantum entanglement as opposed to local realism, they are called loopholes. Here some examples of existing and hypothetical experimental errors are explained. There are of course sources of error in all physical experiments. Whether or not any of those presented here have been found important enough to be called loopholes, in general or because of possible mistakes by the performers of some known experiment found in literature, is discussed in the subsequent sections. There are also <b>non-optical</b> Bell test experiments, which are not discussed here.|$|E
50|$|Watch towers are {{observation}} towers, {{on which}} persons supervise a larger area. Strictly speaking, control towers also {{fall into this}} category, although surveillance from these structures is mostly done in a <b>non-optical</b> way using Radar. Watch towers usually have a closed pulpit to protect the observer against bad weather. Watch towers {{do not have an}} elevator as a rule, since these buildings are mostly not higher than 20 metres. Active watch towers are not as a rule accessible to the public, since they usually serve for the monitoring of sensitive ranges. However watch towers can be quite ordered for forest fire monitoring a platform accessible for the public or be used during times without forest fire risk as observation towers. Shut down watch towers can however be easily converted to observation towers.|$|E

50|$|Under ideal {{circumstances}} most detection {{techniques can}} be considered theoretically as interferometers and, as such, their ultimate sensitivities are all roughly equal. This is because, in all these techniques, interferometry is used to linearize the detection transfer function and when linearized, maximum sensitivity is achieved. Under these conditions, photon shot noise dominates the sensitivity and this is fundamental to all the optical detection techniques. However,the ultimate limit {{is determined by the}} phonon shot noise. Since the phonon frequency is many orders of magnitude lower than the photon frequency, the ultimate sensitivity of ultrasonic detection can be muchhigher. The usual method for increasing the sensitivity of optical detection is to use more optical power. However, the shot noise limited SNR is proportional to the square root of the total detection power. Thus, increasing optical power has limited effect, and damaging power levels are easily reached before achieving an adequate SNR.Consequently, optical detection frequent has lower SNR than <b>non-optical</b> contacting techniques. Optical generation (at least in the firmly thermodynamic regime) is proportional to the optical power used and itis generally more efficient to improve the generation rather than the detection (again the limit is the damage threshold).|$|E
