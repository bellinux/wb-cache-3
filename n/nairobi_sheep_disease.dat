40|$|Studies on arboviruses {{carried out}} between 1984 - 1990 at the University of Peradeniya are {{summarized}} here. The isolation of <b>Nairobi</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> virus, Getah, Batai and Arkonam and serological {{evidence of the}} circulation of California encephalitis serogroup and Chandipura viruses have been reported {{for the first time}} in Sri Lanka. The ecology of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in areas with epidemic disease and sylvatic infection has been compared. A synchronous pattern of seroconversion in pigs and seroprevalence in cattle are more predictive of epidemic JE risk than overall porcine seroprevalence which is a good indicator of the presence of sylvatic JE rather than of human epidemic risk. Relatively modest changes in vector abundance associated with rainfall or agricultural practices have dramatic changes on the emergence of epidemic JE. Chandipura virus which is known to cause major outbreaks of encephalitis in India is endemic in Sri Lanka as are viruses belonging to the California encephalitis serogroup. Both these viruses are potential causes of human encephalitis and should be sought in patients with undiagnosed encephalitis. <b>Nairobi</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> virus is endemic in animals (especially goats) and infects humans working closely with such livestock.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever in South Africa patients were encountered who had been bitten by ticks, but who lacked evidence of infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus or non-viral tick-borne agents. Cattle sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine whether tick-borne viruses other than CCHF occur in the country. The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905 / 2116 (42. 8 %) for CCHF virus, 70 / 1358 (5. 2 %) for Dugbe, 21 / 1358 (1. 5 %) for louping ill, 6 / 450 (1. 3 %) for West Nile, 7 / 1358 (0. 5 %) for <b>Nairobi</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>disease,</b> 3 / 625 (0. 5 %) for Kadam and 2 / 450 (0. 4 %) for Chenuda.

Cross-reactivity for the nairoviruses, Hazara, <b>Nairobi</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> and Dugbe, was detected in serum samples from 3 / 72 human patients with confirmed CCHF infection, and serum from 1 / 162 other patients reacted monospecifically with Dugbe antigen.

40|$|Introduction: The Omics {{sciences}} {{are part}} of the research and diagnostic routines in human health. However, their application in veterinary sciences is still sparse, albeit the increasing number of proteomics studies published, especially regarding farm animals. The amount of information accumulated by these high throughput techniques, makes the existence of specialized databases fundamental. These databases are essential to store, annotate and make available to the scientific community, all the information gathered by the different omics studies, so that researchers can use it to understand the physio pathological mechanisms underlying <b>sheep</b> <b>diseases,</b> as well as to develop new and improved diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Objetive: The aim of this work is to present the OvisOme database and to demosntrate how {{it can be used to}} understand the molecular mechanisms urderlying <b>sheep</b> <b>disease.</b> Methodologies: OvisOme compiles all proteins identified by proteomics studies of Ovis aries. The proteins are annotated as to the sample characterization, the proteomics techniques used and all the data the authors refer regarding the donor sheep’s health. Results: The database currently has 1451 proteins, associated to 8 diseases and 10 breeds. When compared to other proteomics databases, the OvisOme stores and displays more information than other databases not specific for sheep, such as UniProt.

40|$|<b>Nairobi</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>disease</b> virus (NSDV; {{also called}} Ganjam virus in India) is a {{bunyavirus}} {{of the genus}} Nairovirus. It causes a haemorrhagic gastroenteritis in sheep and goats with mortality up to 90 %. The virus {{is closely related to}} the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrha-gic fever virus (CCHFV). Little is currently known about the biology of NSDV. We have gen-erated specific antibodies against the virus nucleocapsid protein (N) and polymerase (L) and used these to characterise NSDV in infected cells and to study its distribution during in-fection in a natural host. Due to its large size and the presence of a papain-like protease (the OTU-like domain) {{it has been suggested that}} the L protein of nairoviruses undergoes an autoproteolytic cleavage into polymerase and one or more accessory proteins. Specific antibodies which recognise either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the NSDV L protein showed no evidence of L protein cleavage in NSDV-infected cells. Using the specific anti-N and anti-L antibodies, it was found that these viral proteins do not fully colocalise in infected cells; the N protein accumulated near the Golgi at early stages of infection while the L pro-tein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, further supporting the multifunctional natur...|$|E

A flavivirus, an orbivirus, a phlebovirus, and a nairovirus were isolated from these ticks and partial sequences obtained. The flavivirus was nearly identical to Gadgets Gully virus, isolated some 30 year previously, illustrating the remarkable genetic stability of this virus. The nearest relative to the orbivirus (for which we propose the name Sandy Bay virus) was the Scottish Broadhaven virus, and provided only the second available sequences from the Great Island orbivirus serogroup.
