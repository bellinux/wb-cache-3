5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it {{made it hard to}} find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front of}} County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

25|$|Although the DG had {{based his}} {{decision}} on evidence, he had misdirected himself as to <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> and effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> required to prove <b>the</b> export <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goods. While the DG had {{prima facie evidence}} to show that the goods had not been exported, the applicant had submitted his own evidence to rebut this finding. <b>The</b> <b>nature</b> and effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> was to nullify the factual basis upon which the DG had made his decision. It was sufficient that <b>the</b> applicant's <b>evidence</b> had such an effect, and the DG, in failing to recognize this while placing undue weight on his own evidence, had misdirected himself as to <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> and effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> required to prove <b>the</b> export <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goods.|$|R
25|$|With so much {{evidence}} expunged first by Neferneferuaten's successor, then the entire Amarna period by Horemheb {{and later in}} earnest by the kings of the 19th Dynasty, the exact details of events may never be known.

The various steles, for instance, strongly suggest a female coregent but offer nothing conclusive as to her identity.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that during the Bronze Age, Proto-Celtic started fragmenting into distinct languages, including Celtiberian and Gaulish. As {{a result of the}} expansion of Celtic tribes during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, closely related varieties of Celtic came to be spoken in a vast arc extending from present-day Britain and France through the Alpine region and Pannonia in central Europe, and into parts of the Balkans and Anatolia. Their precise linguistic relationships are uncertain because of the fragmentary <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E

These conclusions have been accepted, adopted and ratified by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatry Association, the American Pediatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America and the National Association of Social Workers. As a result, based on the robust <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> available in the field, this Court is satisfied that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise; the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of six days, the court heard a {{succession}} of witnesses piecing together the complicated story of how Thomas had met her death. Webster had attempted before the trial to implicate the publican John Church and her former neighbour Porter, but both men had solid alibis and were cleared of any involvement in the murder. She pleaded not guilty and her defence sought to emphasise the circumstantial <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> and highlighted her devotion to her son as a reason why {{she could not have}} been capable of the murder. However, Webster's public unpopularity, impassive demeanour and scanty defence counted strongly against her.|$|E
500|$|An {{effect of}} the Civil War and {{resulting}} Commonwealth of England, particularly the [...] "liberal" [...] values and feelings it stirred up, was the continuous modernisation and improvement of the common law courts, something that reduced the interference of the Lord Chancellor in common law matters, except in areas where they had wildly divergent principles and law. Under Charles II, for the first time, there was a type of common law appeal where the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> in the initial trial was taken into account, which reduced the {{need to go to}} the Court of Chancery. As a result, the nature of the Court of Chancery changed; rather than being a major corrective system for the common law, it became primarily concerned with the administration and protection of rights, as opposed to the common law courts, which were mainly concerned with the remedy and retribution of problems. This was further enforced by the Statute of Frauds, which confirmed Chancery principles across the board, allowing people to receive the same treatment in the common law courts as they did in the Chancery.|$|E
500|$|The {{geographer}} Thomas Krabacher of the University of California {{undertook a}} review of The Man-Eating Myth for the journal Human Ecology. Believing that a critical study of cannibal claims has been long needed, he was nevertheless perturbed that Arens' work failed to be either comprehensive or objective. Although concurring that reports of cannibalism have been all too readily accepted without being properly scrutinized, Krabacher nonetheless argues that he has used a [...] "careless and selective" [...] approach to the literary sources. He also sees problems in Arens' approach to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> stating that the anthropologist has not given sufficient thought to what would constitute reliable testimony {{in the case of}} cannibalism. Drawing comparisons with sexual behaviour, he notes that it would not always be possible for a western anthropologist to directly view cannibalism, which would likely be hidden from their view by many practitioners, and that as such, second-hand accounts would have to do. He then critiques Arens' writing style, believing it to be [...] "contentious and possibly offensive", and highlighting a number of typological errors.|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} reevaluate {{existing}} scholarship {{on the late}} Roman “bishop’s hearing” or “bishop’s court” via a reexamination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extant legal <b>evidence.</b> Paying {{particular attention to the}} original contexts in which the relevant fourth- and early fifth-century imperial constitutions were issued, it argues that, prior to <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Theodosian Code in 438, these constitutions should be understood as specific responses to circumstances thrown up by courtroom practice. Having reassessed <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal <b>evidence</b> both before and after <b>the</b> promulgation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Theodosian Code, the article attempts to re-contextualize the episcopalis audientia within a broader late Roman socio-legal landscape, hence challenging <b>the</b> traditional framing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debate on the episcopalis audientia as a question of “church” and “state. ...|$|R

2500|$|Historian David Henige {{has argued}} that many {{population}} figures {{are the result of}} arbitrary formulas selectively applied to numbers from unreliable historical sources.

He characterizes the modern trend of high estimates as [...] "pseudo-scientific number-crunching." [...] Henige does not advocate a low population estimate, but argues that the scanty and unreliable <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> renders broad estimates inevitably suspect, saying [...] "high counters" [...] (as he calls them) have been particularly flagrant in their misuse of sources.

2500|$|After having {{refused to}} answer {{questions}} {{on the grounds of}} self-incrimination, Castle apologised to the court and was granted protection from prosecution by Justice McClellan, before being compelled to answer questions relating to the fraudulent email. The judge ordered that Hanson's legal costs of more than $150,000 be paid by the State of New South Wales – a move which outraged Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham, who would have been replaced by Hanson had her challenge been successful. Questioning whether Hanson's legal action should have gone ahead at all given the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> Buckingham said that [...] "This lack of judgement shows that she's unfit for public office." [...] Earlier, the judge, Justice McClellan, said Hanson had no other remedy but to take legal action after receiving the fraudulent email.|$|E

The resulting [...] "Report to the Governor in the Matter of Sacco and Vanzetti" [...] detailed grounds for doubting that the trial was conducted fairly in the first instance, and argued as well that such doubts were only reinforced by [...] "later-discovered or later-disclosed evidence." [...] The Report questioned prejudicial cross-examination that the trial judge allowed, the judge's hostility, the fragmentary <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> and eyewitness testimony that came to light after the trial. It found the judge's charge to the jury troubling for the way it emphasized the defendants' behavior at the time of their arrest and highlighted certain physical evidence that was later called into question. The Report also dismissed the argument that the trial had been subject to judicial review, noting that [...] "the system for reviewing murder cases at the time...failed to provide the safeguards now present." ...|$|E
