They had no knowledge that she was standing in the path of the tractor. An autopsy of Corrie's body revealed that the cause of death was from falling debris and not from the tractor physically rolling over her.

[...] An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics. Joel Coen replied: [...] "Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but that question is independent of whether or not we're interested in them – and we're not." [...] The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota Fortunae and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about Karma.|$|E

500|$|In 1754, he {{was elected}} {{a fellow of the}} Society of Antiquaries but by 1760 he was happily married and {{resigned}} his fellowship because [...] "my circumstances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly thought my happiness would have been permanent, and that I <b>never</b> <b>should</b> have been called again from my retirement to amuse myself in town, or to be of use to the society." [...] When his financial circumstances later improved, he became a patron and collector. He amassed a considerable collection of works of art, many of which had been commissioned and which were selected for their scientific interest rather than their connoisseur value. He had several works by Nicholas Pocock representing topographical landforms, mostly in Wales, and others by the artist Peter Paillou, probably commissioned, representing different climate types. His portrait by Thomas Gainsborough shows him as a country gentleman. Also included in the [...] "Pennant Collection", housed at the National Library of Wales, are many watercolours by Moses Griffiths and John Ingleby, and some drawings by Pennant himself.|$|E

[...] Some Israeli supporters said that Clinton <b>never</b> <b>should</b> have kissed the wife of the Palestinian leader, especially after such inflammatory remarks. The following day, Clinton denounced Suha Arafat's allegations, and said that Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat had told her Suha Arafat had been referring to 'tear gas' and not 'poison gas'. The kiss became a campaign issue, especially with Jewish voters. [...] Clinton said it as a formality akin to a handshake, saying that to not have done so would have caused a diplomatic incident. [...] Clinton later wrote that the live Arabic-to-English translation had failed to convey the accurate nature of her remarks: [...] "Had I been aware of her hateful words, I would have denounced them on the spot." ...|$|E
500|$|Nelson's {{response}} was to express agreement with Murray that such situations could occur, but reminded him that on whatever he [...] might be called, or whatever measure he might be directed to carry into execution, he <b>never</b> <b>should</b> forget the intimacy which subsisted between them; and even, should anything go contrary to his wishes, he would wave the rank of admiral, and explain, or expostulate with him, as his friend, Murray. Murray then accepted the post, and remained with Nelson as his captain of the fleet during the blockade of Toulon between 1803 and 1805, and the subsequent chase of Villeneuve and his fleet to the West Indies and back in 1805. He had been promoted to rear-admiral on 23 April 1804, but declined to raise his flag {{so as to be}} able to continue on with Nelson. The fleet returned to England in August 1805, where Murray learnt that his father-in-law had died, leaving him as executor of his estates. While Nelson sailed to take up command of the fleet blockading Cadiz, Murray was compelled to remain in England and attend to family affairs. Nelson did not therefore have a captain of the fleet at Trafalgar, for as one biographer stated [...] "none but Murray would do".|$|E

500|$|With September nearly dead, Peter {{decides to}} use Walter's {{equipment}} {{to enter the}} Observer's mind to try to learn of Olivia's location. Within September's consciousness, Peter learns the Observers are {{a team of scientists}} from one possible future of humanity, having used technology to travel to the past to witness their own creation. September, however, disrupted events by attempting to observe the point where Peter's cure was discovered, and his disruption has since caused several unintended changes within the timeline, including the war between the two universes. Ultimately, this would lead to the birth of Henry, Peter's child with the parallel universe's Olivia, which September claimed <b>never</b> <b>should</b> have happened and will be a catalyst for disruption of future events. By Peter entering the Machine and altering the timeline, Henry also ceased to exist. September explains that Peter's reappearance may be a means to set things right, and insists he find a way to reunite his romance with his original Olivia. As the reality of September's mind breaks down and he claims [...] "they are coming", the Observer tells Peter to [...] "go home". [...] Peter is suddenly woken up in the lab, September's body goes into convulsions and vanishes.|$|E
500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted {{to make my own}} director's cut. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I <b>never</b> <b>should</b> have shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross. Roger Ebert [...] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ...
