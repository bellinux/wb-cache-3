40|$|Introduction. Digital {{libraries}} play a {{vital role}} in providing more appropriate information in less time with ease of access. A digital library is more near to user’s minds, and paves a bridge between the sea of information and users needs. We explored the new sources and media of information. Material in different formats i. e. audio, video, image etc. especially in CDs are more important to understand medical information. <b>Non-book</b> <b>material</b> i. e. reports, conference papers, introductory material etc. are also very useful to cope with latest developments in the medical field. New services are evaluated by the users of AKU Library by conducting a Users survey; so that the users must be competent in their ability at the point of service to distill data into useful information to access growing information in different formats and to meet the ever increasing patient care needs. As the result of the survey, we could strengthen the systems and services; and the library users will also know and access required information and there is no need to waste time and money both in visiting other libraries to acquire needed information. Objective: The objective of this paper is to discuss the developments in repository, User Interface and Operational systems of the library and its impact on the users. Methodology and Procedural Detail: The purpose of paper is to share the expanding designed models, new developmental practices and their evaluation at AKU library’s services for the digital library. Repository Tier: Two types of repository 1) Store the information about the software agents such as programs and the symbols and identifications of data formats. 2) Store the full text data of library holdings such as audio, video, image, text and further links separately in a server, from the CDs and other recourses. In <b>non-Book</b> <b>material</b> such as the citation of reports, introductory material, conference papers, dissertations etc…by using Informix and SQL server databases running under UNIX and Windows respectively. User Interface Tier: two major types of user interface module are designed according to the search requirements of the users. 1) CD Library, it deals to retrieve data by author, title, keyword etc…form different formats of material such as audio, video, text, image etc…without opening and browsing any CD with the capability of running the full document by using Active Server Pages (ASP). 2) <b>Non-book</b> <b>material,</b> it deals with the documents which were under utilized before this system. By this new system all type of gray and fugitive material can be accessed. For non-book library a separate classification scheme is designed and applied successfully. A manual multi approaches storage and retrieval process system is designed to physically access the material by using different searching tools via material type, subject heading, organization and Call no. (SDI) Service - Operational Tier: In the system the software matches acquiring documents with the users preference and generate and send an email to the selected users. To run this Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) service Informix is using under UNIX. Conclusion: Three major digital services were initiated at Aga Khan University, FHS library during the year 2004, 1) CD library. 2) <b>Non-book</b> <b>material</b> and 3) SDI Service. After few months use of these new electronic services; a survey of library users was conducted. As the result of survey, we evaluated new services and collected statistics of increasing number of users of digital contents. Benefits for health practitioners, students and researchers, and some problems with suggestions are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{library is}} one of the forms of {{organization}} of learning resources that collects various information {{in the form of a}} book and other form (<b>non-book</b> <b>material)</b> that can be utilized by the user (faculty, students, and community) in an effort to develop their knowledge, ability and skill. Library itself is a resource center for learning. If related to teaching and learning in universities, libraries provide a very valuable contribution in the effort to increase the activity of students and improve the quality of education and teaching. Through the provision of libraries, students can interact and engage directly both physically and mentally in the learning process. Library is an integral part of the overall university programs, which together with other educational components also determine the success of the process of education and teaching. Use of the library as a trend in self-learning in higher education, must be supported by student interest in reading. Several attempts to do to improve student reading craze through the library are: 1) To provide students the literaturs they interested in; 2) Make the library as a fun place for students through a good arrangement, with a friendly service; 3) Make the promotion and development activities interests and passions read by using the library; 4) Provide additional tasks to students outside of the classroom.

Relevant literature {{on the need for}} management, preservation, importance, challenges and factors responsible for deterioration of this <b>non-book</b> <b>materials</b> as well as remedies, suggestion and/or recommendations for improvement was reviewed. The descriptive survey research design was adopted for this study. The study population consisted of one hundred and forty one (141) staff in the three selected university libraries. The population of the study consists of para-professionals and professionals librarian. Data were collected using questionnaire and interview. Data collected, were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques, frequency counts and percentages. The study provides answers to five research questions posed. The result of the study revealed that the three libraries recruited more male staff than their female counterpart. It was revealed that the three libraries lacked adequate preservation policy, security guards, photocopy services as well as inadequate funding. It was also revealed that dust and particles serves {{as one of the greatest}} problem to management and preservation of <b>non-book</b> <b>materials</b> in the three selected university libraries. Based on these findings, the following were recommended: provision of working preservation policy, provision of functional air-conditioner to regulate the temperature and humidity of the storage area, an alternative power supply should be provided to check the constant power failure currently being experienced in the three universities libraries, training and retraining of staff through seminars, workshops or short courses in management and preservation; adequate funding should be provided especially for preservation programmes.

40|$|The National Library of Australia holds a {{significant}} collection of material about East Timor, {{dating from the}} periods of Portuguese colonisation, Indonesian occupation and post-independence. This bibliography {{is an attempt to}} list all the National Library’s holdings on East Timor, including monographs, newspapers and <b>non-book</b> <b>material</b> (including maps, pictures, and ephemera), up to and including January 2009. The material was extracted from the catalogue using keyword searches such as “Timor ” in title, subject and place of publication. Unfortunately, {{we have not been able}} to include citations for journal articles at this stage. Some titles which referred to the whole island of Timor have been retained on this list as they may still be of relevance to some researchers. The material is arranged alphabetically by author, or by title where no main author is given. Hopefully future editions of this bibliography will be subdivided by subject to make research easier. It has not been possible to physically check every item listed, so there may well be some records included which despite their title have little relevance to East Timorese research. The authors request that readers of the bibliography bring them to their attention so that they can be removed from future editions. Works on East Timor are not housed separately, or within Asian Collections, but are integrated within the National Library’s overseas collections by format – i. e. East Timorese newspapers are held with the other overseas newspapers. Most items, with the exception of serials and newspapers, may be requested through interlibrary loan. The East Timor collection is a growing one, and it is intended to update this list regularly.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{longitudinal}} {{comparative study of}} card catalogue and OPAC of ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC) Library, it was sadly noted that despite automation and meticulously developing, updating and maintaining nine databases on OPAC, almost doubling the number of registered members, collection and use of documents over the same period, use of OPAC has not much increased compared to use of card catalogue. It is often speculated that there is substantial decline in general reading habit and use of libraries over a generation. Promoting the use of OPAC (and multiple databases on them) through user education/ orientation instruction programmes was felt again and again. After all, OPAC, like card catalogue, continue {{to be one of}} the many means by which users discover bibliographic references of their potential interest. Having faced such a situation, gearing up user education/ orientation programmes particularly to new users and younger generation is much desired. The purpose of user education is to make the end user searching as easy and as comfortable as possible, to minimise waiting time at the terminal and to avoid resorting to time consuming trial and error mode. Some of the new technologies are pretty easy to use but few can be effectively used without training. The need for training can be ascertained from the signs of novice users sitting in front of the terminal with lots of beeps, moving back and forth or from menu to menu and long periods of inactivity as well as the need expressed by users themselves. In addition to extensive one-to-one assistance by professional staff and flip charts, new user induction and orientation programmes have been launched with visual animated presentation as well as lecture and discussion. Regular user orientation entitled "Know your library" consists of lecture cum demonstration on using various services followed by a local tour in small groups and distribution of informative brochure “Know your library” and “library user manual”. In the introduction, the presentation highlights the necessity of consumption skills among users, levels of user education and types of information covered in the presentation, a brief look at significant information-behaviour of engineers, display of selected parts of classification scheme followed by the library and finally the digital content and the <b>non-book</b> <b>material</b> collection of the library. Keeping aside common self-explanatory aspects of OPAC, Digital Library and the Internet, the presentation focused on features generally not known to users. Feedbacks from earlier studies on card catalogue and OPAC were also kept in mind. A series of A 3 -size colour charts with tips for effective use of OPAC, Internet, Digital Library, on-line and other information services were periodically designed and displayed at important places...|$|E

Maps are information resources which can give detailed and strategic information about any part of the world differ from the other information resources. They have been used as widely as books in almost every age of the history. Maps have been drawn and used after discoveries, excursions, and especially military expeditions. Many countries, governments or managers ordered special maps for their countries and/or other countries and paid serious budgets for them. The most important characteristics distinguishing maps from other information resources are that they have many types and they can be used for many purposes. Different applications were developed for organizing them because of the variety of the information they contain. These characteristics of maps put forward that drawing and reading map necessitate a special education.
