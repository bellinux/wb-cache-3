30|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century and {{particularly}} {{from the time of the}} establishment of the modern Hellenic state (1832 A.D.), the importance of agriculture for the economy of the young Greek nation was vital (McGrew 1985). <b>Nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> developed with the continued existence of tsiflikia until the land reform of 1922. This system had been limiting the acreage of land open to cultivation and favoured the preservation of pastures and pastoralism, which were always associated with <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> (Gidarakou and Apostolopoulos 1995). However, establishment of the independent state affected central Greek pastoralism in several ways. The most immediate blow was due to the needs of the armies of the Greek irregulars and the mercenaries recruited by the Turks to suppress the revolution. Both sides resorted to the flocks of the local shepherds, who soon hired the services of mountaineer warriors like the Souliotes to protect them (Koliopoulos 1981).|$|R

50|$|In Kazakhstan {{where the}} major {{agricultural}} activity was <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding,</b> forced collectivization under Joseph Stalin's rule met with massive resistance and major losses and confiscation of livestock. Livestock in Kazakhstan fell from 7 million cattle to 1.6 million and from 22 million sheep to 1.7 million. The resulting famine of 1931-1934 caused some 1.5 million deaths: this {{represents more than}} 40% of the total Kazakh population at that time.|$|R

30|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it is worth}} noting that the ethnic {{minority}} areas account for more than half of the country’s territory. They are primarily plateaus, mountains, and grasslands. As a result, a great many ethnic minorities engaged in animal husbandry, while the Han peoples engaged primarily in agriculture, forming a different type of economy.

50|$|Extensive farming most {{commonly}} refers to sheep and cattle farming {{in areas with}} low agricultural productivity, but can also refer to large-scale growing of wheat, barley, cooking oils and other grain crops in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, yields per hectare are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean yields per unit of labour are high. <b>Nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional rainfalls.|$|R

5000|$|One {{explanation}} for this culture of leisure is the hot, dry climate of the peninsula which allowed <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> but permitted agriculture only in a small area (the southwest corner).

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> carried on with the same intensity as previously (Koliopoulos 1981). However, soon <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> suffered a fatal blow with the expropriation of the big estates (Gidarakou and Apostolopoulos 1995). As the modern Greek state solidified in territorial terms, it still had to face major problems of restructuring. Moreover, the rural population in Greece suddenly increased, with the arrival of approximately 1.5 million refugees from Asia Minor, after the resolution of the Greco-Turkish War and the Treaty of Lausanne in 1922, which led to a population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The wave of compulsory expropriations, which was dictated by the need to settle the landless (both locals and refugees) and the aim to achieve food autarkia (self-sufficiency), resulted in a sudden increase in cultivated land area, a sharp reduction in grazed areas and a revolution in cultivation methods and strategies. The winter grazing lands were reduced in size, and the herdsmen were forced to reduce the size of their flocks or even to give up animal keeping (Gidarakou and Apostolopoulos 1995). In several cases, just before expropriation, herdsmen bought parts or all of the tsiflikia land, which they previously used to rent for grazing, and shifted into arable farming. As a result of these events, a more sedentary system was established, wherein animals were kept in enclosures and supplemented with harvested feeds to increase their productivity.|$|R

50|$|Andean civilization {{probably}} began c. 7600 BCE. Based in {{the highlands}} of Peru, an area now called the punas, the ancestors of the Incas probably began as a <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> people. Adaptation to the altitude led to distinctive physical developments. Short and stocky, men averaged 1.57 m (5'2") and women 1.45 m (4'9"). Compared to other humans, the Incas had slower heart rates, almost one-third larger lung capacity, about 2 L (4 pints) more blood volume and double the amount of hemoglobin, which transfers oxygen from the lungs {{to the rest of}} the body.

25|$|Pastoralism {{involves}} managing domesticated animals. In <b>nomadic</b> pastoralism, <b>herds</b> {{of livestock}} are moved {{from place to}} place in search of pasture, fodder, and water.

30|$|As a nomadic {{traditional}} feeding management practice, {{there were}} no minerals, vitamins, pro-vitamins or GMOs for animal feed. Nomad sheep and goat breeds {{were considered to be}} robust, adapted to the environment and disease-tolerant livestock. In the nomadic system, no animal cruelty practices such as tail ducking, dehorning and tethering were allowed. To keep ruminants in groups to meet their social needs, nomad families stayed and kept animals together to support each other in different livestock activities, including shepherding, feeding, milking and health care. Due to natural breeding in <b>nomadic</b> <b>herds,</b> the male breeding stock was kept and grazed separately from does during the breeding season. Nomadic livestock products, i.e. meat, milk, wool, could be labelled organic after making local studies, surveillance, regulation and certification.|$|R
50|$|Cultures {{that rely}} on <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding,</b> where the {{livestock}} may be moved around to greener pastures freely, survive much better in arid regions than cultures that have permanent settlements {{that are based on}} subsistence farming techniques.

Rather, it is much more believable and logical to conclude that the members of the Cucuteni-Trypillia society that were facing starvation by farming their dry and barren plots of depleted soil chose instead to take up the practice of their neighbors, and became pastoralists.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{industrial}} revolution, Norway's economy was largely based on agriculture, timber, and fishing. Norwegians typically lived under conditions of considerable scarcity, though famine was rare. Except for certain fertile areas in Hedemarken and Østfold, crops were limited to hardy grains, such as oats, rye, and barley; and livestock to sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and some poultry; in places this was complemented with hunting. In areas of Central and Northern Norway, the Sami subsisted on the <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding</b> of reindeer. Fishing all around the coast was dangerous work, though fish such as herring, cod, halibut, and other cold-water species were found in abundance. The introduction of the potato to Norway (in the 18th century) provided considerable relief for Norwegians.|$|R
50|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} reindeer were independently domesticated in Fennoscandia and Western Russia (and possibly Eastern Russia). Reindeer have been herded for centuries by several Arctic and Subarctic people including the Sami and the Nenets. They are raised for their meat, hides, and antlers and, {{to a lesser}} extent, for milk and transportation. Reindeer are not considered fully domesticated, as they generally roam free on pasture grounds. In traditional <b>nomadic</b> <b>herding,</b> reindeer herders migrate with their herds between coast and inland areas according to an annual migration route and herds are keenly tended. However, reindeer were not bred in captivity, though they were tamed for milking {{as well as for}} use as draught animals or beasts of burden. Domesticated reindeer are shorter-legged and heavier than their wild counterparts.|$|R
