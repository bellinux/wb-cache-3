40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} analyse {{the impact of}} {{different}} public policies on inequality, unemployment, growth and the tax burden. Design/methodology/approach – A dynamic general equilibrium model is built, in which growth is driven by endogenous technical progress, to analyse the impacts of several policies (minimum wage, redistribution and R&D subsidies financed by an income tax). Findings – All policies except pure redistribution are better than non-intervention in terms of growth. The authors distinguish three major policy patterns. The Anglo-Saxon model is characterised by high growth, high inequality, low unemployment and a low tax burden. The <b>Nordic</b> model <b>combines</b> high growth, low inequality and low unemployment, and a high tax burden. The Continental European model puts together medium inequality and a medium tax burden, and higher long-term growth is paid for by high unemployment. Research limitations/implications – The model could be extended {{by the introduction of}} educational policy. Originality/value – The paper distinguishes three configurations that capture the main features of the developments in Anglo-Saxon countries, Scandinavian countries, and Continental European countries in the 1990 s. It thereby provides a general framework to analyse and compare these experiences. Economic growth, Pay, Research and development, Subsidies, Unemployment...|$|R
40|$|Family {{policies}} in the Nordic countries gain international attention. 1 An important {{reason for this is}} that they appear to produce good results: the <b>Nordic</b> countries <b>combine</b> comparatively high levels of fertility with high female employment rates and low rates of child poverty. Feminists, anti-poverty activists, and social liberals generally tend to look to the Nordic countries with curiosity and admiration (Lister, 2009). Recently it has also been argued that the Nordic countries not only produce social equality and high levels of living, but also enact active policies targeted at families that enhance productivity and lay the foundation for economic success (e. g. Esping-Andersen, 2002). Such policies simultaneously encourage women to work outside the home, and create good conditions for children’s early education. Working mothers improve economic efficiency, broaden the tax base, and improve household income, thus reducing child poverty. It is hoped that early childhood education will create more equal life chances for children and secure a productive labour force for the future (cf. Esping-Andersen, 2002; Morel, Palier, & Palme, 2012). Whether viewed from the perspective of gender equality, child welfare, or social investment, then, Nordic family policies appear to have some very useful features...|$|R

5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the <b>Nordic</b> <b>combined</b> format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km {{individual}} Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the <b>Nordic</b> <b>combined</b> mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E

40|$|The flow of Atlantic water {{across the}} Greenland-Scotland Ridge (Atlantic inflow) is {{critical}} for conditions in the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean by importing heat and salt. Here, we present a decade-long series of measurements from the Iceland-Faroe inflow branch (IF-inflow), which carries almost half the total Atlantic inflow. The observations show no significant trend in volume transport of Atlantic water, but temperature and salinity increased during the observational period. On shorter time scales, the observations show considerable variations but no statistically significant seasonal variation is observed and even weekly averaged transport values were consistently uni-directional from the Atlantic into the <b>Nordic</b> Seas. <b>Combining</b> transport time-series with sea level height from satellite altimetry and wind stress reveals that the force driving the IF-inflow across the topographic barrier of the Ridge is mainly generated by a pressure gradient that {{is due to a}} continuously maintained low sea level in the Southern Nordic Seas. This implies that the relative stability of the IF-inflow derives from the processes that lower the sea level by generating outflow from the Nordic Seas, especially the thermohaline processes that generate overflow. The IF-inflow is {{an important component of the}} system coupling the Arctic region to the North Atlantic through the thermohaline circulation, which has been predicted to weaken in the 21 st century.

The {{purposes of this study}} were to compare the radiation dose from quantitative fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine with lumbar spine radiographs, and identify opportunities for dose reduction in quantitative fluoroscopy. MethodsInternationally reported dose area product (DAP) and effective dose data for lumbar spine radiographs were compared with the same for quantitative fluoroscopy and with data from a local hospital for functional radiographs (weight bearing AP, lateral, and/or flexion and extension) (n =  27). The effects of procedure time, age, weight, height and body mass index on the fluoroscopy dose were determined by multiple linear regression using SPSS v 19 software (IBM Corp., Armonck, NY, USA). Results and conclusionThe effective dose (and therefore the estimated risk) for quantitative fluoroscopy is 0. 561  mSv which is lower than in most published data for lumbar spine radiography. The dose area product (DAP) for sagittal (flexion + extension) quantitative fluoroscopy is 3. 94  Gy cm 2 which is lower than local data for two view (flexion and extension) functional radiographs (4. 25  Gy cm 2), and combined coronal and sagittal dose from quantitative fluoroscopy (6. 13  Gy cm 2) is lower than for four view functional radiography (7. 34  Gy cm 2). Conversely DAP for coronal and sagittal quantitative fluoroscopy combined (6. 13  Gy cm 2) is higher than that published for both lumbar AP or lateral radiographs, with the exception of <b>Nordic</b> countries <b>combined</b> data.

5|$|The {{hill was}} {{scheduled}} to host two FIS Ski Jumping World Cup events in January 1991, {{but they had to}} be cancelled due to lack of snow. In 1993, the hills hosted a single large hill World Cup event.

Originally it consisted of a single competition in the large hill, but from 2010, a qualification run was introduced the day before the main event. The venue has hosted the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup four times, in 2000, 2002, 2010 and 2011. In February 2006, the venue hosted two FIS Cup competitions in the normal hill.

40|$|During the Last Interglacial (LIG; ~ 130 {{thousand}} years BP), {{part of the}} Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) melted {{under the influence of}} a warmer than present-day climate. However, the impact of this melting on the LIG climate in the North Atlantic region is unknown. Using the LOVECLIM earth system model of intermediate complexity we have systematically tested the sensitivity of the LIG climate to increased freshwater runoff from the GIS. Moreover, additional experiments have been performed to investigate the impact of an idealized reduction of both altitude and extent of the GIS on the LIG climate. By comparing the simulated deep ocean circulation with proxy-based reconstructions, the most realistic simulated climate could be discerned. The resulting climate is characterized by a shutdown of deep convection in the Labrador Sea and a subsequent cooling here by ~ 6 °C and ~ 2 °C over the southern part of Baffin Island and the North Atlantic Ocean between 40 ° N and 60 ° N. The reduction of altitude and extent of the GIS results in a local warming of up to 6 °C and a reduction in deep convection and accompanying cooling in the <b>Nordic</b> Seas. <b>Combining</b> model results and proxy-based reconstructions enabled us to constrain the possible melt rate of the GIS to a flux between 0. 052 Sv and 0. 13 Sv.
