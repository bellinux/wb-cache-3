Ultrasound and CT scan appear to be of equal value in respect of validity and significance of information on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings,</b> especially in connection with spaceoccupying processes, hydronephrosis and pyonephrosis. However, CT supplies a better anatomical and topographical overall view of the situation. 2.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Because of the {{contradictory}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> and methodological weaknesses identified within current human-companion animal bond research, {{there is a}} need to further explore the connection between human-animal bonds and mental health. DESIGN: The purpose of this survey questionnaire study was to explore the relationship of attachment to companion animal and human psychological distress after controlling for demographic variables, and to investigate whether the relationship between social supports and psychological distress would be moderated by attachment to a companion animal. RESULTS: Results highlight the psychological vulnerability of individuals reporting a strong bond with their companion animal. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for mental health services designed to anticipate and address client-related companion animal needs.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{standard}} statistical tests of OPEC behavior have very low power {{across a wide}} range of alternative hypotheses regarding market structure. Consequently, it is difficult, given the current availability and precision of data on demand and costs, to distinguish collusive from competitive behavior in the world oil market. This, along with other factors, may account for the largely inconclusive <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> so far reported in the empirical literature on OPEC. We apply a new approach for examining alternative hypotheses and find strong evidence of cooperative behavior among OPEC members. Our results also suggest that OPEC’s formal quota mechanism, introduced in 1982 to replace a system based on posted prices, increased transactions costs within the organization. We do not find strong evidence to support the view that Saudi Arabia has played the role of dominant producer within the cartel.

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} the potential effects of short-term treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) on both subjective and objective sleep characteristics in children aged 6 to 12 years (n = 24) with ADHD. Method: Polysom-nography (PSG) and actigraph measures {{as well as}} assessments of subjective sleep parameters were examined in children before and after treatment with either LDX or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, single-center, parallel-group study. Results: There was no statistically {{significant increase in the}} primary endpoint of latency to persistent sleep (LPS) for the LDX-treated group compared to the placebo group. Secondary PSG or actigraph results generally supported primary endpoint results. Subjective sleep measure results indicated the possibility that responses are influenced by sleep hygiene counseling before and throughout the study. Conclusions: In this pilot sleep study in children with ADHD, LDX did not appear to contribute to any sleep disturbances as measured by both objective and subjective sleep parameters. The sample used in this study was small, and the multifarious <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> in this study warranted that the study conclusions be interpreted cautiously and that further study is required focusing on the influence of LDX on sleep in larger samples o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{considered}} that annual chest x-ray (CXR) examination can {{be restricted to}} workers by age; however, adequate epidemiological evidence is needed regarding {{the difference in the}} effectiveness of CXR examination between younger and older age groups. This study attempted to estimate the prevalence of latent abnormalities (P) in the lung and the false negative rate (F) and false positive rate (G) of examinations among workers of different age groups. 112, 482 subjects who were screened for three consecutive years with no findings at the first screening, were selected. The proportion of positive findings at the second screening and the proportion of negative findings at the third screening were incorporated into a stochastic model, and 5 -yr-age-specific P, F, and G were estimated. P tended to increase with increasing age. F was 40 – 45 % in < 45 -yr-old subjects and was only 10 % in the older age groups. G showed a steady increase with increasing age. This study indicates that the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> differs between younger and older age groups, and this difference affects the accuracy of examination.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a study aimed at assessing the impact of the only recurring Asian library leadership institute on its participants. Design/methodology/approach – A review of the literature focussing on similar longitudinal studies was first conducted followed by a survey of past participants aimed at utilizing a self-evaluation approach. Findings – The study found it difficult to establish a conclusive cause and effect link between institute attendance and the subsequent changes in participants’ professional lives. Nevertheless the study provides compelling evidence that the institute has enhanced participants’ leadership skills, knowledge and insights and thus contributed directly or indirectly to changes in respect of their career progression, involvement in leadership activities and changes at their respective organizations. Research limitations/implications – Like other similar longitudinal studies on library leadership training, the inconclusive <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> suggests that further analysis of participants might be undertaken through a qualitative approach in the form of focus group interviews with the participants and over a time period less than the ten years used in the study. Practical implications – Survey respondents provided overwhelming support for the institute providing organizers with the motivation to continue to provide this opportunity to librarians in the Asia region. Originality/value – As the only Asian library leadership training of its kind, this study has delivered a unique set of data that provides perspectives that have not been previously documented.

A comprehensive survey on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> lost objects provides insights {{for the design of}} human-centered, object-finding services. A systematic analysis of the responses showed the importance of identifying object types, timescale of use, supporting situational factors (reasons for loss and strategies of recovery), and targeting an age-defined user population (user desire and degree of support) when building these services. These criteria motivate a checklist for systematically evaluating both existing and proposed lost object finding services...|$|R

By 1930, he claimed to have grown more than 10,000 seedlings. Some crosses, particularly early in the program, were by open pollination. Later, to select for specific characteristics, field workers would bag each cluster of cones before the female bines flowered, to protect them from wild pollination. They would then apply pollen from a selected male plant to the flower with a paint brush and reseal the bag. Once seeds had formed, the bags could be removed. The seeds would then be planted the following year and evaluation of the new cross could begin the year after that.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Because {{there is}} a lack of {{longitudinal}} research examining the impact of partner coping in couples experiencing infertility, we know very little about the long-term <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> coping with infertility and how partner coping strategies impact personal, marital and social distress. METHODS Participants were Danish men and women about to start a cycle of assisted reproduction treatment who were followed for a 5 year period of unsuccessful treatments. Multilevel modeling using the actor–partner interdependence model was used to examine the couple as the unit of analysis. RESULTS Active and passive avoidance coping strategies were significantly related to increased personal, marital and social distress at the individual and partner level. Meaning-based coping strategies were related to decreases in a woman’s individual distress and her partner’s marital distress. CONCLUSIONS Partner coping strategies have a significant impact on the other member of the couple over time in men and women undergoing infertility treatments over a 5 year period. Physicians and mental health professionals can educate men and women regarding the ineffectiveness of avoidance coping strategies as well as the beneficial <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> new meaning and life goals while experiencing the stress of infertility...|$|R

40|$|This article {{takes up}} {{biomedical}} {{and public health}} concerns about the difficulty of generalizing or extrapolating measurements of efficacy produced by the method of the randomized control trial (RCT) to wider populations. While explanations for the difficulty may be deduced from social studies of science that reveal the contingent and situated <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> trial <b>findings,</b> new conceptual tools are required {{to allow for the}} practical value associated with the possibility of their extrapolation. We argue that Alfred North Whitehead’s concept of 'abstraction' can provide an alternative appreciation of some key aspects of the processes of knowledge-production of RCTs to enable a recasting of the problem of generalization. By proposing that generalization depends on relevant abstractions, we direct attention to the situated forms of care that this calls for. After showing the conceptual difference that the process of abstraction makes for understanding and extrapolating the situated <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> a research <b>finding,</b> we offer an interpretation of possible forms of care at work in efforts to devise Ebola adaptive trials.
