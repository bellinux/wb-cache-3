40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} role of {{methylation}} of Human MutS homolog 2 (MSH 2) and Human runt-related transcription factor 3 genes (RUNX 3) in DNA prepared from <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> in early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods　The methylation-specific PCR was used to detect hypermethylation of MSH 2 and RUNX 3 genes in DNA prepared from <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> from 54 <b>nasopharyngeal</b> carcinoma patients, 18 chronic nasopharyngitis patients and 20 healthy volunteers. The specificity and sensitivity in early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by detecting MSH 2 and/or RUNX 3 gene methylation were evaluated. The relationship between methylation of MSH 2 or RUNX 3 gene and the biological behavior of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was analyzed. Results　Hypermethylation of MSH 2 and RUNX 3 gene was respectively detected in 38 out of 54 (70. 37 %) and in 28 out of 54 (51. 85 %) <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> obtained from <b>nasopharyngeal</b> carcinoma patients, while there was no methylation in <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> from 18 chronic nasopharyngitis patients and 20 healthy volunteers. The differences were statistically significant (P＜ 0. 001). The specificity and sensitivity in early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were respectively 100 % and 70. 37 % by detecting MSH 2 gene methylation, 100 % and 51. 85 % respectively by detecting RUNX 3 gene methylation in <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> from <b>nasopharyngeal</b> carcinoma patients determined by methylation-specific PCR, while parallel combined detection of MSH 2 and RUNX 3 gene methylation increased the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity up to 100 % and 90. 74 %, respectively. No close correlation was found between methylation of MSH 2 or RUNX 3 gene and the biological behavior of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients (P＞ 0. 05). Conclusions　Parallel combined testing of MSH 2 and RUNX 3 gene methylation in DNA prepared from <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> determined by methylation-specific PCR could increase the specificity and sensitivity in early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and is of important clinical significance.

40|$|AbstractDiagnosis of {{invasive}} pneumococcal disease is challenging. We compared Binax NOW pneumococcal urinary antigen test with blood pneumococcal PCR in healthy Malawian children {{with and without}} pneumococcal carriage, and we found a high false-positive rate with Binax NOW.

We speculate that <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabbing</b> may be causing a breach of mucosal integrity, leading to invasion into the bloodstream.

Here we validate quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays {{for the detection of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in: (a) spiked serum samples and (b) in matched serum and <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> from a population of Indigenous Australian children without pneumonia, but with a high nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
