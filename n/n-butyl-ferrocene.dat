40|$|Covalently grafted Kolliphor®EL (a poly-ethylene-glycol based "transporter molecule" for {{hydrophobic}} water-insoluble drugs; MW ca. 2486; diameter ca. 3 - 5 nm) at {{the surface}} of a glassy carbon electrode strongly affects the rate of electron transfer for aqueous redox systems such as Fe(CN) 63 -/ 4 -. XPS data confirm mono-layer grafting after electrochemical anodisation in pure Kolliphor®EL. Based on voltammetry and impedance measurements, the charge transfer process for the Fe(CN) 63 -/ 4 - probe molecule is completely blocked after Kolliphor®EL grafting {{and in the absence of}} a "guest". However, in the presence of low concentrations of suitable ferrocene derivatives as "guests", mediated electron transfer across the mono-layer via a "shuttle mechanism" is observed. The resulting amplification of the ferrocene electroanalytical signal is investigated systematically and compared for 5 ferrocene derivatives. The low concentration electron shuttle efficiency decreases in the sequence dimethylaminomethyl-ferrocene > <b>n-butyl-ferrocene</b> > ferrocene-dimethanol > ferrocene-acetonitrile > ferrocene-acetic acid...|$|E
