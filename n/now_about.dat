5|$|Following {{his failure}} at Fredericksburg, Burnside was reassigned to the Department of the Ohio. The IX Corps, {{which he had}} {{formerly}} commanded, was reassigned with him. The 21st Massachusetts boarded trains for Cincinnati on March 28, 1863. They were then transported to Mount Sterling, Kentucky, to combat Confederate guerrillas. In April, due to the reduced numbers of the regiment (<b>now</b> <b>about</b> 200) several officers, being effectively without commands, chose to resign their commissions, including Col. William S. Clark. Command of the regiment passed to Lt. Col. George P. Hawkes.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} <b>now</b> <b>about</b> 1800 botanical gardens and arboreta in about 150 {{countries}} (mostly in temperate regions) of which about 550 are in Europe (150 {{of which are}} in Russia), 200 in North America, and an increasing number in East Asia. These gardens attract about 150 million visitors a year, so {{it is hardly surprising that}} many people gained their first exciting introduction to the wonders of the plant world in a botanical garden.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by <b>now</b> <b>about</b> 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.|$|E

5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is <b>now</b> <b>about</b> 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{became the}} first Liberal to be elected {{councillor}} for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1856. He was mayor of the council from 1857 to 1860 and retired from local politics in 1874 due to conflict with his own party. Mason returned to the Liberals in 1878 when he stood for election as Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne. He was voted in and supported progressive policies, which included women's suffrage, making him unpopular within his own party. He was MP from 1880 to 1885. When he died in 1886, aged 69, Hugh Mason had amassed £290,933 (<b>now</b> <b>about</b> £17million).|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{constructed}} following World War I {{in order to}} provide improved access to the ports at Avonmouth Docks, which had replaced Bristol Harbour as the major local centre for commercial shipping. Upon opening on 2 July 1926, it was the single most expensive road project in Britain, costing £800,000 (<b>now</b> <b>about</b> £ million). The construction posed a number of significant engineering challenges, including long and deep rock cuttings, a viaduct over the River Trym, and retaining walls against the gorge adjacent to the River Avon. Falling rocks have since been a problem along the Portway, particularly at the southern end close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, with concrete canopies constructed to prevent loose rock and assist with remedial work.|$|E

5|$|Up till now, the Muslim {{army had}} adopted a largely {{defensive}} strategy, but {{knowing that the}} Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now {{decided to take the}} offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All the cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total strength of this cavalry group was <b>now</b> <b>about</b> 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, Wadi-ur-Ruqqad at west, Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry.|$|E

Mammals include a large raccoon population, coyotes, skunks, beavers, rabbits descended from discarded pets, and a thriving grey squirrel population (descended from eight pairs acquired from New York's Central Park in 1909). However, there is a complete absence of large mammals including deer, elk, bear, wolves, cougars, and bobcats.|$|E
