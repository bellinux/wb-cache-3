40|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>crops</b> of widely spaced pioneer {{trees are}} a {{silvicultural}} approach {{to protect the}} regeneration of frost sensitive target tree species. If overstorey <b>nurse</b> <b>crops</b> are harvested, they can provide additional short-term benefits through increased biomass production, e. g., for bioenergy. However, the intensification of biomass exports from forests might impact negatively on ecosystem nutrient pools. Thus, precise allometric biomass equations are required to quantify biomass and nutrient removals. Since an analysis of published allometric equations developed for typical, dense aspen or birch forests showed that the tree height-to-diameter ratio correlated positively {{and the proportion of}} branch biomass negatively with stand density, we developed new allometric biomass equations for widely spaced aspen and birch growing at 4 x 4 m spacing. These equations yielded a root mean squared error of 13 % when predicting total aboveground woody biomass for our sample trees. In contrast, the corresponding root mean squared error produced by allometric biomass equations from the literature ranged between 17 % to 106 % of actual dry biomass. Our results show that specific allometric biomass equations are needed for widely spaced pioneer trees both for accurate estimates of biomass and the nutrients contained within...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{creation}} and restoration schemes on former agricultural soils can be constrained by high residual soil fertility, a weedy seed bank, {{and a lack}} of suitable species in the seed rain. Topsoil inversion has been trialled across the United Kingdom as a novel technique to address these constraints. We investigated 15 topsoil inversion sites ranging in age (time since inversion) from 6 months to 5 years. We assessed surface soil fertility compared to adjacent noninverted soil, and vegetation composition with respect to the species introduced at each site. Soil organic matter, total and extractable N and P were lower in topsoil inversion surface soils, demonstrating that topsoil inversion can successfully reduce surface soil fertility prior to habitat {{creation and}} restoration. This reduction was maintained over the timescale of this study (5 years). Cornfield annual <b>nurse</b> <b>crops</b> provided instant visual appeal and gave way to grassland species over time. Sown species varied widely in their establishment success, and sowings were more successful than plug plantings. Grasses colonized naturally following sowing forb-only seed mixes, allowing introduced forbs to establish early on with reduced competition from the seed bank.

40|$|Agronomic {{differences}} between endophyte- (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan Jones and Gams) free and endophyte-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) exist, {{and should be}} considered when implementing a management strategy. Although dry matter yield of tall fescue does not generally appear {{to be influenced by}} endophyte infection status, endophyte infection has been shown to improve seedling performance and survival, is associated with insect and nematode resistance, drought resistance, improved nitrogen assimilation, and higher seed set. Considering all biologically valuable characters of the endophyte-tall fescue relationship, survival of endophyte-infected tall fescue is probably better than that of endophyte-free tall fescue, especially in drought- or heat-stressed environments. Despite problems which growers have reported in establishing stand; of endophyte-free tall fescue varieties, there is still a decided advantage to seeding endophyte-free tall fescue because of improved livestock performance. However, greater attention to management is needed, particularly during the establishment year. Good seedbed preparation, including fertility improvements, should be stressed for endophyte-free tall fescue. Since endophyte-free tall fescue seedlings are not as vigorous as endophyte-infected tall fescue seedlings, using other grasses as <b>nurse</b> <b>crops,</b> or seeding with clovers, is not recommended when establishing new stands. Environmental or imposed stress on newly established endophyte-free tall fescue stands should be avoided by selecting optimum planting dates, and limiting livestock access.

40|$|Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon R. Br.) is a {{high-quality}} appearance-grade timber species native to eastern Australia. Wide variation in its survival, growth and form, together with {{issues related to}} site selection and intensive silvicultural management, limit progress in its domestication and commercial development. To {{determine the effect of}} genetics on these traits, five blackwood progeny trials in northern Tasmania, Australia, aged between 15 and 19 years were assessed. All trials contained a variety of open-pollinated, single-tree, family collections from Tasmania, with one trial containing a selection of provenances from mainland Australia. Significant genetic variation in survival, growth and form were found. This variation was partly explained by broad scale adaptive differences across the wide geographic distribution of blackwood. Blackwood from the tropical northern range of the species had poor survival in cool temperate Tasmania. Significant differences in survival between Tasmanian seedlots were also observed. Among the Tasmanian seedlots, those from low altitudes grew better than those from high altitudes, while those from the north-east of Tasmania had significantly better growth rates than seedlots from the south-east. Seedlots from the north-west seed zone had intermediate growth rates. Significant genetic differences in the proportion of trees with single stems, and the number of large branches in the lower stem were found between Tasmanian seedlots. Early-age seedlot height was significantly positively correlated with mid-age diameter. Stem form was improved under <b>nurse</b> <b>crops,</b> but even open-grown blackwood had low percentages of trees of excellent form.

After 8 years these stands were thinned and under-planted with Hopea odorata, Dipterocarpus alatus, Parashorea chinensis, Tarrietia javanica, Parashorea stellata, Scaphium lychnophorum, Peltophorum dasyrhachis var. tonkinensis and other high-value native species.

40|$|It {{is often}} a {{challenge}} to successfully establish perennial pastures which in turn determines the production potential and persistence thereof. Three perennial subtropical grass species commonly cultivated in South Africa are Eragrostis curvula (var. Ermelo), Digitaria eriantha (var. Irene) and Chloris gayana (var. Katambora). The secret of successful planted pastures lies in the execution of good seed- and soil preparation techniques; {{also referred to as}} pre-establishment techniques. These techniques include: seed conditioning by coating seed with either conventional coating or a coating that contains Mycortex, that differs in only adding mycorhizza; adjusting the seeding rates recommended by industry which potentially causes intra-species competition (competition between plants of the same species); planting an annual <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> with a perennial species which potentially causes inter-species competition (competition between plants of different species); and controlling seedbed qualities before planting and consolidating the seedbed after planting. There were four experiments conducted (Randomized Block Design) in a controlled environment of a Phytotron. In these experiments the growth factors like water, temperature and soil variance were controlled. It must be kept in mind that conclusions made from data obtained in these experiments cannot be extrapolated to field conditions. Digitaria eriantha and C. gayana were only assessed in two small experiments as uncoated and coated (conventionally- and Mycortex coated) seed. Eragrostis curvula was measured in two experiments as uncoated and conventionally coated seed and was also evaluated at different seeding rates, planted with and without an annual <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> (Eragrostis tef) and where seedbed consolidation was done after planting. The treatments were replicated between three and six times in the four experiments. It was found that coated seed does not significantly improve establishment of any of the test species. Adapting the E. curvula seeding rate had no significant effect because of the favourable environment created. Consolidating the seedbed caused a lower emergence and yield of E. curvula {{as a result of an}} anaerobic condition being generated around the seed. The <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> planted with E. curvula caused an increased yield in the first season. Pre-establishment techniques applied as treatments in these controlled experiments were not as effective as hypothesized in a controlled environment. There were three field experiments conducted (Randomized Block Design) in uncontrolled environments. Establishment success of test species were evaluated as a response to variable seeding rate treatments, of uncoated and conventionally coated seed; additionally, D. eriantha and C. gayana Mycortex coated seed was also used. The establishment success of the perennial test species was also measured as being influenced by an annual <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> (Eragrostis tef). The experiment included the evaluation of establishment success of E. curvula where seedbed quality was controlled through preparation techniques; rotavating before planting and consolidating the seedbed after planting. It was concluded that a higher seeding rate gives a better first season plant density. However, in season two, the optimum plant density was reached for E. curvula and C. gayana and there were no differences between seeding rate treatments. This was as a result of intra-species competition in season one, resulting in plants out-competing one another. The creeping growth characteristics of C. gayana also contributed to this result. One of the main functions of the <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> planted with a perennial grass species is to create a more “favourable” competition as opposed to aggressive competition from weeds. The establishment success of perennial species was lower, where nurse crops were included as a result of inter-species competition. From the second season data it can be seen that D. eriantha and C. gayana did not have lower plant densities where a <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> was planted, whereas E. curvula still had lower plant densities. All species had a significantly higher pasture density in season one where uncoated seed was used due to a higher number of seed planted at the same seeding rates on a weight basis. Nevertheless, in season two, the E. curvula and C. gayana plant densities showed no significant differences between the seed conditioning treatments. This is attributed to the small seed size and shape of E. curvula and the creeping growth characteristics of C. gayana. Controlling the seedbed quality was found to be unsuccessful for E. curvula. The field experiment results highlight the interactive effects between seed coatings, seeding rates and <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> treatments as a function of selected species. The insignificant results obtained from the controlled environment study support the original hypothesis that favourable growing conditions reduce the functions of pre-establishment techniques during the facilitated establishment of sown pasture seed. The significant results from the unfavourable field study support the original hypothesis that adjusting the seeding rates and the use of a <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> does have significant effects on the establishment success of the perennial species. It also confirms that conditioning of seed by using coating substances does have significant effects on the establishment success of the perennial species. Controlling the seedbed quality does not have significant effects where pastures are irrigated until establishment.

40|$|Australian {{blackwood}} (Acacia melanoxylon R. Br.) is {{a high-quality}} appearance-grade timber species native to eastern Australia and {{renowned for its}} rich heartwood colour. It is grown in plantations in Australia and other countries but with mixed results. This {{is due in part}} to variable survival, growth, stem form and wood properties, including heartwood colour. The aim of this project was to determine the potential for genetic improvement of these traits by examining their environmental and genetic control. A review of available genetic resources showed that extensive native population provenance and family seed collections have been made with over 60 progeny trials established in both Australia and overseas. However, there are few published papers, particularly on wood properties. Six family/provenance trials were identified as suitable for use in this project. These mainly contained open-pollinated families from Tasmania. Significant environmental (i. e. trial) and genetic variation in survival, growth, and form were found, with greater genetic variation between families within seed zones than between seed zones. Several mainland provenances were included in some trials and showed that blackwood from tropical Queensland was poorly adapted to survive in cool temperate Tasmania. Narrow-sense heritabilities for early age growth and form were significant, but moderate to low respectively. There were no significant genetic correlations between growth and form traits. Wood properties were measured using stem cores on a sub-sample of 16 Tasmanian families across three 19 year-old trials growing at two sites. One site contained two spatially intermixed trials, with and without a Eucalyptus globulus <b>nurse</b> <b>crop.</b> Significant genetic, environmental and genetic by environmental interactions were 13 found for most wood properties, including heartwood colour. The presence of a <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> improved tree form but had an adverse effect on growth and wood colour.

In addition to its use for this purpose it is sown in lawns as a <b>nurse</b> <b>crop.</b> Alfalfa is cultivated only to a limited extent in Iowa; the area thus devoted is not ascertainable, but is small. The demand for alfalfa seed is continually increasing, largely because of the success attending its cultivation in suitable soils and locations. This success has induced a large number of farmers to try it in an experimental way...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the large}} {{interest}} {{there is in}} Sweden for alternative use of land set aside {{and the production of}} renewable fuels this study was carried out to evaluate the suitability of reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and a ley of red clover (Trifolium pratense) and timothy grass (Phleum pratense) as energy crops. The typical production systems for each crop was established, a set of assumptions were also agreed upon and all inputs and outputs were identified, quantified and expressed in MJ/ha. Reed canary grass was to last ten years and the harvest is done in the spring. A four year rotation was established for the ley with barley as a <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> in the first year. As outputs of the ley system the following were considered: barley grain, barley straw, biogas and nitrogen in the digesters residues which were assumed spread on the field. As parameters of efficiency Net Energy Gain (N. E. G) and the output/input ratio were calculated. The main results showed a N. E. G of 56 417 MJ/ha and year and an output/input ratio of 7. 4 for the reed canary grass; biogas production from the ley gave a N. E. G of 53 000 MJ/ha and year and an output/input ratio of 2. 9...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} based on several {{long-term}} experiments of crop fertilization at three Iowa locations: Howard County, with Clyde and Cresco soils; Hancock County, with acid and calcareous Webster soils; and Wayne County, with Seymour soil. The trials at these widely separated experimental farms included corn and oats fertilized in a 3 -year rotation of corn-oats-meadow. The periods of the trials were: Clyde and Cresco soils, 1945 - 1960; Webster soils, 1954 - 1960; Seymour soil, 1949 - 60. Although meadow was not fertilized, residual nutrients from fertilization of the oats <b>nurse</b> <b>crop</b> were expected to affect hay yield. Applied nutrients included only phosphorus and potassium. The objectives of the analysis were: (a) to estimate annual production functions for each crop and compare them with average production functions estimated from the several years of data for the same crops, locations and soil types; (b) to analyze the variability or degree of uncertainty involved in such physical and economic relationships as isoquants, isoclines and profit-maximizing nutrient inputs; (c) to estimate weather indexes and their quantitative relationship to fertilizer response; (d) to estimate generalized production functions that incorporate weather, soil nutrients, location and soil into the production function along with the quantities of K and P applied annually...|$|E
