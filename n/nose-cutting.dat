Press reports attributed the violence to the Pashtun tradition that a dishonored husband "lost his nose. " This equation of <b>nose-cutting</b> with tradition begs questions {{not only about the}} Orientalist lens of the western press when viewing Afghanistan, but also about the assumption that the word "medieval" can function as a label for such practices. A study of medieval <b>nose-cutting</b> suggests that its identification as an "eastern" practice should be challenged.

50|$|Natesan is {{frequently}} visited {{by an old}} 'Mental' like looking old man who demands money from Natesan {{most of the time}} with any reason. Natesan is irritated by his acts and yet he supports him with the money. The old man is actually a scientist who has invented many things. Natesan gets angry that old man cheated him once and visits his home and surprised to see all inventions. The old man explains that he is inventing a machine which makes people invisible. He also shows him a receiver which can receive abnormal frequencies powerful enough to intrude Indian defence. Natesan hears an intrusion that a famous scientist shall be killed by some people. So he rushes to police station to warn them. The scientist is saved because of his warning. Hence he earns enmity of Raja Bhupathy as he is behind the master plan of killing the scientist. Bhupathy's men sets off to find the receiver in Natesan's house and find that the receiver is with the old man. The old scientist finally invents 'invisible' making machine. But he is killed by Bhupathy's men. Before dying he handovers the machine to Natesan and tells him to fight for justice in the country with this. Natesan and one of his child test the machine and sees it work. Hence Natesan uses the machine and becomes invisible. He once saves Meenakshi from Bhupathy's men when she tried to find their truth and got trapped. The invisible man introduces himself as 'Vaathiyaar' (nickname of Thiru M.G.R.) who has come back to world to fight justice. Soon Natesan gains fame as invisible Vaathiyaar due to his good deeds for society. Since he does good things and does not trouble public and government, police does not arrest him. The child who is the only person to know about Natesan's invisibility finds that the invisible man can be seen through 'Red' colour and he wears red glasses. Meenakshi is very proud that she is friend of 'Vaathiyaar' and tells everybody she is his pet. This irritates Natesan and once <b>nose-cuts</b> her in front of everybody to teach her a lesson. Natesan's inferiority complex prevents him to propose his love for Meenakshi and he expresses his love to her as 'Vaathiyaar' hoping that she would love the hero. But Meenakshi rejects his proposal as she reveals that she loves a poor auto driver who is gentle man and tells Invisible Man to go out of her life. Natesan reveals his secret to her and is very happy to have won her love.|$|R
