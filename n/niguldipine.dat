40|$|The {{effect of}} both isomers of <b>niguldipine,</b> a highly {{selective}} alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist and dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, on noradrenaline-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) potentiation was examined. Both isomers inhibited noradrenaline-stimulated IP accumulation. (+) -Niguldipine was 100 fold more potent than (-) -niguldipine. Potentiation of beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated cyclic AMP by noradrenaline was only partially inhibited by both isomers. The dihydropyridine, israpidine, did not inhibit either second messenger response.

Whole-cell and single-channel patch-clamp recording were used to compare five Ca 2 channel antagonists {{with respect to their}} potency as inhibitors of native bTREK- 1 K channels. The dihydropyridine (DHP) Ca 2 channel antagonists amlodipine and <b>niguldipine</b> potently and specifically inhibited bTREK- 1 with IC 50 values of 0. 43 and 0. 75 M, respectively. The other Ca 2 channel antagonists, including the DHP nifedipine, the diphenyldiperazine flunarizine, and the cannabinoid anandam-ide were less potent, with IC 50 values of 8. 18, 2. 48, and 5. 07 M, respectively.

This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effect of a series of newly synthesized 1, 4 -dihydropyridines and pyridines, designed as potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors, on BCRP-mediated drug efflux both in vitro and in vivo. The effects of 25 synthesized dihydropyridines and corresponding pyridines along with 4 commercially available dihydropyridines (<b>niguldipine,</b> nicar-dipine, nifedipine, and nitrendipine) on the intracellular accumula-tion of the BCRP substrate mitoxantrone were evaluated in BCRP-expressing human breast cancer MCF- 7 /MX 100 and human non-small cell lung cancer H 460 /MX 20 cells. At a 2. 5 M concentration, 24 of 25 newly synthesized dihydropyridines and pyridines pro-duced a significant increase of mitoxantrone accumulation in both cell lines.

40|$|Individual {{response}} to small-molecule drugs is variable; {{a drug that}} provides a cure for some may confer no therapeutic benefit or trigger an adverse reaction in others. To begin to understand such differences systematically, we treated 104 genotyped segregants from a cross between two yeast strains {{with a collection of}} 100 diverse small molecules. We used linkage analysis to identify 124 distinct linkages between genetic markers and {{response to}} 83 compounds. The linked markers clustered at eight genomic locations, or quantitative-trait locus 'hotspots', that contain one or more polymorphisms that affect response to multiple small molecules. We also experimentally verified that a deficiency in leucine biosynthesis caused by a deletion of LEU 2 underlies sensitivity to <b>niguldipine,</b> which is structurally related to therapeutic calcium channel blockers, and that a natural coding-region polymorphism in the inorganic phosphate transporter PHO 84 underlies sensitivity to two polychlorinated phenols that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. Our results provide a step toward a systematic understanding of small-molecule drug action in genetically distinct individuals...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Simple, {{sensitive}} and rapid spectrophotometric methods were {{developed for the}} determination of Niguldi-pine in pharmaceutical formulations. Method A {{was based on the}} extractive spectrophotometry and the devel-oped color complex due to the formation ion association complex with Bromothymol blue (BTB) at pH 3. 7. The formation of a yellow color solution exhibited maximum absorption at wavelength 380 nm. Method B was based on the yellow color formation due to ion association complex between methyl orange (MO) and <b>Niguldipine</b> at PH 3. 7 that exhibited maximum absorption at a wave length of 430 nm. Both ion association complexes were extracted into chloroform and Beer’s law was obeyed over the concentration ranges 4 - 25 µgml- 1 and 2 - 12 µgml- 1 for methods A and B respectively. Both the methods have been successfully applied for the assay of the drug in pharmaceutical formulations. No interference was observed from common pharmaceutical adjuvants. The reliability and the performance of the proposed methods were established by point and interval hypothesis tests through recovery studies...|$|E
40|$|The ideal {{antiepileptic}} drug (AED) should {{correct the}} aberrant pathophysiology of epileptogenesis without interfering with normal neurotransmission A {{new group of}} drugs with antiepileptic efficacy, without sedative properties, would be an exciting prospect. Theoretical considerations and results from experimental animal models of epilepsy have put forward the possibility that calcium (Ca 2 +) antagonists may form such a group. The initiation of epileptogenic activity in the neuron {{is thought to be}} connected with the phenomenon known as “intrinsic burst firing”, which is activated by an inward Ca 2 + current. Ca 2 + is described as the primary mediator of “excitotoxic” neuronal damage. Both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is associated with Ca 2 + entry into the cells during status epilepticus. The Ca 2 + channel blockers depressed epileptic depolarizations of neurons. In this review, we present anticonvulsant effects of cinnarizine, flunarizine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nicardipine, amlodipine, isradipine, <b>niguldipine,</b> diltiazem, verapamil and dantrolene in animal models of seizures. Also, a detailed analysis of interactions between Ca 2 + blockers and AEDs was performed. Clinical trials in intractable epilepsy support to a certain degree antiepileptic properties of Ca 2 + antagonists...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors involved in the contraction induced by rilmenidine in isolated canine cutaneous veins. Rings of saphenous vein (without endothelium) were suspended for the recording of isometric force in physiological salt solution. All experiments {{were performed}} {{in the presence of}} propranolol (to antagonize beta-adrenoceptors), cocaine (to inhibit neuronal uptake) and hydrocortisone (to inhibit extraneuronal uptake). In the presence of rauwolscina (an alpha 2 -adrenegic blocker), rilmenidine caused concentration-dependent contractions which were inhibited by prazosin (nonselective alpha 1 -antagonist) and by (+) <b>niguldipine</b> (selective alpha(1 A) -adrenergic antagonist), but not by (-) nigurdipine. After treatment with phenoxybenzamine (to alkylate alpha 1 -adrenoceptors), rilmenidine evoked contractions of the canine saphenous vein which were antagonized competitively by rauwolscine. The combination of rauwolscine and prazosin did not abolish contractions evoked by the highest concentrations of rilmenidine. Although binding experiments using 3 H-idazoxan suggested the existence of a nonadrenergic binding site (around 20 % of the total binding), contractile studies failed to demonstrate their involvement in the increases in tension evoked by rilmenidine. These experiments suggest that the contractions evoked by rilmenidine in isolated canine veins are mediated by both alpha(1 A) - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is caused}} by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel gene. CF mutations like DeltaF 508 cause both a mistrafficking of the protein and a gating defect. Other mutations, like G 551 D, cause only a gating defect. Our aim was to find chemical compounds able to stimulate the activity of CFTR mutant proteins by screening a library containing approved drugs. Two thousands compounds were tested on Fisher rat thyroid cells co-expressing DeltaF 508 -CFTR and a halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) after correction of the trafficking defect by low-temperature incubation. The YFP-based screening allowed {{the identification of the}} anti-hypertensive 1, 4 -dihydropyridines (DHPs) nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, isradipine, nitrendipine, felodipine and <b>niguldipine</b> as compounds able to activate DeltaF 508 -CFTR. This effect was not derived from the inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels, the pharmacological target of anti-hypertensive DHPs. Indeed, methyl- 1, 4 -dihydro- 2, 6 -dimethyl- 3 -nitro- 4 - 2 (trifluoromethylphenyl) pyridine- 5 -carboxilate (BayK- 8644), a DHP that is effective as an activator of such channels, also stimulate CFTR activity. DHPs were also effective on the G 551 D-CFTR mutant by inducing a 16 - to 45 -fold increase of the CFTRT Cl- currents. DHP activity was confirmed in airway epithelial cells from patients with CF. DHPs may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents able to correct the defect caused by a set of CF mutations...|$|E
40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme is {{a common}} form of brain tumor that leads to {{debilitating}} effects despite the current regiment of treatment, which includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. With the discovery of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) that exists within the bulk tumor, some light has been shed on this disease. GICs {{have been shown to}} be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, therefore providing a plausible explanation for the high propensity for recurrence in patients. However, effective treatments are still unavailable, and there is an urgency to discover drugs that can eradicate this group of cells. The overall aim of this thesis is to identify drugs from small molecule screens that can kill GICs, as well as to understand the possible causes and mechanisms for drug sensitivity. In Paper I, we have identified a new small molecule, Vacquinol- 1, that reduced the viability and growth of GICs, both in vitro and in vivo, and had little effects on normal cells such as fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells. Cell death was caused by an unconventional nonapoptotic manner, where the cells showed massive accumulation of vacuoles that formed through macropinocytosis. This led to the impairment of cell function followed by cell death. Furthermore, treatment with Vacquinol- 1 also exhibited excellent improvement in survival of glioma xenografted mice. Using an shRNA screen, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK 4), which is involved in stress response, was determined to play a role in the unique type of cell death. In Paper II, we have identified that GICs are particularly sensitive to perturbations in calcium (Ca 2 +) homeostasis, with the relative degree of sensitivity being linked to their degree of stemness. The two compounds employed in this study, Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitor Thapsigargin, are wellknown compounds that elicit cell death. However, the compounds affected viability to a different degree in the various GIC lines, with the line that is more similar to neural stem cells being more sensitive to perturbations in Ca 2 + homeostasis. This sensitivity was correlated to expression levels of different Ca 2 + related proteins such as GRIA 1 and S 100 A 6, as well as to Nestin (NES). In Paper III, we have repositioned <b>Niguldipine,</b> an old anti-hypertensive drug, as a potential compound for targeting GICs. Through an ion channel drug screen, we have also observed that GICs exhibit sensitivity to Ca 2 + modulators, suggesting once again that Ca 2 + homeostasis is critical to cell viability in GICs. <b>Niguldipine,</b> which is also a Ca 2 + channel inhibitor, also showed a selection for GICs as compared to normal cells such as fibroblasts and neural stem cells. At the effective dose, the compound showed no effects on cardiac rhythmicity, and administration of the drug resulted in a significant improvement in the survival of glioma xenografted mice. In conclusion, we have identified a few small molecules, both old and new, that can reduce the proliferation and viability of GICs without affecting that of normal cells. One of the mechanisms underlying selectivity is that GICs show a greater degree of sensitivity to disturbances in Ca 2 + homeostasis, therefore suggesting that Ca 2 + modulators should be screened for their potential in cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|It is {{not known}} whether tepal {{senescence}} in Iris flowers is regulated by hormones. We applied hormones and hormone inhibitors to cut flowers and isolated tepals of Iris x hollandica cv. Blue Magic. Treatments with ethylene or ethylene antagonists indicated lack of ethylene involvement. Auxins or auxin inhibitors also did not change the time to senescence. Abscisic acid (ABA) hastened senescence, but an inhibitor of ABA synthesis (norflurazon) had no effect. Gibberellic acid (GA 3) slightly delayed senescence in some experiments, but in other experiments it was without effect, and gibberellin inhibitors [ancymidol or 4 -hydroxy- 5 -isopropyl- 2 -methylphenyltrimethyl ammonium chloride- 1 -piperidine carboxylate (AMO- 1618) ] were ineffective as well. Salicylic acid (SA) also had no effect. Ethylene, auxins, GA 3 and SA affected flower opening, therefore did reach the flower cells. Jasmonates delayed senescence by about 2. 0 days. Similarly, cytokinins delayed senescence by about 1. 52. 0 days. Antagonists of the phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathway (lithium), calcium channels (<b>niguldipine</b> and verapamil), calmodulin action [fluphenazine, trifluoroperazine, phenoxybenzamide and N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphtalenesulfonamide hydrochloride (W- 7) ] or protein kinase activity [1 -(5 -isoquinolinesulfonyl) - 2 -methylpiperazine hydrochloride (H- 7), N-[2 -(methylamino) ethyl]- 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride (H- 8) and N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride (H- 9) ] {{had no effect on}} senescence, indicating no role of a few common signal transduction pathways relating to hormone effects on senescence. The results indicate that tepal senescence in Iris cv. Blue Magic is not regulated by endogenous ethylene, auxin, gibberellins or SA. A role of ABA can at present not be excluded. The data suggest the hypothesis that cytokinins and jasmonates are among the natural regulators...|$|E
