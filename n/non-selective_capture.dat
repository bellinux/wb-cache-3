Amphisbaenians (Aulura anomala Barbour, 1914; Leposternon polystegumn [Duméril, 1951] and Amphisbaena sp.), which are highly specialized for a fossorial life, accounted for 81. 25 % of the recorded items, followed by snakes - Anilius scytale (Linnaeus, 1758), and Tantilla melanocephala (Linnaeus, 1758) : 12. 5 % - and caecilians - Caecilia cf. gracilis Shaw, 1802 : 6. 25 %. We found a positive, although not significant, relationship between the snout-vent length of A. scytale and the total length of the prey and a tendency for smaller specimens to ingest proportionately larger prey. Anilius scytale forages mainly on the ground, at night, {{as well as in}} aquatic environments. The <b>non-selective</b> <b>capture</b> of either proportionately large or small prey by A. scytale may reflect the opportunistic nature of the encounters. A tendency of the juveniles of this species to ingest proportionately larger prey may be associated with either a low availability of prey with a size compatible to that of the juveniles, or with their inexperience in selecting prey. Ingestion of prey headfirst may be an attempt to minimize the risk of injury the prey could cause through their rigid, pointed and sharp structures or powerful bites...|$|E

Eradicate or reduce the population of exotic/opportunistic species which threaten desirable native species, habitats, and ecological relationships. Prevent the introduction of additional exotic species. Galveston Bay wildlife and fisheries populations have tremendous value in ecological, economic, and social, terms. Galveston Bay contributes one-third of the state's commercial fishing income and over one-half of the state's recreational fishing expenditures. There is a tradition in natural resource management {{to focus on the}} management of single species. This is true of fisheries management even though fishing methods are often <b>non-selective</b> and <b>capture</b> many species. It is especially true of the approach to management of threatened and endangered species, despite the requirement in the ESA that habitat conservation plans be developed for every listed species.

40|$|The large {{mangrove}} crab Ucides cordatus (“caranguejo-uçá”) {{is a key}} fisheries {{resource in}} Brazil, critical for the sustenance of livelihoods {{of thousands of people}} in coastal rural areas. Today's crab populations suffer from habitat degradation, disease, and increasing fishing pressure. Crabs are sold alive on local and regional markets, or traded as processed meat and the market chains typically involve intermediaries (i. e. traders). The presentstudy examined the relationship between crab harvesters and the intermediaries, and the socio-ecological implications thereof. The research was performed between September 2013 and October 2014 in the Mamanguape River estuary, northeastern Brazil. Socioeconomic information and data regarding the catch (sex and carapace width of the crabs), the processing of U. cordatus meat and the commercial relationship between harvesters and intermediaries were obtained through structured (questionnaires) and semi-structured interviews and direct observations. The crab harvesters exist under precarious socioeconomic conditions that place them at the edge of society and therefore often seek loans offered by the intermediaries, generating loyalty and dependencethat guarantees the intermediaries a stable supply of crabs needed to supply an avid market. Within this relationship, the intermediaries create pressure on natural crab populations by stimulating <b>non-selective</b> <b>captures,</b> as they buy specimens below the legal size limit (6 cm wide carapace) for meat processing. During crab meat processing, the intermediaries themselves report that the meat is often mixed with cooked and shredded of other marine vertebrates, such as spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) and nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum), to increase the weight of the final product. As with the crab harvesters, the women involved in processing the crabmeat often accept loans, resulting in the same type of dependence and loyalty to the intermediaries. The intermediaries, with their strong influence on the crab harvesting, are directly linked to the commercial, social and ecological implications of these harvesting activities, together with the crab harvesters themselves. Hence, to ensure sustainability of the U. cordatus fishery and maintain (better improve) dependant livelihoods, all actors involved in the production chain of U. cordatus must be considered when developing management strategies, rather than the current approach of considering the crab harvesters only. We advise the development and implementationof fisheries associations to give the crab harvesters (and regulating bodies) greater control over and capital gains from their catches...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRadiotherapy is {{essential}} for the treatment of oral cancer, especially in advanced cases. There has been marked progress in this field due to the prevalence of intensity-modified radiation therapy and introduction of particle radiotherapy using protons and carbon-ions. However, these treatments are still <b>non-selective.</b> Boron neutron <b>capture</b> therapy (BNCT) is a unique modality in which neutron beams destroy only boron compound-bearing tumor cells while leaving the surrounding normal tissues intact. Thus, BNCT is a selective form of radiotherapy, if high tumor/normal tissue ratio in boron concentration could be achieved. The principle of BNCT, and the basic study of the mechanism by which BNCT exerts antitumor effects using oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells and oral SCC xenografts in mice are described...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Catch share {{management}} {{is a common}} and increasingly relied upon form of fisheries management in which, frequently, shares of a hard total allowable catch are allocated to individuals or groups of harvesters. A style of rights-based-management, catch shares are often thought to promote efficient resource use and long-term stewardship, improving both economic and ecological conditions within the fishery. Their success in multispecies fisheries, where <b>non-selective</b> gear <b>captures</b> several, separately managed stocks, {{has been the subject}} of ongoing debate however. Limited flexibility in production might dampen or entirely remove any and all of catch shares' potential benefits as harvesters are unable to effectively target or avoid individual stocks. In this dissertation, I explore the economic effects of multispecies catch shares following a 2010 application to New England groundfish, a diverse and overexploited multispecies fishery. In the first chapter, I combine market models of ex-vessel inverse demand and counterfactual models of individual harvesting behavior to estimate the market timing benefits of catch share management. I find that fleet revenues were improved by over US $ 30 million and that individual benefits were heterogeneously distributed, with large and more diverse operations better able to take advantage of market externalities. In the second chapter, I theoretically develop and empirically explore a model of costly avoidance wherein production of target stocks is given up to reduce that of the avoided. An error in the management of pollock, initially setting a low and constraining allocation that was later relaxed, is used to identify behavioral response to multispecies production constraint, finding harvesters engaged in costly avoidance strategy, which had the low pollock allocation persisted, would have cost the fleet US $ 3 million. I then develop a neoclassical multispecies production technology in the third chapter which is used to test technological restrictions of strong disposability on pairs of demersal species and also estimate the costs, in terms of forgone production, of pollock avoidance. For catch share regulated species, strong disposability is rejected more than half the time, suggesting output controls may frequently lead to choked production. Additionally, pollock avoidance costs are estimated at US $ 6 million...|$|R
