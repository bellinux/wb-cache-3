50|$|March 3, 1974: A Douglas DC-7C/F (EI-AWG) {{operating}} an Aer Turas Teo {{charter flight}} from Dublin landed at Luton Airport on runway 08 {{just after midnight}} but failed to achieve reverse thrust. <b>Normal</b> <b>braking</b> <b>application</b> also was ineffective and the emergency pneumatic brakes were applied. All main wheel tires burst. The aircraft overran the runway and continued over the steep bank at the eastern perimeter finally coming to rest in soft ground 90 metres beyond. The situation had also been made worse by an inadvertent application of forward thrust by the crew in trying to achieve reverse thrust. Three of the six passengers {{and two of the}} four crew were injured. The aircraft was badly damaged and deemed a write-off.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} {{brake rotors}} {{are made with}} cast iron. Besides having economical advantage, cast iron rotor provides many disadvantages due to its weight, such as reduction in fuel efficiency, increase in green house gas emission, and increase in noise, vibration and hardness. With the development of commercial aluminum composites, composite brake rotors are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property. In this paper, the unique properties offered by an aluminum composite for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is addressed, and an approach to compensate its properties for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is highlighted...|$|R

The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction.

5000|$|On a long {{train the}} brake force during a <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> was not {{consistent}} {{along the length}} of the train; the response to the driver’s operation of the brake valve varied according to train length and the variation caused longitudinal surging.|$|R
5000|$|... for {{the same}} reason, on a very long train, a {{considerable}} volume of air has {{to be admitted to}} the train pipe to make a full <b>brake</b> <b>application,</b> and a considerable volume has to be exhausted to release the brake (if for example a signal at danger is suddenly lowered and the driver requires to resume speed); while the air is traveling along the train pipe, the brake pistons {{at the head of the}} train have responded to the <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> or release, but those at the tail will respond much later, leading to undesirable longitudinal forces in the train.

40|$|This {{proof-of-concept}} {{research was}} performed to explore the feasibility of using real-world braking data from commercial motor vehicles to make a diagnosis of brake condition {{similar to that of}} the performance-based brake tester (PBBT). This was done by determining the relationship between pressure and brake force (P-BF), compensating for the gross vehicle weight (GVW). The nature of this P-BF relationship (e. g., low braking force for a given <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure) may indicate brake system problems. In order to determine the relationship between brake force and <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure, a few key parameters of duty cycle information were collected. Because braking events are often brief, spanning only a few seconds, a sample rate of 10 Hz was needed. The algorithm under development required <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure and speed (from which deceleration was calculated). Accurate weight estimation was also needed to properly derive the braking force from the deceleration. In order to ensure that braking force was the predominant factor in deceleration for the segments of data used in analysis, the data was screened for grade as well. Also, the analysis needed to be based on pressures above the crack pressure. The crack pressure is the pressure below which the individual brakes are not applied due the nature of the mechanical system. This value, which may vary somewhat from one wheel end to another, is approximately 10 psi. Therefore, only pressures 15 psi and above were used in the analysis. The Department of Energy s Medium Truck Duty Cycle research has indicated that under the real-world circumstances of the test vehicle brake pressures of up to approximately 30 psi can be expected. Several different types of data were collected during the testing task of this project. Constant-pressure stopping tests were conducted at several combinations of <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure (15, 20, 25, and 30 psi), load conditions (moderately and fully laden), and speeds (20 and 30 mph). Data was collected at 10 Hz. Standard and stepped-pressure performance-based brake tests with brake pressure transducers were performed for each loading condition. The stepped-pressure test included the constant-pressure intervals of <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> at 15, 20, 25, and 30 psi. The PBBT data files included 10 Hz streaming data collected during the testing of each axle. Two weeks of real-world duty cycle (driving and braking) data was also collected at 10 Hz. Initial analysis of the data revealed that the data collected in the field (i. e., day-to-day operations) provided the same information as that obtained from the controlled tests. Analysis of the data collected revealed a strong linear relationship between <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure and deceleration for given GVWs. As anticipated, initial speed was not found to be a significant factor in the deceleration-pressure relationship, unlike GVW. The positive results obtained from this proof of concept test point to the need for further research to expand this concept. A second phase should include testing over a wider range of speeds and include medium <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressures in addition to the low pressures tested in this research. Testing on multiple vehicles would also be of value. This future phase should involve testing to determine how degradation of braking performance affects the pressure-deceleration relationship...|$|R
40|$|In the past, wear at {{the disc}} and pads {{interface}} of disc brakes {{has rarely been}} accounted for in a 3 -dimensional finite element (FE) model for studying brake squeal. Thus, its effect on disc brake squeal is only possible to investigate through experimental methods. In the present paper, wear over time at the pads interface is simulated using a modified wear rate formula. Confirmation of the proposed wear formula is made against experimental results. The surface topographies of two brand new pairs of brake pads are measured. The contact tests using pressure-indicating films are carried out in order to capture static pressure distributions. The same brake pads are tested under several <b>braking</b> <b>applications.</b> For each <b>braking</b> <b>application,</b> the static contact pressure distribution is measured. The results are used to compare with the simulated results predicted by the FE model. To do so, the detailed 3 - dimensional finite element model of a real disc brake is developed and validated through appropriate analyses. The paper also investigates squeal generation in the above <b>braking</b> <b>applications</b> using complex eigenvalue analysis that is available in a commercial software package. The predicted results are then compared to the squeal events observed in the experiments...|$|R
