North Korea mounted a large offensive in August, simultaneously attacking all four entries into the perimeter.

25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out 'How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues {{he ought to have}} by the year from the shire.' Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though I may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>single</b> hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ.

500|$|Several decades later, in 1912, Episcopal Bishop Franklin S. Spalding sent {{copies of}} the three facsimiles to eight Egyptologists and semitists, soliciting their {{interpretation}} of the facsimiles; the results were published in a pamphlet entitled, Joseph Smith, Jr. as a Translator: An Inquiry. The eight scholars recognized the facsimiles as portions of ordinary funerary documents, and some harshly condemned Smith's interpretation. Egyptologist James H. Breasted of the University of Chicago noted: [...] "hese three facsimiles of Egyptian documents in the 'Pearl of Great Price' depict the most common objects in the Mortuary religion of Egypt. Joseph Smith’s interpretations of {{them as part of}} a unique revelation through Abraham, therefore, very clearly demonstrates that he was totally unacquainted with the significance of these documents and absolutely ignorant of the simplest facts of Egyptian writing and civilization." [...] Flinders Petrie of London University wrote: [...] "It may be safely said that there is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>single</b> word that is true in these explanations". Likewise, Archibald Sayce, Oxford professor of Egyptology, stated: [...] "It is difficult to deal seriously with Joseph Smith’s impudent fraud .... Smith has turned the goddess [...] into a king and Osiris into Abraham.” ...|$|E

In fact if three soft numbers 'Kuch Kum', 'Khabar Nahi' and 'Jaane Kyun' are the pick of the lot, then 'Desi Girl' is a definite must for the dance floors. 'Maa Da Laadla' and 'Shut up & Bounce' have their own place under the sun." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album eight out of ten and called it Vishal–Shekhar's best album of the year: [...] "Whether it be through the touching vocal, musical, and lyrical poetry of Kuch Kum, Vishal's riveting vocal performance in Jaane Kyun, the soothing depths of Khabar Nahin, or the uplifting, feel-good breeze of Desi Girl, Dostana has music for everyone to savor." [...] Hindustan Times also gave it a positive review, calling it [...] "a surefire chartbuster." [...] According to CNN-News18, [...] "Except for 'Shut Up and Bounce', each song in Dostana is wrapped in fun and peppiness {{on the one hand}} and melody and rhythm on the other." [...] According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 17,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fourth highest-selling.|$|E

It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>single</b> solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|Not {{all of the}} {{reactions}} were positive: several of Duncan's captains were criticised for their failure to rapidly and decisively engage the enemy, including Captain Wells of Lancaster. The worst criticism fell on Captain John Williamson of Agincourt. Agincourt had been barely engaged in the battle and had suffered <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>single</b> casualty. As a result, Williamson was accused of failing to do his duty by Captain Hopper of Agincourts Royal Marines and court-martialled on 4 December 1797, at Sheerness aboard Circe, on the charges of [...] "disobedience to signals and not going into action" [...] and [...] "cowardice and disaffection". Williamson {{had a history of}} indecisiveness: in 1779, while a junior officer on Captain James Cook's voyage to the Pacific Ocean, Williamson had prevaricated about bringing boats to evacuate Cook from Kealakekua Bay while under attack by Hawaiians. As a result, Cook was trapped on the beach and stabbed to death. At the conclusion of the trial on 1 January 1798, Williamson was found guilty of the first charge and not guilty of the latter, resulting in demotion {{to the bottom of the}} post captains list and prohibition from further naval service. Williamson was reported to have died in 1799, shortly after his dismissal from the service, but Edward Pelham Brenton later claimed that he had instead gone into hiding under an assumed name and continued to draw his pension for many years. In the Batavian Republic, there were also recriminations against those officers who were deemed to have failed in their duty: De Winter's despatch from London after the battle placed much of the blame with six ships that had failed to follow his orders and had withdrawn early from the battle. Several officers were brought up on charges, including Admiral Bloys van Treslong who was convicted at court-martial and dismissed the service although later reinstated, and Commander Souter of Batavier who was convicted and imprisoned. Admiral Story was also criticised, particularly by De Winter, and was only permitted to keep his command once he had satisfied the Batavian government that he had had no option but to retreat.|$|E

The first 25 decrypts were very short messages or partial decrypts of marginal intelligence value. As Whitlock stated, [...] "The reason that <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>single</b> JN-25 decrypt made prior to Pearl Harbor has ever been found or declassified is not due to any insidious cover-up... it is due quite simply to the fact that no such decrypt ever existed.

[...] "Horace Walpole summed up for the unbelievers when he pronounced {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century, 'I cannot imagine that Dr Johnson's reputation will be very lasting.' His dictionary was 'a surprising work for one man', but 'the task is too much for one man, and ... a society should alone pretend to publish a standard dictionary.' Walpole's reservations notwithstanding, the admirers out-numbered the detractors, and the reputation of the Dictionary was repeatedly boosted by other philologists, lexicographers, educationalists and word detectives." ...|$|E

Former Buchenwald inmate Adam Cabala claims that von Braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers: [...] the German scientists led by Prof. Wernher von Braun were aware of everything daily.
