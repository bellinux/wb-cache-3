25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E

Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin. The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to things (to an objective reality), but rather from the social relations (economic, for Marx) between the bearers of those concepts. As a result, there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unchanging [...] "human nature".

2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of models of {{imperfect}} and asymmetric information, the traditional neoclassical economics literature had assumed that markets are efficient except for some limited and well defined market failures. More recent work by Stiglitz and others reversed that presumption, to assert {{that it is only}} under exceptional circumstances that markets are efficient. Stiglitz has shown (together with Bruce Greenwald) that [...] "whenever markets are incomplete and/or information is imperfect (which are true in virtually all economies), even competitive market allocation is not constrained Pareto efficient". In other words, they addressed [...] "the problem of determining when tax interventions are Pareto-improving. [...] The approach indicates that such tax interventions almost always exist and that equilibria in situations of imperfect information are rarely constrained Pareto optima." [...] Although these conclusions and the pervasiveness of market failures do not necessarily warrant the state intervening broadly in the economy, it makes clear that the [...] "optimal" [...] range of government recommendable interventions is definitely much larger than the traditional [...] "market failure" [...] school recognizes. For Stiglitz, there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> invisible hand, in the sense that free markets lead to efficiency as if guided by unseen forces.

2500|$|From {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s onward, {{classical}} revolutionary orthodox Marxists like Henryk Grossmann, Louis C. Fraina (alias Lewis Corey) and Paul Mattick [...] argued {{that at a}} certain point, the falling rate of profit stops the total mass of profit in the economy from growing altogether, or at least from growing at a sufficient rate. This results in a crisis of overaccumulation (or a shortage of surplus value), and consequently a drop in new productive investment, causing an increase in unemployment. This, in turn, leads to a wave of takeovers and mergers to restore profitable production, plus a higher intensity of labor exploitation. In the end, however, {{after a lot of}} cycles, capitalism collapses. This contrasted with V.I. Lenin’s idea that in the crises of bourgeois society [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> absolutely hopeless situation", since the bourgeoisie can – in principle – always find a way out. Lenin regarded the abolition of capitalism as a conscious political act, not as a spontaneous result of the breakdown of the economy. In 1931, two years after publishing his breakdown theory, Grossman qualified his idea more, emphasizing that he did not believe that capitalism had to collapse [...] "by itself" [...] or [...] "automatically"; the objective law of breakdown had to be combined with the subjective factor of the class struggle.|$|E
