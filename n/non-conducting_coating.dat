5|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal discharge {{generated by}} the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a <b>non-conducting</b> <b>coating</b> prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere. The dielectric barrier discharge {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine. The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jets. These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as plasma bullets.|$|E

40|$|Networks {{comprised}} of randomly oriented overlapping nanowires offer {{the possibility of}} simple fabrication {{on a variety of}} substrates, in contrast with the precise placement required for devices with single or aligned nanowires. Metal nanowires typically have a coating of surfactant or oxide that prevents aggregation, but also prevents electrical connection. Prohibitively high voltages can be required to electrically activate nanowire networks, and even after activation many nanowire junctions remain non-conducting. Non-electrical activation methods can enhance conductivity but destroy the memristive behavior of the junctions that comprise the network. We show through both simulation and experiment that electrical stimulation, microstructured electrode geometry, and feature scaling can all be used to manipulate the connectivity and thus, electrical conductivity of networks of silver nanowires with a <b>non-conducting</b> polymer <b>coating.</b> More generally, these results describe a strategy to integrate nanomaterials into controllable, adaptive macroscale materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to study, design, and build microwave cavity resonators for use at both room and low temperatures with an electron para-magnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. The resonant cavity provides the high frequency magnetic field necessary for resonance absorption in paramagnetic solids; {{and it must be}} carefully constructed such that it will have a high Q and low noise, A high Q is necessary because the spectrometer detector signal is directly proportional to Q and the minimum detectable signal is inversely proportional to Q. In order to reduce the noise due to interactions between the DC magnetic field and currents induced in the walls by the modulation field, the cavity must be constructed of a <b>non-conducting</b> material <b>coated</b> with a thin layer of silver. The problems connected with the design and construction of such a cavity are discussed in detail, and characteristics are given for the resulting resonators...|$|R
40|$|A small heat {{transfer}} probe, {{operating in the}} free molecule tow regime, was developed {{with the purpose of}} obtaining accurate x, t diagrams of a reflected shock wave close to the end wall of the GALCIT 17 -inch shock tube. The sensitive element of the probe consists of a. 005 " diameter filament of <b>non-conducting</b> material <b>coated</b> with a thin metallic film. The sensitivities of a filament probe and a conventional cold wire are compared analytically and it is found that the filament probe has favorable characteristics for measurement times of the order of a few microseconds. This is confirmed by the experiments. The probe was mounted in the end wall of the 17 -inch shock tube and x, t diagrams of reflected shock waves were measured at three levels of the initial pressure. The initial motion of the reflected shock is governed by heat loss to the reflecting wall; the wave velocity approaches its ideal value only asymptotically. The asymptotic approach agrees closely with the results of a boundary layer theory. The measurements indicate that the trajectory of the reflected shock close to the end wall is characterized by three different regions; the region in which boundary layer theory is valid, a region closer to the wall in which deviations from boundary layer theory are observed, and a non-continuum region adjacent to the wall in which the reflected shock is formed. The reflected shock wave is found to leave the formation region with a velocity which is approximately 20 per cent below the ideal velocity. It then accelerates toward this ideal velocity, approaching within 3 per cent at distances from the end wall of about 1000 mean free paths. The boundary layer approximation is found to be valid for distances greater than about 70 mean free paths. Accordingly, a non-uniform temperature profile is to be expected in a layer of approximately 100 mean free paths from the end wall...|$|R
