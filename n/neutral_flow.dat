40|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>flow</b> {{dynamics}} in Hall thrusters are not often {{regarded as a}} critical aspect that controls thruster operation and discharge channel physics. This dissertation, combined with previous work, showed that <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> dynamics affect global properties including thruster performance, stability, thermal margin, and lifetime. In addition, the <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> rate, and more importantly, the electron-neutral collision rate in the channel {{have an impact on}} other thruster properties including the location, size, and intensity of the ionization, high electron temperature, and acceleration regions. The results of these findings are relevant to ongoing efforts to understand thruster operation, electron physics, and thruster lifetime. Performance and plume measurements indicated that thruster efficiency remained constant from ± 50 % of the nominal flow rate of 20 mg/s. Current utilization was the primary loss mechanism and it decreased with flow rate due to increased ionization losses and electron-wall losses. To compensate, the divergence and mass utilizations increased with flow rate through a more compact ionization region and increased ionization efficiency from the increasing neutral density. Electron collision frequencies and the electron Hall parameter were calculated from measurements of the ion density, electron temperature, and electric field inside the discharge channel. The peak Hall parameter moved downstream and decreased in magnitude as flow rate was increased, and the results confirmed that there exist at least three distinct electron mobility regions as implemented in some plasma simulations. Near the anode, the turbulence was approximated by the Bohm value. Near the channel exit, the turbulence was suppressed and electrons were most effectively trapped by the Hall current in this region. In the plume, the turbulence was an order of magnitude greater than the Bohm value, indicating large contributions to electron transport from turbulence or a currently unaccounted for anomalous transport mechanism. For most of the channel, the electron-neutral collisions were the primary contributor to electron energy loss and cross-field mobility. However, near the channel exit, electron-wall collisions increased and became the primary contributor to the measured decrease in electron temperature with increased flow rate...|$|E

The model is discrete in the vertical with 27 layers spaced by half a scale height. In the horizontal, the fields are expanded in a series of spherical harmonics using a triangular truncation at wave number 31, equivalent to a homogeneous global resolution with a minimum wavelength of 1270 km. A hypothetical uniform grid point model would require a horizontal spacing of 417 km to describe the same minimum wavelength. In the high-latitude F region the tides affect the dusk vortex of the <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> very little, but the dawn vortex is either suppressed or amplified dependent upon the universal time and tidal phase. In the E region <b>neutral</b> <b>flow,</b> both the dusk and dawn vortices are shifted in local time by the tides, again as a function of universal time and tidal phase.

Quantitative measurements of D&# 945; emission, made with a CCD camera, have been used to determine the particle efflux from the plasma. Roughly one third of the D&# 945; emission occurs in a diffuse `halo' that surrounds the limiter belt. The particle confinement time is less than the energy confinement time by a factor of typically 4. Modelling in 2 -D of plasma and <b>neutral</b> <b>flows</b> in the TEXTOR boundary has been performed. The source of D+ ions can be related to the D&# 945; emission by a factor that is found to depend on the location of the emission and on the discharge density. The predicted total D&# 945; emission agrees with the measurements within a factor of about 2. Pumping of ALT-II allows for density control; with NBI, the density can be increased well beyond the ohmic limit without the discharge ending in disruption. The plasma particle efflux and the pumped flux both increase with density as well as with heating power. The exhaust efficiency is typically ~ 2 %, with the highest values observed in high density NBI discharges. Higher exhaust rates are observed with NBI than with ICRF. Plasma and <b>neutral</b> <b>flows</b> in the ALT-II scoops have been simulated, making use of a simple plasma model.

40|$|We {{study the}} physics of wave {{propagation}} in a weakly ionised plasma, {{as it applies to}} the formation of multifluid, MHD shock waves. We model the plasma as separate charged and neutral fluids which are coupled by ion-neutral friction. At times much less than the ion-neutral drag time, the fluids are decoupled and so evolve independently. At later times, the evolution is determined by the large inertial mismatch between the charged and neutral particles. The <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> continues to evolve independently; the charged flow is driven by and slaved to the <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> by friction. We calculate this driven flow analytically by considering the special but realistic case where the charged fluid obeys linearized equations of motion. We carry out an extensive analysis of linear, driven, MHD waves. The physics of driven MHD waves is embodied in certain Green functions which describe wave propagation on short time scales, ambipolar diffusion on long time scales, and transitional behavior at intermediate times. By way of illustration, we give an approximate solution for the formation of a multifluid shock during the collision of two identical interstellar clouds. The collision produces forward- and reverse J shocks in the neutral fluid and a transient in the charged fluid. The latter rapidly evolves into a pair of magnetic precursors on the J shocks, wherein the ions undergo force free motion and the magnetic field grows monotonically with time. The flow appears to be self similar at the time when linear analysis ceases to be valid. Comment: 18 pages including 24 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|E
40|$|F-region neutral winds {{across the}} polar cap {{have been studied}} by {{utilizing}} a Fabry-Perot interferometer located at Eureka (89 ° CGM), Nunavut Territory, over a 2 -winter period 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99. The dependence of neutral winds on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was studied with simultaneous solar wind data from the WIND satellite. A detailed comparison was made between the neutral winds and simultaneous ion drifts measured from the DMSP F 13 polar orbiting satellite during January and December, 1998. Spatially resolved 4 vector winds for 4 campaign days were compared to vector ion flows, to study the contributions of various forcing terms including ion drag to the neutral motions, {{under a variety of}} IMF conditions. The major results are as summarized below. (1) The average neutral winds across the central polar cap were 165 m/s antisunward. For IMF Bz southward the average was 295 m/s and for Bz northward only 90 m/s. The By component influenced the neutral wind direction; for By positive the average wind direction was about 3. 4 ° duskward relative to the direction for By negative. (2) The observed time for neutral winds to respond to major IMF Bz transient changes was on average about 57 minutes. The calculated neutral e-folding time constant is 3. 5 hours for a typical winter F-region electron density. The observed response time ranged from 1. 5 to 7 hours. (3) For steady IMF Bz conditions, the measured ratios of the neutral wind velocity in the polar cap to the ion velocity were 0. 46 and 0. 33 respectively for Bz southward and northward. The empirical relations between these velocities and Bz were Vn=- 204 + 19. 3 Bzm/s Bz innT Vi=- 504 + 43. 4 Bzm/s. (4) Sunward winds occur frequently in the dayside of the polar cap under prolonged IMF Bz northward conditions. For B z strongly northward, the <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> is sunward in the dayside due to sunward ion flows from reverse convection cells. The nightside flow is antisunward approximately along the 14 - 02 MLT meridian. (5) When B y is positive and a dominant component of the IMF, the dayside <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> is mainly dawnward due to the dawnward ion drifts from the expanded dusk convection cell. The nightside flow remains along the 14 - 02 MLT meridian. (6) For IMF Bz strongly northward and By strongly positive conditions, the contributions of the pressure gradient force and Coriolis force to the dayside <b>neutral</b> <b>flow</b> are apparent in addition to ion drag.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of flow angles from a fetch-limited beech forest site with clearings is presented. Flow angles and vertical velocities from {{two types of}} sonic anemometers {{as well as a}} ground based remote sensing lidar were analysed. Instead of using rotations, where zero-flow angles were assumed for <b>neutral</b> <b>flow,</b> the data from the instruments were interpreted in relation to the terrain. Uncertainties regarding flow distortion and limited sampling time (statistical uncertainty) were evaluated and found to be significant. Especially for one of the sonic anemometers, relatively small changes in the flow distortion correction could change the sign of mean vertical velocities taken during stable atmospheric stratification relative to the <b>neutral</b> <b>flow.</b> Despite the uncertainties, it was possible to some extent to relate both positive and negative mean flow angles to features in the terrain. Conical and linear scans with a remote sensing lidar were evaluated for estimation of vertical velocities and flow angles. The results of the vertical conical scans were promising, and yielded negative flow angles for a sector where the forest is fetch-limited. However, more data and analysis is needed for a complete evaluation of the technique. The horizontal linear scans showed the variability of the mean wind speed field. A vertical velocity was calculated from different focusing distances, but this estimate yielded unrealistically high vertical velocities, due to neglect of the transversal wind component. The vertical advection term was calculated using the measured mean flow angles at the mast and profile measurements of carbon dioxide, but it is not recommended to use in relation with the flux measurement as the vertical velocity measured at the mast is most likely not representative for the whole forest...|$|E

A portion of this flow is ionized. This report describes a fluid that expands so rapidly into a vacuum that the ionized portion of the flow departs from local thermodynamic equilibrium. This cold supersonic exhaust will have a much higher degree of ionization, and of higher electron temperature, than would be expected from a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium at the local temperature of the <b>neutral</b> <b>flow.</b> This report presents {{a continuation of the}} work described in reference (1). My aim is to develop as simple a model as will reasonably predict the speed and density of <b>neutral</b> <b>flow,</b> and the temperature and density of plasma. I use simplifying assumptions and mathematical approximations to develop convenient formulas, and I test them by comparing specific examples to experimental data and computations by DeVolder and other Los Alamos scientists (2). The phenomenon of sudden expansion of a gas cloud into vacuum is described in several sections of the two-volume work by ZelUdovich and Raizer (3). The criterion I use for estimating the point in the flow where plasma ceases to be in equilibrium is in principle that proposed by Bray (4), (5), and discussed extensively by Vincenti and Kruger (6). The immediate concern motivating this work is how to design a metal target that accurately converts an {{electron beam}} pulse train into a radiation pulse train for use in the high-speed radiography of implosion hydrodynamics experiments. In the radiography application, either the electron beam must be swept magnetically along the metal target more quickly than the spread of the debris plume, or the metal plate must move laterally past a fixed point of impact, carrying its plume with it. What is this speed, and how dense is this splash flow? Aside from its technological application, this problem has an intrinsic interest because it includes such a wide range of physical phenomena, and because it is an analog in miniature of supernova explosions. A small hot source created quickly propels an expanding flow into a vacuum, and this flow contains a remnant plasma that preserves information about the earliest moments of the flow. The plan of this report is as follows. The section ``Heat source and neutral flow`` reviews the physics of an electron beam pulse that generates enthalpy, which in turn propels a flow of neutral target material.
