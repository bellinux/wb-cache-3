40|$|Biologists {{frequently}} use nondirectional heterogeneity tests {{when comparing}} {{three or more}} populations because a suitable directional test is unavailable or is not practical to implement. Here we describe a test, the ordered heterogeneity test, that permits testing against simply ordered alternative hypotheses {{in the context of}} almost any <b>nondirectional</b> <b>test.</b> The test has a wide range of parametric and nonparametric applications. Graphs are developed for calculating exact P values...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} lobbying against the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s 1985 Exposure Draft (ED) on accounting for pensions. The ED 2 ̆ 7 s proposals {{would have put}} a liability on the balance sheet for unfunded pension benefits, reduced flexibility in measurement of pension expense, and caused possible volatility in expense measurement. Drawing upon contracting theory, {{it was hypothesized that}} industrial firms would be motivated to lobby against the proposals because of adverse financial statement effects. The potentially adverse balance sheet effect was measured by using a ratio of net pension liability (asset) to the firm 2 ̆ 7 s total existing balance sheet tangible assets. Lobbyists were hypothesized to have a smaller ratio than nonlobbyists. The potential for adverse income statement effects was captured by the use of a ratio of pension expense to pretax earnings. This ratio was hypothesized to be larger for lobbyists than nonlobbyists. Using political cost management wealth theories, firm size and management percentage ownership were hypothesized to be key motivating factors in the lobby decision. Lobbyists were hypothesized to be larger than nonlobbyists. The management wealth hypothesis was a joint test of Jensen and Meckling 2 ̆ 7 s (1976) theory and Fama 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) theory, so a <b>nondirectional</b> <b>test</b> of management wealth was used. ^ Using both univariate and multivariate (logit) analyses, it was determined that firm size differed significantly (and in the direction predicted) between lobbying and nonlobbying firms. The hypotheses representing adverse financial statements effects were not supported. The pension ratio variable was never significant, although the sign of the difference was in the direction predicted. The pension expense ratio was not significant, and the sign of the difference was opposite of that predicted. Management percentage ownership was significant in the univariate tests, but the logit results indicated that management wealth was not independent of either firm size or industry membership. Results of this study support the political cost theory that firm size may be sufficient to explain the decision to lobby. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{directional}} and <b>nondirectional</b> hypothesis <b>testing</b> {{was examined}} from {{the perspectives of}} textbooks, journal articles, and members of editorial boards. Three widely used statistical texts were reviewed in terms of how directional and <b>nondirectional</b> <b>tests</b> of significance were presented. Texts reviewed were written by: (1) D. E. Hinkle, W. Wiersma, and S. G. Jurs (1994); (2) G. V. Glass and K. D. Hopkins (1996); and (3) R. C. Sprinthall (1990). All three focused on <b>nondirectional</b> <b>tests</b> of significance. While all three texts introduced one-tail (directional) tests of significant, two downplayed its significance. Research methods text...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{includes}} 3 {{tables for}} quick power estimates that require no computation {{for the most}} common designs involving comparisons of 2 and 3 means in ANOVA and ANCOVA situa-tions. Power can be estimated for (from. 1 &sigma; to 1 &sigma;) for 4 effect sizes at alpha levels from. 01 to. 20, for samples sizes from 5 to 400 per group, and for directional and <b>nondirectional</b> <b>tests.</b> Many behavioral studies discover {{no significant difference between}} means even when differences between the parameter means are substantial. This situation results, in part, because inadequate attention is frequently given to the issue of statistical power {{in the design of the}} experiment (Brewer, 1972; Cohen, 1973; Cohen & Hyman, 1979; Hopkins, 1973). Procedures for the estimation of power are included in current textbooks of applied statistics and experimenta...|$|R
