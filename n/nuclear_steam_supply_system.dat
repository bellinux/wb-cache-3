40|$|The modular high {{temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR) {{is a typical}} small modular reactor (SMR) that offers simpler, standardized and safer modular design by being factory built, requiring smaller initial capital investment, and having a shorter construction period. Thanks to its small size, the MHTGRs could be beneficial in providing electric power to remote areas that are deficient in transmission or distribution and in generating local power for large population centers. Based on the multi-modular operation scheme, the inherent safety feature of the MHTGRs can be applicable to large nuclear plants of any desired power rating. The MHTGR-based <b>nuclear</b> <b>steam</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>system</b> (NSSS) is constituted by an MHTGR, a side-by-side arranged helical-coil once-through steam generator (OTSG) and some connecting pipes. Due to the side-by-side arrangement, there is a tight coupling effect between the MHTGR and OTSG. Moreover, there always exists the parameter perturbation of the NSSSs. Thus, it is meaningful to study the model-free coordinated control of MHTGR-based NSSSs for safe, stable, robust and efficient operation. In this paper, a new model-free coordinated control strategy that regulates the nuclear power, MHTGR outlet helium temperature and OTSG outlet overheated steam temperature by properly adjusting the control rod position, helium flowrate and feed-water flowrate is established for the MHTGR-based NSSSs. Sufficient conditions for the globally asymptotic closed-loop stability is given. Finally, numerical simulation results {{in the cases of}} large range power decrease and increase illustrate the satisfactory performance of this newly-developed model-free coordinated NSSS control law...|$|R
50|$|Combustion Engineering (C-E) was a multi-national American-based {{engineering}} firm {{and a leader}} in the development of both fossil and <b>nuclear</b> <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> power <b>systems</b> in the United States with approximately 42,00010 employees worldwide. Originally headquartered in New York City, C-E moved its corporate offices to Stamford, Connecticut in 1973. C-E owned over three dozen other companies including Lummus Company, National Tank Company and the Morgan Door Company. Former workers have gone on to hold leadership positions in major {{engineering firm}}s and governments around the world. The company was acquired by Asea Brown Boveri in early 1990. The boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and the nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company also in 2000.|$|R
5000|$|The OPR-1000 is a South Korean {{designed}} two-loop 1000 MWe PWR Generation II nuclear reactor, {{developed by}} KHNP and KEPCO. The OPR-1000 was originally {{designated as the}} Korean Standard Nuclear Power Plant (KSNP), and was re-designated as the OPR-1000 in 2005 for foreign sales. [...] It was developed based partly on the Combustion Engineering (C-E) designs, through a technology transfer agreement. The reactor core design {{was derived from the}} C-E designed Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 2, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> (NSSS) was derived from the C-E designed units at Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station and auxiliary plant design was derived from the earlier Unit-1 and Unit-2 at the Yeonggwang (now Hanbit) Nuclear Power Plant.|$|E
50|$|The Reactor Protection System (RPS) is a system, {{computerized}} {{in later}} BWR models, {{that is designed}} to automatically, rapidly, and completely shut down and make safe the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Steam</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>System</b> (NSSS - the reactor pressure vessel, pumps, and water/steam piping within the containment) if some event occurs that could result in the reactor entering an unsafe operating condition. In addition, the RPS can automatically spin up the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) upon detection of several signals. It does not require human intervention to operate. However, the reactor operators can override parts of the RPS if necessary. If an operator recognizes a deteriorating condition, and knows an automatic safety system will activate, they are trained to pre-emptively activate the safety system.|$|E
50|$|The RPV and <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Steam</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>System</b> (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation piping loops and pumps in the containment that in turn drive jet pumps producing forced flow in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal recirculation pumps are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the core shroud and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal recirculation pumps eliminate all of the jet pumps in the RPV, all of the large external recirculation loop pumps and piping, the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|E
40|$|The {{prospects}} of using nuclear energy in Saudi Arabia for desalination and {{electric power generation}} represent a challenging engineering problem. Three specific issues have been considered for a dual-purpose plant, namely: (1) Impact of the availability and reliability of the desalination plants, (2) Integration of the desalination and power production stages, and, (3) Safety considerations of dual systems;The operational history data of the Jeddah desalination plants are studied, to determine the reliability of a multi-stage flash (MSF) desalination plant and of a reverse osmosis plant (RO);MSF plant performance, operation conditions, and the most common causes of deviation from plant performance standards are presented. Actual operation data from an MSF plant are analyzed. Potential problem areas and critical components are identified, and failure rates are estimated;Fault tree techniques are used for major systems in both MSF and RO plants, and a quantitative evaluation is performed using PREP-KITT computer codes to assess the probability of failure of the MSF and RO plants. The results of such studies showed that the major contributors of unavailability are pump failures, screen failures, pipe leakages, motor operated valve failures, and tube leakages. Recommendations for improving the reliability of MSF systems are given;The reliability and operational experience of the RO plant are analyzed, {{and the results of}} the RO plant availability analysis are given for four cases of operation in which failure contributors are membrane fractures, pump failures, diesel engine failures, and pipe leakages;The analysis of the operation history of both desalination plants revealed some very important factors which have been considered. The implications of dual-purpose nuclear desalination plants are discussed for technical, safety, and operational aspects of these plants. Also, the schemes of integration of <b>nuclear</b> <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> with the MSF plant are presented. A comparison of RO and MSF processes {{from the point of view}} of reliability, safety, and compatibility with nuclear power as an energy source is presented.

40|$|The {{objectives}} for the ASP large early release frequency (LERF) model development {{work is to}} build a Level 2 containment response model that would capture all of the events necessary to define LERF as outlined in Regulatory Guide 1. 174, can be directly interfaced with the existing Level 1 models, is technically correct, can be readily modified to incorporate new information or to represent another plant, and can be executed in SAPHIRE. The ASP LERF models being developed will meet these objectives while providing the NRC with the capability to independently assess the risk impact of plant-specific changes proposed by the utilities that change the nuclear power plants' licensing basis. Together with the ASP Level 1 models, the ASP LERF models provide the NRC with the capability of performing equipment and event assessments to determine their impact on a plant's LERF for internal events during power operation. In addition, the ASP LERF models are capable of being updated to reflect changes in information regarding the system operations and phenomenological events, and of being updated to assess the potential for early fatalities for each LERF sequence. As the ASP Level 1 models evolve to include more analysis capabilities, the LERF models will also be refined to reflect the appropriate level of detail needed to demonstrate the new capabilities. An approach was formulated for the development of detailed LERF models using the NUREG- 1150 APET models as a guide. The modifications to the SAPHIRE computer code have allowed the development of these detailed models and the ability to analyze these models in a reasonable time. Ten reference LERF plant models, including six PWR models and four BWR models, which cover a wide variety of containment and <b>nuclear</b> <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> designs, will be complete in 1999. These reference models will be used as the starting point for developing the LERF models for the remaining nuclear power plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} application of Distributed Digital Controls in order to review {{the application of}} this recent control technology towards Steam Boilers in a step-by-step manner. The main purpose of a steam generating boiler is to <b>supply</b> enough <b>steam</b> to meet process demands. Steam conditions must remain as stable as possible, because variations in the steam system can affect downstream processes. Pressure variations in the <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> header, for example, can have a severe effect on heat transferred to a process. If that process suffers an upset, unstable conditions can propagate from one process to another via the <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system.</b> The closer the tolerance in the boiler control system, the smaller the steam header disturbances will be. This reduces the interaction, or 'coupling', of upsets between steam-consuming processes. Also, it may reduce the complexity of instrumentation needed for those processes. If the boiler control system can eliminate major upsets, the downstream processes won't need exotic schemes to compensate for such upsets...|$|R
