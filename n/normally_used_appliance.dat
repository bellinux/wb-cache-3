40|$|Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a {{technology}} offering methods to identify appliances in homes {{based on their}} consumption characteristics and the total household demand. Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were introduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation metric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even with the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to incomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is evaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by the considered appliances, the number of <b>used</b> <b>appliances,</b> the device type representing the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the consumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of aggregated consumption data providing {{an assessment of the}} problem complexity affected by the <b>used</b> <b>appliances,</b> the appliance characteristics and the appliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on different real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach. The introduced disaggregation complexity measure is able to classify the disaggregation problem based on the <b>used</b> <b>appliance</b> set and the considered measurement noise...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of orthodontic appliances in the oral environment and the subsequent leaching of metals are relatively unknown. A method for determining the effects of various types of soldering and welding, both of which in turn could lead to leaching of metal ions, on the growth of osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and oral keratinocytes in vitro, is proposed. The effects of cell behaviour of metal wires on osteoblast differentiation, expressed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity; on fibroblast proliferation, assayed by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulphophenil) - 2 H-tetrazolium-phenazine ethosulphate method; and on keratinocyte viability and migration on the wires, observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were tested. Two types of commercially available wires <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> for orthodontic <b>appliances,</b> with a similar chemical composition (iron, carbon, silicon, chromium, molybdenum, phosphorus, sulphur, vanadium, and nitrogen) but differing in nickel and manganese content, were examined, {{as well as the}} joints obtained by electrical resistance welding, traditional soldering, and laser welding. Nickel and chromium, known as possible toxic metals, were also examined using pure nickel- and chromium-plated titanium wires. Segments of each wire, cut into different lengths, were added to each well in which the cells were grown to confluence. The high nickel and chromium content of orthodontic wires damaged both osteoblasts and fibroblasts, but did not affect keratinocytes. Chromium strongly affected fibroblast growth. The joint produced by electrical resistance welding was well tolerated by both osteoblasts and fibroblasts, whereas traditional soldering caused a significant (P < 0. 05) decrease in both osteoblast ALP activity and fibroblast viability, and prevented the growth of keratinocytes in vitro. Laser welding was the only joining process well tolerated by all tested cells...|$|R

40|$|Serious adverse {{impacts on}} the {{environment}} and human health from the recycling and disposal of electronic waste have occurred in the past and continue to occur in China today, {{due to the lack of}} a national management strategy. With aiming to support the management strategy development, a study was carried out to plan and quantitatively evaluate the optional management frameworks for the selected five main types of large electronic home appliances in Beijing, the capital city and a typically big municipality in China. This paper outlined the main findings yielded from the series of assessment studies which started from the generation amount prediction and material flow analysis of the <b>used</b> electronic <b>appliances,</b> planning and optimization of the collection & transportation frameworks and ended at the economic evaluation of the optional recycling processes for the waste appliances. Although the revenue could be expected from the result of isolated evaluation of the recycling processes, the entire system will be economically unavailable if the <b>used</b> <b>appliances</b> are still collected from the owners at current prices. The traditional understanding of householders on the values of their <b>used</b> <b>appliances</b> should be changed in Beijing and China as a whole. Establishment of a formal collection system that could take back the <b>used</b> <b>appliances</b> at lower prices (less than 40 % of the current level) is the key for the construction of a formal management framework with sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Manufacturers have {{developed}} {{a new generation of}} household appliances which perform their functions more effectively and use less resources like energy and water. The next step is to inform and educate students and their families how <b>using</b> <b>appliances</b> more efficiently can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent climate change. An on-line resource has developed (www. eais. info) as an enlarged appliance database accessible via Internet, a home appliance energy survey which is downloadable from the website, modules which explain the origins and impacts of global warming, product, labeling and energy saving in the home through <b>using</b> <b>appliances</b> more efficiently and a set of activities together with resource material suitable for use in primary and secondary schools throughout Romania (an eBook) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} household energy <b>use</b> and <b>appliance</b> {{ownership in}} Ireland. Logit regression analyses {{on a large}} micro-dataset reveal how household characteristics can help explain the ownership of energy <b>using</b> <b>appliances.</b> <b>Using</b> OLS regression models, we explore the factors affecting residential energy demand conditional on appliance ownership. Results suggest that the methods of space and water heating employed by a household are {{even more important than}} electrical appliances in explaining domestic energy usage. However, the stock of appliances must be included in such models so that results will not be biased. The methods employed in this paper can be easily adopted for studies of household energy use in other countries where household expenditure survey data are available.
