Intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) 6 -OHDA attenuated the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and also lowered the systolic blood pressure (BP) in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Norepinephrine was markedly and dose-dependently de-pleted in brain areas of all three substrains. Dopamine was affected also, although to a lesser extent. Pretreatment with the norepinephrine-uptake inhibitor desmethylimipramine (DMI) did not influ-ence the effect of 6 -OHDA on the development of hypertension in SHR. DMI largely antagonized the 6 -OHDA-induced depletion of brain norepinephrine, while dopamine depletion was not affected. Specif-ic depletion of brain norepinephrine by treatment with DSP- 4 did not alter the rise in BP in SHR. These results suggest that the effect of 6 -OHDA on the development of hypertension in SHR may not be mediated through destruction of brain <b>norepinephrine</b> <b>neurons,</b> but that interruption of brain dopaminergic mechanisms is a possibility in this respect.

Human PNMT transcripts and immunoreactivity were mainly detected in <b>norepinephrine</b> <b>neurons</b> in brain and sympathetic ganglion as well as in norepinephrine-producing cells in adrenal medulla of transgenic mice, indicating that the human DBH gene promoter of 4 kilobases is sufficient to direct expression of the gene in norepinephrine-producing cells.

As Ret-null mutants (Ret-/-) did not survive after birth, our experiments were performed in wild-type (wt) and Ret-/- fetuses exteriorized from pregnant heterozygous mice at gestational day 18.

As a major unmet need for patients, research and use of NE drugs in PD may provide significant benefits for cognitive processing...|$|R
40|$|Buspirone {{is a novel}} {{anxiolytic}} whose pharmacological profile {{differs from}} that of the benzodiazepines and includes dopaminergic agonist effects. Because of these properties, buspirone's usefulness in the management of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was evaluated in a controlled study of 16 outpatients with stage I-IV disease. At doses of 10 to 60 mg/day, no significant group or individual effects could be discerned on standardized disability, dyskinesia, anxiety, or depression scales. At high dose levels (100 mg/day) however, there was a significant worsening of disability ratings and a decrease in dyskinesia scores; anxiety ratings were also significantly increased. The results indicate that buspirone is well tolerated by parkinsonian patients at conventional antianxiety doses of 10 to 40 mg. Clinical effects of high dose treatment, on the other hand, resemble those associated with a reduction in central dopamine mediated synaptic function. Since buspirone reportedly produces dose-dependent stimulation of <b>norepinephrine</b> containing <b>neurons</b> in the locus ceruleus and behavioral symptoms of such activation were observed, these clinical observations support the concept that central noradrenergic stimulation can adversely affect parkinsonian symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) was {{originally}} considered a pure motor disorder {{according to the}} first description by James Parkinson in “The Shaking Palsy”. Nowadays, an increasing awareness of the complexity underlying PD has been acquired among clinicians: dementia {{is one of the}} most investigated PD’s non-motor features because of its individual and social burden. Recent evidences report dementia affects up to 80 % of PD patients in later stages and it represents a relevant risk for nursing home-admissions and duration of hospitalization. Clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease (PDD) have been suggested to develop common lines of diagnosis. Frequently, PD patients present a state of cognitive impairment since the time of diagnosis, defined as Parkinson’s disease mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). In non-demented PD population, MCI is the major predictor for conversion to dementia and new diagnostic criteria and guidelines for diagnostic procedures in PD-MCI have been proposed by Movement Disorder Society to better identified it. The involvement of different circuits including dopamine, norepinephrine and acetylcholine neurotransmission give reason of the multifaceted cognitive profile described in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Main clinical features include attention deficits, executive dysfunction, as well as visuospatial and memory impairments. Neuroimaging and the assessment of genetics, central and peripheral biochemistry and neuropsychology seem to be useful in detecting an early cognitive decline. In particular, the combination of these single biomarkers might make more sensible and specific the early diagnosis of PD-MCI and PDD. In 2012, Cochrane analysis has outlined the therapeutic efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) in patients with PDD. Among AChEI, rivastigmine is the most recognized treatment that appears to provide a real benefit in cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric disturbances and activities of daily living in patients with PD-MCI and PDD. Some findings suggest possible therapeutic effects in improving cognition of memantine, which is already used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Also atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, showed beneficial for PD’s non-motor symptoms linked to the loss of <b>norepinephrine</b> <b>neurons</b> such as global cognition (i. e. attentional modulation) and daytime sleepiness. Finally, the treatment of motor-symptoms with levodopa has demonstrated a positive impact on some cognitive impairments such as working memory and planning activities, but it seems also lead to iatrogenic cognitive deficits through a dopamine overdose in brain regions less dopaminergically depleted (i. e. caudate nucleus and ventral striatum). The pursuit to optimizing the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and to conduct a treatment to slow progression to dementia in Parkinson’s disease is a key research priority...|$|R
40|$|The spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rat (SHR) replicates many clinically relevant {{features of}} human essential hypertension and also exhibits behavioral symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dementia. The SHR phenotype is highly complex and cannot {{be explained by}} a single genetic or physiological mechanism. Nevertheless, numerous studies including our own work have revealed striking differences in central catecholaminergic transmission in SHR such as increased vesicular catecholamine content in the ventral brainstem. Here, we used immunolabeling followed by confocal microscopy and electron microscopy to quantify vesicle sizes and populations across three catecholaminergic brain areas—nucleus tractus solitarius and rostral ventrolateral medulla, both key regions for cardiovascular control, and the locus coeruleus. We also studied colocalization of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in <b>norepinephrine</b> and epinephrine-containing <b>neurons</b> as NPY is a common cotransmitter with central and peripheral catecholamines. We found significantly increased expression and coexpression of NPY in <b>norepinephrine</b> and epinephrine-positive <b>neurons</b> of locus coeruleus in SHR compared with Wistar rats. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immunolabeled vesicles of 150 to 650 [*]nm in diameter (means ranging from 250 to 300 [*]nm), which is much larger than previously reported. In locus coeruleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, but not in nucleus tractus solitarius, of SHR, noradrenergic and adrenergic vesicles were significantly larger and showed increased NPY colocalization when compared with Wistar rats. Our morphological evidence underpins the hypothesis of hyperactivity of the noradrenergic and adrenergic system and increased norepinephrine and epinephrine and NPY cotransmission in specific brain areas in SHR. It further strengthens the argument for a prohypertensive role of C 1 neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla as a potential causative factor for essential hypertension...|$|R

In the first experiment, dopamine or norepinephrine was injected intracerebraUy in female rats during estrous and diestrous phases of the estrous cycle. Dopamine injections in the anterior diencephalon of rats elicited eating (p< 0. 05) only during diestrus when circulating estradiol is low; norepinephrine elicited eating during both diestrous (/ 9 < 0. 02) and estrous (p< 0. 001) phases of the cycle.

50|$|Trace amine-associated {{receptor}} 1 (TAAR1) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the TAAR1 gene. TAAR1 is an amine-activated Gs-coupled and Gq-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily located in several peripheral organs, lymphocytes, astrocytes, {{and in the}} intracellular compartments within the presynaptic plasma membrane (i.e., axon terminal) of monoamine neurons in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). TAAR1 was discovered in 2001 by two independent groups of investigators, Borowski et al. and Bunzow et al. TAAR1 is one of six functional trace amine-associated receptors in humans, which are so named for their ability to bind endogenous amines that occur in tissues at trace concentrations. TAAR1 plays a significant role in regulating neurotransmission in dopamine, <b>norepinephrine,</b> and serotonin <b>neurons</b> in the CNS; it also affects immune system and neuroimmune system function through different mechanisms.|$|R
