25|$|In {{addition}} to complete roll-back {{of the proposed}} reservation, the striking protesters have demanded that an expert committee comprising members from non-political organisations to review the existing reservation policy and find out whether reservation for OBCs is required at all. This {{is based on the}} current confusion over actual population of OBC as various organisations have indicated various figures for the population of OBCs. This is mostly because the 1931 national census was the last time detailed population and economic data was gathered along with caste information for the OBC population. The Mandal Commission, using extrapolated 1931 Census figures, put it at 52 per cent, the <b>National</b> <b>Sample</b> Survey Organisation (NSSO) at 32 per cent and the National Family and Health Survey at 29.8 per cent. Keeping in view the fact that already 23.5% of all college seats are reserved for OBCs, the rationale of extending reservation is debated. The protesters also demand that no penal action be taken against the protesters and publication of a white paper by the government, making its stand clear on reservation.|$|E

Special emphasis in the study {{is given to the}} nature of race and ethnicity within the black population by selecting and interviewing <b>national</b> <b>samples</b> of African-American (N = 3, 570), and Afro-Caribbean (N = 1, 623) immigrant and second and older generation populations. National multi-stage probability methods were used in generating the samples and race/ethnic matching of interviewers and respondents were used in the largely face-to-face interview, which lasted on average 2 hours and 20 minutes. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV World Mental Health Composite Interview (WHO-CIDI) was used to assess a wide range of serious mental disorders, potential risk and resilience factors, and help seeking and service use patterns. This paper provides an overview of the design of the NSAL, sample selection procedures, recruitment and training of the national interviewing team, and some of the special problems faced in interviewing ethnically and racially diverse <b>national</b> <b>samples.</b> Unique features of sample design, including special screening and listing procedures, interviewer training and supervision, and response rate outcomes are described.

500|$|The {{educational}} system prevailing in the state's schools {{is made up}} of 10 years, which are streamlined into lower primary, upper primary and secondary school stages with a 4+3+3 pattern. After 10 years of schooling, students typically enroll in Higher Secondary Schooling in one of the three major streams—liberal arts, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional under-graduate (UG) programmes. The majority of public schools are affiliated with the Kerala State Education Board. Other educational boards are the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), and the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most self-financing schools, while government and government-aided schools offer English or Malayalam.

Since November 2005, a new government led by Nitish Kumar has implemented a number of economic and social reforms.

For example, in June 2009, the World Bank reported that Patna was the second best city in India to start a business, after Delhi. Between 1999 and 2008, state GDP grew by 5.1% a year, which was below the Indian average of 7.3%.

Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science. [...] Also, cross-national studies, polled from 1981-2001, on views of science and religion have noted that countries with higher religiosity do not have stronger trust in science, whereas countries that are seen as more secular are less skeptical {{about the impact of}} science and technology. Though the United States is a highly religious country compared to other advanced industrial countries, according to the National Science Foundation, public attitudes towards science are more favorable in the United States than Europe, Russia, and Japan. A study on a <b>national</b> <b>sample</b> of US college students examined whether they viewed the science / religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or independence.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Baseline {{data for}} the {{clinician}} initiated, tobacco prevention trial, the first non-school based clinician mediated tobacco prevention study, were used to explore {{the degree to which}} young people receiving orthodontic treatment use tobacco and the differences in use rates between national, California, and patient samples. Correlates of tobacco use were identified and these correlates were contrasted with findings from the published reports. DESIGN AND SETTING: A 26 item telephone survey assessed demographic information, tobacco use, selected health related behaviours, and variables based on social learning theory. The study was conducted among 11 to 18 year old orthodontic patients from San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles Counties, California, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 17925 patients who were eligible, 16915 (> 94 %) completed the survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multivariate analyses were conducted using a logistic mixed effects model. Although the 30 day prevalence rate of tobacco use (6 %, n = 1010) proved lower than California and <b>national</b> <b>samples,</b> the rates for the age, gender, and race ethnicity subgroups showed trends similar to those seen in California and <b>national</b> <b>samples.</b> Ten variables were significantly associated with tobacco use (p < 0. 05), including 30 day alcohol use (OR = 7. 88), age (OR = 1. 32), and living with a tobacco user (OR = 1. 72).
