Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper Sounds to describe {{the emergence of new}} heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> music.|$|E

5|$|In 1956 Rivette {{made the}} short film Le Coup du Berger, which Truffaut {{credited}} as enacting the <b>New</b> <b>Wave</b> movement. The following year he {{began work on}} his first feature film with the initial support of Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini. Paris Belongs to Us {{was shot in the}} summer of 1958, but not released theatrically until 1961, after Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard had their feature-film debuts distributed and made the <b>New</b> <b>Wave</b> renowned worldwide. After staging a theatrical version of Denis Diderot's novel La Religieuse starring Anna Karina in 1963, Rivette became the editor-in-chief of Cahiers du Cinéma until 1965. He then began production on a film version of La Religieuse, which led to a lengthy public battle with French censorship over the film's release. Finally released in 1967, the publicity made it financially successful.|$|E

5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, a <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> of pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in {{what remained of the}} Empire.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of these collaborations, Rock Steady touches on many musical styles, {{focusing}} on electropop, dancehall, and <b>new</b> <b>wave.</b> The band attempted to capture the vibe of Jamaican dancehall music, and experimented with writing songs without its standard instrumentation.

5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock explosion of the late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and <b>New</b> <b>Wave</b> of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting in short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth.
