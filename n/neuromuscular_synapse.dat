25|$|The {{red-headed}} krait is {{an extremely}} venomous snake, although bites are reported rarely. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their own. When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles {{are the first to}} suffer: the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may have a real struggle to keep his or her eyelids open. This medical condition is known as bilateral ptosis and it is a classic, tell-tale sign of severe envenomation. Other common symptoms include diplopia, dysphagia, vomiting, headache, and hypersalivation. Sometime later the symptoms of paralysis tend to worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing. Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed κ-flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of antivenin or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the chemical messenger carrying signals from nerves to muscles at the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse.</b>|$|E

The protein dense projections vary in size and shape {{depending on the type of}} synapse examined. One striking example of the dense projection is the ribbon synapse (see below) which contains a [...] "ribbon" [...] of protein dense material that is surrounded by a halo of synaptic vesicles and extends perpendicular to the presynaptic membrane and can be as long as 500 nm. [...] The glutamate synapse contains smaller pyramid like structures that extend about 50 nm from the membrane. [...] The <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> contains two rows of vesicles with a long proteinaceous band between them that is connected to regularly spaced horizontal ribs extending perpendicular to the band and parallel with the membrane. These ribs are then connected to the vesicles which are each positioned above a peg in the membrane (presumably a calcium channel). Previous research indicated that the active zone of glutamatergic neurons contained a highly regular array of pyramid shaped protein dense material and indicated that these pyramids were connected by filaments. This structure resembled a geometric lattice where vesicles were guided into holes of the lattice. [...] This attractive model has come into question by recent experiments. Recent data shows that the glutamatergic active zone does contain the dense protein material projections but these projections were not in a regular array and contained long filaments projecting about 80 nm into the cytoplasm.|$|E

40|$|<b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> {{formation}} is {{brought about by}} a complex bi-directional exchange of information between the innervating motor neuron and its target skeletal muscle fiber. Agrin, a heparin sulfate proteoglycan, is released from the motor nerve terminal to activate its muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) receptor {{that leads to a}} second messenger cascade requiring rapsyn to ultimately bring about AChR clustering in the muscle membrane. Rapsyn performs many functions in skeletal muscle. First, rapsyn and AChRs co-target to the postsynatic apparatus. Second, rapsyn may self associate to stabilize and promote AChR clustering. Third, rapsyn is essential for AChR cluster formation. Fourth, rapsyn is required to transduce the agrin-evoked MuSK phosphorylation signal to AChRs. Finally, rapsyn links AChRs to the utrophin-associated complex, which appears to be required for AChR stabilization as well as maturation of the neuromuscular junction.

40|$|Agrin is a {{proteoglycan}} secreted by motor neurite terminals that {{functions to}} initiate and maintain AChR clusters at the nerve terminal. This {{led to the}} theory that neurite terminals decide where <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapses</b> form by secreting agrin. However, initiation of AChR clustering occurs {{in the absence of}} the innervating motoneuron and in the absence of agrin. In this instance, the muscle, not the nerve, is deciding the location of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapses</b> by drawing neurite terminals towards pre-existing AChR clusters. If this were true, one would expect the initial innervation patterns to be the same in agrin-deficient mice and wild-type mice. To test this we quantified the intramuscular axonal branching and synapse formation in the diaphragm at E 14. 5 in agrin-deficient mice and wild-type mice. Heterozygote mothers were anaesthetised with Nembutal (30 mg) and killed via cervical dislocation. In the diaphragm, the nerve trunk runs down the centre of the muscle and extends branches primarily toward the lateral side. In agrin-deficient mice however, we found significantly more branches exited the phrenic nerve trunk, branched in the periphery and extended further on the medial side. Moreover, we found that the percentage α-bungarotoxin/synaptophysin colocalisations, markers of pre- and postsynaptic differentiation, respectively, was the same in agrin-deficient mice and wild-type mice.

Interestingly, also in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Sema 3 A is expressed at NMJs of fast-fatigable muscle fibers.

40|$|The {{specificity}} of synaptic connections {{that is essential}} for nervous system function arises during development {{through a series of}} events, including axon outgrowth, pathway selection, target selection, and synaptogenesis. The <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> between spinal motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers is one of the model systems most widely used to study these events. Using the zebrafish <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> as a model, a genetic screen for synaptogenesis mutants was performed. Seven mutants that affect different aspects of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> formation were identified. Identification of the underlying genetic defects in these mutants will extend our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation and function of neuromuscular and other synapses. I further characterized and established a fine map location for one mutant identified in this screen, bossu (bos), which fails to form discrete AChR clusters beneath nerve terminals and, later in development, fails to restrict AChR clusters to synapses. In addition, to better understand the role of AChR clusters in early synaptogenesis in wild type zebrafish, I examined formation and dispersion of AChR clusters during early stages of synaptogenesis, and investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of neuromuscular synaptogenesis in live zebrafish. It was found that motor axon growth cones interact with and precisely contact pre-existing AChR clusters and that they appear to incorporate these clusters into nascent neuromuscular synapses. Thus, it appears that postsynaptic differentiation may precede presynaptic differentiation and play a role in determining the ultimate location of synapses. ...|$|E

FTX selectively and reversibly blocked excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents and potentials in a dose-dependent manner. FTX had no effect on (i) resting and postsynaptic membrane conductance, (ii) postsynaptic L-type VDCC, and (iii) both glutamate- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-induced postsynaptic responses. Mean amplitude and frequency of miniature postsynaptic potentials were unchanged by FTX. The postsynaptic VDCC was inhibited by nifedipine, a selective dihydropyridine antagonist of L-type VDCC, whereas synaptic transmission was unaffected. Transmission was also undisturbed by omega-conotoxin, suggesting that N-type VDCCs are not involved. The peptide omega-Aga-IVA blocked excitatory and inhibitory transmission without affecting postsynaptic VDCC. Synaptic transmission was also blocked by synthetic FTX.

40|$|Precise wiring of neuromuscular {{connections}} requires motor axons {{to navigate}} through the periphery and establish synapses at their muscle targets. While these processes are typically viewed as distinct events, {{they must be}} coordinated to ensure proper matching of pre- and post-synaptic development to achieve a synapse. To explore this relationship, I have taken a genetic approach in the zebrafish to examine the roles of (1) unplugged and (2) increased postsynaptic activity during the development of neuromuscular connections. In developing zebrafish, primary motor axons innervate axial muscle by pioneering projections into the periphery and establishing synapses. Analyses of unplugged mutants reveal dual roles for the unplugged gene in motor axon pathway selection and <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> formation. The unplugged locus generates receptor tyrosine kinase isoforms related to Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK) : unplugged Full-Length (UnpFL) and Splice Variant 1 (UnpSV 1). I demonstrate that UnpSV 1 is an adaxial cell-derived signal that enables pioneering growth cones to choose their axonal path. UnpFL is a MUSK ortholog that directs <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> formation. While unplugged/MUSK is essential for patterning equatorial synapses, which are the predominant form in mammalian muscle, it is dispensable for synapse formation in distributed and myoseptal innervation. Dystroglycans direct an alternative synapse formation pathway sufficient for distributed and myoseptal innervation. These results provide the first genetic evidence that vertebrate <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse</b> formation occur {{in the absence of}} MUSK and that dystroglycans are critical in this process. ^ In examining the relationship between axonal migration and muscle patterning for synaptogenesis, I show that UnpSVI also initiates postsynaptic differentiation. I propose a model in which UnpSVI patterns the prospective synaptic region to coordinate axon guidance and localize postsynaptic components. Activity-dependent processes also coordinately affect pre- and postsynaptic development. Analyses of twister mutants reveal that prolonged neuromuscular activity and impedes pre- and postsynaptic development. These findings underscore the influence of activity during the initial formation of nerve-muscle contacts. Based on these studies, I propose that muscle-derived signaling coordinate motor axon growth and guidance with postsynaptic development. ...|$|E

The latency dispersion was highest in the proximal part (P 90 = 1. 25 ms); it decreased to P 90 = 0. 95 ms in the central part and to P 90 = 0. 75 ms (60 % of the proximal part) in the distal part. In the proximal parts of the long <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>synapse,</b> stimulation-evoked EPCs with long release latencies were eliminated when the intracellular cAMP was increased by β 1 activation by noradrenaline, by the permeable analogue db-cAMP, by activation of adenylyl cyclase or by inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis. This makes the evoked release more compact, and the amplitude of the reconstructed multiquantal currents increases. Protein kinase A is a target of this regulation, since a specific inhibitor, Rp-cAMP, prevents the action of cAMP in the proximal parts and increases the occurrence of long-latency events in the distal parts of the synapse. Our results show that protein kinase A {{is involved in the}} timing of quantal release and can be regulated by presynaptic adrenergic receptors...|$|E
