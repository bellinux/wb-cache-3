5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oboe.|$|E
5|$|According to Watson, {{the most}} {{dominant}} element in the Rommel myth is Rommel the Superior Soldier, the second being Rommel the Common Man, {{and the last one}} Rommel the Martyr. Rosie Goldschmidt Waldeck, writing in 1943, also takes <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image of the general who fought with common soldiers, with an indelible youthfulness and apparent invulnerability.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E

5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720â€“1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E

5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ore but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|They {{went on to}} Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet {{of smoke}} from a {{recently}} active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{there are}} various systems (including solfeggio, sargam, and {{numerical}} sight-singing) that assign specific syllables to different <b>notes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale.

5|$|Bartlett's party now {{consisted}} of eight Karluk crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the {{family of four}} and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, {{was one of the}} few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{of other}} leagues took <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{financial}} boon that followed SEC expansion to twelve teams. Atlantic Coast Conference representatives began discussing expansion to twelve {{schools in the}} first years of the new century, who began publicly pursuing the possibility of expansion anew in 2003. On May 13, 2003, representatives voted in favor of extending invitations to three schools. The only certain school was the University of Miami, while the other two spots were still being debated. Initially, the league favored admitting Miami, Syracuse University, and Boston College. After a month of debate, however, the ACC elected to extend formal invitations to Miami, Boston College, and Virginia Tech, which joined after initially being overlooked. This came years after these schools were considered for ACC membership in the early 1990s but nothing had ever came to fruition. Pittsburgh and Syracuse would also eventually join the ACC after rejections in 1990 and 2003, becoming members in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark is set {{in early}} 2022, predating the storyline of the Nintendo 64 game by one year. Joanna Dark is {{a student at the}} Carrington Institute and she is eager to {{complete}} the final stages of her training. After completing her training successfully, Carrington Institute leader Daniel Carrington sends her on a mission to destroy an illegal cyborg manufacturing facility in the South American jungle. The facility is headed by Mink Hunter, a highly dangerous terrorist whose purpose is to produce high-tech weaponry for terrorist operations. Joanna manages to complete her mission by eliminating Hunter and destroying the entire facility. When Carrington contacts Joanna, she reports that, during her landing in the jungle, she witnessed an aircraft being shot down and made a <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> co-ordinates. Carrington soon learns that there is a UFO in the area at the time and that dataDyne, the world's leading developer of new technology, is getting away with the alien wreckage.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every <b>note</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe KlosÃ© in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E
