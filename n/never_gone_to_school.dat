According to Tapio Helen, the periodical used partly vulgar methods, often publishing obvious falsehoods, for example about the reward offered by Life magazine {{when it was}} already known that the reward was only a marketing trick. In June 1952, BT-Mitteilungen published Traven's [...] "genuine" [...] biography, in which it claimed that the writer {{had been born in}} the Midwestern United States to an immigrant family from Scandinavia, that he had <b>never</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> had had to make his living from the age of seven and had come to Mexico as a ship boy on board a Dutch steamer when he was ten.

40|$|The present {{research}} began with one main question: How can new technolo-gies be effective for poor and illiterate {{children and youth}} in developing coun-tries? We addressed this question through a research-based implementation project in India that included the development of local language multimedia software for literacy; a built-in, user-friendly interface; {{and the use of}} existing computer infrastructure. Two studies were undertaken in Andhra Pradesh state. One included a sample of youth and young adults who had <b>never</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> (or dropped out early) in peri-urban Hyderabad, and the other was composed of young second- and third-grade school children in rural West Godavari district. Based on a short-term intervention program, research results demonstrated a modest positive impact on the learning rate in reading with both groups of learners (when compared with control groups without the multimedia intervention). The ªndings provide support for the view that infor-mation and communications technologies for development can assist in pro-moting literacy among the poorest of the poor. In addition, the present results support the view that the digital divide, as it evolves over time, will only be narrowed when content-based solutions are sensitive to, and built on cultural and linguistic diversity...|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{and use of}} medicinal plants by human beings is ancient and follows them {{since the beginning of}} civilization, and the study of this field is named ethnobotany. This work analyzed two rural populations about cultivation, use and indication of medicinal plants for symptoms and/or diseases which affect families. 35 family farmers from Santa Albertina (SP) and other 35 from Estrela da Ilha Settlement in Ilha Solteira (SP) were studied through a survey directly applied in the rural settlements. As a result, among the farmers from Santa Albertina, on which 85, 72 % of people who answered the questions were women and the predominant education was (74, 28 %) incomplete elementary school. 153 medicinal plant uses were mentioned, referring to 49 different species; while about cultivation 58 different medicinal plant species were found in the studied areas. Among the farmers from Estrela da Ilha Settlement, 48, 57 % of people who answered were women, 31, 43 % were men and 20 % the couple (both answered together); most of them (60 %) didn't complete elementary school (11, 42 %) had <b>never</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> With this group, 170 uses referring to 46 different medicinal plant species; about cultivation, the diversity was bigger in Ilha Solteira (SP), with 75 different species in the studied areas. Among them, the most cultivated plants (Chenopodium ambrosioides L., Cymbopogon citratus (Dc.) Stapf., Mentha sp., Plectranthus barbatus Andr.) were also the ones with the highest use percentage in both towns. In both places, leaves were the most used medicinal plant type and tea was the most used way. About 60 % of the studied farmers use the medicinal plants for treating problems and diseases in pets or cattle. About the use of plants named as medicinal for other purposes, the use of plants as spice was observed in Santa Albertina (SP), while at the Settlement, feeding was the most reported purpose.

O conhecimento e utilização de plantas medicinais pelo ser humano é antigo e o acompanha desde os primórdios da civilização, sendo o estudo dessa área denominado etnobotânica. Este trabalho consistiu em uma pesquisa com duas populações rurais, a respeito do cultivo, utilização e indicações das plantas medicinais para sintomas e/ou doenças que acometem as famílias. Foram pesquisados 35 agricultores familiares de Santa Albertina (SP) e outros 35 produtores do Assentamento Estrela da Ilha, em Ilha Solteira (SP), por meio de questionário aplicado diretamente nos estabelecimentos rurais. Como resultado, entre os agricultores de Santa Albertina, obteve-se que 85, 72 % dos respondentes foram mulheres e a escolaridade predominante (74, 28 %) o ensino fundamental incompleto. Foram citados 153 usos de plantas medicinais, referentes à 49 espécies diferentes; quanto ao cultivo constatou-se 58 plantas medicinais de diferentes espécies nas áreas pesquisadas. Entre os agricultores do Assentamento Estrela da Ilha, 48, 57 % dos respondentes foram mulheres, 31, 43 % homens e 20 % o casal (respostas em conjunto); a maioria (60 %) estudou no máximo até o ensino fundamental incompleto (11, 42 % sem escolaridade). Nesse caso foram citados 170 usos referentes à 46 espécies diferentes de plantas medicinais; quanto ao cultivo a diversidade foi maior em Ilha Solteira (SP), com 75 espécies diferentes presentes nos lotes pesquisados. Dentre estas as plantas medicinais mais cultivadas (Chenopodium ambrosioides L., Cymbopogon citratus (Dc.) Stapf., Mentha sp. Plectranthus barbatus Andr.) foram também aquelas com maior porcentual de utilização, em ambos os municípios. Também nas duas localidades a folha foi a parte das plantas medicinais mais utilizada e enquanto a forma de uso mais empregada foi chá. Em torno de 60 % dos agricultores pesquisados utilizam as plantas medicinais para tratamento de problemas ou doenças de animais domésticos ou de produção [...] ...|$|E
