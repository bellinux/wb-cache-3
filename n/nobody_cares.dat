MPT uses the mathematical concept of variance to quantify risk, and this might be justified under the assumption of elliptically distributed returns such as normally distributed returns, but for general return distributions other risk measures (like coherent risk measures) might better reflect investors' true preferences.|$|E

Charles Warfield, composer of [...] "Baby Won't You Please Come Home", has disputed the song's authorship, asserting {{that he had}} composed it. Warfield copyrighted the song as [...] "I Ain't Got Nobody and <b>Nobody</b> <b>Cares</b> for Me" [...] with David Young and Marie Lucas in 1914. It was introduced by Bert Williams in vaudeville, where {{it was also a}} popular number for Sophie Tucker. The first of many hit records was by Marion Harris in 1917; Harris recorded the song several times afterwards. The 1939 film Paris Honeymoon with Bing Crosby revived the song's success, and Louis Prima recorded an influential arrangement of it in 1944, paired with [...] "Just a Gigolo".|$|E

[...] The encounter between Milano Collection A.T. and Curry Man was also given a 1/2 star rating with Caldwell commenting that [...] "from a viewer's perspective" [...] it was [...] "too short" [...] and that TNA did not give [...] "enough background on Milano" [...] for the viewers [...] "to care about this." [...] Keller gave the contest between Doug Williams and Masato Yoshino a 1 star rating and quipped that the [...] "win gave Team International 2 points, so that meant that in the standings for those who care... wait. <b>Nobody</b> <b>cares?</b> Okay. Never mind, then." [...] As for the contest pitting Kaz against Último Guerrero, Keller said it was [...] "decent action" [...] and gave it 3/4 of a star.|$|E

500|$|The album's release {{generated}} much publicity over a sales {{competition with}} 50 Cent's Curtis. Three months that were {{prior to the}} September 11 release date, West extended his gratitude towards 50 Cent for the enthusiasm and excitement the friendly competition had produced. Though confident that he would emerge victorious, West {{said that he would}} be perfectly fine with losing to 50 Cent, saying that he'd rather, [...] "be #2 on that day rather than come out and be #1 on a day <b>nobody</b> <b>cares</b> about." [...] In an interview for USA Today, 50 Cent expressed his view on the idea of a sales competition, stating [...] "It's great marketing — for Kanye West. But I sell way more records than Kanye West, and I generate way more interest than Kanye West. They think they can match us up, but they'll find out when that week goes by and the sales come back. This is no rivalry." [...] "Mine will sell and his will still be on the shelf," [...] 50 Cent tells ROLLING STONE". On August 10, 50 Cent confirmed during an interview with SOHH that he would end his career as a solo recording artist if Graduation were to sell more copies than Curtis in the United States. However, 50 Cent later retracted his statement within an MTV interview due to his contract agreements with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. [...] But most retailers and radio programmers interviewed pick Kanye, whose current single, [...] "Stronger," [...] is Number Six on BiIIboard's Hot 100 -while none of 50's four singles have climbed higher than thirty-two.

2500|$|During Mack Brown's time at Texas, he {{has only}} lost sixroad games in an opponent's stadium. [...] The Red Raiders are the only team so far to have {{defeated}} the Longhorns twice in road games, and {{they have done so}} in four-year increments with victories in 1998 and 2002. [...] The 2002 game was lost by Texas 42–38, when defensive starters Derrick Johnson, Kalen Thornton, Marcus Tubbs and Nathan Vasher were all injured. [...] Texas' coaching staff said that injuries are not an excuse to lose a ball game. [...] Mack Brown said, [...] "It's still a loss. <b>Nobody</b> <b>cares.</b> [...] I used to talk about injuries all the time, and it does nothing good for your team. Some years you have them, and some years you don't... We've still got a chance for everything after eight games, and that's unbelievable."

2500|$|On February 8, the TNT started {{broadcasting}} {{a so-called}} [...] "Island" [...] sitcom, which though quite traditional in its performance, was very remarkable for its subtext. For {{the first time}} a rating product of the TNT channel parodied the channel’s highly fashionable reality show with a 12-year history ("Dom-2"), doing this in quite a postmodern manner. According to the scenario, a group of participants of a certain reality show [...] "Island", consisting of four guys and four girls, reach a deserted island, where lots of television cameras are hidden in various places. On the first day, something unexpected happens: the entire film crew dies in the explosion of the yacht; which fact the participants of the show understand as a signal for the beginning of the game, and rush to perform sophisticated tasks of the editors and even carry out SMS-votes. They are sure that millions of viewers are watching them, although in reality nobody does and <b>nobody</b> <b>cares</b> about them (more precisely, they are seen by the audience, but a different one, not that of the reality show, but the sitcom audience). Just like the participants of [...] "Dom-2" [...] they unconsciously begin to break up into pairs and [...] "build relationships", although they were not asked to do so. They are accompanied by a local resident, and he alone knows the terrible truth, but he does not speak their language, and they do not understand him. Actually, [...] "Dom-2" [...] as well as some other TNT products are directly mentioned, and even mocked at, by the participants of the [...] "Island" [...] from the very beginning: ...|$|E
