40|$|Three {{identical}} {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) <b>sensor</b> <b>rings</b> {{have been}} inserted in different locations of an ultrasonic wire bonding transducer driver {{in order to measure}} the bonding parameters. Voltage outputs from these three sensors were compared in order to find an optimal position for the sensor placement. One side of the PZT <b>sensor</b> <b>ring</b> is partially coated with a specially designed electrode pattern and the rings are only poled in this small region. With this specific electrode pattern, sensor resonance can be eliminated and the sensor has a flat frequency response. From the sensor signals, different bonding qualities can be distinguished. Hence, the transducer can provide a feedback for real-time bond quality control and thus can be called a ‘smart transducer’. The optimum position is found to be near the back of the transducer if second harmonic detection is used. By placing the sensor at this optimized position, an in situ automatic wire bonding process control system can be implemented. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R

From this, we obtained a thermal conductivity of approximately 2.8  W m− 1  K− 1 and a water heat capacity of 2  MJ K− 1  m− 3 for the filling material of the sandbox, medium-grained sand with a porosity of approximately 30 %. These values match those obtained from laboratory measurements of sand samples. For the Thermocem® cement, which is in between the two TSM tubes, we used a porosity of 10 % and assumed, as plastic tubes enclose it, a very low permeability of 10 − 19 m 2. Its thermal conductivity and heat capacity were 2  W m− 1  K− 1 and 2  MJ K− 1  m− 3, respectively. Its thermal conductivity strongly influenced the temperature gradient of our measurement. Thus, Thermocem® mainly causes the temperature difference between the inner and the outer <b>sensor</b> <b>rings.</b> Those results were inserted into a numerical 2 D model of the TSM with a BHE, as described in “Model set-up” subsection.|$|R

Unlike conventional star networks, the pro-posed network {{is divided into}} several delta regions, each containing only one feeder fiber. This delta-star structure significantly reduces the complexity and implementation cost of conventional star net-works. A concatenated dual-ring structure with the self-healing function is designed to overcome the star’s weakness in reliability. Numerous <b>sensor</b> <b>ring</b> subnets (SRSNs) are utilized to serve {{a large number of}} fiber Bragg grating sensors. Delta regions are parti-tioned upon the criterion of inter-region traffic uniformization; this simplifies the interrogation process and time slot assignment. The reconfigurable function for this multipoint sensor network, which is based on the optical switching technique, is utilized to en-sure service continuity when fibers fail. The protection mechanism is illustrated with several multiple link failure cases. Finally, an ex-perimental network is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and survivability of the proposed sensor network.

Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) has previously been used to provide a measure of particle concentration within moving suspensions. ERT measurements normally employ electrodes around a circular boundary of a container that allows measurement of multiple projections.

An efficient double ring design is developed to lower the influence of external force, acceleration, and ambient light, and to hold the sensor gently and securely on the skin, so that the circulation at the finger may not be obstructed. To better understand the mechanism of motion artifact by external forces, a comprehensive mathematical model describing the finger photoplethysmography was developed and verified by finite element method, numerical simulation and experiments.

Moreover, if the sidebranch is sufficiently flexible, substantial sensitivity gains can be made using this configuration compared with locating the wire on the main pipe. Measurements made in the laboratory on a medium density polyethylene (MDPE) finite pipe with a polythene sidebranch connected to it confirm that the acoustic pressure in the main pipe can indeed be measured on the sidebranch.
