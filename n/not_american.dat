25|$|There is an {{area where}} Nanban is used {{exclusively}} to refer to a certain style, and that is cooking and the names of dishes. Nanban dishes are <b>not</b> <b>American</b> or European, but an odd variety not using soy sauce or miso but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese Goan cuisine. Some of these dishes resemble Southeast Asian cuisines but are so heavily changed to fit Japanese tastes like ramen that they should be considered separate.|$|E

[...] Epps further notes that [...] "as a practical matter, the American-born children receive recognition of their citizenship regardless of the immigration status of their parents." [...] In Epps' opinion, the sponsors of the Fourteenth Amendment [...] "were unwavering in their insistence that the Citizenship Clause was to cover" [...] the children of such undesirable immigrants as Chinese and Gypsies, and he views the Wong Kim Ark ruling as an [...] "unexceptionable" [...] matter of reading the drafters' intent.|$|E

The album had been conceptualised in July 2010, following Lewis' completion of her first tour, The Labyrinth. The album title Glassheart was inspired from a conversation that Lewis had with Ryan Tedder. During the conversation, Tedder asked Lewis about her past experiences with love and life in general. Lewis' response led him to the word [...] "Glassheart." [...] During an interview with Clyde 1 radio, Lewis said [...] "Glassheart represents protecting your heart, yourself and protecting your emotions, its very poignant". On 8 October 2012, a week before the album's UK release, Lewis announced her supporting tour of the same name.

Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was <b>not</b> <b>American.</b> Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without my permission {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.|$|E

While recruiting at Pine Ridge, Captain Richard Henry Pratt met heavy opposition from Red Cloud who was distrustful of white education, and who had no school age children.

[...] American Horse had grown into an influential tribal politician and was the head of a large household with two wives and at least ten children. [...] He had become a sophisticated man who adroitly negotiated his way between the traditional Lakota society and the new white society encircling him. He had become a shrewd politician and his friendliness with whites was a calculation to win concessions for himself and his people. [...] Above all, American Horse prided himself in his sagacity, [...] It was glaring apparent to him that his offspring would have to deal with whites, and perhaps even live with them, whether they liked it or <b>not.</b> <b>American</b> Horse agreed to send two sons and a daughter for first class: Ben American Horse, Samuel American Horse and Maggie Stands Looking.
