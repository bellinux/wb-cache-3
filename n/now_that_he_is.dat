25|$|It was {{revealed}} following Mayweather vs Pacquiao that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury {{to his right}} shoulder while training, and that while it had healed {{in time for the}} fight, he re-injured it during the 4th round. , currently Pacquiao is facing a lawsuit of 5 million dollars by two fans for failing to disclose the shoulder injury in the lead up to his bout with Floyd Mayweather, Jr. Pacquiao failed to disclose the injury to the Nevada State Athletic Commission in the pre-fight injury evaluation. The commission did a standard injury report with Pacquiao filling out the form saying that he had no injuries heading into the bout. Pacquiao said he had sustained the injury weeks out from the fight after the loss to Mayweather. However, after facing lawsuits due to Pacquiao's statement, Pacquiao has said that he sustained the injury during the fight in which it flared up in the 3rd round. The Nevada State Athletic Commission stated and the post fight press conference that they had only just found out about Pacquiao's injury that evening at the post fight press conference. Speculation arose that the injury was an excuse for the loss to Mayweather because Pacquiao did not mention an injury in the post fight interview with Max Kellerman. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum stated that Pacquiao suffered the injury back in 2008 causing even more confusion as Pacquiao just stated that he suffered the injury during the fight <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> facing lawsuits.|$|E

After visiting the dentist and experiencing her own hallucination, in which she performs [...] "...Baby One More Time", Rachel begins dressing more provocatively.

500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the {{original}} episode were seen as vulgar and {{were removed from the}} television broadcast. [...] One of the scenes removed was {{from the beginning of the}} episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as [...] "retarded friend" [...] (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird tasting Smuckers jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the [...] "choose your own ending" [...] text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.|$|E
