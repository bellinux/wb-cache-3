5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total <b>nucleon</b> number of about 60—is usually an {{exothermic}} process that releases {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per <b>nucleon</b> in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lithium {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per <b>nucleon</b> (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per <b>nucleon</b> than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per <b>nucleon</b> than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
50|$|While {{the nuclear}} force is usually {{associated}} with <b>nucleons,</b> more generally this force is felt between hadrons, or particles composed of quarks. At small separations between <b>nucleons</b> (less than ~ 0.7 fm between their centers, depending upon spin alignment) the force becomes repulsive, which keeps the <b>nucleons</b> at a certain average separation, {{even if they are}} of different types. This repulsion arises from the Pauli exclusion force for identical <b>nucleons</b> (such as two neutrons or two protons). A Pauli exclusion force also occurs between quarks of the same type within <b>nucleons,</b> when the <b>nucleons</b> are different (a proton and a neutron, for example).|$|R

50|$|For {{technetium}} (Z=43), {{the valley}} of beta stability is centered at around 98 <b>nucleons.</b> However, for every number of <b>nucleons</b> from 95 to 102, there is already at least one stable nuclide of either molybdenum (Z=42) or ruthenium (Z=44). For the isotopes with odd numbers of <b>nucleons,</b> this immediately rules out a stable isotope of technetium, since there can be only one stable nuclide with a fixed odd number of <b>nucleons.</b> For the isotopes with an even number of <b>nucleons,</b> since technetium has an odd number of protons, any isotope must also have an odd number of neutrons. In such a case, {{the presence of a}} stable nuclide having the same number of <b>nucleons</b> and an even number of protons rules out the possibility of a stable nucleus.|$|R
5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister <b>nucleon),</b> but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium {{isotopes}} found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per <b>nucleon</b> of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common {{in the solar system}} than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in Dubna led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of lead-208 and lead-207 were bombarded with accelerated ions of chromium-54. In total, fifty-one spontaneous fission events were observed with a half-life between four and ten milliseconds. After having ruled out <b>nucleon</b> transfer reactions as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.|$|E

50|$|The nuclear {{system is}} a complex {{physical}} system consisting of <b>nucleons,</b> i.e., protons and neutrons. The quantum mechanical properties of the <b>nucleons</b> include the spin among others. Since the electromagnetic moments of the nucleus depend on the spin of the individual <b>nucleons,</b> one can look at these properties with measurements of nuclear moments, and more specifically the nuclear magnetic dipole moment.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic polarizability {{defined by}} spin {{interactions}} of <b>nucleons</b> {{is an important}} parameter of deuterons and hadrons. In particular, measurement of tensor polarizabilities of <b>nucleons</b> yields important information about spin-dependent nuclear forces.|$|R
5|$|After hydrogen, helium is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, {{which is more than}} 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per <b>nucleon)</b> of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E
5|$|Within the Solar System, the <b>nucleon</b> {{fraction}} of xenon is , for {{an abundance of}} approximately one part in 630thousand of the total mass. Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The abundance of xenon in the atmosphere of planet Jupiter is unusually high, about 2.6 {{times that of the}} Sun. This abundance remains unexplained, but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals—small, subplanetary bodies—before the heating of the presolar disk. (Otherwise, xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz, reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|In the chiral bag {{model of}} the <b>nucleon,</b> the Casimir energy plays an {{important}} role in showing the mass of the <b>nucleon</b> is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the spectral asymmetry is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the baryon number, cancelling the topological winding number of the pion field surrounding the <b>nucleon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{total number}} of <b>nucleons</b> in the {{observable}} universe of roughly the Hubble radius is the Eddington number, currently estimated at 1080. Archimedes' 1063 grains of sand contain roughly 1080 <b>nucleons,</b> making the two numbers relatively equal.|$|R
50|$|Hot {{spots are}} {{a manifestation of}} the finite size of the system: in {{subatomic}} physics this refers both to atomic nuclei, which consist of <b>nucleons,</b> as well as to <b>nucleons</b> themselves, which are made of quarks and gluons, Other manifestations of finite sizes of these systems are seen in scattering of electrons on nuclei and <b>nucleons.</b> For nuclei in particular finite size effects manifest themselves also in the isomeric shift and isotopic shift.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, another force, {{called the}} nuclear force (or {{residual}} strong force) holds the <b>nucleons</b> of nuclei together. This force is a residuum {{of the strong}} interaction, which binds quarks into <b>nucleons</b> at an even smaller level of distance.|$|R
25|$|The {{processes}} {{during which}} two neutrinos (or antineutrinos) are emitted {{is known as}} two-neutrino double beta decay. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle (meaning that the antineutrino and the neutrino are actually the same particle), {{and at least one}} type of neutrino has non-zero mass (which has been established by the neutrino oscillation experiments), then it is possible for neutrinoless double beta decay to occur. In the simplest theoretical treatment, known as light neutrino exchange, the two neutrinos annihilate each other, or equivalently, a <b>nucleon</b> absorbs the neutrino emitted by another <b>nucleon.</b>|$|E

25|$|Typical fission events release {{about two}} hundred million eV (200MeV) of energy for each fission event. The exact isotope which is fissioned, {{and whether or not}} it is {{fissionable}} or fissile, has only a small impact on the amount of energy released. This can be easily seen by examining the curve of binding energy (image below), and noting that the average binding energy of the actinide nuclides beginning with uranium is around 7.6 MeV per <b>nucleon.</b> Looking further left on the curve of binding energy, where the fission products cluster, it is easily observed that the binding energy of the fission products tends to center around 8.5 MeV per <b>nucleon.</b> Thus, in any fission event of an isotope in the actinide's range of mass, roughly 0.9 MeV is released per <b>nucleon</b> of the starting element. The fission of U235 by a slow neutron yields nearly identical energy to the fission of U238 by a fast neutron. This energy release profile holds true for thorium and the various minor actinides as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrostatic}} force, on {{the other}} hand, is an inverse-square force, so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion {{from all the other}} protons in the nucleus.
