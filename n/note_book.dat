25|$|Shape notes {{became very}} popular, {{and during the}} first part of the nineteenth century, a whole series of shape note tunebooks appeared, many of which were widely distributed. As the {{population}} spread west and south, the tradition of shape note singing expanded geographically. Composition flourished, with the new music often drawing on the tradition of folk song for tunes and inspiration. Probably the most successful shape <b>note</b> <b>book</b> prior to The Sacred Harp was William Walker's Southern Harmony, published in 1835 and still in use today.|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained. When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the Kentish <b>Note</b> <b>Book</b> magazine a list appeared with [...] "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff". [...] Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term aptronym is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist Franklin P. Adams. Linguist Frank Nuessel coined aptonym, without an [...] "r", in 1992. Other synonyms include euonym, Perfect Fit Last Name (PFLN), and namephreak. In literary science a name that particularly suits a character is called a charactonym. Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include Charles Dickens (e.g., Mr. Gradgrind, the tyrannical schoolmaster) and William Shakespeare (e.g., the lost baby Perdita in The Winter's Tale). Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do not say anything about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.|$|E

[...] In this comparatively retired sphere he soon found scope for that manifold activity which so prominently characterized his subsequent career. In 1831 he published a tract on tithes, [...] "to correct the prejudices {{of the lower}} order of farmers," [...] and {{in the following year}} a collection of hymns for use in his parish, which had a large general circulation; a small volume of stories entitled the <b>Note</b> <b>Book</b> of a Country Clergyman; and a sermon, The Apostolical Ministry.

The last gave rise to controversy as Hall inaccurately stated that Tabley Old Hall was [...] "ruinous" [...] when at that date it remained in reasonable repair; its owner, Lady Leighton-Warren, complained and it emerged that Hall, whose health was failing, had based his opinion on postcard images without visiting. Hall gave lectures to many local societies on topics ranging across music and literature {{as well as local}} history. Thirty volumes of his unpublished notebooks are archived in The National Archives. These and other unpublished notes include research on medieval architecture, misericords in local churches, Acton and Dorfold Hall, and the history of the Delves family of Doddington Castle.|$|E

2500|$|Medical staff {{tried to}} take an x-ray of Alder's head injury {{but he would not}} remain still and they {{abandoned}} the effort. PC Dawson wrote in his <b>note</b> <b>book</b> at this time that Alder was [...] "heavily in drink" [...] and [...] "typical of people I've seen in the past on amphetamine." [...] Staff eventually decided that they could not administer further treatment to Alder without his cooperation, and the police officers asked if he was well enough to be detained in police custody. The attending doctor agreed that he was. A subsequent (2005) Healthcare Commission report into the medical treatment Alder received described this decision as [...] "flawed...he doctor had yet to make a diagnosis. He was unable to carry out his plan of treatment for Christopher Alder, for example to admit him for observation, x-ray his skull and refer him to a maxillo-facial surgeon. Despite this he decided to discharge him without seeking advice from a senior colleague." [...] This may also have contributed to the police officers' assumption that Alder's condition was not serious. Alder was forcibly removed from the hospital by PCs Dawson and Blakey, with medical staff stating that he was dragged out by his arms, backwards and with his legs trailing on the floor. The police officers, however, stated that Alder had walked out unaided although they had kept a gentle grip on him to prevent him falling and to [...] "guide" [...] him.|$|E
