5000|$|Tylenol [...] is a {{brand of}} drugs advertised for {{reducing}} pain, reducing fever, and relieving the symptoms of allergies, cold, cough headache, and influenza. The active ingredient of its original flagship product is acetaminophen (known in most Commonwealth nations as paracetamol), an analgesic and antipyretic. Like the words acetaminophen and paracetamol, the brand name Tylenol {{is derived from the}} chemical name for the compound, <b>N-aceTYL-para-aminophENOL</b> (APAP). The brand name is owned by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe world faces complex {{challenges}} for chemical hazard assessment. Microfluidic bioartificial organs enable the {{spatial and temporal}} control of cell growth and biochemistry, critical for organ-specific metabolic functions and particularly relevant to testing the metabolic dose-response signatures associated with both pharmaceutical and environmental toxicity. Here we present an approach combining a microfluidic system with H- 1 NMR-based metabolomic footprinting as a high-throughput small-molecule screening approach. We characterized the toxicity of several molecules: ammonia (NH 3), an environmental pollutant leading to metabolic acidosis and liver and kidney toxicity; dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a free radical-scavenging solvent; and <b>N-acetyl-para-aminophenol</b> (APAP, or paracetamol), a hepatotoxic analgesic drug. We report organ-specific NH 3 dose-dependent metabolic responses in several microfluidic bioartificial organs (liver, kidney, and cocultures), as well as predictive (99 % accuracy for NH 3 and 94 % for APAP) compound-specific signatures. Our integration of microtechnology, cell culture in microfluidic biochips, and metabolic profiling opens the development of so-called "metabolomics-on-a-chip" assays in pharmaceutical and environmental toxicology...|$|E
40|$|Acetaminophen (<b>N-acetyl-para-aminophenol</b> (APAP), paracetamol) is a {{commonly}} used analgesic and antipyretic agent. Although considered safe at therapeutic doses, accidental or intentional overdose causes acute liver failure characterized by centrilobular hepatic necrosis with high morbidity and mortality. Although many molecular aspects of APAP-induced cell death have been described, no conclusive mechanism has been proposed. We recently identified TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) -dependent {{activation of the}} pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 homolog Bim as an important apoptosis amplification pathway in hepatocytes. In this study, we, thus, investigated the role of TRAIL, c-JNK and Bim in APAP-induced liver damage. Our results demonstrate that TRAIL strongly synergizes with APAP in inducing cell death in hepatocyte-like cells lines and primary hepatocyte. Furthermore, we found that APAP strongly induces the expression of Bim in a c-JNK-dependent manner. Consequently, TRAIL- or Bim-deficient mice were substantially protected from APAP-induced liver damage. This study identifies the TRAIL-JNK-Bim axis as a novel target {{in the treatment of}} APAP-induced liver damage and substantiates its general role in hepatocyte death...|$|E
40|$|Pain {{relievers}} containing <b>N-acetyl-para-aminophenol,</b> {{also called}} APAP, acetaminophen or paracetamol, {{in combination with}} opioid narcotics are top-selling pharmaceuticals in the U. S. Individuals who abuse these drugs {{for as little as}} sixty days can develop tinnitus and progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Recently published studies indicate that APAP and its metabolic product N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) are the primary ototoxic agents in this type of pain relievers. However, the mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of these drugs on auditory cells remain to be fully characterized. In this study, we report cellular, genomic, and proteomic experiments revealing that cytotoxicity by APAP and NAPQI involves two different pathways in Immortomouse™-derived HEI-OC 1 cells, implicating ROS overproduction, alterations in ER morphology, redistribution of intra-cisternal chaperones, activation of the eIF 2 α-CHOP pathway, as well as changes in ER stress and protein folding response markers. Thus, both oxidative and ER stress are part of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the cytotoxic effects of APAP and NAPQI in these cells. We suggest that these invitro findings should be taken into consideration when designing pharmacological strategies aimed at preventing the toxic effects of these drugs on the auditory system. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Cysteine (Cys), a conditionally {{indispensable}} amino acid, {{is required}} for the detoxification of paracetamol (acetaminophen, <b>N-acetyl-para-aminophenol,</b> 4 -hydroxy-acetanilide, APAP), a drug of widespread use in older persons. We recently reported that repeated APAP cures could worsen sarcopenia in old rats, likely to be due to the impairment of Cys/GSH homoeostasis. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate whether a dietary Cys supplementation during APAP cures could improve Cys/GSH homoeostasis and thus preserve skeletal muscle. Male 21 · 5 -month-old Wistar rats received three 2 -week-long cures of APAP (1 % of diet) alone or with extra Cys (0 · 5 % of diet), intercalated with washout periods of 2 weeks (APAP and APAP-Cys groups, respectively). They were compared with untreated control rats (CT group). CT and APAP-Cys groups were pair-fed to the APAP group. Dietary Cys supplementation was efficient to prevent increase in liver mass (P< 0 · 0001), decrease in liver GSH (P< 0 · 0001), increase in blood GSH concentration (P< 0 · 0001), and to some extent, decrease in plasma free Cys concentration (P< 0 · 05), all induced by repeated APAP cures. The addition of Cys to APAP cures decreased plasma alanine transaminase (P< 0 · 05), the fractional synthesis rate of liver proteins (P< 0 · 01), and increased masses of extensor digitorum longus (P< 0 · 01), and soleus (P< 0 · 05), compared with the APAP group. Cys supplementation prevented alteration in Cys/GSH homoeostasis and increased some muscle masses in old rats under repeated cures with a non-toxic dose of APAP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Acetaminophen (<b>N-acetyl-para-aminophenol)</b> is {{the most}} widely used {{over-the-counter}} or prescription painkiller in the world. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver where a toxic byproduct is produced that can be removed by conjugation with glutathione. Acetaminophen overdoses, either accidental or intentional, are the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States, accounting for 56, 000 emergency room visits per year. The standard treatment for overdose is N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), which is given to stimulate the production of glutathione. Methods We have created a mathematical model for acetaminophen transport and metabolism including the following compartments: gut, plasma, liver, tissue, urine. In the liver compartment the metabolism of acetaminophen includes sulfation, glucoronidation, conjugation with glutathione, production of the toxic metabolite, and liver damage, taking biochemical parameters from the literature whenever possible. This model is then connected to a previously constructed model of glutathione metabolism. Results We show that our model accurately reproduces published clinical and experimental data on the dose-dependent time course of acetaminophen in the plasma, the accumulation of acetaminophen and its metabolites in the urine, and the depletion of glutathione caused by conjugation with the toxic product. We use the model to study the extent of liver damage caused by overdoses or by chronic use of therapeutic doses, and the effects of polymorphisms in glucoronidation enzymes. We use the model to study the depletion of glutathione and the effect of the size and timing of N-acetyl-cysteine doses given as an antidote. Our model accurately predicts patient death or recovery depending on size of APAP overdose and time of treatment. Conclusions The mathematical model provides a new tool for studying the effects of various doses of acetaminophen on the liver metabolism of acetaminophen and glutathione. It can be used to study how the metabolism of acetaminophen depends on the expression level of liver enzymes. Finally, {{it can be used to}} predict patient metabolic and physiological responses to APAP doses and different NAC dosing strategies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{repetitive}} duodenal {{application of}} activated charcoal on {{the elimination of}} the elimination of intravenously applied acetaminophen (<b>N-Acetyl-para-aminophenol)</b> The influence of the repeated administration of activated charcoal on elimination of intravenously injected acetaminophen was investigated in an in-vivo model of anaesthetized rats. 40 rats were randomized and divided into four groups of 10 animals, respectively. Concentration of 14 C-marked acetaminophen and its metabolites was measured in plasma, urine and small intestine irrigation samples of all animals. To measure the influence of activated charcoal on elimination of acetaminophen, the small intestine of one half of the animals (n= 20) was perfused with activated charcoal dissolved in polyethylene glycol (PEG) (= gastrointestinal dialysis), the small intestine of the other half (n= 20) was perfused just with PEG. In order to answer the question whether activated charcoal interrupts enterohepatic circulation, half of the rats treated with activated charcoal and half of the PEG-treated animals (n= 10, respectively) were subject to bile duct cannulation; the externalized bile was then quantified for acetaminophen. During a testing period of 3. 5 hours, in the ileal effluent of animals with physiological bile flow, we detected ca. 20 % of the dose administered originally; in the animals subject to cannulation, we found about 7 %. 13 % of acetaminophen and metabolites were found in the externalized bile. Activated charcoal did not influence the exsorption of acetaminophen into the small intestine. Terminal half-life in blood ranged from 35 - 51 minutes, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P= 0. 152). Neither did the Area under curve (AUC) – ranging from 2. 6 to 3. 3 g/min. /l. – show significant variation between groups (P= 0. 392). Concentration of acetaminophen in liver and kidney samples, which were removed post mortem, was very low, ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 6 % of the dose originally administered. Excretion of acetaminophen into urine varied widely (31 - 56 %), correlating with diuresis. The absence of an effect of activated charcoal on elimination of acetaminophen and metabolites may have been caused by exsorption of insufficient amounts into the intestinal lumen...|$|E
