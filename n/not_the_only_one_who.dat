25|$|The fast-fashion brands are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> involve {{with sweat}} factories. The German {{sportswear}} giant, Adidas, was blamed for Indonesian sweatshops in 2000 (Osborn, 2000). Adidas was {{subjected to the}} issues of underpayment, overtime working, physical abuse and child labour. Another sportswear giant, Nike, is recently facing a heavy wave of anti-sweatshops protests in the US. They are organised by the United Student Against Sweatshops (USAS) and were held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike’s contract factory in Vietnam are suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with ‘temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees’(Bain, 2017). Since the 1990s, Nike was reported of employing sweat factories and child labour. Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike’s image has {{been affected by the}} issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers’ life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights (Nisen, 2013). To improve its brand image of being immoral, Nike has been publishing annual sustainable business reports since 2001(Project Just, 2016) and annual corporate social responsibility report continuously since 2005, mentioning its commitments, standards and audit (Nisen, 2013).Yet, the issue of sweatshops continues to bother Nike. Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.|$|E

500|$|... "My Moment" [...] is a self-empowerment {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} in the key of E major, simply using three major chords (E, B, and A, respectively). According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, the song [...] "is addressing all those haters who didn't necessarily get her last viral smash, [...] "Friday". Black starts singing the lyrics [...] "Weren't you {{the one who said}} that I would be nothing?/ Well, I'm about to prove you wrong/ I'm <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> believes in something/ My one wish is about to come true." [...] As the song goes, Black addresses her negative reception even more, singing, [...] "Haters, said I'll see you later/Can't talk to you right now/I'm getting my paper". [...] "My Moment" [...] features a simple mid-tempo melody with a prominent uses of garish keyboards on its background. Uses of pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on Black's vocals were also noticed.|$|E

Hordes of office {{applicants}} came to the White House, which was then open to all who wanted {{a meeting with the}} President. Most of Harrison's business during his month-long presidency involved extensive social obligations—an inevitable part of his high position and arrival in Washington—and receiving visitors at the White House. They awaited him at all hours and filled the Executive Mansion. Harrison wrote in a letter dated March 10, [...] "I am so much harassed by the multitude that call upon me that I can give no proper attention to any business of my own." [...] Nevertheless, Harrison sent a number of nominations for office to the Senate for confirmation during his month in office. The new 27th Congress had convened an extraordinary session for the purpose of confirming Harrison's cabinet and other important nominees, since a number of them arrived after Congress' March 15 adjournment; however, John Tyler would ultimately be forced to renominate many of Harrison's selections.|$|E

Underwood's voice spans from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country noted that the lyrics of the song push [...] "the {{normally}} plucky country superstar to the edge of evil. It's as far as she can go without falling off the cliff of believability." [...] Dukes also described the song as a [...] "mini-movie", in which Underwood sings: [...] "And the preacher said {{he was a good man}} / And his brother said he was a good friend / But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry / Bye, bye / Yeah they took turns laying a rose down / Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground / He's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> had a secret to hide / Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye."

500|$|Concerns {{have also}} been raised over the mixed use of {{taxpayer}} and corporate funding and associated naming rights for sections of the park. While a monument in Wrigley Square honors the park's many private and corporate donors, many park features are also named for their corporate underwriters, with the sponsors' names prominently indicated with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The AT Plaza, The Wrigley Square). Some critics have deemed this to be inappropriate for a public space. Julie Deardorff, Chicago Tribune health and fitness reporter, described the naming of the McDonald's Cycle Center as {{a continuation of the}} [...] "'McDonaldization' of America" [...] and as somewhat [...] "insidious" [...] because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from fast food. Timothy Gilfoyle, author of Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark, notes that a controversy surrounds the [...] "tasteless" [...] corporate naming of several of the Park's features, including the BP Bridge, named for an oil company.

500|$|It took a {{month for}} the project to be {{completely}} storyboarded before any programming work started on it. While the game's design evolved over time, its original plot remained largely intact. Several revisions resulted in some of the already made some graphics and other content being cut from the game, in particular in the final area of the castle's interior (which at first was intended to be much longer and to feature monsters that would guard it, but in the end was reduced to a small area with the task basically limited to finding a secret chamber). The game's story and elements were partially inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , The Snow Queen, and Disney animated films, and relies heavily on surreal humor and slapstick. It contains several Easter egg pop culture references, including the shop called [...] "Benn's Costume Shop" [...] (complete with a costume of Batman), a band named [...] "The Slugs" [...] (consisting of four humanoid slugs), getting into a frozen realm through a wardrobe, and encountering the wreck of Marie [...] Celeste. Curse of Enchantia was described by Stuart Campbell as [...] "a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot." [...] He was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> noted the both games' similarities to each other. Its working title was initially Zeloria, which later caused some confusion as several video game magazines continued to use [...] "Zeloria" [...] as the name of the world in the game (some other magazines also incorrectly assumed Enchantia to be the name of the game's antagonist, who is actually unnamed). Some articles featured an earlier and slightly different version of the plot, which involved a castle of three witches, who needed to drink a special potion every hundred years or else they would turn to dust, and the protagonist Brad's original task involved a rescue of his captured sister Jenny.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{appearing}} in Super Street Fighter IV, Juri was well received by critics. The Escapist described Juri as [...] "jarring", praising Capcom {{for trying to}} take risks with the character design {{but at the same}} time questioning how well the character meshes with Street Fighter IVs main cast. In describing Juri, IGN editor Martin Robinson called her [...] "quite awesome" [...] and [...] "SSFIVs best. IGN editor Ryan Clements stated that he was most excited to try out Juri, attributing this to his [...] "recent fascination with K-pop." [...] He called her an [...] "excellent addition to the roster" [...] after playing a few rounds with her. Street Fighter player Justin Wong described her as [...] "very unique", comparing her to Fatal Fury character Kim Kaphwan. GameSpot editor Ricardo Torres similarly compared her to Kim Kaphwan, also comparing her to fellow Street Fighter characters Rose and M. Bison. He also described her as an [...] "amazingly flexible and sensibly dressed vixen." [...] G4TV editor Matt Keil called her taekwondo-inspired play style [...] "fascinating," [...] calling it [...] "almost reminiscent of a King of Fighters character." [...] Game Informer editor Dan Ryckert called Juri his [...] "personal favorite," [...] citing her fighting style. GamesRadar Michael Grimm chose Alisa Bosconovitch from the Tekken series as an opponent he would like to see Juri battle, commenting that Juri may be at a disadvantage since Alisa is an android and Juri a human. On the other hand, Dave Cook from Now Gamer listed Hwoarang as the opponent he wanted Juri to face as both have similar traits such as being Tae Kwon Do kickboxers. GamePro editor Heidi Kemps commented that [...] "after spending time with her, I think I've found my new favorite Street Fighter IV character." [...] GameDaily editor Chris Buffa described Juri as a [...] "wonderful addition." [...] Similarly, GameZone editor Dakota Grabowski gave [...] "much love" [...] to the addition of Juri to the Street Fighter universe. Hardcore Gamer editor Nicholas J. Martin praised Juri for bringing a [...] "unique mix" [...] to the series. UGO Networks placed Juri at #13 on their list of Top 50 Street Fighter Characters", stating [...] "Juri is a fast and agile cyberneticaly enhanced fighter and during the course of Super Street Fighter IV". 1UP.com listed Juri as one of the characters they wanted to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, adding [...] "Juri is arguably one of Capcom's best fighting games character designs to date and I'm sure I'm <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> wants to see her in more games". Complex ranked Juri as the [...] "31st-most dominant fighting game character", stating [...] "The Juri equation is simply taekwondo + extra perverted creepiness + dat eye = Purple Swag Madness!" [...] WhatCulture ranked Juri as the [...] "10th-greatest female fighting game character of all time", commenting, [...] "Arguably the greatest new addition to the Street Fighter family with the release of IV, Juri's leg-centric combat style fused with some handy psycho powers courtesy of M. Bison make her a joy to play." ...|$|E
