40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{influence}} of founder families in medium-sized manufacturing firms and to investigate the impact of such influence on risk management – more specifically <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedging</b> and speculation. Design/methodology/approach – This empirical study uses survey data and publicly available data for descriptive analysis and ordinary least squares/ordered regression analysis. Findings – The authors find that two thirds of medium-sized manufacturing firms are founder family firms in which the founder of the firm or members of his/her family are active in the management team, are members of the board of directors, and/or are shareholders of the firm. The study finds no difference between such founder family firms and other firms in terms of the use/non-use decision related to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives but a marked difference in terms of the extent decision. Thus, founder family firms tend not only to hedge but also to speculate more extensively than other firms.

40|$|Bank holding {{companies}} (BHCs) in the United States (US) have been recently {{required to report}} <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives in two accounts. One account includes the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives held for trading while the other account contains the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives held for purposes other than trading. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the factors that determine the sizes of these two accounts. We propose that the size of the securities portfolio held for purposes other than trading is an indicator of the magnitude of the hedging operations by a US BHC. In particular, we are interested in the portfolio of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives held for purposes other than trading and we refer to this portfolio as the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives <b>hedging</b> account. Our proposition is consistent with Adkins, Carter and Simpson (2007) who regard the securities that are held for purposes other than trading as primarily used for hedging purposes. Thus, we use the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedging</b> account to study the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedging</b> behavior of BHCs and determine the factors that influence the magnitudes of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedging</b> accounts. Hedging activities in general are very important for practitioners, regulators, and academics as evidenced by the extensive publicity and attention that has been given to interest rate risk and the extensive research that has been done to examine the factors that determine the magnitudes of interest rate hedging activities. Yet, little research has been devoted to examine the factors that determine the magnitudes of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedging</b> activities in US BHCs. One purpose {{of this study is to}} fill this gap in the literature. Similarly, we propose that the size of the trading account of a BHC is an indicator of the magnitude of the trading operations. These operations are attracting the attention of academics, regulators, and practitioners as they can generate significant revenues to BHCs but they are sources of significant risks. For example, much of the surprisingly high revenues reported by major US banks in the first and second quarters of 2009 are credited to trading operations while revenues from other activities were significantly low. On the other hand, trading activities are largely blamed for several catastrophic financial events such as the collapse of the Baring Bank PLC and the financial crisis of 2008 which nearly leads to the collapse of the global financial system. One objective of this study is to improve our understanding of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives trading and the factors that influence the magnitudes of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> trading accounts at US BHCs. Given the importance of the trading operations it is surprising that little research has been done in this area. The results of this study are derived from empirical data observed over the period from 1995 to 2007 inclusive. This data is obtained from the financial reports and statements of US BHCs. We use regression analysis to show that the notional amounts of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives held in the hedging and trading accounts are related to various firm-specific and environmental factors. In particular, we argue that the net asset exposure, which measures the difference between the assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, and the net income exposure, which measures the difference between the interest income and interest expenses denominated in foreign currency, should be significant determinants of the notional amount of derivatives held in the hedging account. We propose that these two factors are indicators of a BHC’s exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> fluctuations and <b>hedging</b> should be designed to offset their influence on the value of assets or level of income. In addition, we propose that a BHC’s size and level of capitalization affect the size of the hedging account. Similarly, we propose that the notional amount of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives held for trading should be related to the same factors. In particular, we argue that the notional amount of derivatives in the trading account is related to the net asset exposure and the net income exposure as they indicate a BHC’s involvement in international operations such as lending, deposit taking, risk management, and correspondent relationships in foreign countries. In our opinion, the larger the involvement in international operations the larger is a BHC’s ability to trade <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives. This study makes several unique contributions. First, it shows that the net asset exposure and the net income exposure have positive and significant effects on both the hedging and the trading accounts. Second, we show that the capital ratio and the magnitude of the hedging and trading accounts are positively and significantly related. In addition, this study confirms that the magnitude of total assets is a positive and significant determinant of BHCs’ <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivative securities held in either the hedging or the trading accounts. This result is consistent with previous studies such as Carter and Sinkey (1998), Brewer, Jackson and Moser (2001), Adkins, Carter and Simpson (2007), and Hassan and Khasawneh (2009) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> (FX) swaps {{as a source}} of funding and as a hedging tool has focused attention {{on the role of the}} FX swap market in the recent crisis. The turbulence in international money markets spilled over into the FX swap market in the second-half of 2007 and into 2008, giving rise to concerns over the ability of banks to roll over their funding requirements and manage their liquidity risk. The turmoil also raised questions about banks'' ability to continue their supply of credit to the local economy, as well as the external financing gap it could create. In this paper, we examine the channels through which FX swap transactions could affect a country''s financial and economic stability, and highlight the strategies central banks can employ to mitigate market pressures. While not offering any judgment on the instrument itself, we show that the use of FX swaps for funding and hedging purposes is not infallible, especially during periods of market stress.

Given that hedging reduces the volatility of cash flows, we ask whether it allows financial analysts to provide more accurate forecasts for firms that hedge than for firms that do not. Three data sources are used to construct the data set for this study: the Edgar database, Compustat and I/B/E/S.

40|$|We examine {{explanations}} for corporate policy choices {{related to the}} use of derivative financial instruments. Recent corporate disclosure requirements allows us to replicate and extend the work of Nance, Smith and Smithson (1993, NSS) using a larger sample. We extend previous research by considering interest rate and <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedging</b> separately, using continuous rather than binary measures of hedging, and including variables measuring level of multinationality and exposure to interest rate and <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate changes. The findings document robust empirical relationships among corporate policy decisions and firm characteristics. In a tobit regression analysis, our results suggest that firms which use more derivatives are more multinational, less liquid, more subject to progressive taxation, less subject ot regulation, and larger. They have more growth opportunities, and issue less debt by foreign operations, to reduce conflicts between bondholders and shareholders, and to reduce the higher default rish associated with lower liquidity. Contray to expectiation, hedging is associated with lower dividen payouts, possibly due to the correlation of dividend payout with growth opportunities. Overall, this study confirms the findings of NSS that the determinants of derivative usage are rish reducing hedges. Our conditional results are stronger for hedgers of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rish exposure than for hedgers of interest rate risk exposure. One possible explanation {{is that there is a}} difference in the level of hedging achieved by the use of different derivatives. <b>Foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> derivatives <b>hedge</b> the exposure created by foreign invenstments and foreign currency transactions. Objectives for using interest rate derivatives are more ambiguous.

40|$|The {{observed}} international home bias {{has traditionally}} been viewed as an anomaly. This paper provides statistical evidence contrary to this view within a mean-variance framework. Two methods of estimating the expected return and covariance parameters are investigated: (i) the traditional Markowitz approach, and (ii) the Bayes-Stein "shrinkage" algorithm. In-sample tests reveal that neither the Markowitz tangency allocation vectors nor the Bayes-Stein tangency allocation vectors are significantly different than a 100 % domestic allocation (i. e. extreme home bias). These results are robust to the shorting of equity and across <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedge</b> strategies. The paper also reports out-of-sample tests with a view toward investment performance. Typically, a 100 % domestic allocation outperforms both the Bayes-Stein and Markowitz tangency portfolios. Overall, the theorized gains to international diversification appear difficult to capture in practice and, hence, investors exhibiting a strong home bias are not necessarily acting irrationally...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedging</b> {{efficiency}} of forward and option currency contracts. Previous studies tend {{to concentrate on}} the risk reducing aspect only. They suggest that options seldom are more efficient in reducing <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk than forwards or futures. The hypothesis of this paper is that this is due to: 1) the use of the variance a a risk measure, or 2) the assumption that foreign cash flows are non-contingent and certain. This paper reports the results of an analysis which evaluates hedging alternatives in an expected value-risk space. Risk is measured by a probability-weighted function of deviations below a specific target level. Furthermore, both contingent and non-contingent uncertain foreign currency cash flows are analysed. The analysis shows that options tend to dominate forward contracts. Hence options tend to be preferable if the investor is concerned about avoiding returns below the target level, while forward contracts tend to be preferable if the investor measures risk by the variance. Finally, the maximum risk reduction from using options or forward contracts is not very large, except if the foreign currency cash flow and the exchange rate are highly (positively or negatively) correlated. ...|$|R

The broadening of India''s foreign investor base, in recent years, has a bias towards hedge funds/unregistered foreign investors who invest primarily via PNs. While tax arbitrage via capital gains tax has almost disappeared since July 2004, it is intriguing to note that since then the demand for PNs has actually increased.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{business}} globalization, many multinational enterprises operating in different nations {{need to deal with}} <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> exposure. <b>Foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> exposure comprises transaction, translation and economic exposures. Moreover, exposure to the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> movement alters a company’s corporate revenue, profit and future cash flow. While many firms focus on transaction exposure, relatively few address economic exposure, altered market shares, sales and competitor actions. Thus, in this dissertation, the objective is to explore a firm’s strategy for managing the risk of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> movement in order to mitigate currency risk and protect corporate profit and value. The strategies explored include <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> exposure <b>hedging</b> with financial derivatives, which is mostly done by firms. Further, the manner in which firms adopt operational and marketing strategies to deal with economic exposure, including operational diversification, operational cost reduction, internal operations and marketing choices, has been discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{variance}} minimizing currency forward hedge of an exporting firm that {{is exposed to}} different sources of risk. In an empirical study, we quantify the corresponding hedge ratios of a "typical" German firm for different hedge horizons. Based on cointegrated vector autoregressive models of prices, interest rates and exchange rates, we show that hedge ratios decrease substantially with the hedge horizon for different currencies, reaching values of one half or less for a ten-years horizon. Our findings can partly explain underhedging of long-term exchange rate exposures and {{have important implications for}} the design of risk management strategies. Corporate risk management, <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, <b>hedging,</b> cointegrated VAR model...|$|R
40|$|This study {{finds that}} {{a sample of}} U. S. -based {{multinational}} corporations (MNCs) with heavy involvement in Europe is less frequently exposed to European currency risk than to non-European currency risk. Furthermore, 60 % of the time, the MNCs without European exposure are found to have non-European exposure. These results are likely due to scale economies in <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> exposure <b>hedging</b> that recently has been suggested in the literature. To the extent that economies of scale in hedging exist, {{it is likely that}} MNCs can achieve these economies in areas where they conduct substantial business activities, thus are more able to justify the necessary hedging programs...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to divide my diploma thesis into two parts: {{theoretical}} and practical. In the theoretical part, I will outlint the area of hedge accounting pursuant to IAS 39 and FAS 133, including distinction between cash flow hedge and fair value hedge. In the next chaper, I will deal with general characteristics of forwards, including their accounting aspects and their valuation methods. In the next chapter, I will deal with selected characteristics of options (e. g., time and intrinsic value of the option {{with the emphasis on}} the accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP). In the next chapter, I will outlint the general aspects of vanilla and exotic options (e. g [...] knock-in and knock-out barrier option and so called "range accruals"). An integral part of this chapter will be formed by the introduction to their valuation (Black-Scholesův model, Garman-Kohlhagenův model, binomic model, method Monte Carlo). In the nexch chapter, I will deal with the general characteristics of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk and related accounting aspects. In the practical part, I will deal with particular examples of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>hedge</b> via forwards and options (including their valuation and accounting recognition pursuant to US GAAP and IFRS) : a) Cash flow hedge through option tunnel, ie., by means of standard put and call option, b) Cash flow hedge through participating forward, ie. combination of put option and forward c) Cash flow hedge throug knock-in forward, ie. combination of knock-in barrier option and forward d) Cash flow hedge through KIKO forward, ie. combination of knock-in and knock-out opce and forward e) Hedge through "range accrual" optio...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradox of}} {{international}} investing is that, although foreign investments deliver diversification benefits {{that help to}} decrease the asset risk of a portfolio, they also introduce <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk. Classic <b>hedging</b> instruments used to hedge this risk have the drawback of hedging not only the risk but the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> returns as well. Volatility swaps are financial instruments that allow the user pure exposure to the volatility of an asset. While most of the published works on volatility swaps have focused on their use as a speculative instrument, this thesis will attempt to show how portfolio managers can use <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> volatility swaps to manage the currency risk from international equity investments...|$|R
