5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal <b>noise</b> <b>power</b> formula is well known today.|$|E

40|$|The Electrooculogram (EOG) {{signal is}} often {{contaminated}} with artifacts and power-line while recording. It {{is very much}} essential to denoise the EOG signal for quality diagnosis. The present study deals with denoising of noisy EOG signals using Stationary Wavelet Transformation (SWT) technique by two different approaches, namely, increasing segments of the EOG signal and different equal segments of the EOG signal. For performing the segmental denoising analysis, an EOG signal is simulated and added with controlled <b>noise</b> <b>powers</b> of 5 [*]dB, 10 [*]dB, 15 [*]dB, 20 [*]dB, and 25 [*]dB so as to obtain five different noisy EOG signals. The results obtained after denoising them are extremely encouraging. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values between reference EOG signal and EOG signals with <b>noise</b> <b>powers</b> of 5 [*]dB, 10 [*]dB, and 15 [*]dB are very less when compared with 20 [*]dB and 25 [*]dB <b>noise</b> <b>powers.</b> The {{findings suggest that the}} SWT technique can be used to denoise the noisy EOG signal with optimum <b>noise</b> <b>powers</b> ranging from 5 [*]dB to 15 [*]dB. This technique might be useful in quality diagnosis of various neurological or eye disorders...|$|R

25|$|One {{more recent}} {{application}} for flash memory is {{as a replacement}} for hard disks. Flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives, so a solid-state drive (SSD) is attractive when considering speed, <b>noise,</b> <b>power</b> consumption, and reliability. Flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high-performance desktop computers and some servers with RAID and SAN architectures.|$|E

These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the <b>noise</b> <b>power</b> within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E

25|$|Development {{measures}} were begun in 1972 with federal financial aid {{granted to the}} Lander for improvement measures relating to towns and villages, and in the 1972 budget, DM 50 million was earmarked, i.e. {{a third of the}} total cost of some 300 schemes. A council for urban development was formed in May 1972 with the purpose of promoting future work and measures in the field of urban renovation. In 1973, the government provided assistance of DM 28 million for the modernisation of old dwellings. New rules were introduced regarding improvements in the law relating to rented property, and control of the rise in rents and protection against cancellation of leases also safeguarded the rights of migrant workers in the sphere of housing. A law of July 1973 fixed the fundamental and minimum requirements regarding workers' dwellings, mainly concerning space, ventilation and lighting, protection against damp, heat and <b>noise,</b> <b>power</b> and heating facilities and sanitary installations.|$|E
500|$|Although {{this work}} by Carson and Zobel was very early, {{it was not}} universally {{accepted}} that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way.

40|$|Linear minimum {{mean-square error}} (L-MMSE) {{equalization}} {{is among the}} most popular methods for data detection in massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems. While L-MMSE equalization enables near-optimal spectral efficiency, accurate knowledge of the signal and <b>noise</b> <b>powers</b> is necessary. Furthermore, corresponding VLSI designs must solve linear systems of equations, which requires high arithmetic precision, exhibits stringent data dependencies, and results in high circuit complexity. This paper proposes the first VLSI design of the NOnParametric Equalizer (NOPE), which avoids knowledge of the transmit signal and <b>noise</b> <b>powers,</b> provably delivers the performance of L-MMSE equalization for massive MU-MIMO systems, and is resilient to numerous system and hardware impairments due to its parameter-free nature. Moreover, NOPE avoids computation of a matrix inverse and only requires hardware-friendly matrix-vector multiplications. To showcase the practical advantages of NOPE, we propose a parallel VLSI architecture and provide synthesis results in 28 nm CMOS. We demonstrate that NOPE performs on par with existing data detectors for massive MU-MIMO that require accurate knowledge of the signal and <b>noise</b> <b>powers.</b> Comment: Presented at the 2017 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers; 5 page...|$|R
40|$|A problem {{occuring}} {{in radio}} astronomy is the detection and cancellation of spatially correlated interfering signals entering via the sidelobes of the telescopes in an array. A complicating {{factor is that}} the <b>noise</b> <b>powers</b> can be different at each telescope.

We derive algorithms to estimate the <b>noise</b> <b>powers</b> and the subspace of interferer signature vectors. Once the subspace is estimated, the interference can be projected out. We compare this method to the conventional multichannel subspace detector and show its robustness to non-identical channels on data collected with the Westerbork radio telescope...|$|R
