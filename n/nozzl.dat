40|$|The {{description}} of the fluid flow solution in a nozzle with help of ANSYS-Fluent software is listed in this article. Self-oscillations of the main hydraulic parameters are consequence of the fluid flow in the nozzle. Input pressure of the water reaches level 10 MPa. This value evokes high speed fluid flow in the nozzle. Fluid is created with the mixture of water air and vapor. For such conditions, {{we need to take}} into account the effect of compressibility in the calculation.

40|$|Sound {{waves on}} a fluid stream, in a de Laval nozzle, are shown to {{correspond}} to quasinormal modes emitted by black holes that are physical solutions in a quadratic curvature gravity with cosmological constant. Sound waves patterns in transsonic regimes at a laboratory are employed here to provide experimental data regarding generalized theories of gravity, comprised by the exact de Sitter-like solution and a perturbative solution around the Schwarzschildâde Sitter standard solution as well. Using the classical tests of General Relativity to bound free parameters in these solutions, acoustic perturbations on fluid flows in nozzles are then regarded, to study quasinormal modes of these black holes solutions, providing deviations of the de Laval nozzle cross-sectional area, {{when compared to the}} Schwarzschild solution. The fluid sonic point in the nozzle, for sound waves in the fluid, is shown to implement the acoustic event horizon corresponding to quasinormal modes.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{to estimate the}} spray distribution of phytopharmaceutical deposits under a spray boom is proposed. It focuses {{on the need to}} take account of the dynamic effects of the forward movement of the boom. These are related both to the horizontal and vertical boom movement and to the influence of aerodynamic factors on the nozzle spray distribution. The distribution of the spray deposits is computed by multiplying the nozzle spray pattern by the time needed to move from one position to the next. Mathematically, this is expressed by a convolution of the trajectory function with the nozzle spray pattern function. The model is validated through a dynamic test bench aimed at reproducing the boom movements observed in the field. The chosen method to measure the distribution of the spray deposits is a chemical dosage of the sprayed potassium chloride (KCl) solution collected in Petri dishes. A pulse width modulation (PWM) nozzle body fitted on the test bench is used to generate a dynamic distribution of spray deposits from which the dynamic two-dimensional <b>nozzl...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract⎯The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze a viscous flow in the {{axisymmetric}} nozzle taken into account the mesh size both in the free stream and into the boundary layer. The resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations is realized by using the finite volume method to determine the supersonic flow parameters at the exit of convergingdiverging nozzle. The numerical technique uses the Flux Vector Splitting method of Van Leer. Here, adequate time stepping parameter, along with CFL coefficient and mesh size level is selected to ensure numerical convergence. The effect of the boundary layer thickness is significant at the exit of the nozzle. The best solution is obtained with using a very fine grid, especially near the wall, {{where we have a}} strong variation of velocity, temperature and shear stress. This study enabled us to confirm that the determination of boundary layer thickness can be obtained only if the size of the mesh is lower than a certain value limits given by our calculations.

40|$|Cavitation {{in various}} nozzles of {{different}} geometries and dimensions, i. e., two-dimensional (2 D) and cylindrical nozzles, and liquid jets {{discharged from the}} nozzles are visualized using a digital camera, and the index for estimating cavitation in a nozzle is discussed. Simultaneous high-speed visualization of cavitation in the cylindrical nozzle and a liquid jet are also carried out to investigate the relation between cavitation and ligament formation. As a result, the following conclusions are obtained: (1) Flow pattern transition in cavitating flows induces the transition in liquid jet patterns. As the liquid flow rate increases, flow patterns of cavitating flows and liquid jets transit from (no cavitation and wavy jet), (developing cavitation and wavy jet), (supercavitation and spray), to (hydraulic flip and flipping jet); (2) When the trace of a cavitation cloud {{comes out of the}} nozzle, a ligament is formed at the liquid jet interface. (3) The collapse of cavitation clouds near the exit and induces ligament formation, which, in turn, causes liquid jet atomization; (4) The causal relationship between cavitation cloud and ligament formation holds not only in the two-dimensional nozzle but also in the cylindrical <b>nozzl...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the spray breakup process of sprays injected from single and two-hole nozzles for gasoline direct injection engines by using 3 -D computational fluid dynamics code. Spray characteristics were ex-amined for spray tip penetration and other characteristics including: the vapor phase concentration distribution and droplet spatial distribution, which were ac-quired using the computational fluid dynamics simulation. Results showed that as the hole-axis-angle of two-hole nozzle decreased, the droplet coalescence in-creased and vapor mass decreased. The spray with cone angle of 5 deg. for sin-gle hole nozzle has the longest spray tip penetration and the spray with the hole [...] axis-angle of 30 deg. and spray cone angle of 30 deg. for two hole nozzles had the shortest one. Also, when the spray cone angle and hole-axis-angle increases from 5 to 30 deg., the Sauter mean diameter decreased for both single-hole and two-hole nozzles used in this study. For a single-hole nozzle, when spray cone angle increases from 5 to 30 deg., the vaporization rate increases very much be-cause of low level of coalescence. The result of model for tip penetration is good agreement with the corresponding experimental data in the literatures.

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{impinging}} liquid jets in electronics {{thermal management}} is attracting some consideration {{due to their}} very high heat transfer coefficients, hot spot targeting capabilities and moderate hydraulic power requirements. In this investigation an experimental study of the cooling capabilities of impinging water jet arrays is presented. Of particular interest here is the influence that the inlet and outlet geometries have on the thermal-hydraulics of jet impingement heat transfer {{with the aim of}} determining practical configurations in which heat transfer to the impinging jets is increased and/or the hydraulic pumping power is decreased. For a square array of 45 jets of fixed 1. 0 mm diameter and fixed interjet spacing of 5 mm, six different nozzle geometries were investigated. The arrays impinged normally upon a heated circular copper surface of 31. 5 mm diameter for a nominal heat flux of 25. 66 W/cm 2. Each array was tested under confined-submerged flow conditions with a constant jet-to-target spacing of 2. 0 mm as well as free-surface conditions with a constant jet-to-target spacing of 20 mm. All nozzles were tested for a Reynolds number range of approximately 800 ≤ Redn ≤ 10000. It has been found that the confined-submerged tests yield greater heat transfer coefficients compared with their free jet counterparts.

40|$|The {{world trade}} in dairy powders has {{consistently}} been increasing {{for the last}} fifteen years. Therefore, there is an obvious need in the dairy industry to develop tools to optimise powder production and control powder structure and functionalities. For this purpose, {{it is necessary to}} better understand the wet agglomeration mechanisms leading to powder structuration in various processes such as spray -drying, with an emphasis on the role of process parameters (operating conditions, physicochemical properties of the inlet food matter, and process design) in the final properties of dried agglomerates. Liquid atomisation, which directlyinfluences the wett ing/nucleation stage of wet agglomeration, has been identified as a crucial step in spray -drying operations: the size of final agglomerates was indeed shown to be highly correlated to the size of sprayed droplets. That is why we intended in this work to focus on the role of process conditions in liquid atomisation. We carried out 148 laser diffraction measurements of the mean size of droplets produced with a bi-fluid nozzle in various process conditions (liquid and air flow -rates) at two different dist ances from the nozzle. Ternary mixtures of water -ethanol - glycerol, along with skim milk concentrates (dried extract ranging from 30 to 40 % (w/w)) were employed to investigate the influence of physicochemical characteristics of the sprayed liquid (surface tension, viscosity, density). Our experimental results were consistent with the pioneer work of Mandato et al. Regarding the predominant influence of operating conditions over liquid hysicochemical properties. In addition, we showed that droplet size increased with the distance to nozzle, indicating that droplet coalescence owing to inertial effects occurs quickly after liquid atomisation at the nozzle outlet. Finally, in order to model accurately the link between process conditions and droplet size, we extended the dimensional analysis approach first proposed by Mandato et al. by introducing key dimensionless numbers (air-to -liquid ratio and aerodynamic Weber number) in the process relationship. This enabled to discuss the relative influence of operating conditions and liquid physicochemical properties on the size of sprayed droplets, {{as a function of the}} distance to the <b>nozzl...</b>|$|E
