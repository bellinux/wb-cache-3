5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 {{to use all}} of the above as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could <b>not</b> <b>place</b> with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz also provided a completely different definition, including all theropods more closely related to Tyrannosaurus than to Eotyrannus. The most recent definition is that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|At the December 2011 IPC Nor Am Cup, Gourley won {{his first}} gold medal in {{international}} competition in the giant slalom, but was beaten by New Zealand's Adam Hall and Australian teammate Toby Kane in the slalom. He competed at a February 2012 World Cup event in Italy in the slalom, but did <b>not</b> <b>place</b> in the event. After sitting in fourth place after his first run, he missed a gate in his second run and was disqualified. He {{won a gold medal}} in the giant slalom with a combined run time of 2:03.15, 0.43 seconds faster than the silver medallists. It was the first gold medal he had won at a World Cup.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} does <b>not</b> <b>place</b> any {{limits on}} the possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll, The Swarm debuted {{at position}} 68 {{out of the}} 365 roller coasters in the poll. When compared with other Wing Coasters debuting in the 2012 poll, The Swarm performed fairly well; X-Flight at Six Flags Great America ranked 58, Wild Eagle at Dollywood ranked 87, and Raptor at Gardaland ranked 113. It did <b>not</b> <b>place</b> in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but made its first appearance in 2015 ranked at 30.|$|E

5|$|Memento was a {{box office}} success. In the United States, during its opening weekend, it was {{released}} in only 11 theaters, but by week 11 it was distributed to more than 500 theaters. It grossed over $25million in North America and $14million in other countries, making the film's total worldwide gross some $40million as of August 2007.

5|$|Much of the Solar System {{is still}} unknown. The Sun's {{gravitational}} field {{is estimated to}} dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do <b>not</b> <b>place</b> it farther than 50,000 AU. Despite discoveries such as Sedna, the region between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, an area {{tens of thousands of}} AU in radius, is still virtually unmapped. There are also ongoing studies of the region between Mercury and the Sun. Objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions.|$|E

In the Canadian market, it peaked on the best seller lists at number one in Maclean's and number two in The Globe and Mail, but did <b>not</b> <b>place</b> on the New York Times Best Seller List in the American market. Some critics found the writing to be typical of Atwood or even one of her finest works, while others found some aspects, like the chorus of maids, disagreeable.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did <b>not</b> <b>place</b> {{it close to}} any other member of the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do <b>not</b> <b>place</b> importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are interwoven together through various combinations. He speculates {{that it was his}} background in graphic design that allowed him to perceive this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and epigraphy.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a small}} {{customer}} base in Japan, Alisia Dragoon sold few copies on its release (April 24, 1992); the console it was made for, the Sega Mega Drive, was not a popular device in Japan, selling 33.5million units (10% of all Mega Drives/Genesis sold around the world). The game was published earlier by Sega for North America and Europe, on March 30. However, it was a subdued release; Sega did <b>not</b> <b>place</b> major advertisements for {{the game in the}} media. To localize the contents for the Western market, the video game publisher made several cosmetic changes to Alisia Dragoon. Instead of a big-eyed heroine drawn in typical anime styling, Alisia was portrayed as a golden bikini-wearing female barbarian on the box covers outside Japan. The Western version of Alisia was likened to the scantily clad females in artist Boris Vallejo's work.|$|E
5|$|Five-time Olympian {{and former}} Louisiana State University athlete Laverne Eve, the oldest Bahamian athlete in the Beijing delegation, {{was the sole}} Bahamian {{participant}} in women's javelin throw. The event's qualification round, which took place on 18 August, included Eve in its second heat. During qualifications, Eve participated in three rounds. She threw the javelin 55.22meters during the first round (placing thirteenth), and improved to 57.36meters in her second round (placing fourth). She threw 55.15meters the third round, but did <b>not</b> <b>place.</b> Out of the twenty-seven participants in the heat, Eve's best time placed her ninth in the event between Cuba's Yanet Cruz (58.06meters on her best attempt) and the Czech Republic's Jarmila Klimesova (57.25meters on her best attempt). Out of all 54 competitors in the qualification round, Eve ranked twentieth. She did not progress to the final round.|$|E
5|$|While fleeing, Stan {{calls his}} mother, who is too busy protesting Terrance and Phillip {{to listen to}} his problems. More than a dozen people have killed {{themselves}} against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing Terrance and Phillip. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill him, but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and <b>not</b> <b>place</b> the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in limbo.|$|E
