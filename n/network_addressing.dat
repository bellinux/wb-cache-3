The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the network card, {{as well as on}} firmware or specialized chipsets. These perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a physical medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the <b>network</b> <b>addressing</b> methods used in the Internet Protocol to link layer addresses, such as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist in the link layer, but are not explicitly defined.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} framework, messages, {{and procedures for}} the Diameter <b>Network</b> <b>address</b> and port translation Control Application. This Diameter application allows per-endpoint control of <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translators and <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> and Port Translators, which are added to networks to cope with IPv 4 address space depletion. This Diameter application allows external devices to configure and manage a <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator device [...] expanding the existing Diameter-based Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) and policy control capabilities with a <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator and <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> and Port Translator control component. These external devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network Access Server, or can be more centralized control plane devices such as AAA-servers. This Diameter application establishes a context to commonly identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server and a <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator and <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> and Port Translator device. This includes, for example, {{the control of the}} total number of <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator binding for a particular endpoint. In addition, it allows <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translator devices to provide information relevant to accounting purposes. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.
