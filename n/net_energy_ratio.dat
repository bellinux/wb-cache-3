40|$|In {{the search}} for new {{transport}} fuels from renewable resources, biodiesel from microbial lipids comes into view. We have evaluated the lipid yield and energy use of a process for production of biodiesel from agricultural waste using lipid-accumulating yeast and fungi. We included different bioreactors for submerged and solid-state fermentation in our evaluation. Using existing kinetic models, we predict lipid yields on substrate between 5 % and 19 % (w/w), depending on the culture system. According to the same models, improvement of the yield to 25 – 30 % (w/w) is possible, for example by genetic modifi cation of the micro-organisms. The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> of the non-optimized systems varies between 0. 8 and 2. 5 MJ produced per MJ used; energy use for pre-treatment and for oxygen transfer are most important. For the optimized systems, the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> increases to 2. 9 – 5. 5 MJ produced per MJ used, which can compete very well with other biofuels such as bioethanol or algal biodiesel. This shows that, although quite some work {{still has to be}} done, microbial lipids have the potential to be tomorrow’s source of biodiesel. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|E

The Government of Thailand recently {{has set up a}} production target of 8. 5 Â million liters per day of palm oil-based biodiesel by 2011. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the energy consumption of palm methyl ester (PME) production in Thailand using a life cycle approach compared to other possible oil crops for biodiesel production including jatropha and coconut. The main contributors to the energy use are cultivation, oil production, transesterification and transportation. Taking into account only fossil fuel or petroleum inputs in the production cycle, the energy analysis provides results in favour of PME in Thailand. The net energy balance (NEB) and <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> (NER) of PME and co-products are 100. 84 Â GJ/ha and 3. 58, respectively. The NER of PME without co-products is 2. 42, which is still higher than one indicating a favourable result. The results are important in selecting an appropriate feedstock for biodiesel production and this study will support policy makers in the energy sector to make informed decisions vis-à-vis promotion of oil palm plantation for biodiesel. This will also support the Government of Thailand in its policy to promote the use of indigenous and renewable sources for transportation fuels.

However the viability of these sources is critically dependent on environmental, economic and technological considerations. This paper focuses on the environmental aspect of future photovoltaic (PV) systems which are assessed through life cycle analysis (LCA). Previous LCA studies on commercially available PV systems are reviewed. The sustainable evaluation methods used in these studies are also discussed. These methods are applied to the hybrid quantum dot (QD) -based solar cells currently under development within a project between the University of Manchester and Imperial College London. The aim of this project is to develop affordable solar cells with efficiencies up to 10 % for micro-generation applications. Presently hybrid QD-based solar cells are not commercially fabricated; therefore the study is mostly based on very small laboratory-scale production. For easy comparability 10 % conversion efficiency and 25 years lifetime are initially assumed. Lower conversion efficiencies and shorter lifetimes likely to initially characterise emerging PV technologies such as the hybrid QD-based solar cells are discussed.

The Thai government recently {{has set up a}} production target of 1. 925 million litres a day of sugar-based ethanol. The molasses-based ethanol (MoE) system involves three main segments: sugar cane cultivation, molasses generation, and ethanol conversion. Negative <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> value found for MoE is a consequence of not utilizing system co-products (e. g. stillage and cane trash) for energy. Taking into account only fossil fuel or petroleum inputs in the production cycle, the energy analysis provides results in favour of ethanol. A positive <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> of 5. 95 Â MJ/L which corresponds to 39 % energy gain shows that MoE is efficient as far as its potential to replace fossil fuels is concerned. Another encouraging result is that each MJ of petroleum inputs can produce 6. 12 Â MJ of ethanol fuel. Regarding supply potential, if only the surplus molasses is utilized for ethanol, a shift of 8 - 10 % sugar cane produce to fuel ethanol from its current use in sugar industry could be a probable solution.

The process energy input requirements are {{important factors in}} oil extraction and biodiesel production. This research work investigated oil extraction from flax seeds and compared extraction yield with the energy load. The effect of moisture content on the oil yield was compared between a mechanical oil expeller, organic solvent extraction, organic solvent and microwave assisted, organic solvent and ultrasonic assisted, and combined microwave and ultrasonic with organic solvent. The maximum oil yields % wt/wt from these techniques was 22. 6 %, 36. 3 %, 10. 0 %, 42. 0 % and 27. 8 %, respectively. The moisture content {{had a significant effect}} on oil yield with the mechanical oil expeller, organic solvent method and ultrasonic assisted extraction, whereas no or little effect was found on microwave-assisted extraction. The microwave-assisted extraction showed better results compared with the ultrasonic-assisted and combined treatment methods. The relative energy consumption of these processes was experimentally investigated; <b>energy</b> <b>ratios</b> were calculated based on the amount of energy recovered to the amount of energy supplied to the flax seed for oil extraction.

In plant production, <b>energy</b> <b>ratios</b> and <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> were assessed as a function of nitrogen fertilization, because indirect energy input in the form of agrochemicals was 5473 % from the total energy input and nitrogen was responsible for the major part of this. The highest <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> was 18. 6 for reed canary grass. As a whole reed canary grass was superior to the other crops, which were barley, spring wheat, spring turnip rape, ley for silage, potato and sugar beet. Reed canary grass and sugar beet gained the highest <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> yields of 111115 GJ ha- 1. The optimum <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> was gained in general with less nitrogen fertilization intensity than farmers use. The <b>energy</b> <b>ratios</b> in pork production varied between 0. 141. 28 depending on what was included or excluded in the analysis and for milk production between 0. 151. 85. Ratios of 1. 28 in pork production and 1. 85 in milk production are unrealistic as they do not give any shelter to the animals, although they can be approached in very low-input production systems. If the ratio is calculated with feed energy content then the ratio is low, 0. 140. 22 for pork and 0. 15 for milk. This shows that animals can convert 1422 percent of the input energy to usable products. In pork production, the largest portion of the energy input was the ventilation of the building. In milk production milking and cooling consumes a lot of energy and for this reason the electricity consumption is high. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to assess the energy and {{environmental}} benefits of cultivating hybrid poplars as a biomass crop for cellulosic ethanol. A "Life Cycle Assessment" (LCA) methodology is used to systematically evaluate the hybrid poplar's energy input and output as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The system boundary is divided into three sections, agriculture, transportation, and ethanol processing. In this LCA, only energy from fossil fuels is accounted for, and only energy yield from ethanol yield is considered. Energy demands and associated emissions for all operations are divided equally over the total biomass harvested over a 10 year timeline. Ultimately, the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio,</b> the amount of clean energy produced over the amount of fossil fuels consumed, and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during the cultivation process is compared to those of current forms of fuel and other renewable resources. The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> was calculated to be in the range of 5. 82 to 8. 55, which was found to be higher than both gasoline and corn ethanol. (cont.) The carbon dioxide emission was calculated to be in the range of 2. 42 to 3. 55 grams CO 2 per MJ output, and was lower than the net emissions of both gasoline and corn ethanol.

EDI removed 95 % and 76 % ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 +-N) from diluted (0. 025 M) to concentrated (0. 5 M) synthetic ammonium wastewaters, respectively, accompanied by hydrogen production. SOFCs converted the recovered fuels, biogas mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide, to electricity.

The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> for the photobioreactor reactor {{proved to be}} a negative value considering energy requirements in its construction and material production. <b>Net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> depends on many factors such as the cultivation, harvesting, production and processing methods and can vary from each process [201]. For instance, the US DOE reported in the algal biodiesel production roadmap as follows: The energy content of most algae cells is of the order of 5 watt-hours/gram if the energy content of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins and the typical percentage of each in algae are considered [202]. It is possible to estimate the energy requirements in watt-hours/gram of algae for harvesting, de-watering, and drying {{as a function of the}} volume percentage of algae in harvested biomass. The energy requirements for flocculation and sedimentation and the belt filter press are expected to be minimal. However, based on the latent heat of vaporization of water at 0.54 watt-hours/gram, energy balance can become an issue in systems that propose to take algal biomass and concentrate / dry it to enable downstream processing and extraction because of the high volumes of water that must be evaporated away. In spite of gaps in data precluding more detailed analyses, algal biofuel production schemes at scale will likely need to implement innovative technologies and integrated systems in order to overcome this challenge.

The higher positive value of NREV and <b>energy</b> yield <b>ratio</b> reveal that a low amount of fossil fuels are required to produce 1 Â L of MOE.

The effect of the increased price of molasses and reduced energy consumption in the sugarcane milling and ethanol conversion are found to be significant in determining the energy values and yield ratio of MOE.

30|$|The supply {{status of}} fossil fuel {{resources}} can be measured from two perspectives: the physical perspective (i.e. physical supply; the volume or weight of physical production of the fuel), and the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> perspective (i.e. <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> output of the fuel). The reason why we include the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> perspective in this paper {{is that for the}} society, <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> (i.e. subtracting the energy used in production from the energy produced) is the only true energy. However, most current studies have been conducted only from the physical perspective. In 2011, Hu et al. (2011 a) were apparently the first to introduce the concepts of <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> and energy return on investment (EROI) into China. Some authors use “energy return on energy invested” (EROEI) for the same concept. Several studies appeared after 2011 which discussed the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> or EROI for China’s {{fossil fuel resources}} (e.g. Hu et al. 2011 b, 2013 a, b, 2014 a; Xu et al. 2014). To fully reflect the supply status of fossil fuel resources, the studies from <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> perspective are also reviewed in this paper.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} energy security, production of renewable energies has been highly promoted by governments {{around the world in}} recent years. The typical base of various policy instruments used for this purpose is gross energy output of renewable energy. However, we show that basing policy instruments on gross energy output will result in problems associated with energy waste, economic inefficiency, and negative environmental effects. We recommend using <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> output as the base to apply price or quantity measures because it is <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> output, not gross energy output, which contributes to energy security. The promotion of gross energy output does not guarantee a positive amount of <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> output. By basing policy instruments on <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> output, energy security can be enhanced and the above mentioned problems can be avoided.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> and dietary ractopamine levels for barrows weighing 70 to 100 kg. The 150 pigs investigated (initial weight 70. 80 ± 3. 84 kg) were distributed in a randomized block design with a 5 × 3 factorial arrangement, comprising five levels of <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> (2, 300; 2, 425; 2, 550; 2, 675; and 2, 800 Kcal kg- 1 of diet) and three levels of ractopamine (5, 10, and 20 ppm kg- 1 of diet), with five replicates, and two animals per experimental unit. No interaction (P> 0. 05) was observed between <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> and ractopamine levels. Increasing the dietary <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> levels led to a linear reduction in feed intake, with a linear improvement in feed conversion. <b>Net</b> <b>energy</b> levels had no observable effect (P> 0. 05) on weight gain, final weight, or carcass characteristics. A dietary <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> level of 2, 800 Kcal kg- 1 can be recommended for pigs weighing 70 - 100 kg, improving feed conversion without affecting carcass characteristics, regardless of dietary ractopamine levels. Ractopamine levels above 5 ppm did not affect performance or modify the quantitative characteristics of carcasses, regardless of dietary <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> levels...|$|R
40|$|Bioenergy {{sources are}} {{promising}} alternatives for energy production in a sustainable world. Nevertheless many research and detailed analysis {{are necessary to}} measure in which circumstances they can contribute to it. This paper focuses on microalgae biomass combustion to produce heat and compares the use of different electricity sources with respect to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and <b>Net</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Ratio</b> (NER). Some fossil sources were used as reference. The methodology was based on ISO 14040 / 44 standards {{and most of the}} data were obtained from scientific publications. The results showed that NER from microalgae combustion is still disadvantageous compared to fossil options. Microalgae GHG emissions were higher than fossil using the United States electricity grid but lower using the Brazilian one. Regardless of the fossil options show slightly better yields related to microalgae in the two categories analyzed, the fossil energy technology is mature and has less space for improvements while microalgae is in its infancy and have many technological solutions being developed...|$|E
40|$|Energy and {{environmental}} effects of wheat-based fuel, produced continuously by a Blenke cascade system, were assessed. Two scenarios: (1) no-co-products utilization scenario; and (2) co-products utilization scenario, were compared. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) model was used for analysis. The scope covered a cradle-to-gate inventory. The results from energy analysis showed, that wheat-based ethanol has a positive average net energy value (NEV), NEV = 3. 35 MJ/kg ethanol with an average <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> (NER), NER = 1. 14 MJ/MJ fossils for scenario 1, while for scenario 2, NEV = 20 MJ/kg ethanol with NER = 3. 94 MJ/MJ fossils. The environmental performance analysis indicated that in scenario 1, the strongest contribution to environmental impacts was from the ethanol conversion stage; whereas in scenario 2, it was from wheat production stage. The use of a continuous fermentation system based on Blenke cascade is a promising technology that increases wheat based bio-ethanol’s energy benefits. In addition, the calculated parameters show the potential to significantly reduce emissions level...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{lettuce leaves}} – from the “fresh cut vegetable” {{industry}} – were pretreated with the deep eutectic solvent (DES) made of choline chloride – glycerol. Reaction time (3 – 16 h) and the operation temperature (80 – 150 °C) were investigated. Enzymatic glucose and xylose yields of 94. 9 % and 75. 0 %, respectively were obtained when the biomass was pretreated at 150 °C for 16 h. Sugars {{contained in the}} biomass hydrolysate were fermented in batch cultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum DSMZ 792. The energy consumption and the energy efficiency related to the DES pretreatment were calculated and compared to the most common lignocellulosic pretreatment processes reported in the literature. The DES pretreatment process was characterized by lower energy required (about 28 % decrease and 72 % decrease) than the NAOH pretreatment and steam explosion process respectively. The <b>Net</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Ratio</b> (NER) value related to butanol production via DES biomass pretreatment was assessed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{lifecycle}} wide analysis of the direct and indirect energy inputs and outputs flowing through a bioethanol pathway in Kenya using the life cycle energy assessment technique and energy performance indicators. The study was performed in western Kenya, and data was gotten from a Mumias Sugar Company and Spectre International ethanol distillery. Fertilizers had the largest energy share while industrial chemicals were the least. Indirect inputs had a larger energy share because of co-generation of electricity and steam by bagasse and biogas. The <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> of the system was 1. 5 MJ of ethanol produced per MJ of <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> inputs. The total energy consumed in the system was 13. 6 MJ of inputs per litre of ethanol produced. The primary <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> is much higher at about 4. 2 MJ of ethanol produced per MJ of fossil inputs. The wider implications of the findings were discussed and also suggestions were made on how to improve the results of this assessment. The importance of energy and biofuels in the society were discussed in the introductory chapters and the significance of biofuel assessments to decision making was also discussed...|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed that solar hot water systems save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> requirement of solar hot water systems {{has rarely been}} analysed, including their embodied energy. The extent to which solar hot water systems save energy compared to conventional systems in Melbourne, Australia, is shown through a comparative <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> analysis. It was shown that the embodied energy component of the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> requirement of solar and conventional hot water systems was insignificant.
