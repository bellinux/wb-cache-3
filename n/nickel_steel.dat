5|$|Weissenburg and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm were armored with <b>nickel</b> <b>steel</b> Krupp armor, {{but due to}} {{delivery}} problems, Brandenburg and Wörth were armored with {{a composite}} armor. The composite armor was constructed by layering steel-clad wrought iron plates and wood planks, which was backed by two more layers of sheet iron. Krupp's <b>nickel</b> <b>steel</b> armor {{was based on the}} Harvey process, which enriched the upper layers of the steel with carbon. This type of armor produced greater strength with thinner armor belts, which enabled ships equipped with it to carry more complete protection. Some portions of Brandenburg did receive the new Krupp armor, including the barbettes that held the fore and center main battery turrets. All four ships retained teak backing to their armor belts.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, {{with the exception of}} the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor. The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw <b>nickel</b> <b>steel</b> for their armor from America and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of Krupp cemented armor, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates took longer to produce than planned.|$|E
5|$|Von der Tanns armor {{consisted}} of Krupp cemented and <b>nickel</b> <b>steel.</b> The main belt armor was 80–120mm (3.1–4.7in) thick forward, 250mm(9.8in) thick over the ship's citadel, and was 100mm(3.9in) thick aft. The forward conning tower {{was protected by}} 250mm(9.8in), while the aft conning tower by 200mm(7.9in). The four turrets had 230mm(9.1in) faces, 180mm(7.1in) sides, and 90mm(3.5in) on the roofs. The horizontal armor measured 25mm(0.98in) thick, and the sloping deck armor was 50mm(2.0in) thick. Like the armored cruiser Blücher before her, she was protected by a torpedo bulkhead, 25mm(0.98in) thick. It was set back a distance of 4meters(13ft) from the outer hull skin, the space in between being used to store coal.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{equipped}} with Krupp cemented armor. The level of armor {{protection for the}} Moltke class was increased from the Von der Tann design, to 10cm (3.9in) in the forward main belt, 27cm (10.6in) in the citadel, and 10cm (3.9in) aft. The casemates were protected by 15cm (5.9in) vertically and 3.5cm (1.4in) on the roofs. The forward conning tower was protected by 35cm (14in), and the aft tower had 20cm (7.9in) of armor. The turrets had 23cm (9.1in) on the face, 18cm (7.1in) on the sides, and 9cm (3.5in) on the roofs. The deck armor and sloping armor were both 5cm (2.0in), as was the torpedo bulkhead around the barbettes. The torpedo bulkhead was 3cm (1.2in) in other, less critical areas. As with Von der Tann, the armor was Krupp cemented and <b>nickel</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E

25|$|Two flaws {{emerged in}} Maines protection, both due to {{technological}} developments between her laying-down and her completion. The {{first was a}} lack of adequate topside armor to counter the effects of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns and high-explosive shells. This was a flaw she shared with Texas. The second was the use of nickel-steel armor. Introduced in 1889, <b>nickel</b> <b>steel</b> was the first modern steel alloy armor and, with a figure of merit of 0.67, was an improvement over the 0.6 rating of mild steel used until then. Harvey steel and Krupp armors, both of which appeared in 1893, had merit figures of between 0.9 and 1.2, giving them roughly twice the tensile strength of <b>nickel</b> <b>steel.</b> Although all three armors shared the same density (about 40 pounds per square foot for a one-inch-thick plate), six inches of Krupp or Harvey steel gave the same protection as 10inches of nickel. The weight thus saved could be applied either to additional hull structure and machinery or to achieving higher speed. The navy would incorporate Harvey armor in the s, designed after Maine, but commissioned at roughly the same time.|$|E

25|$|Each graver is {{different}} and has its own use. Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.

Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork.

25|$|The CAB {{investigated}} the accident, {{and as the}} wreckage pieces were reassembled and scrutinized, {{it became apparent that}} a critical 5/16 inch AN-175-21 <b>nickel</b> <b>steel</b> bolt was missing in the elevator boost linkage mechanism. By carefully examining and analyzing the various scuff marks and grease patterns near the missing bolt, the CAB investigators concluded that the bolt had fallen out prior to the aircraft's disintegration and collision with the ground, and not {{as a result of the}} accident itself. Without the bolt in place, the elevator (when in boost mode) and hence the entire aircraft would become uncontrollable, leading the investigators to deduce that the bolt had fallen out, most likely by working itself loose, a short time prior to the beginning of the accident sequence.|$|E

25|$|Jääkarhu {{was also}} the most {{powerful}} steam-powered icebreaker ever commissioned in Finland. Her three triple-expansion steam engines, two with a maximum continuous rating of 2,500 ihp driving four-bladed <b>nickel</b> <b>steel</b> propellers weighing about 11 tons each in the stern at 120 rpm, and one turning a third propeller {{of the same size}} in the bow at 130 rpm with a maximum continuous rating of 2,600 ihp. However, for short periods of time during icebreaking operations, the combined output of the engines could reach 9,200 ihp. Unlike the previous coal-burning icebreakers, Jääkarhu had eight oil-fired boilers with mechanical ventilation that consumed 2.5 to 4.5 tons of fuel oil per hour. Although she was the most expensive to operate, and for that reason she was always the last one to enter service and first one to sail back to her summer moorings, her endurance and range were considerably better than those of the older icebreakers since she could hold nearly 1,000 tons of fuel and required refueling only two or three times during normal winters.|$|E
