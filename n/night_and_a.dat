5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary.

When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} person, however, was arguably Joan Fleming, {{who decided to}} tackle the racial tension in the church head on.

She created programming to address the heritage of all, Italian Night, International <b>Night</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Celebration of Black Heritage (the latter one being an ongoing parish event 20 years later). Her diocesan initiative, “Unlearning Racism,” was first offered at Christ Church. Strides were also made in the liturgy, as music from Lift Every Voice and Sing II was incorporated alongside the classical repertoire {{that had been a}} part of Christ Church’s life during the interim rectorship of Robert Shearer. Also, under Mother Deborah Meister, a Jazz Vespers service was occasionally offered.|$|E

We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand.

25|$|At 9:00 on {{the morning}} of 13 April, the {{traditional}} festival of Baisakhi, Colonel Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that <b>night</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later. Meanwhile, the local CID had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.|$|E
25|$|Great Desert: It {{lies between}} Calormen and the {{northern}} countries of Archenland and Narnia. Located immediately {{to the north of}} the Carlomen capital Tashbaan, the desert can be crossed on horseback in about a <b>night</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> day of hard riding. The desert provides some protection from Calormen invasion since the springs at the great oasis would not be sufficient to enable an army of any size to cross it. This oasis is halfway across the desert; however a secret and well watered valley leads into Archenland. The desert is described as an ocean of sand by Narnians. It can be bypassed by sea as the Calormenes do in The Last Battle. The Hermit of the Southern March lives north of it. Beyond it is Anvard and Narnia.(HHB)(LB).|$|E
