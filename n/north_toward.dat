5|$|Midway between Natural Bridge and Harrisville, NY3 intersects NY812. NY812 turns east onto NY3, {{following}} NY3 northeast into St. Lawrence County before splitting to {{the northwest}} between Harrisville and Pitcairn. Shortly after departing NY812, NY3 enters Adirondack Park. The route follows a largely eastwest routing from its entry point to Tupper Lake, where it merges with NY30. Near Upper Saranac Lake, NY30 heads <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Malone as NY3 continues northeast through nearby Saranac Lake toward Plattsburgh.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} force boarded transport ships {{during the}} afternoon of 13December, and the convoy sailed at midnight. It proceeded to Buna in New Guinea to rendezvous {{with most of the}} escorting destroyers and made a feint <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Finschhafen before turning toward Arawe after dusk on 14December. The convoy was detected by a Japanese aircraft shortly before it anchored off Arawe at 3:30am on 15December, and the 11thAir Fleet at Rabaul began to prepare aircraft to attack it.|$|E
5|$|Around 04:00 on June 25, the KPA's 5th Division {{began its}} first {{attacks on the}} ROK 10th Regiment's forward positions. Three hours later, the 766th Regiment's two battalions landed at the village of Imwonjin, using motor and sail boats to land troops and {{mustering}} South Korean villagers to assist in setting up supplies. The two battalions separated; one headed into the T'aeback Mountains and the second advanced <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Samcheok. At this point, the ROK 8th Division, under heavy attack from the front and aware of attacks in the rear, urgently requested reinforcements. It was denied these reinforcements, as ROK higher commanders informed the division commander that the ROK Army was under heavy attack across {{the entirety of the}} 38th parallel and had no reinforcements to spare.|$|E

5|$|At 21:00, the British moved out. No one {{except the}} commanders {{knew of the}} plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light {{infantry}} with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening. The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> the heights.|$|E
5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being {{driven out of}} Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds of}} their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of defeating Nazi Germany first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia.|$|E

Urban areas transition back into rural areas here. It later intersects SR 305 and SR 5 at diamond interchanges near Cortland. The route then enters Ashtabula County, and travels in a straight line, passing through US 322, a rest area, US 6, and SR 307. Mostly forests and fields are between the highway. The route slowly bends northwest, and meets I-90 at a cloverleaf interchange. The route crosses over Ashtabula River, and bypasses Ashtabula. It ends at SR 531, part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour, at a stop sign.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan's army reached Dinwiddie Court House on March 29. His {{first two}} {{divisions}} went into camp at that location, while Custer's 3rd Division ({{which included the}} 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment) guarded the wagon trains further back at Malone's Crossing. The 3rd Division's Third Brigade, which included the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd West Virginia cavalry regiments, also included the 1st New York (Lincoln) Cavalry. On the next day, Devin's 1st Cavalry Division, and a brigade from Crook's 2nd Division, were sent <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Five Forks. Their reconnaissance found a strong enemy force led by General George E. Pickett, and the Union cavalry was driven back.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Franco–Belgian forces to hold the Ardennes gap was fatal. The Belgians had {{withdrawn}} laterally upon the initial invasion and had demolished and blocked routes of advance, which held up the French 2nd Army units moving <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Namur and Huy. Devoid of any centre of resistance, the German assault engineers had cleared the obstacles unchallenged. The delay that the Belgian Ardennes Light Infantry, {{considered to be an}} elite formation, could have inflicted upon the advancing German armour was proved by the fight for Bodange, where the 1st Panzer Division was held up for a total of eight hours. This battle was a result of a breakdown in communications and ran contrary to the operational intentions of the Belgian Army.|$|E

5|$|The route {{continues}} northeast {{through the}} town of Hannibal {{to the village of}} the same name. Instead of entering the community, NY104 bypasses it to the east. It intersects NY3 east of Hannibal and heads <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Lake Ontario. In the town of Oswego, NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY104A and assumes its northeasterly routing. It is here that the Seaway Trail rejoins NY104. NY104 heads along the Lake Ontario shoreline to the lake-side city of Oswego, the first location with significant development along the route since Williamson. The route intersects Sweet Road, a connector leading to the campus of SUNY Oswego, just west of the city limits.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} the border town of Dryden, NY38 {{emerges from the}} valley and becomes Dryden–Harford Road as it heads northwestward through a more low-lying but still undeveloped area. The highway gradually curves to the <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> the village of Dryden, where the route changes names to South Street upon {{entering the}} village limits. It continues north across Virgil Creek and past three blocks of homes to the commercial village center, where it intersects both NY13 and NY392. The latter begins here and heads off to the east while the former joins NY38 along North Street.|$|E
5|$|Although Zahir was {{bereft of}} friends in Istanbul and Damascus, he was forging a new {{alliance}} with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the Hejaz, Ali Bey al-Kabir. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to Syria for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of Gaza and Jaffa under commander Ismail Bey. Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the Jordan Valley with their armies and moved <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Damascus. They made {{it as far as}} Muzayrib, but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{north into}} the town of Sparta, NY63 runs along {{the east side of}} a wide, rural valley {{surrounding}} Canaseraga Creek, with NY36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY258, a connector to NY36, comes in from the west at the town line. Another long, open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY63 is the primary route to the village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit {{at the point where the}} expressway crosses under NY63. I-390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY63 heads <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route20A (US20A) and NY39 just outside the village limits.|$|E
5|$|K-383 {{begins at}} a four-legged {{intersection}} {{northeast of the}} town of Selden in northern Sheridan County. US-83 heads west toward Selden and Colby and <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Oberlin; K-23 heads south and east toward Hoxie. K-383 heads northeast as a two-lane road immediately parallel to the Kyle Railroad and a couple of miles south of Prairie Dog Creek. The highway enters Decatur County and intersects K-223 north of the village of Leoville and K-123 while passing through the city of Dresden. K-383 and the railroad enter the creek valley shortly before the city of Jennings, through which the road is Railroad Street. The highway separates from the railroad for several miles prior to rejoining at the city of Clayton at the DecaturNorton county line. K-383 leaves the railroad again southwest of the village of Oronoque, heading east then curving north to cross Prairie Dog Creek at its entrance to Keith Sebelius Lake. The highway crosses over the Kyle Railroad before intersecting US-36, with which the state highway runs concurrently east.|$|E
5|$|MD222 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD7 (Broad Street) {{in the town}} of Perryville. The highway heads north as two-lane Aiken Avenue, which reaches its northern end at US40 (Pulaski Highway) immediately to the east of the toll plaza for the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge. MD 222 continues northeast as Perryville Road, which crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The highway curves north and leaves the town of Perryville and passing Perryville High School. MD222 intersects the southern end of MD824 (Reservoir Road) and the entrance to the Perryville Outlet Center before meeting I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. At {{the north end of the}} interchange, the highway briefly re-enters the town of Perryville, intersects the ramps to and from southbound I-95 and the entrance to Hollywood Casino Perryville, and passes wast of a park and ride lot before it reaches a four-way intersection with the northern end of MD824 (Blythedale Road) and MD275 (Perrylawn Drive). MD222Truck follows MD275 <b>north</b> <b>toward</b> Rising Sun, and MD222 turns west onto Bainbridge Road toward Port Deposit.|$|E
