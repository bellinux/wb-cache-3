50|$|Based on {{a survey}} of >800, {{surgical}} removal of the entire involved kidney plus the peri-renal fat appeared curative {{for the majority of}} all types of mesoblastic nephroma; the patient overall survival rate was 94%. Of the 4% of <b>non-survivors,</b> half were due to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatments. Another 4% of these patients suffered relapses, primarily in the local area of surgery rare cases of relapse due to lung or bone metastasis.. About 60% of these recurrent cases had a complete remission following further treatment. Recurrent disease was treated with a second surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy that often vincristine and actinomycin treatment. Removal of the entire afflicted kidney plus the peri-renal fat appears critical to avoiding local recurrences. In general, patients who were older than 3 months of age at diagnosis or had the cellular form of the disease, stage III disease, or involvement of renal lymph nodes had a higher recurrence rate. Among patients with these risk factors, only those with lymph node involvement are recommended for further therapy.|$|E
50|$|Each {{emergency}} situation {{is unique and}} requires four steps, after an emergency has taken place at a university. Universities, such as East Carolina University, has four different steps when approaching {{emergency situation}}s. These steps are known as preparedness/mitigation, response, and recovery. Preparedness and mitigation requires each university to be ready at all times for an emergency situation so that everyone remains calm and order can be reestablished as soon as possible. Communication during the response section {{would be the most}} important factor. During the response situation, {{it is important to have}} an immediate response, in that all help to the emergency situation gets on site as soon a possible to help. The switch from response to recovery is the most important decision of the four steps. This step means the search to help find survivors or even <b>non-survivors</b> is completely over, in which the cleanup and rebuilding process will now begin. Each Step has its own importance and the emergency response process would not work if each step did not cooperate and do its part.

40|$|Background: Hyperglycaemia is {{associated}} with adverse outcomes {{in the intensive care}} unit, and initial studies suggested outcome benefits of glycaemic control (GC). However, subsequent studies often failed to replicate these results, and they were often unable to achieve consistent, safe control, raising questions about the benefit or harm of GC as well as the nature of the association of glycaemia with mortality and clinical outcomes. In this study, we evaluated if <b>non-survivors</b> are harder to control than survivors and determined if glycaemic outcome is a function of patient condition and eventual outcome or of the glycaemic control provided. Methods: Clinically validated, model-based, hour-to-hour insulin sensitivity (SI) and its hour-to-hour variability (%ΔSI) were identified over the first 72 h of therapy in 145 patients (119 survivors, 26 <b>non-survivors).</b> In hypothesis testing, we compared distributions of SI and %ΔSI in 6 -hourly blocks for survivors and <b>non-survivors.</b> In equivalence testing, we assessed if differences in these distributions, based on blood glucose measurement error, were clinically significant. Results: SI level was never equivalent between survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> (95 % CI of percentage difference in medians outside ± 12 %). <b>Non-survivors</b> had higher SI, ranging from 9 % to 47 % higher overall in 6 -h blocks, and this difference became statistically significant as glycaemic control progressed. %ΔSI was equivalent between survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> for all 6 -hourly blocks (95 % CI of difference in medians within ± 12 %) and decreased in general over time as glycaemic control progressed. Conclusions: Whereas <b>non-survivors</b> had higher SI levels, variability was equivalent to that of survivors over the first 72 h. These results indicate survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> are equally controllable, given an effective glycaemic control protocol, suggesting that glycaemia level and variability, and thus the association between glycaemia and outcome, are essentially determined by the control provided rather than by underlying patient or metabolic condition.

40|$|Sepsis causes high {{mortality}} and morbidity. Static lactate concentration and early lactate clearance are cited to be a predictor for sepsis survival. This {{study examined the}} clinical utility of static lactate concentration and early lactate clearance within the first six hours of admission in Emergency Department (ED) to predict 28 -day mortality rate in sepsis patients. Patients who presented with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock and admitted to ED of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre were recruited. Blood lactate concentrations were measured upon admission (H 0), at 1 st hour (H 1) and 6 th hour (H 6), respectively. Either standard treatment of sepsis or early goal directed therapy was initiated according to sepsis severity. A follow-up report was conducted at 28 days via telephone call, e-mail or case notes.

Static lactate concentration appeared to be significantly higher for <b>non-survivor</b> {{as compared to the}} survival group at H 0, H 1 and H 6 (p< 0. 05). The lactate clearance trend reflects no relationship between early lactate clearance and 28 -day mortality.
