5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger <b>national</b> <b>agenda.</b> Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a <b>national</b> <b>agenda.</b> It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the <b>national</b> <b>agenda</b> since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the {{economic}} costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E

Arising from this context, the PAIWD did not explicitly reference Islamic values, and was more closely related to a “development discourse” that formed a crucial element of Mohammad VI’s <b>national</b> <b>agenda.</b> The PAIWD’s main areas of focus were education, reproductive health, the involvement of women in development, and empowerment through legal reforms and a strengthening of political power.|$|E

25|$|In {{the center}} were the conservationists, led by Theodore Roosevelt and his {{coalition}} of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized {{the value of}} natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the <b>national</b> <b>agenda.</b> He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with Gifford Pinchot and used the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000mi² or 930,000km²) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, national parks, and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined.|$|E

500|$|Falun Gong {{initially}} enjoyed considerable {{official support}} {{during the early}} years of its development, and amassed a following of millions. By the mid-1990s, however, Chinese authorities sought to rein in the influence of qigong practices, enacting more stringent requirements on the country’s various qigong denominations. [...] In 1996, possibly in response to the escalating pressure to formalize ties with the party-state, Falun Gong filed to withdraw from the state-run qigong association. [...] Following this severance of ties to the state, the group came under increasing criticism and surveillance from the country’s security apparatus and propaganda department. Falun Gong books were banned from further publication in July 1996, and state-run news outlets began criticizing the group as a form of [...] "feudal superstition," [...] whose [...] "theistic" [...] orientation was at odds with the official ideology and <b>national</b> <b>agenda.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{first real}} {{breakthrough}} {{for the party}} in Norwegian politics came in the 1987 local elections, when the party nearly doubled its support from 6.3% to 12.3% (county results). This was largely as immigration was {{for the first time}} seriously taken up as an issue by the party (although Hagen had already in the late 1970s called for a strongly restrictive immigration policy), successfully putting the issue on the <b>national</b> <b>agenda.</b> Its campaign had mainly been focused on the issue of asylum seekers, but was additionally helped by the infamous [...] "Mustafa-letter", a letter read out by Hagen during the electoral campaign that portrayed the future Islamisation of Norway. In April 1988 the party was {{for the first time the}} second largest party in Norway in an opinion poll with 23.5%. In September 1988, the party further proposed in parliament for a referendum on the immigration policy, which was regarded by political scientists as the start of the party's 1989 election campaign. In 1989, the party made its breakthrough in national politics. In the 1989 parliamentary election, the party obtained 13%, up from 3.7% in 1985, and became the third largest party in Norway. It started to gain power in some local administrations. The first mayors from the party were Håkon Rege in Sola (1988–1989), Bjørn Bråthen in Råde (1990–1991) and Peter N. Myhre in Oslo (1990–1991).|$|E
500|$|The {{reform of}} the spoils system of {{political}} patronage entered the <b>national</b> <b>agenda</b> under the Grant Presidency. Grant and all reformed agreed that the prevailing system of appointments was unsound, for it maximized party advantage and minimized efficiency and the nonpartisan interest of good government. Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure. Grant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. He pushed the initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. [...] Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December, 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions. [...] However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage, meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labelled corruption.|$|E

40|$|With {{the plethora}} of {{articles}} and volumes on the Iron and Bronze Age in Western Europe some might argue {{that the study of}} the first millennium BC is in rude health. Look more closely, however, and deep divisions can be traced between, and within, European first millennium BC studies. Indeed, we might argue that the period has witnessed an increasing theoretical and methodological divide between the approaches taken in different European countries. Varied <b>national</b> <b>agendas</b> and theoretical paradigms have increasingly led to a disjuncture and unfamiliarity between the archaeologies of Europe, even of, and between, areas which are in relative close proximity (Jones and Graves-Brown 1996 : 13). Rather than increasing integration in European archaeologies (Lodewijckx 2001 : 5) we are seeing increasing claims of division (Kristiansen 2008; Harding 2009). At the same time, research has increasingly focused on processes at local or regional scales, while broader geographic approaches and narratives have become perceived as rather old fashioned (Kristiansen 2008 : 14 – 25). Despite this increasing distance between practitioners and practices little attention has been drawn to this as a fundamental challenge for study of the first millennium BC, either in <b>national</b> <b>agendas</b> or wider syntheses...|$|R
