These findings suggest that strategies were not merely used when test takers had a language or content-related problem, but also to sustain or manage and complete the task.

Using entanglement swapping between two temporally separated photon pairs we entangle one photon from the first pair with another photon from the second pair.

50|$|The third type of activity, action (which {{includes}} both speech and action), is {{the means by}} which humans disclose themselves to others, not that action is always consciously guiding such disclosure.

With humans, unlike with other beings, there is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> generic <b>question</b> of what we are, but of who each is individually.

40|$|Over-the-counter (OTC) {{financial}} derivatives are increasingly {{used in a}} globalising financial market as tools for risk management. However, the advent of large financial crises {{as a result of}} their use raises issue as to the risks derivatives themselves might pose to the players who use them, as well as to the international financial system as a whole. It is, therefore, <b>a</b> key <b>question</b> to ask what regulation might be apt for trade in OTC derivatives. This thesis considers how a post-structuralist account might offer important insight into how this question is understood. Post-structuralist, as well as broader social constructivist and non-rationalist critiques help illustrate some of the limits to objectivist rationalism in practices of financial risk management. This thesis argues that the danger of ignoring such critiques include a continued “illusion” of individual and state-actor control over macro-economic processes, such as the phenomenal volume of trade in OTC derivatives contracts today. In this light, therefore, the regulation of OTC derivatives is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> political <b>question</b> of who does and should have explicit policy control over economic and regulatory processes; but it is also <b>a</b> political <b>question</b> over knowledge constructs, and how particular technologies and specialist discourses are developed that enable “experts” legitimacy and power where it is not necessarily justified...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at anyone who is {{interested}} in the role of media as an influence on power and policy. It especially about the role of news journalism, NGOs and other activists who use communication for change. It looks at the context for those actors and their actions. It asks how much the Internet and social networks are changing advocacy. It takes an ethical and political rather than technological or theoretical approach. It ask whether the ‘public sphere’ needs to be redefined. If that is the case, I argue, then we need to think again about journalism, advocacy communications and the relationship between mediation and social, political or economic change. I would identify three overlapping, interrelated media dynamics that might add up to the need for a new notion of the public sphere: the disruption of communication power; the rise of networked journalism; the dual forces for online socialisation and corporatisation. This is not only a theoretical concern. From these dynamics flow all the other arguments about what kind of media we want or need, and what effect it will have on our ability to communicate particular kinds of issues or information. Unless we understand the strategic context of these changes we will continue to make the kind of tactical blunders that Kony 2012, for example, represents.
