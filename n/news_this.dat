25|$|When Meridian {{originally}} won {{the franchise}} in 1991, its plans were to purchase buildings, not unlike its current arrangement today: {{with a small}} studio for continuity and local <b>news.</b> <b>This</b> was planned because, being a publisher-broadcaster, it did not plan to make any programmes itself, instead buying in programmes from independent production companies. However, when TVS lost its franchise, TVS' plans were to become an independent production company based at Vinters Park, Maidstone, site of the former TVS South East division. Meridian {{took the opportunity to}} buy the Southampton studios from TVS.|$|E
25|$|Large {{negative}} earnings surprises {{may have}} legal and reputational costs to managers. Firstly, managers {{can be held}} personally liable if shareholders sue the firm for failing to disclose negative earnings news promptly. Secondly, money managers may choose not to hold, and analysts may choose not to follow, the stocks of firms whose managers have reputations for withholding bad <b>news.</b> <b>This</b> may contribute to managers' voluntary disclosure of information related to negative earnings surprises: quarterly earnings announcements containing large negative earnings surprises are preempted by voluntary disclosures more frequently than are other earnings announcements.|$|E

His father died in September and, a few days later, he received a telegram from Mathilde, announcing that she was pregnant. This situation of responsibility worried Bourguiba who decided, on his return to Paris, to inform one of his friends about the <b>news.</b> <b>This</b> friend proposed that he break up with Mathilde and leave the responsibility of educating the child to her, which Bourguiba refused, stating he was as responsible for that as she was, having the sense of family responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Talon News was {{a virtual}} {{organization}} (with no physical office or newsroom) {{owned by the}} Web site GOPUSA. Robert Eberle is the president and CEO of both GOPUSA and Talon <b>News.</b> <b>This</b> has led to unproven charges that Talon News was created specifically to give Gannon a news organization that he could ostensibly represent, to justify his continuing {{to work at the}} White House. By the middle of February 2005, the Talon News website had shut down indefinitely, according to the message on that site; since May 2007, the Talon News site has been a parody, and its pages link to The Firesign Theatre's site.|$|E

As well as this, on the same day, it was announced that the national weekend editions of Ten News would be timeshifted from Ten onto Ten HD, an hour delayed at 6pm, to directly compete with Seven News and National Nine <b>News.</b> <b>This</b> would have seen Ten News formally broadcast at 6pm for the first time since 1992, however, the timeslot was later amended to 5.30pm.|$|E

25|$|On May 29, 2006, ABC named Charles Gibson as sole {{anchor of}} ABC World News Tonight. Two months later, ABC renamed the program World News with Charles Gibson. In February 2007, the program {{achieved}} {{the number one}} spot in the Nielsen ratings for nightly news broadcasts, overtaking NBC Nightly <b>News.</b> <b>This</b> was ABC's first victory since the week Peter Jennings died in August 2005, {{and the first time}} since 1996. NBC Nightly News subsequently reclaimed the lead and currently maintains a steady lead over the other programs. On September 2, 2009, ABC announced that Mr. Gibson would retire from broadcasting at the end of 2009, and then be succeeded by Diane Sawyer.|$|E
25|$|In June of the {{following}} year, Port Victor was again in the <b>news,</b> <b>this</b> time {{as the result of}} a rough passage from London to Sydney. On 28 May, the ship had run into a gale which tore away the topsails, while heavy seas smashed the port side of the upper bridge, wrecked the forward house on the bridge, and damaged one of the lifeboats. Sheep pens, hen coops, dog kennels and livestock on the ship's deck were swept overboard, and the passenger quarters, including the saloons and cabins, were flooded. A little over a year later, on 8 July 1889, the ship suffered a second accident when she ran aground on a reef off Restoration Island, northwest of Brisbane, on a coal-carrying voyage from Newcastle, NSW to Batavia. The ship was refloated without damage a few days later after the removal of about 200 tons of cargo.|$|E
25|$|ABC took {{an episode}} of The Morning Exchange and {{used it as a}} pilot episode. After very {{positive}} reviews for the pilot, the format replaced AM America in November 1975 as Good Morning America. The first host of the new program was David Hartman, featuring Nancy Dussault as his co-host. Dussault was replaced in 1977 by Sandy Hill. For the first seven years, weather forecasts were presented by John Coleman, former chief meteorologist for ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV in Chicago, who would leave GMA in 1982 to start The Weather Channel with Landmark Communications CEO Frank Batten. Dave Murray (now chief meteorologist at KTVI in St. Louis) provided the forecasts for both Good Morning America and ABC's early morning news program ABC <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning from 1983 to 1986. In August 1986, he was replaced by Spencer Christian, who worked at WABC-TV in New York City and served as fill-in meteorologist for both Coleman and Murray whenever they were away on vacation or assignment.|$|E

5000|$|Chandrapeeda is {{rendered}} unconscious by <b>this</b> <b>news.</b> At <b>this</b> moment, Kadambari (who has told her parents {{that she is}} leaving to see Mahashveta), arrives at the scene, accompanied by Patralekha. They both fall into a swoon after seeing Chandrapeeda lying on the ground. When Kadambari recovers, still thinking that Chandrapeeda is dead, she prepares to immolate herself on his funeral pyre.|$|R
25|$|Throughout its history, {{the station}} has always carried local news programming. Branded {{for years as}} Eyewitness News from 1974 to 1995, its newscasts were retitled as Fox 7 News from 1995 to 1998 {{following}} the affiliation switch to Fox. When WTVW joined Fox, news programming on the station was expanded to two hours on weekday mornings, along {{with the addition of}} a 5 p.m. newscast. Newscasts came and went, with the midday news being cancelled in the late 1990s, later followed by the 5 p.m. and finally, the morning <b>news.</b> <b>This</b> eventually left only the 6 and 9 p.m. newscasts (the 10 p.m. news had earlier been moved into the 9 p.m. slot and expanded to an hour); however, the morning and midday newscasts returned in March 2002. In 2006, the weekday morning newscast expanded to three hours, the midday newscast moved to noon and a 6:30p.m. weeknight newscast was added to the schedule.|$|E
25|$|On 20 January 1966, a Force 8 gale blew up and Mi Amigos anchors {{broke and}} the ship started to drift. This went unnoticed by the crew, who were {{watching}} a programme about the singer-songwriter Donovan, broadcasting having ended. The final song played that night had been Eve of Destruction by Barry McGuire. Dave Lee Travis went aloft to adjust the TV aerial and noticed that the ship was close to shore. He was also unable to see the Radio London ship Galaxy. Walton-on-the-Naze Coastguards were unable to raise the crew, and the tender Offshore One was sent to her aid. One of the methods of alerting the crew tried was an item on the television <b>news.</b> <b>This</b> was missed by the crew as they had turned the television off as they had lost the signal due to the ship moving from its normal position. Mi Amigo was driven ashore at Frinton-on-Sea, Essex and the crew were rescued by Breeches buoy.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after the}} conference, people {{ascribed}} {{a large amount}} of significance to it. According to Paul Berg and Maxine Singer in 1995, the conference marked the beginning of an exceptional era for both science and the public discussion of science policy. The guidelines devised by the conference enabled scientists to conduct experiments with recombinant DNA technology, which by 1995 dominated biological research. This research, in turn, increased knowledge about fundamental life processes, such as the cell cycle. Additionally, the conference along with public debates on recombinant DNA, increased public interest in biomedical research and molecular genetics. For this reason, by 1995, genetics and its vocabulary had {{become a part of the}} daily press and television <b>news.</b> <b>This,</b> in turn, stimulated knowledgeable public discussion about some of the social, political and environmental issues that emerged from genetic medicine and the use of genetically modified plants in agriculture. Another significant outcome of the conference was the precedent it set about how to respond to changes in scientific knowledge. According to the conference, the proper response to new scientific knowledge was to develop guidelines that governed how to regulate it.|$|E
