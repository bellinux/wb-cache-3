40|$|Key {{aspects of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) cycle were investigated in a 1 ha irrigated wheat-maize rotation field at Luancheng in the North China Plain {{to estimate the}} N balance. The main <b>N</b> <b>output</b> items including ammonia volatilization, nitrate leaching, denitrification-nitrification loss, and nitrogen uptake by crop above ground were measured to assess the magnitude of N cycle by different pathway. The main N input items were also investigated, including applied N fertilizer, N in irrigated water and rainfall and N in residue retained to field. The total NH 3 volatilization loss was 19. 7 kg N ha- 1 under wheat and 46. 7 kg N ha- 1 under maize, accounting for 7. 9 % and 27. 4 % of the applied fertilizer N, respectively. Denitrification-nitrification loss was 4. 8 ~ 7. 9 kg N ha- 1 for the maize phase, accounting for 2. 8 %~ 4. 6 % of the applied fertilizer N, which was slightly higher than that from the wheat phase (1. 0 %~ 1. 4 %). While the cumulative nitrate leaching losses were 32 kg N ha- 1 under wheat and 24 kg N ha- 1 under maize, accounting for 12. 8 % and 14. 1 % of applied N, respectively.

40|$|Effects of {{increased}} ammonia and/or arginine absorption across the portal-drained viscera (PDV) on net splanchnic (PDV and liver) metabolism of nitrogenous compounds and urinary N excretion were investigated in six cathetenzed Hereford x Angus steers (501 +/- 1 kg BW) fed a 75 % alfalfa: 25 % (as-fed basis) corn-soybean meal diet (0. 523 MJ of ME/[kg BW 0. 15. d]) every 2 h without (27. 0 g of N/kg of dietary DM) and with 20 g of urea/kg of dietary DM (35. 7 g of N/kg of dietary DM) in a split-plot design. Net splanchnic flux measurements were obtained immediately before {{beginning and ending}} a 72 -h mesenteric vein infusion of L-arginine (15 mmol/h). For 3 d before and during arginine infusion, daily urine voided was measured and analyzed for N composition. Feeding urea increased PDV absorption (P < 0. 01) and hepatic removal (P < 0. 01) of ammonia N, accounting for 80 % {{of increased}} hepatic urea <b>N</b> <b>output</b> (P < 0. 01).

Estimated salivary urea N excretion was not changed by either treatment. Urea cycle regulation occurs via a complex interaction of mechanisms and requires N sources other than ammonia, but the effect of increased ammonia absorption on hepatic catabolism of individual AA {{in the present study was}} not significant...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{communications}} about resource use efficiency and for measures to increase the use efficiency of nutrients in relation to food production. This holds especially for nitrogen. Nitrogen (N) is essential for life and a main nutrient element. It is needed in relatively large quantities for the production of amino acids (protein), nucleic acids and chlorophyll in plants. However excess N is a threat to the environment and potentially to our health. The ambition of the EU Nitrogen Expert Panel is to promote efficient nitrogen use in food production. In this paper we propose an easy-to-use indicator framework for ‘nitrogen use efficiency’ (NUE) that is applicable to all agricultural systems and food systems. It is based on the mass balance principle, i. e. using N input and <b>N</b> <b>output</b> data for its calculation: NUE = <b>N</b> <b>output</b> / <b>N</b> input. NUE values have to be interpreted in relation to productivity (<b>N</b> <b>output)</b> and <b>N</b> surplus (i. e. the difference between total N input and harvested <b>N</b> <b>output).</b> For estimating NUE and communicating the results, data and information are required about (i) the total N inputs into a system and the <b>N</b> <b>output</b> in harvested products, (ii) the nature of the system (e. g. farm, crop system, livestock housing system, food system) and its boundaries, (iii) the time span of the analyzes, and (iv) possible changes in the stock of N in the system. The NUE indicator concept is presented via a two-dimensional input – output diagram. This allows the presentation of NUE, <b>N</b> <b>output</b> and <b>N</b> surplus in a coherent manner, together with possible reference or target values. We show that the NUE concept is applicable to N fertilisation trials, farms and crop production systems at the national level. Changes in NUE over time due to the effects of technical progress, market changes and policy measures can be presented easily in the two-dimensional input – output diagram. The concept allows us to examine differences in NUE between farms, between specific systems, between countries, and between years. NUE can also serve as an indicator for ‘sustainable intensification’ of food production. For proper comparisons, a clear and approved protocol is needed for uniform data and information collection, processing and reporting. Also, the proposed reference values need further underpinning. Nitrogen use efficiency impacts upon many of the recently approved Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the post- 2015 era, for which concrete targets, pathways and indicators need to be developed at country scale and below. The proposed NUE indicator is suitable for setting realistic targets and the monitoring of progress towards these, particularly in relation to SDG 2 (Food and nutrition security), SDG 12 (Sustainable consumption and production), SDG 14 (Marine ecosystems) and SDG 15 (Terrestrial ecosystems) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the bioavailability of D-methionine (Met) relative to L-Met for nursery pigs using the slope-ratio assay. A total of 50 crossbred barrows with an initial BW of 13. 5 kg (SD = 1. 0) were used in an N balance study. A Met-deficient basal diet (BD) was formulated to contain an adequate amount of all amino acids (AA) for 10 – 20 kg pigs except for Met. The two reference diets were prepared by supplementing the BD with 0. 4 or 0. 8 g L-Met/kg {{at the expense of}} corn starch, and an equivalent concentration of D-Met was added to the BD for the two test diets. The pigs were adapted to the experimental diets for 5 d and then total but separated collection of feces and urine was conducted for 4 d according to the marker-to-marker procedure. Nitrogen intakes were similar across the treatments. Fecal <b>N</b> <b>output</b> was not affected by Met supplementation regardless of source and consequently apparent N digestibility did not change. Conversely, there was a negative linear response (P < 0. 01) to Met supplementation with both Met isomers in urinary <b>N</b> <b>output,</b> which resulted in increased retained N (g/ 4 d) and N retention (% of intake). No quadratic response was observed in any of the N balance criteria. The estimated bioavailability of D-Met relative to L-Met from urinary <b>N</b> <b>output</b> (g/ 4 d) and N retention (% of intake) as dependent variables using supplemental Met intake (g/ 4 d) as an independent variable were 87. 6 % and 89. 6 %, respectively; however, approximately 95 % of the fiducial limits for the relative bioavailability estimates included 100 %. In conclusion, with an absence of statistical significance, the present study indicated that the mean relative bioequivalence of D- to L-Met was 87. 6 % based on urinary <b>N</b> <b>output</b> or 89. 6 % based on N retention...|$|R
