5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is <b>no</b> <b>data</b> <b>available</b> on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E

25|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>data</b> <b>available</b> on {{demographic}} {{history or}} trends for Vaishnavism or other traditions within Hinduism. Estimates vary {{on the relative}} number of adherents in Vaishnavism compared to other traditions of Hinduism. Klaus Klostermaier and other scholars estimate Vaishnavism to be the largest. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Vaishnavism tradition is the largest group with about 641 million or 67.6% of Hindus. In contrast, Jones and Ryan estimate Vaishnavism to have perhaps 200 million followers, and it being the second largest tradition of Hinduism after Shaivism. The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy, individuals revere gods and goddesses polycentrically, with many Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Shiva, Parvati and others reverentially on festivals and other occasions. Similarly, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta Hindus revere Vishnu.|$|E

500|$|Since 1996, it {{has been}} rated as a near {{threatened}} species on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} restricted area of occupancy; although it is a widespread species and has been reported as commonly found within its distribution. Additionally, its population trends, declining about 30%, warrants it a near threatened status, nearly meeting the criteria to be rated as vulnerable. It is hunted as a game species and, between 1958 and 1981, annually about 10,000 furs were produced from the Yarkand hare. Human activities such as transportation development and petroleum exploration has led to the population decline of the species. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed it as near threatened, and earlier it had been regionally listed as vulnerable. It occurs in the Aerjinshan, Luobupoyeluotuo, and Talimuhuyanglin Nature Reserves. As the IUCN report notes: [...] "However, increased human activity within its range is undoubtedly impacting this species negatively. At present, there are <b>no</b> <b>data</b> <b>available</b> to quantify ongoing population decline. It is assumed that declines are moderate (approximately 30%) and is therefore, listed as Near Threatened nearly qualifying for listing as Vulnerable (VU) under A2cd. The species occurs only in the widely spaced oases that surround the Tarim â€“ making it highly fragmented; the majority of the desert has no water or vegetation. More data are needed on the actual population level of L. yarkandensis in the oases that define its AOO, as well as whether or not the species is currently poached for food or pelts." [...] Altnough it was regiinally [...] "classified as VU under criteria A1cd (Wang and Xie 2004)" [...] a better criterion A2 was preferrred, as the cause(s) of decline have not ceased and are expected to continue in the future." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Temagami Mining and Milling Company {{operated}} a concentrating plant and worked two shafts, one open cut and one adit from 1905 to 1908. A former railway siding, known as Grey's siding, {{was used to}} ship ore away from the mine site. The shipped ore averaged [...] of gold per ton. Analysis of drill core data ranged from trace to [...] of gold per ton and from trace to [...] of silver per ton. Ore was hoisted by skip then dumped into a Blake jaw crusher at the concentrating plant. It was then dried, passed through roll crushers and elevated to trommels for sizing. The oversized ore passed down through a fine roll crusher. After the reduced ore fragments passed through roll crushers, it was then put through three Kriem air separators in the mill. The ore concentrates from these separators were drawn off and bagged for shipping. A [...] long and [...] wide arsenic vein was also mined during this period. All of the mining infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by a forest fire and operations were not renewed. There are <b>no</b> <b>data</b> <b>available</b> on how much the mine produced. Since the closure of Big Dan, the adit and shafts have been flooded. Remains of the former concentrating plant are also present.|$|E

2500|$|Tomb of the Unknowns marble was quarried {{in seven}} pieces for four layers; cap, die, base and {{sub-base}} (plinth) from Quarry 3 at [...] below the opening from early in 1930 to January 1931. The cap was quarried {{on the first try}} while the base required three attempts. [...] (<b>No</b> <b>data</b> <b>available</b> as to quarrying the plinth). The die was worked by 75 men for one year and three attempts until a 56-ton (55.86 metric) block came out of the quarry in late January 1931. [...] When the block was cut from the mountain it weighed 124 tons (123.69 metric). [...] A wire saw was then brought in to cut the block down to 56 tons (55.68 metric). [...] Because of the weight, Vermont Marble Company sent to the quarry a special derrick that was reinforced and heavily rigged. The initial lift was just enough to clear the quarry floor so the block could hang for 15 minutes while the hoist was inspected for stress. [...] Once out of the quarry, the trip to down to Marble took four days with the die block arriving {{on the grounds of the}} mill site on 3 February 1931. [...] On 8 February, the block was shipped to Vermont for cutting to final dimensions and carving the pilasters and bas-relief. [...] The work was completed in September and arrived at Arlington National Cemetery the same month. [...] Assembly started in September but after the base piece was put in place, imperfections were discovered halting the work until a replacement was received. [...] Three attempts were made before an acceptable piece was quarried. [...] In December, the replacement base arrived and the assembly was completed 31 December 1931. [...] This was followed by the carving work on the die block by the Piccirilli Brothers (who also carved the statue of Lincoln for the Lincoln Memorial) under the supervision of Tomb sculptor William Hudson Jones. When the Tomb assembly was completed 9 April 1932, the structure had the following dimensions.|$|E
