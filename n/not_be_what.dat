While grieving over his mother's death, he attempts to stop his father from taking revenge on humanity, as that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> she wanted, but Dracula attacks him and leaves him injured, forcing him to spend a year recovering. He is eventually reawakened by Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, and after a brief battle, he agrees to aid them in stopping his father.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|The Allied {{general staff}} and key statesmen, after {{capturing}} the original invasion plans, were initially jubilant {{that they had}} potentially won a key victory in the war before the campaign was even fought. Contrarily, General Gamelin and Lord Gort, {{the commander of the}} BEF, were shaken into realizing that whatever the Germans came up with instead would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> they had initially expected. More and more Gamelin became convinced that the Germans would try to attempt a breakthrough by concentrating their mechanized forces. They could hardly hope to break the Maginot Line on his right flank or to overcome the allied concentration of forces on the left flank. That only left the centre. But most of the centre was covered by the river Meuse. Tanks were useless in defeating fortified river positions. However at Namur the river made a sharp turn to the east, creating a gap between itself and the river Dyle. This Gembloux Gap, ideal for mechanized warfare, was a very dangerous weak spot. Gamelin decided to concentrate half of his armoured reserves there. Of course the Germans might try to overcome the Meuse position by using infantry. But that could only be achieved by massive artillery support, the build-up of which would give Gamelin ample warning.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the game. Gerstmann said he had an [...] "outstanding time" [...] with it, {{and that it had}} offered an excellent twist to the genre. De Matos said it had successfully branched out the franchise to a new direction, even though it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> players of the original Syndicate would expect. However, he said the spirit of the franchise is still maintained and preserved. Gaston said Starbreeze was not able to capture the franchise's vision and that the game was not well-executed overall. Whitehead described the game as [...] "fun", even though he thought Syndicate was a forgettable experience that will live under the shadow of rival shooters.|$|E

[...] The Washington Post said: [...] "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her...

500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

500|$|The Bookseller {{called the}} book [...] "the first {{comprehensive}} encyclopedia of its kind". In {{a review of}} the encyclopedia for The Guardian, Andrew Mueller called it a [...] "beautifully-produced tome" [...] and commented that the work [...] "succeeds, as was probably intentional, in offering some fascinating tours of the byways of history and providing a tantalising alternative universe in which much of what you know may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it seems". John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas." [...] Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, [...] "For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, if the truth is out there, the authors are damned if they can find it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{direction}} of the band is dominated by chief guitarist, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter Billy Corgan. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, [...] "The music [...] would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers." [...] Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group's reunion, [...] "Everyone knows Billy doesn't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy —who he has on board." [...] In a 2015 interview Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band [...] "as sort of an open source collective" [...] noting that [...] "It's whoever feels right at the time.". Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him. Music critics were not often fans of Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times article that Corgan's lyrics [...] "too often sound like sophomoric poetry", although he viewed the lyrics of later albums Adore and Machina as an improvement. Corgan responded to DeRogatis' words with [...] "fuck the Sun-Times", at the band's 1993 show at the Metro Chicago.|$|E

[...] When asked about being Muslim, he said: [...] "I don't have any misgiving about my faith. I'm very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world.

2500|$|Recent {{research}} by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> causes some actions to be vetoed {{at the last}} moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea {{that we ought to}} know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it easy to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to [...] "veto" [...] an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|One {{suggested}} that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as [...] "comfortable with spontaneous conversation" [...] {{and be able to}} talk about interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance, and suggested it was important to show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement, and show [...] "social maturity" [...] with sensitivity, empathy for others unlike oneself, and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions. An applicant should have an attitude that was <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> can the college offer but what can the student offer the college, and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere, and show an openness to new ideas, an ability to work cooperatively with others, ambition, and caring about others. Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity; if an interviewer asks a [...] "baiting or leading question", an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective, and to keep trying to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer. Another advisor {{suggested that}} students must be prepared to answer the question What is your biggest failure in an interview. Applicants should avoid sounding snide, annoyed, contemptuous, and avoid describing oneself as humiliated, bored, depressed, angry, shy, inhibited, anxious, frightened, and frustrated, and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell. Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage. Another advisor {{suggested that a}} student try to find a common bond with the interviewer, and send a brief follow-up letter afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the early-to-mid-17th century [...] "continental rationalism" [...] John Locke (1632–1704) proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) a very influential view wherein the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori, i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding {{the proposition that the}} human mind is a tabula rasa, a [...] "blank tablet", in Locke's words [...] "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which {{is very different from the}} quest for certainty of Descartes.|$|E

Unable {{to make it in}} the music business and fearing to lose her integrity, she decides to quit and goes back to Tree Hill with her old best friend, Brooke Davis, and soon moves in with her. Her reunion with Lucas turns out to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> she wished for, as he has a new girlfriend, Lindsey. She still loves Lucas, but temporarily puts those feelings aside to force Nathan to come to terms with what he has become. Finally feeling at home, and with the moral help from Lucas and the financial wealth of Brooke, she starts her own label at TRIC. She recruits her first band, led by a guy named Jason. Things get rocky, and Haley convinces her to fire him and keep Mia, the keyboard player, as Mia is the true heart of the group. Peyton also struggles with her feelings toward Lucas, especially since his girlfriend tries to be nice to her. Peyton soon antagonizes her. After visiting her old house and remembering how she thought she would always be with Lucas, she becomes bitter. This then escalates into a fight with him as he confronts her about not being the same Peyton he used to know; she retorts that he gave up on the two of them. She later reveals to Lucas that she came back to Tree Hill for him and that she still loves him. She kisses him, and he kisses back but when she goes by his house, she finds out he has just proposed marriage to Lindsey. After the initial shock, she tells him that if it is what he wants, she will bury her romantic feelings for him. However, she later winds up lashing out at Lindsey. She regrets her hostile remarks toward Lindsey when she discovers Lindsey's dad died from cancer, which prompts the two to start from a clean slate regarding their interaction. Peyton tricks her former boss into helping her launch Mia under her label.|$|E
