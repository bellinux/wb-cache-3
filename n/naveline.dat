40|$|The Sicily is {{the first}} region for orange {{cultivation}} in Italy. This sector, throughout the ages, has been characterized by a decrease of the invested areas and by a reduction of the fresh product’s demand; in the meantime, the competitiveness of the new producer countries is increased for a better commercial organization and for lower production costs. The aim of the paper {{is to improve the}} knowledge of orange cultivation in Ribera area, in the province of Agrigento (Sicily). It is carried out a microeconomic analysis on a sample of 20 farms to determine profitability of orange cultivation by means of various economic indicators (production costs, profits, net incomes). The business survey has regarded 30 plants, distinguished by the two principal variety of the area: Brasiliano and <b>Naveline.</b> The cropping techniques generally adopted in the farm sample are characterized by high manual labour inputs. This doesn’t depend by the variety, but it’s due to a low mechanization degree of the plants and to a different businessman management. Microeconomic analysis has showed similar average values of the production costs among the two variety. The profit average value, whereas, has resulted more elevated in the <b>Naveline</b> plants than Brasiliano ones, because of the high value of the Gross Saleable Product of <b>Naveline</b> oranges. The net incomes values, finally, are resulted higher in the direct management plants. With regard to commercial aspects, the most part of the farm product has been destined to the national market through some commercialization centres located in the Ribera area. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that exposure of males of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), to the scent of sweet orange increases their mating success relative to non-exposed males. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to the commercial essential oils of bitter orange, mandarin orange, lemon and grapefruit confer to males a significant mating advantage as well. Likewise, exposure to peel-wounded mandarin oranges and lemons, and to peel-wounded sweet oranges of the Merlin, Newhole and <b>Naveline</b> varieties, also conferred a significant mating advantage. Exposure to peel-wounded grapefruits and bitter oranges {{as well as to}} sweet oranges of the local Greek variety Xino Artas enhanced mating success, however, not significantly. These results suggest that the chemicals responsible for mating enhancement in C. capitata are present in several citrus fruit species and varieties. In an experiment involving different doses of commercial sweet orange peel oil, males exposed to medium doses of 12. 5 or 25 l achieved significantly higher numbers of matings with virgin females than control males. Lower doses did not increase mating success, whereas higher doses killed a number of males. In another experiment we tested the effect of the seven most abundant individual chemical compounds of citrus oil (some of them also existing in the pheromone of males) and detected compounds with some potential for further trials. In a final experiment we created a mixture of those compounds (geraniol, -pinene, limonene, -myrcene and linalool) and found that wild or sterile males exposed to it achieved over 70 % of all matings when competing with non-exposed males. Since the mixture did not contain -copaene (an expensive compound that is often invoked as responsible for the phenomenon of mating enhancement) our data could lead in a more cost-effective and efficient implementation of sterile insect technique (SIT) programmes against C. capitata...|$|E
