It lacks the brittleness of concrete and consequently does not need expansion joints. The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.|$|E

5000|$|The {{two basic}} types of {{hydraulic}} limes are <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) and artificial hydraulic lime (AHL): [...] <b>Natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) {{is produced by}} heating (calcining) limestone that naturally contains clay and other impurities: no materials may be added to create the hydraulicity. In the United States NHL may be called hydrated hydraulic lime (HHL) per ASTM C-141 Standard Specification for Hydrated Hydraulic Lime for Structural Purposes. Artificial hydraulic lime (AHL) or artificial lime (AL) becomes hydraulic when hydraulic and/or pozzolan materials are added either before or after burning in a lime kiln. Artificial limes are more specifically identified as hydraulic lime (HL), as defined European Norm 459 (EN-459), [...] "Consists of lime and other materials such as Portland cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials."; formulated lime (FL) (EN-459) consists of [...] "...mainly of hydrated lime and or NHL with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. It is identical to HL but its composition must be declared on the CE marking."; pozzolanic hydraulic lime (PHL) (ASTM C-1707)is [...] "very similar to HL or FL. Consists mainly of hydrated lime {{with one or more}} pozzolans with possible inclusion of inert filler. When Portland cement, even traces, is present (can be up to 20% of binder weight), it has to be labeled as 'PHLc'." ...|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic lime sets by {{hydration}} {{so it can}} set under water. Non-hydraulic lime sets by carbonatation and so needs {{exposure to}} {{carbon dioxide in the}} air and cannot set under water or inside a thick wall. For <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) mortars, the lime is obtained from limestone naturally containing a sufficient percentage of silica and/or alumina. Artificial hydraulic lime is produced by introducing specific types and quantities of additives to the source of lime during the burning process, or adding a pozzolan to non-hydraulic lime. Non-hydraulic lime is produced from a high purity source of calcium carbonate such as chalk, limestone or oyster shells.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{strength}} grades for <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime,</b> {{laid down in}} the European Norm EN459; NHL2, NHL3.5 and NHL5. The numbers stand for the minimum compressive strength at 28 days in newtons per square millimeter (N/mm2). For example, the NHL 3.5 strength ranges from 3.5 N/mm2 (510 psi) to 10 N/mm2 (1,450 psi). These {{are similar to the}} old classification of feebly hydraulic, moderately hydraulic and eminently hydraulic, and although different, some people continue to refer to them interchangeably. The terminology for hydraulic lime mortars was improved by the skilled French civil engineer Louis Vicat in the 1830s from the older system of water limes and feebly, moderately and eminently. Vicat published his work following research of the use of lime mortars whilst building bridges and roads in his work. The French company Vicat still currently produce natural cements and lime mortars. Names of lime mortars were so varied and conflicting across the European continent that the reclassification has greatly improved the understanding and use of lime mortars.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative phase {{analyses}} of three commercial samples of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> have been per-formed using the Rietveld method. Although the Rietveld method has been already applied to cement analysis, we report here the first application to different classes of hydraulic binders, such as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> (HL) and <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> (NHL). Unlike HL, that are simple diluted cement, NHL are specific product {{of great interest}} for its application in building restoration and conservation.

30|$|Conserv stone repair mortar was {{supplied}} at {{a binder}} to aggregate ratio of 1 : 7.5 (by weight). The two components were mixed dry using a paddle mixer until the binder was well dispersed amongst the sand, then water was {{added in the}} ratio of 1 part water to 4 parts dry mix (by weight). The material was mixed for 20  minutes; {{the sides of the}} mixer were scrapped after 10  minutes, to ensure thorough mixing, the material was left for 30  minutes before remixing for a final 10  minutes. Water content and mix time were based on a number of trials during which mortar workability was assessed for adhesion to a sandstone substrate. The final, workable, mortar had a flow table value of 135  mm. Work on rheological properties of formulated mortars has not been undertaken by other researchers to date. Work on flow characteristics of <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> have been undertaken by Allen et al.

5000|$|Hydraulic lime is {{also called}} water lime. Hydraulic lime {{contains}} lime with silica and/or alumina and sets with {{exposure to water}} and can set under water. <b>Natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) is made from a limestone which naturally contains some clay. Artificial hydraulic lime is made by adding forms of silica and/or alumina such as clay to the limestone during firing, or by adding a pozzolana to pure lime. Hydraulic limes are classified by their strength: feebly, moderately and eminently hydraulic lime. Feebly hydraulic lime contains 5-10% clay, slakes in minutes, and sets in about three weeks. It is used for less expensive work and in mild climates. Moderately hydraulic lime contains 11-20% clay, slakes in one to two hours, and sets in approximately one week. It is used for better quality work and exterior walls in freezing climates. Eminently hydraulic lime contains 21-30% clay, slakes very slowly, and sets in approximately a day. It is used in harsh environments such as damp locations and near saltwater. Hydraulic lime is off-white in color. [...] "The degree of hydraulicity of mortars will affect many characteristics.

30|$|In 2010, new European {{building}} lime standard EN 459 - 1, modified from previous version, was published [12]. Comparing to old version, <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL), formulated lime (FL) and hydraulic lime (HL) {{under the category}} of limes with hydraulic properties has been clearly specified. <b>Natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime,</b> its use can be dated back to Romans [13], is a lime with hydraulic properties produced by burning of more or less argillaceous or siliceous limestones with reduction to powder by slaking with or without grinding.

Hydraulic lime is, however, a binder consisting of lime and other materials such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials, but does not need to have a declaration of constituents. Formulated lime (FL), which is a new term, is a lime with hydraulic properties mainly consisting of air lime (CL) and/or <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. To protect the user especially in restoration and conservation, formulated limes contain a constituent’s declaration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{wastes and}} {{industrial}} by-products as building materials {{is an important}} issue in order to decrease costs with waste management and the embodied energy of building products. Scrap tire rubber has been studied as aggregate for cementitious materials. <b>Natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> are <b>natural</b> binders with particular characteristics of both air and hydraulic binders. Their specifications became stricter with the last version of EN 459 - 1 : 2010. In this study scrap tire rubber was used as additional aggregate of mortars based on NHL 3. 5 and natural sand. Different particle size fractions and proportions of scrap tire rubber were used: a mix obtained almost directly from industry (only after sieving for preparation of particle sizes similar to mortar aggregate) and separated fine, medium and coarse fractions; 0 %, 18 %, 36 % and 54 % weight of binder, corresponding to 2. 5 %, 5 % and 7. 5 % weight of sand. The influence of the rubber´s additions on the mortars ´ fresh state, mechanical and physical performance is presented, namely by flow table consistency, water retention, fresh bulk density, dynamic elasticity modulus, flexural and compressive strength, open porosity and bulk density, capillary absorption, drying and thermal conductivity. The use of the rubber mix coming from the waste tire industry seems advantageous and may open possibilities for use as raw material by the mortars industry. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical properties of <b>Natural</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Limes</b> (NHL) from a given manufacturer can change over time. Some quarries are deactivated or the extracted raw material properties {{vary depending on}} their geographical location. These variations in property {{make it harder for}} practitioners to predict how changing new products can be best used to match the requirements of a mortar for heritage conservation in terms of mechanical performance and durability. NHL in the UK market have been show to meet the requirements of BS EN 459 - 1. Although important for a consistent production quality this requirement employs tests based on standard samples which are unrepresentative in their nature. As a consequence, these seldom reflect the performance of mortars produced and used ‘on-site’. Mortars formed from the same class of NHL often exhibit distinct variations in property. In this work, a selection of NHL binders were characterised using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and thermo-gravimetric analysis. In addition physical properties including bulk density, surface area and particle size were obtained. Initial {{chemical and}} physical properties were correlated to the final mechanical properties of the mortars produced with a readily available sand in a 1 : 2 mix ratio (binder:aggregate by volume). Distinct mechanical properties at the ages of 7, 14, 28 and 90 days were measured for the same class of NHL. These initial studies will be used to develop a model to predict the final mortar performance from an understanding of the chemical and physical properties of lime binder...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} in its entirety, i. e. {{this publication}} {{prepared for a}} doctorate and now presented together with the licentiate thesis from 2004, deals with the production and utilisation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> mortar, including <b>natural</b> cement and pozzolana mortar, in historic buildings in the Nordic countries, especially in Sweden, from the Middle Ages until present time. The disseratation covers a field of knowledge where the collected knowledge still is meagre. There was a historic stage in a general endeavour to produce mortar with hydraulic characteristics, which also {{led to the development}} of Portland cement. The author is of the opinion that such an endeavour has existed for a long period; in Sweden at least since the 18 th century. This is investigated with and supported by a survey of the production and utilisation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> mortar and also natural cement and pozzolana mortar through the course of time. Two investigations are included in the licentiate thesis. The first deals with the situation concerning knowledge and research with regard to the production and utilisation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> mortar, <b>natural</b> cement and pozzolana mortar from a historical perspective. The second deals with the occurrence and deposits of limestone that has been possible to utilise for the production of <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> lime; and similarly the raw materials for production of natural cement and pozzolana mortar, for instance brick for brickdust lime mortar and burned alum shale for alum shale lime mortar. The production of lime and other materials is linked in this dissertation to still existing buildings and constructions. This study includes a detailed presentation of composition, material properties and also production. This is achieved by four sub-surveys covering four types of mortar: (1) <b>natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> and sub-hydraulic <b>lime</b> mortar, (2) natural cement, (3) brickdust lime mortar and (4) alum shale lime mortar. The intention is to characterise and illustrate by the four sub-studies investigations for what purposes these materials have been used, i. e. in what objects, with application as mortar, grout and finishing mortar, or in the manufacturing of façade ornaments for example. <b>Natural</b> <b>hydraulic</b> and sub-hydraulic <b>lime</b> mortar was in use already during the Middle Ages. However, the conditions dealt with in this dissertation refer mainly to the latter part of the 17 th century and the 18 th, 19 th and 20 th centuries. In contrast natural cement was in use during the 19 th century only. The investigations included in this doctoral dissertation are based on own and other available building-archaeological investigations and observations and also mortar studies. The building investigations were made in connection with restoration projects and façade restoration. The mortar investigations consist of quantitative and qualitative microscopic analyses of thin section as well as chemical analyses and to some extent also SEM/EDS and XRD analyses. The large number of thin section analyses and chemical analyses, and the large number of analysed components, is unique for the investigations of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> mortar in Sweden. The analyses thus provide completely new information regarding these kinds of mortars. This study demonstrates that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> mortar is a traditional building material that has had an essential role in buildings in Sweden from the Middle Ages to present time. A lot of lime mortars from before the 17 th century are sub-hydraulic according to this investigations. During second half of the 17 th century the knowledge about hydraulic mortar was developed. At that time could the hydraulic effect rise and 1770 the swedish cement, the alum shale mortar, was devised.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the shape, average size and calcite content of the aggregate on strength, porosity, water absorption, density and capillary suction of <b>natural</b> feebly- <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL 2) mortars. Four types of aggregate were analysed in order to determine calcite content, particle shape and average particle size. Four different mortar mixes were then designed and produced using each of the aggregate types and NHL 2 as a binder. The mixing and curing as well as the aggregate:binder proportions were kept constant in order to attribute variation of mortar properties {{to the quality of the}} aggregate. The results suggest that an increase in the aggregate?s calcite content lowers the flexural and compressive strength of the mortar. This study also determined that sharp aggregate as well as aggregate with a small average particle size tends to increase the mechanical strength and bulk density of a mortar simultaneously reducing porosity, water absorption and capillary suction. Furthermore, this paper concludes that aggregates containing particles of a wide size range will also increase the mechanical strength and bulk density of the hardened mortar diminishing porosity, water absorption and capillary suction...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (HL) is {{a general}} term for {{varieties}} of lime (calcium oxide), or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), used to make lime mortar which set through hydration: thus they are called hydraulic.

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lime</b> (NHL) binders consist {{mainly of}} portlandite, {{reactive}} silicates and aluminates formed from {{the reaction of}} crushed limestone, containing clays or other impurities, during calcination.

The NHL (<b>Natural</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lime)</b> classification, as specified in the EN 459 - 1 standard, does not consistently give a representative evaluation of the mortar properties, resulting in similarly classified limes often exhibiting very different properties and behaviour thereby hindering the ease of user specification for mortars.
