But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>team</b> understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E

A joint American–French air assault on the camp where the bombing was planned was also approved by Reagan and Mitterrand.

500|$|After {{nearly six}} months of investigations, the Judicial Commission {{reported}} its findings on June 12, 2012. It found that the memorandum was authentic and that Haqqani was its [...] "originator and architect". The report said the former ambassador [...] "orchestrated {{the possibility of an}} imminent coup to both persuade Mr. Ijaz to convey the message and also to give it (Memorandum) traction and credibility". [...] The justices found further that one of Haqqani's purposes was to head a new <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>team</b> in Pakistan. In an unexpected turn of the investigation, a secret fund was discovered in Pakistan's Washington embassy that Haqqani allegedly had access to and had allegedly utilized, in [...] "apparent violation of Article 84 of the Constitution of Pakistan". The Commission's report exonerated President Zardari from any prior knowledge of the memorandum, although it noted that in the [...] "considered view" [...] of the justices, Haqqani had led Ijaz to believe the memorandum had the Pakistani president's approval. Following testimony by Ijaz, the Commission deemed him a reliable witness whose credibility Haqqani had unsuccessfully sought to undermine.|$|E

[...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>team</b> to resign.

2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} reportedly {{went out}} of its way to make the transition as seamless as possible for the incoming administration, earning accolades from Obama staff members and outside experts alike. According to nearly all accounts, the Bush administration streamlined the process for new officials to obtain security clearances and planned training exercises for the incoming <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>team,</b> to ensure that they would be ready to face a possible crisis on the first day in office. Part of this enhanced cooperation is required by laws passed at the behest of the 9/11 Commission, while part is attributed to the difficulty that the Bush administration had with its own transition, which lasted only five weeks and was felt to have had a deleterious effect on Bush's ability to govern.
