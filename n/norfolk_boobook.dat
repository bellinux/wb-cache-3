50|$|Janette Norman {{and colleagues}} tested the {{cytochrome}} b DNA of three subspecies (as {{well as the}} powerful and rufous owls) to ascertain whether the closest relative was used in breeding with the last surviving female of the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>boobook.</b> They discovered that although the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>boobook</b> was similar in plumage to the Tasmanian boobook, that it was genetically {{much closer to the}} New Zealand subspecies. In fact, the two were so close genetically that they considered whether the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>boobook</b> should be recognised as a separate taxon at all, although they conceded the two were easily distinguishable in appearance and so maintained the three as subspecies; the Tasmanian boobook only diverged by 2.7% from the other two, while the powerful and rufous owls diverged by 4.4% from each other. Leading from this, the southern boobook was split from the Tasmanian boobook and morepork in volume 5 of the Handbook of the Birds of the World, however several authors, including Les Christidis and Walter Boles, contested that the data had been misinterpreted from the Norman study, which had not sampled any Australian mainland boobooks at all. They treated the three taxa (southern, Tasmanian boobooks and moreporks) as a single species.|$|E

50|$|Dr Penelope Diane Olsen is an Australian ornithologist and author. She {{has worked}} with CSIRO as an {{experimental}} officer and an Honorary Research Associate {{as well as being}} an ARC Postdoctoral Fellow at the Australian National University. She is also internationally recognised as an expert on raptors and was involved in the conservation work on Norfolk Island for the <b>Norfolk</b> Island <b>Boobook.</b> She was President of the Australasian Raptor Association 1984-1989. In 1997 she was awarded the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union's D.L. Serventy Medal for excellence in published work on birds in the Australasian region.|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} of the <b>Norfolk</b> Island <b>boobook</b> owl Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata, a nocturnal bird restricted to the Australian territory of Norfolk Island, {{was reduced to a}} single female in 1986. Deliberate introduction of two males of its nearest relative, the New Zealand boobook N. n. novaeseelandiae, as a conservation intervention has allowed the taxon to persist on Norfolk Island, albeit in hybrid form. Although declared Extinct in 2000, a re-examination of this unique situation has concluded there is a strong argument that the taxon should be categorized as Critically Endangered because, on average, approximately half the nuclear genome of the original taxon and all the mitochondrial DNA is conserved in all living owls on the island. This thus represents a special case in which the taxon can be considered to be extant, in hybrid form, even though no pure-bred individuals survive. More generally, we suggest that, in exceptional cases, hybridization may not be a threat to highly threatened species and that guidelines are needed to determine when to consider hybrid populations as extant forms of the original taxon, and when to declare extinction through hybridization...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Norfolk</b> <b>boobook</b> (Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata), {{also known}} as the Norfolk Island boobook, Norfolk Island owl or Norfolk Island morepork, was a bird in the true owl family endemic to Norfolk Island, an Australian {{territory}} in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. It is an extinct subspecies of the morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae). However, although the taxon is extinct, its genes live on in the descendants of the hybrid offspring of the last female bird, which was sighted for the last time in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Norfolk</b> <b>boobook</b> {{was very}} similar in {{appearance}} to other subspecies of the morepork, being a small brown hawk owl with mottled plumage. It was smaller, darker and more reddish in colouring than the Australian subspecies, with much spotting. However, it was slightly larger than the nominate subspecies from New Zealand; female boobooks are larger than the males, with New Zealand females comparable in size to Norfolk Island males, a factor which gave rise to sexing difficulties with hybrid birds in the conservation management program.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} of the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>boobook</b> declined with the clearance and modification of its forest habitat, especially the felling of large trees with suitable hollows for nesting in. There was also competition for nest hollows with feral honey bees and introduced crimson rosellas. By 1986 the population {{had been reduced to}} a single female bird, named [...] "Miamiti" [...] after a matriarch of the Norfolk Island people. [...] As part of a program to attempt to conserve {{at least some of the}} genes of the insular subspecies, two male Southern boobooks (moreporks) of the nominate New Zealand subspecies, Ninox novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae, were introduced to the island as mates for the female. The males were sourced from the New Zealand subspecies rather than one of the Australian subspecies as it was discovered that it was more closely related to the Norfolk Island taxon. [...] Nest boxes were also provided. One of the introduced males disappeared a year after introduction but the other successfully mated with the female with the pair producing fledged chicks in 1989 and 1990. The original female disappeared in 1996 but, by then, there was a small hybrid {{population of}} about a dozen birds. These birds and their descendants continue to exist on the island.|$|E
