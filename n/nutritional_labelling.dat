To bridge this gap, this study examines the effect of mother's <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use on children's body mass index and overweight. Using data from the 2001 National Health Interview Survey in Taiwan, a two-stage econometric model is proposed and estimated with a semiparametric method. Results indicate that mother's <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use leads to lower probability of children becoming overweight or obese, and a non-linear relationship between mother's <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use and children's BMI is evident. For mothers who seldom use <b>nutritional</b> <b>labels,</b> label use does not lead to a reduction in children's BMI. In contrast, for mothers who are frequent <b>nutritional</b> <b>label</b> users, label use contributes negatively to children's BMI. However, the magnitudes of these effects are relatively small, suggesting that additional instruments or policies are needed if further reduction in children's body mass index is desired. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>label</b> use Semiparametric method Children's body mass index Overweight Taiwan...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate, in a UK general population sample, the likelihood of paradoxical effects of <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> on energy intake. Participants (n[*]=[*] 287) attended a London cinema and were offered a large tub of salted or toffee popcorn. Participants were randomised to receive their selected flavour with one of three labels: a green low-fat label, a red high-fat label or no label. Participants watched two film clips while completing measures of demographic characteristics, emotional state and taste of the popcorn. Following the experiment, popcorn consumption was measured. There were no main effects of <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> on consumption. Contrary to predictions neither BMI nor weight concern moderated the effect of label on consumption. There was a three-way interaction between low-fat label, weight concern and socioeconomic status (SES) such that weight-concerned participants of higher SES who saw a low-fat label consumed more than weight unconcerned participants of similar SES (t[*]=[*]- 2. 7, P[*]=[*]. 04).

The study aimed at understanding how people value nutritional information on food labels, in particular front-of-pack labelling. Methods. A phone-assisted survey on 7550 consumers in 16 European countries was conducted. People were asked about their opinion on nutritional information provided at different levels, from the media to public institutions, and their commitment to healthy behavior. The value of pack labelling was estimated using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) elicitation technique. Results. Older age groups (> 45 years old), members of a larger family, low income or low education level people and those who perceived themselves to be obese, valued front-of-pack <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> positively.

40|$|Thesis (MNutr (Human Nutrition)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. A diet {{high in fat}} {{results in}} dietary-related diseases, which have reached {{epidemic}} proportions in South Africa. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> {{has the potential to}} alter consumers’ knowledge of attitude and behaviour towards their fat intake. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the effects of <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> on the population’s fat-intake through a systematic literature review. Electronic databases, reference lists of relevant studies and the Internet were searched, to identify studies that could help to answer the problem statement. Relevant citations were independently identified by two investigators based on the established inclusion-criteria. After this the full text of the selected citations were obtained and filtered independently by each investigator based on the inclusion- and exclusion criteria. The characteristics of each study was recorded in specially developed data extraction forms by the investigator herself and was checked by a second investigator. The primary objective of the study was to investigate <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> on food packaging. Two other forms of labelling were included to gain a more concise perception of consumers’ knowledge and practices regarding information on fat. These other forms were point-of-sale labelling (in supermarkets, in restaurants, by vending machines) and experimental labelling (labels spesifically designed to indicate the fat-content of a food item). A total of 59 relevant studies were included based on the inclusion-criteria. Although only a few studies assessed the effect of labelling on diet, there was evidence that the use of labels resulted in lower fat intake. Women older than 35 years with higher education levels, who used nutritional supplements, and who were in the maintenance stage of change to a lower fat diet, and who believed in the importance of nutrition, were between 50 % to 80 % higher users of information about fat than their counterparts. Fat is the food component which was most looked at on the food label (50 % to 80 %). Small changes in fat intake occured due to point-of-sale labelling, but labelling programmes which combined labelling with additional information on fat (e. g. pamphlets), increased visibility and nutrition education programmes, were more successful. People generally perceived products lower in fat as less pleasant, but sensory judgement of the products labelled with a low fat content were related to a person’s beliefs and concerns towards fat. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> can be an effective measure, which can be used to reduce the population’s fat intake; however, more research is needed to assess the effect of labelling on fat content of their diet.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common form of malnutrition in the world, affecting more than 2 billion people globally. Food labelling is an important tool that provides information on the nutritional composition data to consumers. However, the information on bio-accessibility values is limited; therefore, the aim of the present study is to promote the <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> by the inclusion of bio-accessibility values of micronutrients of importance along with nutritional composition data. Commercial supplements commonly used for disease specific conditions were selected and their iron bio-accessibility was determined by equilibrium dialysis involving an in-vitro simulated digestion procedure. The formulations were also subjected to nutritional composition analysis and functional properties by standard AOAC methods. The total iron content of the supplements ranged between 8. 66 ± 0. 5 mg / 100 g to 21. 72 ± 1. 44 mg / 100 g whereas the bio-accessibility of micronutrient iron ranged between 0. 05 ± 0. 01 mg / 100 g to 0. 32 ± 0. 20 mg / 100 g. The per cent iron bio-accessibility was also determined and ranged between 0. 23 - 2. 52 per cent. Inclusion of bio-accessibility values of vital micronutrients along with usual nutritional composition data will serve as an effective tool to combat various micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore, prescription of supplements with higher bio availability may result in usage of lower doses of iron with fewer side effects, thus improving treatment efficacy. This novel information has the potential application in <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> to improve the bio availability of trace minerals and hence contributes to the human health benefit...|$|E
40|$|Background: Implementing a European Union (EU) -wide {{mandatory}} {{nutrition labelling}} scheme has been advocated as part a multi-pronged strategy to tackle obesity. The type of scheme {{needs to be}} acceptable to all key stakeholders. This study explored stakeholders' viewpoints of labelling in two contrasting food cultures (France and the UK) to see whether attitudes were influenced by sectoral interests and/or national context. Methods: Using Multi Criteria Mapping, a decision analysis tool that assesses stakeholder viewpoints, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered during tape-recorded interviews. In France and the UK, 21 comparable stakeholders appraised <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> with criteria of their own choosing (i. e. feasibility, societal benefits, social acceptability, efficacy in addressing obesity, additional health benefits) and three criteria relating to cost (to industry; public sector; individuals). When scoring, interviewees provided both optimistic (best case) and pessimistic (worst case) judgements. Results: Overall, mandatory <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> was appraised least favourably in France. Labelling performed worse under optimistic (best case) scenarios in France, for five out of eight sets of criteria. French stakeholders viewed labelling as expensive, having fewer benefits to society and as being marginally less effective than UK stakeholders did. However, French interviewees thought implementing labelling was feasible and would provide additional health benefits. British and French stakeholders made similar quantitative judgements on how socially acceptable mandatory labelling would be. Conclusions: There is agreement between some stakeholder groups in the two different countries, especially food chain operators.

40|$|This project deals {{about the}} {{rejection}} of the food traffic light labelling by the European Parliament. The traffic light was meant to indicate the nutritional information (regarding sugar, salt, fat and saturated fat) in a coloured way, in which red represented high amounts of certain content, yellow represented a medium amount and green a low amount of one of the above mentioned nutritional amounts. This proposal is part of the wider Commissions Proposal (2008) regarding the <b>nutritional</b> <b>labelling</b> of food. The main interest in this project is to understand the reasons why the EP has rejected the food traffic light and especially to investigate if the rejection was due to business lobbyist influence.

Using this method, the preferences of the business interest groups will be compared against the adopted European Parliament legislative resolution (first reading). Besides this, the input from an anti-Lobby NGO will be used as well in order to increase the validity.
