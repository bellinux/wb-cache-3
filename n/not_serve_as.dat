5|$|Following her {{recovery}} from breast cancer, Minogue released her tenth studio album X in 2007. Slated {{to be released}} as Minogue's comeback album, X went platinum in her native-country Australia after it debuted at {{number one on the}} Australian Albums chart. In the United Kingdom, the album entered and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and was eventually certified platinum. Critical reception towards X was generally favourable, but many critics felt that it lacked introspection from Minogue's side. Later on, critics argued that the album did <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a worthy comeback for Minogue.|$|E
5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would have joined the clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded from doing so by his wife, who was a Campbell, and his neighbors. His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by the Campbell Earl of Breadalbane. Nonetheless, many MacIntyres were in the clan regiment of Stewart of Appin in the campaign of 1745–46, but they did <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> an independent body.|$|E

5|$|The {{music in}} The Wind Waker was {{composed}} by Kenta Nagata, Hajime Wakai, Toru Minegishi, and Koji Kondo. The sound team was significantly larger than for other contemporary projects to accommodate Nintendo's {{desire for a}} high caliber {{of work in the}} rushed development schedule. Koji Kondo, the primary composer for The Legend of Zelda series, contributed to the score but did <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> sound director. However, the score incorporated some of his pieces from older Zelda games, modifying them to emphasize the time passed between the stories.|$|E
5|$|When the Columbian Baseball League was {{forming in}} 1912, The New York Times named Shay {{as one of}} two {{candidates}} to manage the league's Kansas City team. The {{president of the new}} league, John T. Powers, said that the league would <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a third major league, but he noted that many players were eager to sign with the league after their contracts had expired in 1911. The league never materialized. One of its main investors, brewer Otto Stifel, withdrew his support of the league before play began.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as Archdeacon of Ely, with the {{appointment}} occurring before 4 July 1190. Longchamp sent Barre as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince John during Richard's absence on the Third Crusade. Longchamp's exile meant that Barre did <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England in 1194. Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he {{did not return to}} his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.|$|E

5|$|At local, regional, and {{national}} levels, Bahá'ís elect members to nine-person Spiritual Assemblies, which run {{the affairs of}} the religion. There are also appointed individuals working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> clergy, which the Bahá'í Faith does not have. The Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, remains the successor and supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies. Any male Bahá'í, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bahá'ís.|$|E

5|$|The actual Burnt Norton is a manor {{located near}} the village of Aston Subedge in Gloucestershire that Eliot visited with Emily Hale during 1934. The {{original}} Norton House was a mansion burned down in 1741 by its owner, Sir William Keyt, who died in the fire. Even though Eliot was married, {{he spent a lot of}} time with Hale and might possibly have become involved with her had he not been married. Even after their time at Burnt Norton, Eliot stayed in close correspondence with her and sent her many of his poems. The actual manor does <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> an important location within the poem. Instead, it is the garden surrounding the manor that became the focus.|$|E

5|$|Following the Peace of Paris in 1783, Seymour took a {{house in}} London with his brother Lord George Seymour and John Willett Payne. The three men became notorious socialites, joining the Prince of Wales on many of his {{drinking}} exploits across London: Seymour remained close friends with Prince George {{for the rest of}} his life. Seymour, already known for his good looks, good manners, height and martial bearing, rapidly gained a reputation for dissolution. In 1785 however, Seymour married Lady Anne Horatia Waldegrave, daughter of Earl Waldegrave and Maria Walpole (later Duchess of Gloucester) at the insistence of his family in a successful attempt to curtail his social activities. It was at this time that Seymour made his first foray into politics, becoming MP for Newport on the Isle of Wight before relinquishing the post two years later. In 1788 he became MP for Tregony, but in 1790 he switched to become MP for Wendover. Seymour remained in this position until 1796 when he changed his seat to Portsmouth, in which he remained until his death. He did <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> an active politician in any of these positions, preferring his navy career to his political one.|$|E
