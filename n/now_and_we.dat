500|$|The UEFA Champions League is a {{continental}} club football competition organised by UEFA. Founded in the 1950s as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, {{the competition was}} open to champion clubs of each country and arranged as a straight knockout tournament. The growth of television rights saw the format rebranded in the 1990s to include a group stage and permit multiple entrants. Arsenal had qualified for every Champions League season since 1998–99, but the club never progressed further than the quarter-final stage. Ahead of the new campaign, Wenger assessed his team needed to perform in the home games, adding: [...] "We are mature enough <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> must add that little bit of sparkle to make the difference." ...|$|E

500|$|Simple {{movements}} {{were developed by}} their choreographers, including Leeanne Ashley, to accompany each song because, as The New York Times reported, they believed [...] "in the power of basic movements to enchant young children". [...] According to reporter Anders Wright, they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves {{in order to identify}} more with their young audience. [...] The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field's oldest daughter in 2004. [...] "So [...] Wiggles have kind of become a bit more, dare I say, girly. Dorothy (the Dinosaur) does ballet <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> dance as well a lot more than we did", Field reported. [...] In later years, corresponding with Field's developing interests in acrobatics and gymnastics, they added these elements to their stage shows, including, as Field reported, hiring several world-class athletes such as former trampoline champion Karl Shore. [...] Watkins, whom Paul Field called [...] "a dancer of many disciplines", was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as [...] "mainly a dancer".|$|E

Jon Caramanica from The New York Times also wrote that on the song, Brown [...] "double-time-raps about stealing girlfriends." [...] Akshay Bhansali from MTV News wrote that [...] "LookatMeNow" [...] features [...] "a fast-rapping flurry of awesome self-indulgence courtesy of Busta Rhymes, Lil Wayne and Chris, with an eerie downtempo beat cooked up by chefs Afrojack and Diplo." [...] Afrojack told MTV News that the song {{was the product of}} a beat he passed to Diplo. [...] "Yeah, Diplo called me...

500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right <b>now.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2011, Julian re-joined {{his former}} club, now renamed simply Stevenage, on a free transfer, {{three years after}} leaving the club. The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} and we all know how much quality he will bring into the squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with". On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming back <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are in League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town. He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.|$|E
500|$|In June 2005, Ivy Queen {{partnered with}} co-founder of Perfect Image Records, José Guadalupe to form Filtro Musik. This stemmed from Guadalupe parting ways {{with the other}} co-founder of Perfect Image, Anthony Pérez who in turn would launch his own label The Roof Records. Filtro Musik's concept {{initially}} stemmed from its name which means [...] "filter" [...] in English. Guadalupe explained the title, saying [...] "I've been in this industry for 15 years <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> {{have the ability to}} filter and pick the best". In the coming year, Univision Music Group signed the label to licensing plan to release the album in September 2005, which ensured that the [...] "album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product." [...] Ivy Queen was previously married to fellow reggaeton artist Omar Navarro, known by his stage name Gran Omar. They were divorced in 2005 shortly before the release of Flashback, which influenced the composition of the album. She denied ever having found him in the act of adultery, while claiming that if she had found Navarro with another woman, she'd be in La Vega Alta, a prison for women in Puerto Rico. She also denied rumors that she had physically assaulted the woman she caught with Navarro. She stated they had not lived with each other for two months citing the [...] "extensive travels of her husband and his workload of being a producer" [...] as being causes {{to the end of the}} nine-year marriage.|$|E
500|$|The next month, McCarthy took {{advantage}} of Robert Kennedy's decline in the polls, trailing the former frontrunner by two points for {{second place in the}} race behind Vice President Humphrey. At the time, polls suggested that McCarthy was more likely than his Democratic rivals to defeat Republican frontrunner Richard Nixon in a head to head matchup, leading 40 to 37 percent in a Harris poll. While campaigning in South Bend, Indiana prior to the state's primary, McCarthy criticized the approach of his two closest Democratic rivals. He stated that there were three kinds of national unity; Humphrey's approach of [...] "run things together indiscriminately," [...] Kennedy's approach of a [...] "combination of separate interests...or groups," [...] and his own approach of [...] "call upon everyone...to be as fully responsible as [...] can be," [...] which the candidate labeled as the approach for 1968. McCarthy lost in Indiana but received 27 percent of the vote to Kennedy's 42 percent. Four days later, McCarthy received the most votes in Time Magazines national presidential primary. The poll counted votes of over 1 million students in more than 1,200 campuses. Kennedy came in second, trailing by more than 70,000 votes. In regards to the results, McCarthy commented, [...] "We've tested the enemy <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> know his techniques...we know his weaknesses." [...] The next day, Kennedy defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary but it did not stall his effort. He reaffirmed that he would compete with Kennedy in Oregon, California and South Dakota. He ended the month by defeating Kennedy in the Oregon primary by a margin of 45 to 39 percent. The victory allowed for the media to observe that McCarthy was [...] "back in the race as a major contender." [...] and forced an attention shift to the looming primaries in South Dakota and California, scheduled for the next month.|$|E

A groin re-injury suffered in training camp, however, saw him miss {{the beginning of the season}} and by his expected return in mid-July, a reported shoulder injury caused the Bombers to place him on the nine-game injured list. General Manager Brendan Taman suggested then that his time with the organisation was likely over and, on January 31, 2009, new Winnipeg head coach Mike Kelly said that Sheridan was [...] "another guy who needed a fresh start elsewhere" [...] and he was released.|$|E

On this issue President Carter speaks for himself, the opinions in his book are his own, they are not the views or position of the Democratic Party. I and other Democrats will continue to stand with Israel in its battle against terrorism and for a lasting peace with its neighbors." [...] Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated: With all due respect to former President Carter, he does not speak for the Democratic Party on Israel. Democrats have been steadfast in their support of Israel from its birth, in part because we recognize that to do so is in the national security interests of the United States.
