5|$|On {{the second}} afternoon, Bradman delayed {{the taking of}} the second new ball until after tea so that Lindwall and Johnston could have an extra period of {{recuperation}} before a new attack. This proved dividends as the bowlers took a wicket apiece within three overs of the new ball being taken, leaving England at 6/134. England were bowled out for 215 on the third morning, as Lindwall took 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall was {{subjected}} to a thorough fitness test {{on the morning of}} the Second Test at Lord's two weeks later, the home of cricket. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations was sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. Lindwall contributed 15 to Australia's total of 350. He then took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. He had Washbrook caught behind in his fourth over and then clean bowled Edrich and Tom Dollery in the space of three balls. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control. He later returned to bowl English captain Norman Yardley after an 87 run stand with Compton, before finishing with 5/70 as Australia took a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall then contributed 25 as Australia declared at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world-record 596 for victory. Lindwall removed Hutton with the new ball and later returned to remove Dollery and Jim Laker without the addition of a single run to take 3/61 as Australia took a 409 run victory. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser inside-edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> Lindwall's pain. Lindwall {{was worried that}} Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax. The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings. Barnes survived a missed stumping {{opportunity}} when he was 18 and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122. Morris was then bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket. Barnes started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Once he reached his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, included two successive blows over the boundary for six. He was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary from Yardley. He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings. The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296/2 after 277 minutes when he departed. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 296/3 to face Yardley's hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich at slip. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 and Australia reached stumps at 343, without further loss, with Miller having struck one six into the grandstand.|$|E

25|$|The {{couple had}} five children, {{one of whom}} did not survive infancy. Although the {{marriage}} was arranged, the couple got along quite well, and at least during the first years, their relationship was described as happy.

Though Frederick came to feel high regard for her and always treated her with kindness, however, he reportedly was {{not in love with}} her and continued to have affairs after their marriage. She quickly made herself popular in the Danish court, and her father-in-law remarked that she seemed to him to be kind and agreeable.|$|E
500|$|The day of {{the race}} was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a [...] "virtual hysteria" [...] that Secretariat seemed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice.</b> His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, who he had already beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had {{finished}} third in the Man o' War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. [...] "Snorting steam in the raw twilight", he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by [...] lengths.

500|$|The game's {{weapons were}} very well received. Edge praised their weight, stating that each weapon {{encourages}} strategic {{play with their}} secondary functions. Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and {{that they did not}} feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost impossible <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> how [...] "laughably bad it is", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay. GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented, [...] "It's always sad when there's voice acting in a game and I find myself being embarrassed for the voice actors." [...] Nevertheless, GameSpot added that the game's weapon fire and musical score [...] "easily drown this out." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindwall {{returned}} on {{the final}} morning with the score at 6/141. Dollery, who had been batting with assurance, shaped to duck under a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Later in the same over, Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck to leave England at 8/141. The match ended when Doug Wright hit Ernie Toshack to Lindwall and was caught for four. Lindwall ended with 3/61 as Australia took a 409-run victory. Arlott said that while Toshack (5/40) had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall [...] "so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at {{the morale of the}} English batting that was never overcome." [...] In later years, Bradman told Lindwall he pretended <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> the bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried Bradman had noticed his injury and would be disappointed, but the Australian captain later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax and focus on his bowling.|$|E

As the song progresses, she walks out of the bus in the rain, holding an umbrella. She walks out of the parking lot and into an amusement park, where she stands in front of a carousel in the rain as she continues to sing. After the second chorus, Lovato and her band perform in the rain with the water altering colors in the background. As the last verse approaches, she is back on the tour bus. A single tear rolls down her cheek and the video ends.|$|E

[...] He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since the former barker's suicide, and {{suggests}} that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. [...] He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: [...] "Billy Makes a Journey"). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. [...] The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. [...] In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young.

500|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser and Wright survived for 20 minutes, and Lindwall {{tried to break}} their {{resistance}} by aiming a few bouncers at the former. Bedser eventually inside edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135-run first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70, while Johnson took 3/72 and Johnston 2/43. Toshack was the other bowler used, sending down 18 overs {{for the loss of}} 23 runs. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> his bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried his captain had noticed the injury, but Bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." [...] Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.|$|E

2500|$|Watching Movies {{with the}} Sound Off {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 73, based on 17 reviews. David Renshaw of NME said, [...] "It's hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that the production outshines the delivery, with Pharrell and Diplo beats topped {{only by the}} slick 'SDS' courtesy of Brainfeeder boss Flying Lotus. At least it all diverts attention from that naked album cover, mind." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, [...] "Without the hooks or the lofty lyrics, the album seems made exclusively for Miller's fans or those who right-click indie rap mixtape links on the daily. Those audiences should find it an interesting trip, admirable artistic growth, and an attractive, entertaining {{step in the right}} direction. Others will likely be flummoxed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carte {{assembled}} {{a high quality}} team for The Beauty Stone, hoping for a hit. [...] J. Comyns Carr had earlier written the text for Henry Irving's grand production of the King Arthur legend, for which Sullivan had provided the incidental music score in 1895. [...] Sullivan {{had in the past}} considered the idea of an opera on the same subject and was pleased when Carr offered him a similarly romantic work with a medieval setting. [...] The eponymous beauty stone was a magical item that would transform its holder's appearance but would have unanticipated consequences. [...] Sullivan seemed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that this major element of the plot was simply a variant of the [...] "magic lozenge" [...] plot that Gilbert had so often proposed to the composer, and that he had repeatedly rejected. [...] A. W. Pinero was {{at the height of his}} career in 1898, having produced several enduring successes in the 1890s, including The Second Mrs. Tanqueray (1893) and The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith (1895), and the same year as The Beauty Stone he would produce Trelawny of the 'Wells' (1898). One of the most important, prolific and popular British playwrights, Pinero was later knighted for his services to dramatic authorship. [...] Carr conceived of the basic idea of the libretto, that true beauty is an inner quality. [...] Carr confined himself to writing the lyrics, however, and Pinero was brought in to work out the plot and write the dialogue. [...] Having brought together three such eminent talents, Carte had high expectations, and there was much anticipation in the press.|$|E
