Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E

50|$|Genetics seem {{to play a}} role in both food <b>neophobia</b> {{and general}} <b>neophobia.</b> Research shows that about two-thirds of the {{variation}} in food <b>neophobia</b> is due to genetics.

50|$|It is very {{typical for}} people to {{generally}} have a fear of new things and to prefer things that are familiar and common. Most people experience food <b>neophobia</b> to a certain extent, though some people are more neophobic than others. A measure of individual differences in food <b>neophobia</b> is the Food <b>Neophobia</b> Scale (FNS), which consists of a 10-item survey that requires self-reported responses on a seven-point Likert scale. There is also a separate scale geared towards children called the Food <b>Neophobia</b> Scale for Children (FNSC), in which the parents actually do the reporting for the survey.|$|E
50|$|Food <b>neophobia</b> is {{the fear}} of eating new or {{unfamiliar}} foods. It differs from selective eating disorder. Food <b>neophobia</b> is particularly common in toddlers and young children. It is often related to an individual’s level of sensation-seeking, meaning a person's willingness to try new things and take risks. Not only do people with high food <b>neophobia</b> resist trying new food, they also rate new foods that they do try as lower than neophilics.|$|E
5000|$|The word <b>neophobia</b> {{comes from}} the Greek νέος, neos, meaning [...] "new, young", and φόβος, phobos, for [...] "fear". Cainophobia {{comes from the}} Greek καινός, kainos, meaning [...] "new, fresh". Alternative terms for <b>neophobia</b> include metathesiophobia, prosophobia, cainotophobia (or cainophobia), and kainophobia (or kainolophobia).|$|E

50|$|Food <b>neophobia</b> {{relates to}} the omnivore's dilemma, a {{phenomenon}} that explains the choice that omnivores, and humans in particular, have between eating a new food and risking danger or avoiding it and potentially missing out on a valuable food source. Having at least some degree of food <b>neophobia</b> has been noted to be evolutionarily advantageous as it can help people to avoid eating potentially poisonous foods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neophobia</b> is {{the fear}} of {{anything}} new, especially a persistent and abnormal fear. In its milder form, it can manifest as the unwillingness to try new things or break from routine. In the context of children the term is generally used to indicate a tendency to reject unknown or novel foods. Food <b>neophobia,</b> {{as it may be}} referred to, is an important concern in pediatric psychology.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes food <b>neophobia</b> is more {{directly}} {{caused by an}} environmental occurrence. For example, with poison-induced <b>neophobia,</b> a food-poisoning experience can lead to people not only avoiding the flavor(s) they associate with creating their illness but also avoiding all novel flavors during the period directly following the poisoning experience. This {{can be seen as}} the body’s attempt to prevent any new and risky food items from entering the body.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Anton Wilson theorized in {{his book}} Prometheus Rising that <b>neophobia</b> is instinctual in people after they begin to raise children. Wilson's views on <b>neophobia</b> are mostly negative, believing {{that it is the}} reason human culture and ideas do not advance as quickly as our technology. His model {{includes}} an idea from Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which is that new ideas, however well proven and evident, are implemented only when the generations who consider them [...] "new" [...] die and are replaced by generations who consider the ideas accepted and old.|$|E
50|$|Besides food poisoning, food <b>neophobia</b> also {{arises from}} the person associating a {{negative}} experience with new foods, for example suffering from gastroenteritis or other gastrointestinal illnesses after eating undercooked food.|$|E
50|$|Norway {{rats and}} house mice {{are thought to}} have evolved {{increased}} levels of <b>neophobia</b> as they became commensal with humans because humans were routinely devising new methods (e.g., mousetraps) to eradicate them.|$|E
50|$|Psychosocial {{factors can}} also {{increase}} a child's chances of developing food <b>neophobia.</b> Young children carefully watch parental food preferences, {{and this may}} produce neophobic tendencies with regard to eating if parents tend to avoid some foods.|$|E

50|$|Exposing {{someone to}} a new food {{increases}} the chances of liking that food item. However, {{it is not enough}} to merely look at a new food. Novel food must be repeatedly tasted in order to increase preference for eating it. It can take as many as 15 tries of a novel food item before a child accepts it. There also appears to be a critical period for lowering later food <b>neophobia</b> in children during the weaning process. The variety of solid foods first exposed to children can lower later food refusal. Some researchers believe that even the food variety of a nursing mother and the consequent variety of flavors in her breastmilk can lead to greater acceptance of novel food items later on in life. Food <b>neophobia</b> does tend to naturally decrease as people age.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neophobia</b> is also {{a common}} finding in aging animals, {{although}} apathy could also explain, or contribute to explain, the lack of exploratory drive systematically observed in aging. Researchers argued {{that the lack of}} exploratory drive was likely due neurophysiologically to the dysfunction of neural pathways connected to the prefrontal cortex observed during aging.|$|E

"The hostility of some, the <b>neophobia</b> of many, the apathy, {{indifference}} or indecisiveness of most {{regarding the}} need to modify the nature of teaching through experimenting {{in the manner in}} which I have indicated, is nothing but a specific manifestation of a more general phenomenon: the deeply embedded scholastic spirit, bequeathed to us by our ancestors along with other principles fatal to the mental and social development of the people to the absolute exclusion of the new philosophy.|$|E
50|$|Another {{environmental}} factor influencing levels of food <b>neophobia</b> {{is the current}} arousal level of the individual. Trying a new food is an arousing experience, and if the person prefers to maintain a lower arousal level in general, then {{he or she might}} avoid new foods as a method of managing his or her current arousal level. Also, if people are currently experiencing situations with a lot of novelty and are therefore more aroused, they might be reluctant to try new foods as doing so would increase their arousal level to an uncomfortable level. This example can help explain why Americans visiting a foreign country might be less likely to try a new food item and instead gravitate towards the familiar McDonald’s food.|$|E
50|$|The band {{originally}} featured guitarist Steve Essa,bass player Anthony Henning, singer/guitarist Russell Player {{and drummer}} Chad Bartosik, {{who was also}} a member of another thrash band called <b>Neophobia.</b> Cryogenic's history is linked to that of another Sydney thrash/death metal band called Mortality, that was formed around the same time by guitarist Darren Jenkins, bass player Luke Ford and vocalist Darren Maloney. Mortality released three demos and toured with Sepultura before Jenkins was replaced by Craig Figl and original drummer Rick Fuda by Steve Pell, previously of a late-80s metal band known as Kilswitch. Mortality's activity stalled due to a long delay in the release of their debut album Structure. While it was eventually released in early 1997, dispute about musical direction saw Mortality disband six months later.|$|E

Temporary drummer Grahame Goode from <b>Neophobia</b> played with the band on a key support date with Belgian thrash band Channel Zero but without a permanent drummer Cryogenic {{was on the verge}} of splitting up. Late in the year, Mortality's ex-guitarist Jenkins joined tha band as drummer, enabling them to support Fear Factory in mid-1996 before beginning work on a debut album, Suspended Animation in early 1997. At the same time, the band deliberately cultivated a following amongst the [...] "Westy" [...] headbangers of Sydney's western suburbs. In a further link to Jenkins' former band, in the aftermath to the disbanding of Mortality, Player was then replaced by that band's vocalist Darren Maloney, who re-recorded the album's vocal parts just prior to release.|$|E
50|$|During the winter, {{the species}} forms flocks through which {{dominance}} hierarchies {{can be easily}} observed. Dominance hierarchies {{play an important role}} in determining the social behaviors among the birds in these flocks. Positive correlates to higher social rankings include territory size, body condition, singing rate, and reproductive success. The hierarchies are linear and stable; once a relationship is established between two birds, it stays the same for many years. In general, older and more experienced birds are dominant over younger individuals, and males are dominant over females. Dominant and subordinate members differ in their foraging strategies and risk taking behaviors. Dominant individuals control access to preferred resources and restrict subordinates to foraging in novel, riskier or suboptimal environments. Subordinate individuals are often observed foraging in the outermost tree parts that are more prone to predators, while dominant individuals forage low and close to the tree trunk. In experiments, subordinate individuals display less <b>neophobia</b> when approaching novel foods and objects, compared to their dominant counterparts. Subordinate individuals are also more likely to enter novel environment than their dominant counterparts. This is similar to subordinate primates who feed on novel food more readily than the dominant individuals because they are more used to eating suboptimal and unfamiliar food. There is no difference observed in ability to learn novel foraging tasks between dominant and subordinate individuals.|$|E
50|$|Few Australian {{record labels}} have {{specialised}} in heavy metal, {{and even fewer}} have focused solely on Australian heavy metal. Two {{of the best known}} are Melbourne’s Modern Invasion Music and Sydney’s now defunct Warhead Records. Daniel Janecka began Modern Invasion by managing bands like Hobbs Angel of Death and distributing early Norwegian black metal albums before releasing the first Bestial Warlust album in 1994. Since then the label has maintained its distribution service along with its own roster and now carries acts that include Chalice, Deströyer 666, Long Voyage Back and former Sadistik Exekution guitarist Rev. Kriss Hades, along with a selection of overseas bands and a small number of non-metal bands. Brad Sims established Warhead Records by selling demos from local groups and CDs by underground foreign bands. In 1993 Warhead then issued the EP Atavism by Sydney doom band Cruciform followed by Fear of the Future from teenage thrash group <b>Neophobia.</b> Expanding to a store called the Hammerhouse in Parramatta in Sydney’s west, the business traded in metal exclusively while the label released only Australian artists, by far the most successful at the local level being Cryogenic who went on to do a small scale European tour in 1998.

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{acquiring}} a taste can involve developmental maturation, genetics (of both taste sensitivity and personality), family example, and biochemical reward properties of foods. Infants are born preferring sweet foods and rejecting sour and bitter tastes, and they develop {{a preference for}} salt at approximately 4 months. <b>Neophobia</b> (fear of novelty) tends to vary with age in predictable, but not linear, ways. Babies just beginning to eat solid foods generally accept {{a wide variety of}} foods, toddlers and young children are relatively neophobic towards food, and older children, adults, and the elderly are often adventurous eaters with wide-ranging tastes. The general personality trait of novelty-seeking does not necessarily correlate highly with willingness to try new foods. Level of food adventurousness may explain much of the variability of food preferences observed in [...] "supertasters". Supertasters are highly sensitive to bitter, spicy, and pungent flavours, and some avoid them and like to eat only mild, plain foods, but many supertasters who have high food adventurousness enjoy these intense flavors and seek them out. [...] Some chemicals or combinations of chemicals in foods provide both flavor and beneficial or enjoyable effects on the body and mind and may be reinforcing, leading to an acquired taste. A study that investigated the effect of adding caffeine and theobromine (active compounds in chocolate) vs. a placebo to identically-flavored drinks that participants tasted several times, yielded the development of a strong preference for the drink with the compounds.|$|E
40|$|Familiarity of food stimuli is {{one factor}} that has been {{proposed}} to explain food preferences and food <b>neophobia</b> in children, with some research suggesting that food <b>neophobia</b> (and familiarity) is at first a predominant of the visual domain. Considering visual attentional biases are a key factor implicated in a majority of fear-related phobias/anxieties, {{the purpose of this}} research was to investigate attentional biases to familiar and unfamiliar fruit and vegetables in 8 to 11 year old children with differing levels of food <b>neophobia.</b> To this end, 70 primary aged children completed a visual-probe task measuring attentional biases towards familiar and unfamiliar fruit/vegetables, as well as the food <b>neophobia,</b> general <b>neophobia</b> and willingness to try self-report measures. Results revealed that as an undifferentiated population all children appeared to demonstrate an attentional bias toward the unfamiliar fruit and vegetable stimuli. However, when considering food <b>neophobia,</b> this bias was significantly exaggerated for children self-reporting high food <b>neophobia</b> and negligible for children self-reporting low food <b>neophobia.</b> In addition, willingness to try the food stimuli was inversely correlated with attentional bias toward the unfamiliar fruits/vegetables. Our results demonstrate that visual aspects of food stimuli (e. g. familiarity) {{play an important role in}} childhood food <b>neophobia.</b> This study provides the first empirical test of recent theory/models of food <b>neophobia</b> (e. g. Brown & Harris, 2012). Findings are discussed in light of these models and related anxiety models, along with implications concerning the treatment of childhood food <b>neophobia...</b>|$|E
40|$|The dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DB) {{is a major}} {{ascending}} pathway which {{originates in}} the locus coeruleus of the brainstem and projects to the forebrain. The behavioral role of the DB remains unclear, despite {{a great deal of}} effort. Selective attention and anxiety are two areas which have been the focus of recent research. Some studies of the DB utilize the neurotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA), since 6 -OHDA injection into this pathway results in greater than 90 percent depletion of cortical and hippocampal norepinephrine (NE). <b>Neophobia,</b> the fear of novelty, has been reported to be either increased or decreased by 6 -OHDA lesions of the DB, depending on conditions. The selective attention hypothesis would be supported by increased <b>neophobia</b> after 6 -OHDA lesions, while the anxiety hypothesis would be supported by decreased <b>neophobia.</b> We have examined the effects of 6 -OHDA DB lesions on <b>neophobia</b> under conditions in which the test environment and/or the test food were novel. We found that the lesion attenuates <b>neophobia,</b> defined as an increased preference for novel food, when both the environment and food were novel. The lesion had no effect on <b>neophobia</b> when only the environment or food was novel. ^ We examined the effects of chronic intraventricular NE infusions on behavior in our <b>neophobia</b> test, in sham and 6 -OHDA DB lesioned animals. We found that chronic NE infusions into lesioned animals significantly reversed the lesion-induced attenuation of <b>neophobia.</b> Sham/NE infused animals demonstrated a 40 percent greater preference for familiar food compared to sham/saline infused animals. These data suggest that infusions of NE have an effect opposite to lesion-induced attenuation of <b>neophobia.</b> Chronic infusions of the alpha adrenoceptor agonists had no consistent effects on <b>neophobia.</b> The beta adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol reversed the lesion-induced attenuation of <b>neophobia</b> but not to a statistically significant degree. Isoproterenol increased <b>neophobia</b> in sham animals. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, mimicked the effects of NE infusion by significantly reversing the lesion-induced attenuation of <b>neophobia,</b> while increasing <b>neophobia</b> in sham animals. These results suggest that increased release of NE during stress increases <b>neophobia</b> in part by stimulating beta adrenoceptors which activate adenylate cyclase. ...|$|E
