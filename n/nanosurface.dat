40|$|The {{contribution}} of nanoscale surface roughness on the adsorption of one key cell adhesive protein, fibronectin, on carbon nanotube/poly(carbonate) urethane composites of different surface energies was evaluated. Systematic control of various surface energies by creating different <b>nanosurface</b> roughness features {{was performed by}} mixing two promising biomaterials: multi-wall carbon nanotubes and poly(carbonate) urethane. High ratios of carbon nanotubes coated with poly(carbonate) urethane provided for greater hydrophilic surfaces because of higher <b>nanosurface</b> roughness although pure carbon nanotube surfaces were extremely hydrophobic. Fabrication methods followed in this study generated various homogenous <b>nanosurface</b> roughness values (ranging from 2 to 20 nm root mean square (RMS) AFM roughness). With the aid of such <b>nanosurface</b> roughness values in composites, a model was developed that linearly correlated <b>nanosurface</b> roughness and associated <b>nanosurface</b> energy to fibronectin adsorption. Specifically, independent contributions of surface chemistry (70 %) and surface nano-roughness (30 %) were found to mediate fibronectin adsorption. The {{results of the present}} study showed why carbon nanotube/poly(carbonate) urethane composites enhance cellular functions and tissue growth by delineating the importance of their physical nano-roughness on promoting the adsorption of a protein well known to be critical for mediating the adhesion of anchorage-dependent cells.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} surface area, porosity, and rigidity, {{applications}} of nanofibers and <b>nanosurfaces</b> have developed in recent years. Nanofibers and <b>nanosurfaces</b> are typically produced by electrospinning method. In the production process, determination of average fiber diameter is crucial for quality assessment. Average fiber diameter is determined by manually measuring the diameters of randomly selected fibers on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. However, {{as the number of}} the images increases, manual fiber diameter determination becomes a tedious and time consuming task as well as being sensitive to human errors. Therefore, an automated fiber diameter measurement system is desired. In the literature, this task is achieved by using image analysis algorithms. Typically, these methods first isolate each fiber in the image and measure the diameter of each isolated fiber. Fiber isolation is an error-prone process. In this study, automated calculation of nanofiber diameter is achieved without fiber isolation using image processing and analysis algorithms. Performance of the proposed method was tested on real data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by comparing automatically and manually measured nanofiber diameter values...|$|R

40|$|The main {{hypothesis}} {{on which}} this study has been based is that the surface modification of nano-particles of different size (Quantum Dots) and varying nano-surfaces roughness (Silicones of <b>nanosurface</b> roughness) can make them highly biocompatible in various applications of biology and medicine. In this work, {{attempts were made to}} investigate if the surface modification of nano-particles by gelatination of different size (Quantum Dots) makes them more biocompatible by reducing the toxicity on the cells and increasing the nano-surface roughness (Silicones of <b>nanosurface</b> roughness ranging from ~ 88 nm to ~ 650 nm) makes them more biocompatible by reducing the fibroblast growth of the cells in vitro. To address these questions, the nano-particles [CdTe Quantum dots of thioglycolic acid (TGA) capped gelatinated and non-gelatinated] and nano-surfaces (Silicones of <b>nanosurface</b> roughness) were characterised and then three different types of cells were used to check the biocompatibility in in vitro cell lines. At first, the Quantum Dots (QDs) were co-incubated with undifferentiated Pheochromocytoma 12 (PC 12) cells and investigated the cellular interaction, uptake and resultant toxic influence of the QD cell interplay was explored as the QD concentrations were varied over extended (up to 72 hours) co-incubation periods. Following this, QDs have been co-incubated with differentiated pheochromocytoma 12 (PC 12) cells and the apoptotic process involved in the cell death machinery and also the intrinsic behaviour of QDs upon uptake by the cells have been analysed to extended (up to 17 days) co-incubation periods. In the same experiment, differentiated PC 12 cells were also exposed to QDs after the neurites were grown for 10 days. Subsequently QDs were co-incubated with Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial (HPMEC-ST 1. 6 R) cells and analysed their cytotoxicity, differentially expressed genes and also their pathways involved to extended (up to 72 hours) co-incubation periods. Finally, the nano-surface roughnesses of silicone elastomer samples with rms surface roughnesses varying from ~ 88 nm to ~ 650 nm were co-incubated with NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblast cells and analysed the total amount of DNA to extended (up to 24 hours) co-incubation periods.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} light {{absorption}} in a plasmonic grating <b>nanosurface</b> {{can be calculated}} {{by means of a}} simple, analytical model based on a transmission line equivalent circuit. The <b>nanosurface</b> is a one-dimensional grating etched into a silver metal film covered by a silicon slab. The transmission line model is specified for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations of the incident light, and it incorporates the effect of the plasmonic modes diffracted by the ridges of the grating. Under the assumption that the adjacent ridges are weakly interacting in terms of diffracted waves, we show that the approximate, closed form expression for the reflection coefficient at the air-silicon interface can be used to evaluate light absorption of the solar cell. The weak-coupling assumption is valid if the grating structure is not closely packed and the excitation direction is close to normal incidence. Also, we show the utility of the circuit theory for understanding how the peaks in the absorption coefficient are related to the resonances of the equivalent transmission model and how this can help in designing more efficient structures...|$|E

A {{plethora of}} nanotopographies such as nanodots [4, 5], nanoislands [2, 6], nanoridges [7], nanotubes [8, 9], and nanoconcave [10] {{have been known}} to dictate the cellular behavior in the form of cell morphology, cell migration, cell viability, and cell physiology [11]. A diversity of materials such as tantalum oxide [12], titanium dioxide [13], and mica [14] have been exploited to develop <b>nanosurfaces</b> with nanotopographies and <b>nanosurfaces</b> which the body may identify as “self,” thereby providing an ideal environment for the cells to attach and grow. In the past, studies on fibroblasts [15], cardiomyocytes [16], osteoblasts [17, 18], and cancerous cell lines such as C 33 A, TOV- 112 D, and TOV- 21 G [19] have shown how the nanotopography can guide the cellular behavior in the form of cell area, focal adhesions, and microfilament bundles. Cells have been seen to respond favorably to a variety of nanotopographies between the size ranges of 20 to 100  nm [4]. Significant reduction in cell viability in addition to an elongated or an apoptotic morphology accompanied with scarce focal adhesions has been observed for nanotopographies above 100  nm [20]. Modulation in the form of Integrins further elucidates how cellular behavior and ultimately the cell fate can be dictated in vitro by nanotopographies in different size range, at the genetic level [21].|$|R

40|$|The use of {{freeform}} {{designs in}} engineering surfaces {{has become increasingly}} popular over the last decade. Applications of freeform shapes range from aesthetics of components to the bending of light rays through advanced optic designs.

Ultraprecision polishing is an emerging technology for the fabrication of high-precision and high-quality freeform surfaces.

30|$|In this study, we used {{stainless}} steel {{as a substrate}} and engineered nanoporous topographies from 100 to 220  nm (Fig.  1 a) to understand how variation {{in the size of}} nanotopographies can guide the cellular behavior and thereby providing an optimized <b>nanosurface</b> geometry for application as orthopedic implants. The morphology analysis with SEM revealed that the 100 -nm nanoporous surfaces provided an ideal environment for the cells to attach and grow (Fig.  2). Cells’ spreading area (Fig.  3 a) and density (Fig.  3 b) were found to decrease with an increment in the size on the nanopore diameter. In addition, the number of lamellipodia seen on cells cultured on 100 -nm nanoporous surfaces were more as compared to on any other nanopore diameter (Fig.  2). These results are in firm agreement with our previous studies on fibroblasts [21]. Another important conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that the 100  nm promoted cell growth while 200 - and 220 -nm nanoporous surfaces affected the cell growth negatively (Fig.  3 b). These results were further confirmed when cellular cytoskeleton and focal adhesions (vinculin) were stained. Cellular cytoskeleton was ordered (Fig.  4) with cells displaying a plethora of focal adhesions (Fig.  5 a, b) on to the <b>nanosurface.</b> Focal adhesions are important for cell attachment, and thus, growth [30]. It is therefore a reasonable conclusion that 100 -nm nanoporous surfaces provided a friendly environment for the cells to attach and grow which led to their ordered, well-extended cytoskeleton (Fig.  5 c) and morphology while 200 - and 200 -nm nanoporous surfaces caused cell death due to scarce focal adhesions (Fig.  5 a). In addition, these results are consistent with our previous studies on nanodots where cells on 200 -nm nanodots displayed an apoptotic morphology with very few focal adhesions [20]. Also, our studies on fibroblasts have proved that nanotopographies with size 200 or more do not trigger the cells to activate integrins, necessary for focal adhesion formation [21]. Consequently, cells on 100 -nm nanoporous surfaces displayed maximum vinculin-stained area than on any other <b>nanosurface.</b>|$|E
30|$|While {{the focus}} of this study was {{stainless}} steel, other materials such as titanium dioxide [34], tantalum oxide [18], nickel [35], nickel-titanium alloys [36], ceramics [37], polystyrene [38], glass [39], and plastic [40] have also been exploited to study the osteoblast behavior. However, the osteoblast behavior as a function of nanopore diameter has never been studied before. Moreover, the effect of nanopore diameter in acting as a transition step to modulate the cell behavior has also never been identified. Of course, other <b>nanosurface</b> factors such as surface roughness and nanopore depth may also affect the cell behavior along with other possible application of these nanoporous surfaces as cardiac implants, which will remain to be the subject of the future studies. Importantly, just as any biomaterial, stainless steel too possesses certain disadvantages such as mild corrosion and mismatch of physical properties with the soft tissue adjacent to the bone. However, these difficulties can be partially overcome by coating the substrates with oxides such as those tantalum. Therefore, overcoming these difficulties to generate a highly biocompatible biomaterial will remain to be {{the focus of}} upcoming studies.

Standard UV lithography using SU 8 photoresist was then employed to create a microgear onto the brass. At approximately 20 mm depth, nickel microcavity gear of 1 mm diameter was successfully created directly onto the brass substrate, after electrodeposited in nickel solution. A pulse current deposition method at a current density of 400 A/m 2 {{was used for the}} deposition process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{assembly}} of proteins into fibrillar structures {{is an important}} process that concerns different biological contexts, including molecular medicine and functional biomaterials. Engineering of hybrid biomaterials can advantageously provide synergetic interactions of the biopolymers with an inorganic component to ensure specific supramolecular organization and dynamics. To this aim, we designed hybrid systems associating collagen and surface-functionalized silica particles and we built a new strategy to investigate fibrillogenesis processes in such multicomponents systems, working {{at the crossroads of}} chemistry, physics and mathematics. The self-assembly process was investigated by bimodal multiphoton imaging coupling second harmonic generation (SHG) and 2 photon excited fluorescence (2 PEF). The in-depth spatial characterization of the system was further achieved using the three-dimensional analysis of the SHG/ 2 PEF data via mathematical morphology processing. Quantitation of collagen distribution around particles offers strong evidence that the chemically induced confinement of the protein on the silica <b>nanosurfaces</b> has a key influence on the spatial extension of fibrillogenesis. This new approach is unique in the information it can provide on 3 D dynamic hybrid systems and may be extended to other associations of fibrillar molecules with optically responsive nano-objects...|$|R
40|$|The term {{nanomaterial}} encompassesa {{variety of}} materials with nanoscalestructural features which include nanoparticles, nanofibers, <b>nanosurfaces,</b> and nanocomposites. As nanomaterials become increasingly more sophisticated in their range of physical properties (2 D surfaces, 3 D structures, variable porosity, stiffness, and biodegradability), their diversity of use for medical applications continues to ex-pand. Both physical and chemical proper-ties of biomaterials are now more readily altered, providing opportunities to improve efficacy. 1 Stem cells can be isolated {{from a variety of}} sources and consequently differ in their ease of in vitro culture, proliferation rates, and capacity to form specialized cell types. Regardless of stem cell type, current focus remains on stem cell expansion, mainte-nance of the stem cell state, differentiation, and, ultimately, transplantation and clinical application. Enhanced understanding and manipulation of stem cells to produce cell types of interest or transplantable tissues is the predominant goal of regenerative medicine. Here we restrict predominantly to investigations of nanoscale physical properties and their use in embryonic stem cell (ESC) and ESC-like-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) research. Furthermore, we assess how nanomaterials may hold the key for future advances in regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a {{considerable}} effort to study the Casimir and van der Waals forces, enabled by the improved ability to measure small forces near surfaces. Because of the continuously growing role of micro- and nanomechanical devices, the focus of this activity has shifted towards the ability to control these forces. Possible approaches to manipulating the Casimir force include development of composite materials, engineered nanostructures, mixed-phase materials, or active elements. So far, practical success has been limited. The role of geometrical factors in the Casimir force is significant. It is known, for example, that the Casimir force between two spherical shells enclosed one into the other is repulsive instead of normal attractive. Unfortunately, <b>nanosurfaces</b> with this topology are very difficult to make. A more direct approach to manipulating and neutralizing the Casimir force is using external mechanical or electromagnetic forces. Unfortunately, the technological overhead of such an approach is quite large. Using electromagnetic compensation instead of mechanical will considerably reduce this overhead {{and at the same time}} provide the degree of control over the Casimir force that mechanical springs cannot provide. A mechanical analog behind Casimir forces is shown...|$|R
