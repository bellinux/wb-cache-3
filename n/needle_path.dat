In this paper {{we examine the}} effects of these variables on <b>needle</b> <b>paths</b> in ex vivo goat liver, and demonstrate practical applications of robotic needle steering for ablation, biopsy, and brachytherapy. All experiments were performed using a new portable needle steering robot that steers asymmetric-tip needles under fluoroscopic imaging. For bevel-tip needles, we found that larger diameter needles resulted in less curvature, i. e. less steerability, confirming previous experiments in artificial tissue. The needles steered with radii of curvature ranging from 3 : 4 cm (for the most steerable pre-bent needle) to 2 : 97 m (for the least steerable bevel needle). Pre-bend angle significantly affected needle curvature, but bevel angle did not. We hypothesize that biological tissue characteristics such as inhomogeneity and viscoelasticity significantly increase path variability. These results underscore the need for closed-loop image guidance for needle steering in biological tissues with complex internal structure. I...|$|R

The current study assesses the effect of laser guidance during CBCT-guided biopsies on fluoroscopy and procedure times. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data from 15 CBCT-guided biopsies of 8 - 65 mm thoracic and abdominal lesions assisted by a ceiling-mounted laser guidance technique were compared to retrospective data of 36 performed CBCT-guided biopsies of lesions > 20 mm using the freehand technique. Fluoroscopy time, procedure time, and number of CBCT-scans were recorded. All data are presented as median (ranges). RESULTS: For biopsies using the freehand technique, more fluoroscopy time was necessary to guide the needle onto the target, 165 s (83 - 333 s) compared to 87 s (44 - 190 s) for laser guidance (p < 0. 001). Procedure times were shorter for freehand-guided biopsies, 24 min versus 30 min for laser guidance (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract — Fine needles {{facilitate}} {{diagnosis and}} therapy because they enable minimally invasive surgical interven-tions. This paper formulates {{the problem of}} steering a very flexible needle through firm tissue as a nonholonomic kinematics problem, and demonstrates how planning can be accomplished using diffusion-based motion planning on the Euclidean group, SE(3). In the present formulation, the tissue is treated as isotropic and no obstacles are present. The bevel tip of the needle is treated as a nonholonomic constraint that {{can be viewed as}} a 3 D extension of the standard kinematic cart or unicycle. A deterministic model is used as the starting point, and reachability criteria are established. A stochastic differential equation and its corresponding Fokker-Planck equation are derived. The Euler-Maruyama method is used to generate the ensemble of reachable states of the needle tip. Inverse kinematics methods developed previously for hyper-redundant and binary manipulators that use this probability density information are applied to generate <b>needle</b> tip <b>paths</b> that reach the desired targets.

The software subsequently generated three path proposals in downward quality for CT-guided biopsy. Proposed <b>needle</b> <b>paths</b> were compared with consensus proposal of two experts (comparable, less suitable, not feasible).

In 91 % {{one of the three}} automatic path proposals was rated comparable to experts’ proposal. None of the first proposals was rated not feasible, and 76 % were rated comparable to the experts’ proposal. 7 % automatic path proposals were rated not feasible, all being second choice (n= 1) or third choice (n= 6).

30|$|The {{choice of}} the needle depends on the {{mineralisation}} of the lesion {{and the presence of}} a cortical breach [16]. A 14 - to 16 -G soft tissue cutting biopsy needle is the favoured choice whenever possible. A 10 - to 16 -G bone biopsy needle is indicated for dense lesions and when the cortex is intact.

However, both patient and radiologist experience a higher exposure to radiation, which is a significant disadvantage.

The needle can be steered by adjusting {{the orientation of the}} needle tip through manipulation of the handle. The steering mechanism is evaluated by recording needle deflection at constant steering angles. A steering angle of 20. 3 ° results in a deflection of 9. 1 – 13. 3 mm in gelatin and 4. 6 – 18. 9 mm in porcine liver tissue at an insertion depth of 60 mm.

40|$|Purpose: To {{retrospectively}} assess percutaneous {{core needle}} biopsies performed by radiologists and the association with tumor seeding along the biopsy tract when anatomic compartment guidelines are not consistently observed. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data from computerized patient records and digital images from 363 consecutive computed tomographyguided biopsies {{of the lower}} extremity (thigh and leg) performed by radiologists at a single institution from August 2002 to August 2008 were analyzed for breaches of biopsy guidelines. Results: Of the 363 biopsies, 243 (67 %) were of soft tissue lesions and 120 (33 %) were of bony lesions. There were 188 (52 %) malignant and 175 (48 %) benign lesions. The following biopsy breaches were observed: 13 (3. 6 %) of anatomic compartment, 42 (11. 6 %) of "vital structures," and 82 (68. 3 %) of <b>needle</b> <b>path</b> for bony tumors. Vital structures {{as defined by the}} literature included, but were not limited to, the following: knee joint capsule, greater trochanteric bursa, rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscles, tibial tubercle, peroneus brevis and peroneus longus distal tendons, and neurovascular bundles. No cases of tumor recurrences could be attributed to needle seeding along a biopsy tract for any of these biopsy guideline breaches. Conclusions: The concern for needle tract seeding with musculoskeletal tumors is more widespread than the evidence supporting it as a significant or frequent complication.

40|$|Objectives: Difficulties {{in obtaining}} a {{representative}} tissue sample {{are a major}} obstacle in timely selecting the optimal treatment for patients with lung cancer or other malignancies. Having a modality to provide needle guidance and confirm the biopsy site selection could be of great clinical benefit, especially when small masses are targeted. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) at the tip of a core biopsy needle can be used for biopsy site confirmation in real time, thereby enabling optimized biopsy acquisition and improving diagnostic capability. Materials and methods: We included a total of 23 patients undergoing a routine computed tomography (CT) guided transthoracic needle biopsy of a lesion suspected for lung cancer or metastatic disease. DRS measurements were acquired during needle insertion and clinically relevant parameters were extracted from the spectral data along the <b>needle</b> <b>paths.</b> Histopathology results were compared with the DRS data at the final measurement position. Results: Analysis of the collective data acquired from all enrolled subjects showed significant differences (P < 0. 01) for blood content, stO(2), water content, and scattering amplitude. The identified spectral contrast matched the final pathology in 20 out of 22 clinical cases that could be used for analysis, which corresponds with an overall diagnostic performance of 91 %. Three cases underlined the importance of adequate reference measurements and the need for real time diagnostic feedback. Continuous real time DRS measurements performed during a biopsy procedure in one patient provided clear information with respect to the variation in tissue and allowed identification of the tumour boundary.

40|$|Background: To {{develop a}} {{minimally}} invasive ovarian cauterization technique under transvaginal ultrasound control {{and evaluate the}} safety and feasability of monopolar cauterization to cause ovarian injury using female cattle of reproductive age as an experimental model. Method: Experimental study in a university research center was performed. Eleven female bovines of reproductive age were submitted to monopolar transvaginal ovarian cauterization. The right ovary (RO) was punctured at four sites and 40 W was applied for 5 s at each point, {{resulting in a total}} of 800 J (Joules) of thermal energy. In the left ovary (LO), the procedure was similar, with the same time and 80 W, resulting in a thermal energy of 1600 J. Macroscopic and microscopic lesions were assessed. Results: Of 22 ovaries punctured, 20 were cauterized and exhibited macroscopic and typical microscopic lesions. No lesions could be found in the <b>needle</b> <b>path.</b> The measures of the areas of microscopic electrocautery lesions calculated estimating a cylindrical volume showed a median of 1. 12 % in the right ovary and 1. 65 % in the left ovary. When the estimate was calculated by spherical shape, the medians were 1. 77 % in the right ovary and 3. 06 % in the left ovary. There was a statistically significant difference in these two estimates (sphere, p = 0. 008; cylinder, p = 0. 021).

40|$|Intro : We {{present a}} pre-clinical robotic {{guidance}} {{system with a}} dedicated image-based control software to support needle-based interventions in the angio suite. We also present first precision results for needle placement. Methods : The system consists of a Kuka LBR robot, equipped with a control software with OpenIGTLink interface and an image-based calibration and target planning software based on MeVisLab. The robot can hold either a calibration tool, containing 4 spheres with known geometry for coordinate system alignment of the imaging device and the robot or a needle-guide that prescribes the needle trajectory and supports multi-needle-placement. For needle placement, the robot places the needle guide on the patient skin to determine the needle entry point. The calibration and targeting software provides automatic calibration tool detection, image segmentation, registration, virtual needle placement, and ablation simulation. For the precision analysis we used a 15 cm 16 G needle that has been placed at n= 13 target positions. For all positions, we compared planned and reached <b>needle</b> <b>path</b> in air and a gelatin phantom. Results : The robotic guidance system had an overall angular deviation between planned and reached position that is below 1 ° (range 0. 50 ° to 1. 37 °), and an overall deviation of the shaft resp. skin entry point of 1. 4 mm (range 0. 69 mm to 2. 41 mm).

RESULTS: We studied 10 young healthy men and found that, in the first ICS with the medial recess clearly (i. e., several cm) lateral to MCL (usually the eighth ICS), the distance between the recommended insertion site and the lung margin varied from 7. 5 to 17 cm.
