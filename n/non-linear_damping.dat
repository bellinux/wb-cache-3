ER damper and MR damper have gained wide spread attention in academia as well in auto industries due to their attractive features and promising performance potential to overcome the limitations of existing dampers in market. This work presents a comprehensive study of four different suspension dampers, where each are modeled, validated and assigned a set of parameters to facilitate a comparison of performance. The dampers considered include linear passive <b>damper,</b> two-stage asymmetric <b>non-linear</b> <b>damper,</b> ER damper and MR damper. The vibration and shock isolation performance of the dampers are compared using a four degree-of-freedom pitch plane ride model. A wide range of performance measure is considered in this investigation, namely [...] sprung and unsprung mass responses, relative motions, drift, pavement load etc. The study reveals superior vibration and shock isolation performance of ER damper and MR damper for vehicle sprung mass compared to linear passive <b>damper</b> and asymmetric <b>non-linear</b> <b>damper.</b> Since the dampers are designed as symmetric in compression and rebound, they are immune from ride height drifting problem. At higher frequencies (above 10 Hz), the dampers transmit higher load to pavement compared to other two.

40|$|AbstractFluid dampers are an {{important}} tool for dissipating unwanted vibrations {{in a range of}} engineering structures. This paper examines the effects of amplifying the displacements transferred to a <b>non-linear</b> <b>damper,</b> to increase the effectiveness of the damper in a range of situations commonly encountered in civil engineering structures. These include, (i) the ability to “fine tune” the required damping for a particular size damper, (ii) the ability to have a set of the same size dampers, but with different amplification factors to achieve a specific damping task, and (iii) to increase the sensitivity of the damper to small movements which effectively extends the range over which the damper works. Through numerical simulations and experimental tests conducted on a <b>non-linear</b> <b>damper,</b> we quantify the potential advantages of adding an amplification factor and the range of parameters where the benefit to this device is significant. The example of a two-storey structure is used as a test case and real-time dynamic substructuring tests are used to assess the complete system performance using a range of different amplification factors. The results show that the structural performance is most improved for frequencies close to resonance and that the amplification factor has an effective limit that for the case considered in this study is of approximately 3.

In order {{to gain a better}} understanding of the damping mechanism in such structures, tests were performed on a full scale bolted lattice structure and the results of section A show that the joint' damping can be represented approximately in the form: FD =C (1 +e IXIn) where n= 1.

40|$|URL] {{systems are}} often lightly damped and exhibit weak <b>non-linear</b> <b>damping.</b> The weak linear and <b>non-linear</b> <b>damping</b> forces have a {{significant}} effect on the long term behaviour of the system. However, parameter identification methods tend to concentrate on identifying the strongest forces. In this paper the applicability of two identification methods to a single degree of freedom fluidelastic system is investigated using experimental data. The system is weakly non-linear under the flow conditions and is prone to the fluidelastic instability (i. e. self excited limit cycle behaviour). The crucial effect of the weak damping forces on the system stability and post-stable behaviour has been demonstrated. The non-linearity detection and identification has been done using an analytic representation of the displacement signal (FREEVIB method) and subsequently a non-linear decrement method was used for comparison. The identified models were used to predict the global behaviour of the system in the form of limit cycle amplitudes and this has been used as an indication of accuracy. It was found that the non-linear decrement method yields superior predictions, but it suffers from the limitation that the functional form of the system must be known a priori. Therefore it is concluded that employing both methods together provides a more powerful approach for parameter estimation in a lightly damped system where weak <b>non-linear</b> <b>damping</b> plays an important role...|$|E

The main aim of it is to integrate stabilization and state reconstruction methods of non-linear systems in order to analyze a separation principle problem for non-linear systems in order to analyze a separation principle problem for non-linear systems, and then to propose a possible solution for it. The stabilization and state reconstruction methods mentioned in the thesis are based on the same element. It is called the dissipation normal form. In case of the stabilization method the dissipation normal form is used {{in such a way that}} the structure of the representation of a closed loop system is only chosen in this form. An appropriate controller is determined so that our demands required of the behaviour of a closed loop system are realized. The method provides us more flexibility in the choice of closed loop system behaviour in comparison with pole placement or optimisation techniques. We can implement magnitude-dependent damping with the help of a <b>non-linear</b> <b>damping</b> function. Then, the controller containing the <b>non-linear</b> <b>damping</b> function has a greater damping ability than controllers designed in other ways. In case of the stet reconstruction method the dissipation normal form is used in such a way that the structure of the representation of an error system is only chosen in this form. It gives us similar advantages as on the possibilities of the stabilization method. We can implement magnitude-dependent damping with the help of a <b>non-linear</b> <b>damping</b> function again. Then, the error system containing the <b>non-linear</b> <b>damping</b> function has a greater damping ability than a linear one. By means of integrating the stabilization and state reconstruction methods we have managed to find the solution of the separation principle problem for a certain class of non-linear systems. It is embodied in the proposal of a compensation function that guarantees the asymptotical stability of a resulting closed loop system after performing separation if it is put to a designed controller as an addition.

For weak viscous dissipation, a clear understanding of dynamical transitions in the integrated rod-non-linear attachment system can be gained by wavelet transforming the time series and superimposing the resulting wavelet spectra in the frequency-energy plot (FEP) of the periodic orbits of the underlying Hamiltonian system. Two distinct NES configurations are analyzed in detail, and their damped responses are analyzed by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT).
