5|$|Zubir {{died at the}} age of 80 on 16 November 1987 at Joo Chiat Place in Singapore, {{survived by}} four daughters and a son. Despite his legacy, Zubir left only S$20,000 to his name and the family had <b>no</b> <b>home</b> to call its own. In 1990 Zubir's life and passion as a {{musician}} were documented in a book titled Zubir Said: His Songs, and in 2004 a S$20,000 bronze bust of a bespectacled Zubir was installed in Gallery 6 of the Malay Heritage Centre which pays tribute to icons in Malay arts and culture.|$|E
5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, <b>no</b> <b>home</b> runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having <b>no</b> <b>home.</b> Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E

25|$|After the Confederate {{garrison}} at Norfolk was evacuated, Commodore Josiah Tattnall {{knew that}} CSS Virginia had <b>no</b> <b>home</b> port {{and he could}} not navigate her deep draft through the shallow stretches of the James River toward Richmond, so she was scuttled on May 11 off Craney Island to prevent her capture.

25|$|Another {{size and}} format {{was that of}} radio {{transcription}} discs beginning in the 1940s.

They were on average 15 minutes per side and contained several songs or radio program material. These records became less common when tape recorders began being used for radio transcriptions around 1949.|$|E

25|$|The British 6th Battalion Royal Marines Light Infantry (RMLI) was {{scratched}} {{together from}} a company of the Royal Marine Artillery and companies {{from each of the}} three naval port depots. Very few of their officers had seen any land fighting. Their original purpose had been only to deploy to Flensburg to supervise a vote to decide whether northern Schleswig-Holstein should remain German or be given to Denmark. Many of the Marines were less than 19 years old; it would have been unusual to send them overseas. Others were ex-prisoners of war who had only recently returned from Germany and had <b>no</b> <b>home</b> leave.|$|E
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>home</b> video release has yet {{featured}} the film's original theatrical aspect ratio. Plan 9 was composed and shot for 1.85:1 aspect ratio theatrical projection, the predominant widescreen format. As unskilled a filmmaker as Ed Wood was, even he never intended for his film {{to be seen}} in a 1.33:1 open matte aspect ratio, as all home video editions have been. This has led to various boom mikes and edges of props, etc., being seen at {{the top and bottom of}} the image, which was always intended to be cropped, thus unfairly maligning the film yet further.|$|E
50|$|A bushfire at Katoomba and the Blue Mountains on 24 October {{caused some}} houses {{and a school}} to be evacuated, over 100 fire-fighters and three {{aircraft}} responding to contain the blaze. Some minor property damage occurred but <b>no</b> <b>homes</b> {{were lost in the}} blaze.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} this season, {{the veteran}} Australian Test umpire Mel McInnes retired after a {{controversial}} season and a series of questionable decisions that prompted May and English manager Freddie Brown to call for his standing down. This left a vacancy for an Australian Test umpire. During the 1959–60 Australian summer, there were <b>no</b> <b>home</b> Tests as the national team was in the Indian subcontinent. In the meantime, Egar stood in all four Shield matches at the Adelaide Oval. The 1960–61 season saw the first Tests on Australian soil since McInnes's retirement. Egar stood in South Australia's matches against Victoria, the West Indies and Tasmania, before being selected to make his Test debut.|$|E
25|$|As Tanith is destroyed, the Tanith First-and-Only has <b>no</b> <b>home</b> {{world from}} which to draw new {{recruits}} to replace losses. Instead, new Ghosts are adopted into the regiment as the series progresses. The two most significant drafts of new troops occur in Necropolis and His Last Command. At {{the end of the}} siege of Vervunhive, the megacity is left in ruins and disillusioned citizens of Verghast were given the opportunity to join the Imperial Guard under the Act of Consolation. This resulted in an influx of Verghastite soldiers, which brought females into the regiment. Several of these women became some of the regiment's best snipers. While Gaunt is on Gereon and the Tanith First is left without a senior commander, the regiment is merged with a Belladon covert unit and becomes the 81st–1st Recon. Following Colonel Wilder's death and Gaunt's return to command, the regiment resumes the name the Tanith First-and-Only.|$|E
25|$|He {{caught a}} lucky break in 1966 when {{producer}} Daniel Melnick needed {{a writer and}} director to adapt Katherine Anne Porter's short novel Noon Wine for television. Melnick was {{a big fan of}} The Westerner and Ride the High Country, and had heard Peckinpah had been unfairly fired from The Cincinnati Kid. Against the objections of many within the industry, Melnick hired Peckinpah and gave him free rein. Peckinpah completed the script, which Miss Porter enthusiastically endorsed, and the project became an hour-long presentation for ABC Stage 67. Taking place in turn of the century West Texas, Noon Wine was a dark tragedy about a farmer's act of futile murder which leads to suicide. Starring Jason Robards and Olivia de Havilland, the film was a critical hit, with Peckinpah nominated by the Writers Guild for Best Television Adaptation and the Directors Guild of America for Best Television Direction. Robards kept a personal copy of the film in his private collection for years as he considered the project to be one of his most satisfying professional experiences. A rare film which had <b>no</b> <b>home</b> video release until 2014, Noon Wine is today considered one of Peckinpah's most intimate works, revealing his dramatic potential and artistic depth.|$|E
