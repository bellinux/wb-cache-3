50|$|Citrinin is a toxin {{that was}} first {{isolated}} from Penicillium citrinum, {{but has been}} identified in over a dozen species of Penicillium and several species of Aspergillus. Some of these species are used to produce human foodstuffs such as cheese (Penicillium camemberti), sake, miso, and soy sauce (Aspergillus oryzae). Citrinin is associated with yellowed rice disease in Japan and acts as a <b>nephrotoxin</b> in all animal species tested. Although it is associated with many human foods (wheat, rice, corn, barley, oats, rye, and food colored with Monascus pigment) its full significance for human health is unknown. Citrinin can also act synergistically with Ochratoxin A to depress RNA synthesis in murine kidneys.|$|E
50|$|Ochratoxin is a {{mycotoxin}} {{that comes}} in three secondary metabolite forms, A, B, and C. All are produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus species. The three forms differ in that Ochratoxin B (OTB) is a nonchlorinated form of Ochratoxin A (OTA) and that Ochratoxin C (OTC) is an ethyl ester form Ochratoxin A. Aspergillus ochraceus is found as a contaminant {{of a wide range}} of commodities including beverages such as beer and wine. Aspergillus carbonarius is the main species found on vine fruit, which releases its toxin during the juice making process. OTA has been labeled as a carcinogen and a <b>nephrotoxin,</b> and has been linked to tumors in the human urinary tract, although research in humans is limited by confounding factors.|$|E

Although some early reports implicated several Penicillium species, it is now thought that Penicillium verrucosum, a common contaminant of barley, is the only confirmed ochratoxin producer in this genus. Nevertheless, many mycotoxin reviews reiterate erroneous species lists.|$|E

40|$|Renal micropuncture {{studies have}} greatly changed our {{views on the}} {{pathophysiology}} of acute renal failure caused by <b>nephrotoxins.</b> Formerly, this type of renal insufficiency was attributed to a direct effect of the <b>nephrotoxins</b> on tubule epithelial permeability. According to that theory, glomerular filtration was not greatly diminished, the filtrate formed being absorbed almost quantitatively and nonselectively across damaged tubule epithelium. Studies {{in a wide variety}} of rat models have now shown glomerular filtration to be reduced to a level which will inevitably cause renal failure in and of itself. Passive backflow of filtrate across tubular epithelium is either of minor degree or nonexistent even in models where frank tubular necrosis has occured. This failure of filtration cannot be attributed to tubular obstruction since proximal tubule pressure is distinctly subnormal in most models studied. Instead, filtration failure appears best attributed to intrarenal hemodynamic alterations. While certain facts tend to incriminate the renin-angiotensin system as the cause of the hemodynamic aberrations, others argue to the contrary. The issue is under active investigation. Although the clinical syndrome of posttraumatic acute renal failure was well recognize...|$|R
30|$|AKI is a {{frequent}} occurrence following major abdominal surgery and is independently associated with both in-hospital and long-term mortality, {{as well as with}} a higher risk of progressing to CKD.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} the acute glomerulonephritis induced in rats by the injection of anti-rat-kidney serum prepared in rabbits will, under proper conditions, develop into a chronic progressive disease with ultimate renal failure and death (1). Early in the work we believed that the principal factor influencing the development of chronic progressive nephritis was the quantity of <b>nephrotoxin</b> administered. Thus, the injection of an ap-preciable quantity of a weakly nephrotoxic serum, or of {{a small amount of}} a more potent antikidney serum, resulted in a mild nephritis that rapidly sub-sided. Continued renal irritation was originally observed only in rats that had survived a severe acute disease induced by sublethal amounts of <b>nephrotoxin.</b> Later, however, it was shown that the course of the nephritis could be markedly influenced by diet (2).

50|$|Some {{chemicals}} {{toxic to}} the kidney, called <b>nephrotoxins,</b> damage the renal papillae. Damage to the renal papillae {{may result in}} death to cells in this region of the kidney, called renal papillary necrosis. The most common toxic causes of renal papillary necrosis are NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, and phenylbutazone, in combination with dehydration.

40|$|The unknown {{aetiology}} of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) {{has attracted}} recent attention {{as a result}} of the increasing global prevalence and recent reviews of occupational and environmental exposure to <b>nephrotoxins.</b> The main focus of this research is to examine the potential relationship between environmental exposure to known <b>nephrotoxins</b> including arsenic, cadmium and lead and the potential health risk associated with the progressive dysfunction of the kidneys in renal impaired patients with CKD across Northern Ireland. In addition to these known <b>nephrotoxins,</b> co-abundance with several essential elements has been found to play a role as protecting mechanisms while others increase the uptake of nephrotoxic elements {{as a result of}} similar absorption mechanisms within the body. Key elements protecting the body from toxicity include selenium and zinc, whereas those which have been attributed to enhance the uptake of arsenic, cadmium and lead include iron and calcium. The compositional nature of the soil and stream geochemical data is explored to aid in the analysis of interactions between elements. Two approaches, one data-driven and the other knowledge-driven, are explored to investigate the associations between co-abundant elements. The bioaccessibility of these elements, which is the portion of the relevant toxin absorbed within the body, is also investigated to identify areas across Northern Ireland with an increased environmental hazard and potential health risk. The study uses a combination of datasets from the United Kingdom Renal Registry (UKRR) unknown aetiology subset, the soil and stream geochemical dataset from the Tellus Survey (GSNI) with the addition of a bioaccessibility subset. Findings suggest a relationship between the presence of elevated arsenic in stream waters and impaired renal function of the kidneys. Interactions between essential elements and potentially toxic elements could explain the regional variation of CKD of uncertain aetiology across Northern Ireland...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} {{of blood in}} the urine is, of all the parameters normally tested, the one that is most closely related with traumatic damage to the kidneys or the genitourinary tract. The most common causes of hematuria are: nephrolithiasis, glomerular disease, tumours, pyelonephritis, exposure to <b>nephrotoxins,</b> and treatment with anticoagulants. Non-pathological hematuria can be observed after strenuous exercise and during menstruation. The normal number of red blood cells in urine should not usually exceed 3 per high power field.|$|R
40|$|Nephritis can {{be induced}} in rats by the {{injection}} of anti-kidney sera obtained from rabbits immunized with suspensions of perfused rat kidney. Anti-kidney sera, thus prepared, contain {{a number of}} antibodies capable, on injection into rats, of inducing a severe anaphylactoid reaction with general vascular manifestations that involve the kidney {{as well as other}} organs. These sera also contain a nephrotoxic agent that affects the kidney primarily. The nephrotoxic effect is characterized clinically by severe persistent albuminuria with casts, and transient anasarca during the acute disease, but no significant hematuria occurs. When a severe anaphylactoid reaction is superimposed on the nephrotoxic injury, hematuria is an outstanding feature. <b>Nephrotoxin</b> is demonstrable in vivo and is not related quantitatively to the precipitins in the anti-kidney serum against kidney extract. It is most readily obtained by immunization with kidney suspensions, but may occasionally appear after injections of other organ preparations; it does not result from immunization with erythrocytes or serum. <b>Nephrotoxin</b> is present in the globulin fraction of anti-kidney serum. The nephrotoxic action of anti-kidney serum is easily removed by absorption with kidney cells or fat-free kidney tissue. Similar preparations of liver likewise remove it, but less readily.

30|$|Introduction Critically ill {{children}} {{are exposed to}} multiple nephrotoxic medications {{due to the nature}} of the underlying disease process as well as comorbid conditions.

Despite higher inherent risk, data on AKI and <b>nephrotoxin</b> use in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting is scarce. Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score (FOKIS) is a decision support tool piloted in our PICU as a daily score incorporating subscores for AKI (pRIFLE creatinine and urine output), fluid overload (total fluid (in- out)/ICU admission weight), and exposure to nephrotoxic medications (a priori determined list of medications).|$|E
40|$|Studies of the {{mechanism}} of experimental nephrotoxic nephritis (1 - 8) have been concerned largely with: (a) the specificity of the <b>nephrotoxins,</b> (b) their sites of localization, especially in the kidney, and (c) the presence {{and the role of}} immune responses in the nephritic animal. In recent years a considerable body of direct evidence relating to these problems has been furnished by the use of labelled antibody techniques, first applied to this field in the form of radioiodinated <b>nephrotoxins</b> by Pressman et al. (4, 5, 9). Among the results achieved by this group was the demonstration that nephrotoxic T-globulins are preferentially absorbed by the kidney, where they localize, at least in greater part, in the glomeruli, and that the radioactive tracer and, presumably, the intact antibody persist for up to 2 months at the sites of tissue localization. Recently, the potentialities of tracer methods have been more fully realized with the introduction by MeUors et al. (10) of fluorescein-coupled antibodies as histochemical reagents for the detection of tissue-localizing antibodies in viva. This new application of the technique developed by Coons et al.
