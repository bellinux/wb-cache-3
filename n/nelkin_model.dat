40|$|In the {{framework}} of the interaction of a neutron with molecular nuclei and with a special view to organic molecules (polyphenyls), a preliminary analysis is made in this paper on the scattering by bound protons in the benzene molecule (this molecule is assumed to be a fundamental dynamic unit). In evaluating the effect of the molecular dynamics on the scattering of thermal neutrons, several physical hypotheses have been tried. The main purpose of these assumptions is to enable us, when considering explicitly the dynamics of the proton, to investigate both the influence of the different individual features of the molecular dynamics and the effect of different mathematical approximations on the explicit consideration of such dynamical features. This has been performed with reference to experimental results both on integral quantities (e. g. the total scattering cross-section) and on differential ones. In {{the framework}} of the gas model we have first investigated the effect of a single " structure " parameter, namely the effective mass Mo. We have then considered a " molecular gas " by introducing two parameters (Krieger-Nelkin) : one, of the effective mass Mo type, accounting for rotations and translations and a second one formally taking into account the elastic vibrational transitions from the ground state. The possibility is here discussed of calculating the best fitted value of the parameter Mo from experimental data, the value of the vibrational parameter being determined once the frequency distribution of the proton in the molecule is known. The particular structure of this vibrational spectrum induced us to discuss a " two-vibrational model " in analogy to the <b>Nelkin</b> <b>model</b> for the H 2 O molecule, where, in the explicit consideration of the various degrees of freedom, the complicated vibrational spectrum has been replaced by an isotropic, very simplified one. Finally we have treated as predominant the purely vibrational features (still in the frame of the harmonic approximation), considering explicitly the anisotropy of the vibrational spectrum and evaluating in a more correct way the relation of the molecular orientations. In view of this, we started by neglecting (as a first approximation) the rotational and translational degrees of freedom; these will be appropriately introduced later by means of a correction in the vibrational spectrum in the low energy region. We also made a comparison between this analysis, which—in the frame work of an analogy with a polycrystalline assembly of graphite microcrystals — adopts the formalism of Schofield and Hassitt and the set of more refined and mathematically more correct assumptions contained in the Summit code which translates the Parks' viewpoint...|$|E
