5|$|The Brittens are {{involved}} in a fatal car crash. As a result, Michael Britten, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective, begins to live in two separate realities. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survives the crash, and in the other reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survives. Michael does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> reality is real, and uses the wristbands to differentiate the two.|$|E
5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary. The most complete account {{is that of}} Arnold Jacobi (1895) on specimens from Great Natuna (Natuna Islands) and Djemadja (Anamba Islands). Unfortunately, although {{it is clear that}} anatomical differences exist in the two species Jacobi dissected, unfortunately we do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper he referred to the two species as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus. However, that is not possible, because in reality Amphidromus chloris is a species found only in the Philippine Islands, and the interruptus phase of A. perversus is not present in the Natuna Islands.|$|E
5|$|To counter Cleveland’s {{image of}} {{superior}} morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child {{while he was}} a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted “Ma, Ma, where’s my Pa?”—to which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended, “Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha!” Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland. Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland’s friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named. Cleveland did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them. At the same time, Democratic operatives accused Blaine and his wife of not having been married when their eldest son, Stanwood, was born in 1851; this rumor was false, however, and caused little excitement in the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Samoa Joe and Booker T {{started a}} rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship {{following}} Slammiversary. On the June12 episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat {{him at the}} event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July13 for the title. On the July10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed that he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> of the two would win at Victory Road, but {{that he would be}} there to watch. At the event, Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail. He was stopped when Sting interfered in the contest by bashing Joe with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell. The match result was ruled a no-contest, with Joe retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. On the June12 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe's mentor Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title. Since Houston is Booker T's hometown, TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship {{for the people of}} Houston. On the July 10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed that he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would be there to watch.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

25|$|In {{a police}} photo lineup, an officer shows {{a group of}} photos to a witness or crime victim and asks {{him or her to}} pick out the suspect. This is {{basically}} a single-blind test of the witness's memory, and may be subject to subtle or overt influence by the officer. There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a double-blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos to the witness does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> photo is of the suspect.|$|E

25|$|Cave arrows, Line arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic {{arrowhead}} markers {{which are}} hooked onto a cave line by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They {{are used to}} indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. The message is simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> way to go at a line junction {{there is a risk}} of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver gets back to the tie-off, he or she can identify which way to turn.|$|E
25|$|Process variations: With MOSFETs {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs. See process variation, design for manufacturability, reliability engineering, and statistical process control.|$|E

25|$|Every {{operation}} {{performed by}} a computer emits electromagnetic radiation and different operations emit radiation at different frequencies. In electromagnetic side-channel attacks, an attacker is only interested in a few frequencies at which encryption is occurring. Signal processing is responsible for isolating these frequencies from the vast multitude of extraneous radiation and noise. To isolate certain frequencies, a bandpass filter, which blocks frequencies outside of a given range, must {{be applied to the}} electromagnetic trace. Sometimes, the attacker does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> frequencies encryption is performed at. In this case, the trace can be represented as a spectrogram, which can help determine which frequencies are most prevalent at different points of execution. Depending on the device being attacked and the level of noise, several filters may need to be applied.|$|E
25|$|Games such as {{the game}} of chicken and hawk-dove game in which players score highest when they choose {{opposite}} strategies, i.e., discoordinate, are called anti-coordination games. They have reaction correspondences (Figure 4) that cross {{in the opposite direction}} to coordination games, with three Nash equilibria, one in each of the top left and bottom right corners, where one player chooses one strategy, the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners. If the players do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> one of them is which, then the mixed Nash is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), as play is confined to the bottom left to top right diagonal line. Otherwise an uncorrelated asymmetry is said to exist, and the corner Nash equilibria are ESSes.|$|E
25|$|C++ also {{provides}} the dynamic_cast operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, {{to a more}} derived type: downcasting. The attempt is necessary as often one does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> derived type is referenced. (Upcasting, conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via static_cast, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.) dynamic_cast relies on run-time type information (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a dynamic_cast to a pointer fails, {{the result is the}} nullptr constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects known to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with static_cast, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of dynamic_cast, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.|$|E
