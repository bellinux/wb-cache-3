25|$|The {{reason why}} Odo was {{defeated}} so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, but had won 11 years earlier at the Battle of Toulouse is simple. At Toulouse, Odo managed a surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe. The Umayyad forces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry {{they did have}} <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to mobilize. As Herman of Carinthia wrote {{in one of his}} translations of a history of al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers totally by surprise – the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.|$|E

25|$|After {{initially}} playing {{five games}} in the reserves Seed got his first team chance with Spurs, making his debut at inside right and forming an immediate understanding with the legendary, diminutive right winger Fanny Walden. Seed played five {{games in the}} remainder of the 1919–20 season, scoring two goals as Spurs ran away with the Division Two title. Seed was a virtual ever present for Spurs in the following seven seasons in Division One. The 1920–21 season saw Tottenham lift the FA Cup with Seed playing in all six matches in the cup run, scoring five goals including a hat trick against Bradford City in the second round. Just two months after getting his cup winners medal Seed was called up for the first of this five England caps on 21 May 1921 against Belgium, he <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> long run in the international side, playing his final game in April 1925.|$|E
25|$|In the Kansas City Regional, both top seeds {{were upset}} in the {{semifinal}} round. Kentucky, led by 21 point from A'dia Mathies, {{opened up a}} lead ant he second half, extended it to 19 points, and were victorious, beating Nebraska 76–67 {{to advance to the}} regional finals. The regional semifinal game was a second of the season for Oklahoma and Notre Dame, a game the Irish has won in the regular season. In this game the score was tied early, while Oklahoma took a slim lead at the half. They extended the lead to eight points in the second half, but Notre Dame took the lead back at 50–49. With less than a minute to play, Oklahoma took a three-point lead, but Skyler Diggins hit a three-pointer to tie the game at 66 points each. Oklahoma had the ball for the last possession, but <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> shot off, so the game went to overtime. The game was tied with 72 points for each team with seconds to go when Oklahoma had another chance. This time, Nyeshia Stevenson hit a three-pointer, giving the Sooners a three-point lead with just over four seconds to go. Notre Dame tried a long inbounds pass, but were unsuccessful, and Oklahoma won 77–72.|$|E

[...] The Signal Corps photographers instead assisted with escorting the POWs out of the camp.|$|E

500|$|Lin {{worked to}} improve his jump shot during the offseason by abandoning the {{shooting}} form he had used since the eighth grade. He also increased his strength, doubling the weight he could squat (from [...] to [...] ) and almost tripling the number of pull-ups {{that he could do}} (from 12 to 30). He increased his body weight from [...] to —including [...] of muscle—added [...] to his standing vertical jump and [...] to his running vertical jump, and improved his lateral quickness by 32percent. Due to the lockout, he <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to workout for new Warriors coach Mark Jackson. On the first day of training camp on December 9, 2011, the Warriors waived Lin. He was a favorite of Lacob, but the Warriors were freeing up salary cap space to make an offer to restricted free agent center DeAndre Jordan; Lin was due to make almost $800,000 that would have become fully guaranteed on February 10, 2012. The San Francisco Chronicle said Lin would have had trouble beating out rookie guard Charles Jenkins.|$|E
500|$|Paynter next went east {{to run in}} the Grade I Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on August 31. [...] Five of {{the horses}} in the initial seven-horse field, {{including}} Paynter, were previous Grade I stakes winners. [...] Paynter drew post position 5 and was the second favorite at 3-1 odds on the morning line. However, following the scratch of a speed horse, the oddsmaker revised his figures to make front-running Paynter the 2-1 favorite. On race day, over a sloppy track, another horse, Mucho Macho Man, scratched and only five horses went to the post. Paynter had a bad start, hitting {{the left side of the}} starting gate. [...] Although he ran second for part of the race, he finished last in the field. Justin Zayat said after the race, [...] " [...] <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> hold of the track. We’ll be back another day." [...] Baffert concurred, stating that the horse was [...] "fine", but had been troubled by the poor break and by mud hitting his face.|$|E

As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And you <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to see how good I've done / And you never got to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return {{to the top of}} music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key {{as the rest of the}} song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|E

500|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of Enterprise in early May, Saratoga became the only operational American fleet carrier in the South Pacific. Task Force 14, as her group was now known, was reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser [...] on 3 May and by the British fleet carrier [...] on 17 May. At this time Saratoga embarked 34 Wildcats of VF-5, 37 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3 and 16 Avengers of VT-8. Ramsey's force was intended to provide distant cover for the impending landings on New Georgia and to prevent intervention by any Japanese carriers. The two carriers spent some weeks familiarizing each other with their capabilities and tactics and Ramsey decided {{to take advantage of}} each carrier's strengths. He ordered that the Avengers of 832 Squadron be exchanged for 24 Wildcats from VF-3 as Victorious had difficulty operating the large Avenger and the British carrier possessed better facilities for coordinating fighter operations than Saratoga; the latter retained a dozen Wildcats for self-defense and escort duties. Fortunately, Ramsey <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to test his reorganization as the Japanese carriers made no effort to attack the American transports. Ramsey was relieved on 26 July and replaced by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. Victorious sailed on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as reserves for Saratoga.|$|E
500|$|New York City doubled for Metropolis, {{while the}} New York Daily News Building {{served as the}} {{location}} for {{the offices of the}} Daily Planet. Brooklyn Heights was also used. Filming in New York lasted five weeks, {{during the time of the}} New York City blackout of 1977. Production moved to Alberta for scenes set in Smallville, with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of Beynon, Alberta, the high school football scenes at Barons, Alberta, and the Kent farm constructed at Blackie, Alberta. Brief filming also took place in Gallup, New Mexico, Lake Mead and Grand Central Terminal. Director Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule. Creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz reflected, [...] "Donner <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, 'Why don't you just schedule the film for the next two days, and then I'll be nine months over?'." [...] Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers, was then brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who by now were refusing to talk to each other. With his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, [...] "At one time if I'd seen him, I would have killed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} and final arc of the manga, the story took a darker tone {{as most of the}} {{characters}} believed Kaoru was killed by Yukishiro Enishi which made Kenshin question his own way of living and escape to a village of wanderers. Watsuki did not enjoy angst in Kenshin so his friend Myōjin Yahiko took the place as the series' protagonist until Kenshin recovered. In order to make Kenshin recover, Watsuki introduced Tomoe's father, who is simply referred as [...] "Geezer", who assists him in finding an answer to atone for his sins. Once Kenshin recovered, he runs back to the city in order to save Yahiko from Enishi's former comrade, Kujiranami Hyōgo. The fight was originally planned to last longer than the one-chapter shot but due to difficulties in drawing explosions Kujinarami made with his weapons, the fight ended with Kenshin cutting Kujinarami's weapon. In this arc's climax, Watsuki kept listening to the song [...] "Hurry Go Round" [...] by late musician hide which felt it suited the relationship between Enishi as well as Kenshin but in his darker persona. The author also commented he would like to have given both Kenshin and Enishi's characters a bigger contrast. A reader also asked Watsuki whether Kenshin could defeat his rival Saitō Hajime since they <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> final duel. Watsuki responded, saying the two are equally matched but the result might depend whether or not Kenshin had something to protect. At the end of the series, Kenshin appears with short hair. Initially, Watsuki had planned to make his hair shorter before the end; however, he found this to be similar to the character Multi in To Heart. Additionally, Himura Kenji was introduced in the finale as the son of Kenshin and Kaoru; even though the character was [...] "cliché" [...] Watsuki felt that Kenji had to appear.|$|E
