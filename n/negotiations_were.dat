When <b>negotiation</b> <b>is</b> claimed beneficial theoretically, it is important that the deployment of <b>negotiation</b> <b>is</b> examined and the effectiveness of <b>negotiation</b> <b>is</b> evaluated through empirical study. This paper aims at providing an empirical framework design to examine the improvement in software requirements through negotiation. Besides, it elaborates the relevance of negotiation in requirements elicitation process and its effectiveness. An empirical study method is imposed to design the framework.

40|$|<b>Negotiation</b> <b>is</b> {{ubiquitous}} {{in the public}} sector, from policy formation to budget allocation or the coordination of public–private partnerships. The focus on <b>negotiations</b> has nevertheless <b>been</b> somewhat limited in public administration research, but in neighboring disciplines such as behavioral economics and social psychology, <b>negotiations</b> have <b>been</b> studied extensively. This chapter aims at filling this gap. This chapter discusses negotiations {{by focusing on the}} individual negotiator. I focus on what a <b>negotiation</b> <b>is</b> and who negotiates in the public sector by discussing some substantive examples. Distributive and integrative <b>negotiations</b> <b>are</b> discerned and are accompanied by some public sector illustrations. Specific attention is given to public sector distinctiveness in context and its workers and its potential consequences for negotiations...|$|R

5|$|The German–Yugoslav Partisan <b>{{negotiations}}</b> <b>were</b> held between German {{commanders in}} the Independent State of Croatia and the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans in March 1943 during World War II. The negotiations – focused on obtaining a ceasefire and establishing a prisoner exchange – were conducted during the Axis Case White offensive. They were used by the Partisans to delay the Axis forces while the Partisans crossed the Neretva river, and to allow the Partisans to focus on attacking their Chetnik rivals led by Draža Mihailović. The <b>negotiations</b> <b>were</b> accompanied by an informal ceasefire that lasted about six weeks before being called off on orders from Adolf Hitler. The short-term advantage gained by the Partisans through the negotiations was lost when the Axis Case Black offensive was launched in mid-May 1943. Prisoner exchanges, which had been occurring between the Germans and Partisans for some months prior, re-commenced in late 1943 and continued {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} did {{not resolve}} all the patent disputes, and further <b>negotiations</b> <b>were</b> undertaken and concords signed {{over the course}} of the 1930s.

5|$|The {{ascendancy}} of Li Yuanhong to Chinese Presidency in 1916, {{led to the}} negotiations reopening through his former private secretary who resided in the United States at the time. In exchange for allowing arms shipments to India via China's borders, China was offered German military assistance and the rights to 10% of any material shipped to India via China. The <b>negotiations</b> <b>were</b> ultimately unsuccessful due to Sun Yat Sen's opposition to an alliance with Germany.|$|E

5|$|The embassy party {{left behind}} in Canton in 1518 {{proceeded}} north in January 1520 {{with the rest of}} the Portuguese under Tomé Pires and Fernão Pires de Andrade. The embassy reached Nanjing, where the Zhengde Emperor was touring in May 1520, granting the Portuguese embassy a quick audience. However, further diplomatic <b>negotiations</b> <b>were</b> to be resumed once the emperor returned to Beijing; hence, the Portuguese embassy was sent there to wait for the emperor's return.|$|E

5|$|Always in {{the thick}} of the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present near the city of Troyes. Negotiations for an {{armistice}} were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the <b>negotiations</b> <b>were</b> taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that <b>negotiations</b> <b>were</b> indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Blücher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Château-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.|$|E
40|$|<b>Negotiations</b> <b>are</b> a {{formalism}} {{for describing}} multiparty distributed cooperation. Alternatively, {{they can be}} seen as a model of concurrency with synchronized choice as communication primitive. Well-designed <b>negotiations</b> must <b>be</b> sound, meaning that, whatever its current state, the <b>negotiation</b> can still <b>be</b> completed. In a former paper, Esparza and Desel have shown that deciding soundness of a <b>negotiation</b> <b>is</b> PSPACE-complete, and in PTIME if the <b>negotiation</b> <b>is</b> deterministic. They have also provided an algorithm for an intermediate class of acyclic, non-deterministic negotiations, but left the complexity of the soundness problem open. In the first part of this paper we study two further analysis problems for sound acyclic deterministic negotiations, called the race and the omission problem, and give polynomial algorithms. We use these results to provide the first polynomial algorithm for some analysis problems of workflow nets with data previously studied by Trcka, van der Aalst, and Sidorova. In the second part we solve the open question of Esparza and Desel 2 ̆ 7 s paper. We show that soundness of acyclic, weakly non-deterministic <b>negotiations</b> <b>is</b> in PTIME, and that checking soundness is already NP-complete for slightly more general classes...|$|R

5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, <b>negotiations</b> <b>were</b> soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E
5|$|As {{the results}} of the binding {{referendum}} were to join Canada, Newfoundland began to negotiate with Canada to enter into Confederation.

Newfoundland officially joined Canada at midnight, March 31, 1949. At the elections for the Newfoundland House of Assembly two months later, Smallwood's Liberal Party won and controlled the provincial government until the 1970s.
