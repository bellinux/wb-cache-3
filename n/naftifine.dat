5000|$|Petasis and {{coworkers}} proposed, in their seminal study, that vinyl boronic acids can react with the adducts of secondary amines and paraformaldehyde to give tertiary allylamines. The {{geometry of the}} double bond of the starting vinyl boronic acid is completely retained in the final product. Yield is typically in the good to excellent range. The following reaction is particularly effective, hitting a yield of 96%:Petasis {{and coworkers}} used this reaction to synthesize <b>naftifine,</b> a very potent topical antimycotic, in one step in 82% yield. Other compounds with related structure include terbinafine and NB598.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the locus and {{severity}} of infection. For tinea pedis, many antifungal creams such as miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid are effective. For more severe or complicated infections, oral ketoconazole was historically shown {{to be an effective}} treatment for T. rubrum infections but is no longer used for this indication due to the risk of liver damage as a side effect. Oral terbinafine, itraconazole or fluconazole have all been shown to be safer, effective treatments. Terbinafine and <b>naftifine</b> (topical creams) have been successfully treated tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by T. rubrum.

50|$|The Petasis {{reaction}} (alternatively {{called the}} Petasis borono-Mannich (PBM) reaction) is the chemical reaction of an amine, aldehyde, and vinyl- or aryl-boronic acid to form substituted amines.Reported in 1993 by Nicos Petasis {{as a practical}} method towards the synthesis of a geometrically pure antifungal agent, <b>naftifine,</b> the Petasis reaction {{can be described as}} a variation of the Mannich reaction. Rather than generating an enolate to form the substituted amine product, in the Petasis reaction, the vinyl group of the organoboronic acid serves as the nucleophile. In comparison to other methods of generating allyl amines, the Petasis reaction tolerates a multifunctional scaffold, with a variety of amines and organoboronic acids as potential starting materials. Additionally, the reaction does not require anhydrous or inert conditions. As a mild, selective synthesis, the Petasis reaction is useful in generating α-amino acids, and is utilized in combinatorial chemistry and drug discovery.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Naftifine</b> is {{a topical}} {{allylamine}} that is effective and {{safe in the}} management of superficial dermatomycoses. <b>Naftifine</b> is fungicidal in vitro against a broad spectrum of dermatophyte fungi and provides good activity against Candida and Aspergillus species. It is also effective against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Objective: To provide a review of the pharmacologic properties and clinical efficacy of topical <b>naftifine</b> preparations. Methods: A review of the medical literature was performed using PubMed (1965 – 2006) using the search term ‘‘naftifine. ’ ’ All available English-language articles discussing the pharmacology and clinical use of <b>naftifine</b> were reviewed for the article. Results: <b>Naftifine</b> causes interruption of fungal ergosterol synthesis and accumulation of squalene in fungal organisms. <b>Naftifine</b> also has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties such as a reduction in superoxide production and a reduction in polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis/endothelial adhesion. <b>Naftifine</b> has shown good efficacy and safety for a variety of conditions and is a useful treatment that provides both antifungal action and relief of inflammatory signs and symptoms. Few adverse events have been noted with <b>naftifine</b> use, the most frequent being mild and transient burning, stinging, or itching in the application area.

40|$|Many {{antimycotic}} agents {{negatively affect}} the natural immune response. Typically, these drugs impair polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) production of superoxide anion, chemotaxis, or {{the killing of}} pathogens. Allylamines are {{a new class of}} antimycotic compounds with a new mechanism of antifungal action, i. e., inhibition of the fungal squalene epoxidase. The trial that we describe aimed to evaluate the effects of two allylamines, terbinafine and <b>naftifine,</b> on selected functions of PMNs, i. e., superoxide anion production, chemotaxis, and killing of Candida albicans blastospores. Terbinafine and <b>naftifine</b> on their own did not affect superoxide anion production when they were added to PMNs. When PMNs were preincubated with allylamines and were then stimulated by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe or phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, superoxide anion production was increased (priming effect). Since intracellular free calcium (Ca 2 +i) is involved in the control of superoxide anion production, we evaluated the effects of the allylamines on the Ca 2 +i concentration ([Ca 2 +]i). In the presence of terbinafine or <b>naftifine,</b> the [Ca 2 +]i increased in a dose-dependent manner; the source of Ca 2 +i was not extracellular since it was not affected by extracellular calcium chelation with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. In the presence of terbinafine or <b>naftifine,</b> chemotaxis of PMNs was not impaired. Terbinafine and <b>naftifine</b> slightly but significantly increased the killing of C. albicans blastospores (P < 0. 05 at 10 and 100 microM). In conclusion, in contrast to imidazole-like drugs, the allylamine antimycotic compounds terbinafine and <b>naftifine</b> enhance selected functions of PMNs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Naftifine,</b> a new {{antimycotic}} drug of the allylamine class, is {{a potent}} inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis in Candida albicans. Treated cells showed a dose-dependent drop in ergosterol content; the level was reduced by 60 % at concentrations of greater than 50 mg/liter, causing total inhibition of growth. This inhibition coincided with a heavy accumulation of the sterol precursor squalene. Radiolabeling experiments showed that the inhibition of sterol synthesis was complete within 10 min of exposure of cells to the compound. Control cells incorporated [14 C]acetate into nonsaponifiable lipids composed primarily of ergosterol, whereas naftifine-treated cells accumulated only labeled squalene. When the drug was removed by washing cells thoroughly in 1 % Tween 80, the accumulated squalene was further metabolized to ergosterol. A similar pattern of inhibition was observed in sterol biosynthesis from [14 C]mevalonate in a cell-free system. At 50 mg/liter, <b>naftifine</b> gave greater than 99 % inhibition of sterol biosynthesis both in whole cells and in cell extracts of C. albicans. The primary action of <b>naftifine</b> {{appears to be the}} blocking of fungal squalene epoxidation...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of squalene epoxidase by the allylamine antimycotic agents <b>naftifine</b> and compound SF 86 - 327 was investigated, with particulate enzyme preparations from the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis and from rat liver. Both <b>naftifine</b> and compound SF 86 - 327 were potent inhibitors of the Candida epoxidases and showed apparently non-competitive kinetics {{with respect to}} the substrate squalene. The Ki values for <b>naftifine</b> and compound SF 86 - 327 in the C. albicans system were 1. 1 microM and 0. 03 microM respectively. The C. parapsilosis enzyme was slightly more sensitive to inhibition. Varying the concentrations of cofactors or the soluble cytoplasmic fraction (S 200) had no effect on the inhibition. The epoxidase from rat liver was much less sensitive (Ki for compound SF 86 - 327 was 77 microM). The inhibition was also qualitatively different from that in Candida, being competitive with respect to squalene and also {{with respect to the}} S 200 fraction. S 200 fraction derived from C. albicans also antagonized the {{inhibition of}} the epoxidase from liver, but the liver S 200 fraction did not affect inhibition of the Candida enzyme by compound SF 86 - 327. There was no evidence for an irreversible or mechanism-based inhibition of either the fungal or the mammalian epoxidase. The selective inhibition of squalene epoxidase was sufficient to account for the known antimycotic action of the compounds...|$|E

40|$|SF 86 - 327 {{is a new}} {{antimycotic}} agent of the allylamine type. Its primary action {{appears to be the}} inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis at the point of squalene epoxidation, as was previously found with the related compound <b>naftifine.</b> Biosynthesis was measured by incorporation of [14 C]acetate into sterols in cells of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Torulopsis glabrata, and the dermatophyte Trichophyton mentagrophytes. There was a positive correlation between the SF 86 - 327 concentrations needed for inhibition of growth and of sterol synthesis in these four fungi. The greater antifungal efficacy of SF 86 - 327 in comparison with <b>naftifine</b> was also reflected in the relative activities of the two compounds as sterol synthesis inhibitors. Inhibition was maximal at neutral pH. A similar degree of inhibition was found in cell-free extracts when [14 C]mevalonate was used as substrate. In all cases, inhibition of sterol synthesis was accompanied by a parallel accumulation of labeled squalene. SF 86 - 327 and <b>naftifine</b> had no significant effect on initial enzymes of the ergosterol pathway, measured by incorporation of [14 C]acetyl coenzyme A, or on steps distal to squalene epoxidation, measured by conversion of labeled squalene 2, 3 -epoxide or lanosterol. Both allylamines were highly selective for fungal, as opposed to mammalian, sterol biosynthesis. SF 86 - 327 caused slight inhibition of squalene epoxidation in a rat liver cell-free system, but at concentrations three to four orders of magnitude greater than those required for inhibition of the fungal pathway...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes in}} the hyphae of Trichophyton mentagrophytes treated with <b>Naftifine</b> (0. 01 – 0. 5 μg/ml) were studied by light and electron microscopy. The most striking changes observed following treatment with this new antimycotic agent were bulb-shaped thickenings at the hyphal tips and dose-dependent, spherical, or drop-shaped depositions of varying size within the cells. The abnormal formations were not only visible in the cytoplasm (discrete or aggregated in vacuoles), {{but also in the}} region of the cell membrane, in all layers of the cell wall and on the cell surface. Their lipid nature can be deduced from several significant characteristics including osmiophily, the conchoidal fracture surface observed in freeze-fracture replicas and their extractability with acetone. This evidence suggests that the antimycotic action of <b>Naftifine</b> results from interaction of the agent with fungal lipid metabolism and possibly from alterations of the cell wall structure. The latter is also suggested by the changes observed in the hyphal tips...|$|E

40|$|After {{clinical}} diagnosis and microscopic confirmation, tinea cruris is best {{treated with a}} topical allylamine or an azole antifungal (strength of recommendation: A, based on multiple randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Differences in current comparison data are insufficient to stratify the 2 groups of topical antifungals. Determining which group to use depends on patient compliance, medication accessibility, and cost. The fungicidal allylamines (<b>naftifine</b> and terbinafine) and butenafine (allylamine derivative) are a more costly group of topical tinea treatments, yet they are more convenient as they allow for a shorter duration of treatment compared with fungistatic azoles (clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, miconazole, and sulconazole) ...|$|E
40|$|The thiocarbamate antimycotics {{tolnaftate}} and tolciclate blocked sterol biosynthesis in fungal {{cells and}} cell extracts, with accumulation of squalene. This point of action {{was confirmed by}} the direct inhibition of microsomal squalene epoxidase from Candida albicans. There was no inhibition of other steps in ergosterol biosynthesis. In whole Candida cells, ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition was not complete at drug concentrations up to 100 mg/liter, whereas full inhibition occurred in a cell-free test system. Rat liver cell-free cholesterol biosynthesis was much less sensitive to the drugs. The biochemical action of tolnaftate and tolciclate is thus {{similar to that of}} the allylamine antimycotics <b>naftifine</b> and terbinafine...|$|E
40|$|From aseptically grown Artemisia annua plantlets, shoot {{cultures}} were initiated. Using different {{concentrations of}} auxine, cytokinine and sucrose, a suitable culture medium was developed, {{with respect to}} the growth of the shoots and their artemisinin accumulation. Nitrate concentration and conductivity appeared to be suitable growth parameters. The artemisinin content was measured gas chromatographically. The shoot cultures were maintained in the developed standard medium. consisting of a half concentration of MS-salts with vitamins, 0. 2 mg l- 1 BAP, 0. 05 mg l- 1 NAA and 1 % sucrose. The growth of the shoots and the artemisinin content remained stable for a longer period. They showed considerable photosynthetic activity and generally contained ca. 0. 08 % artemisinin on a dry weight basis. The highest artemisinin content found was 0. 16 % in the above mentioned standard medium, but also on the same medium with 0. 5 % sucrose. Attempts were made to further improve the artemisinin production by varying the medium composition through addition of gibberellic acid or casein hydrolysate; by omitting plant growth regulators; by precursor feeding, i. e. mevalonic acid, by influencing the biosynthesis routing through inhibition of the sterol synthesis by miconazole, <b>naftifine</b> or terbinafine; by changing gene expression with 5 -azacytidine or colchicine; and by elicitation, using cellulase, chitosan, glutathione or nigeran. Enhanced artemisinin production was found with 10 mg l- 1 gibberellic acid, 0. 5 g l- 1 casein hydrolysate, 10 mg l- 1 or 20 mg l- 1 <b>naftifine.</b> Relative increases of 154 %, 169 %, 140 % and 120 % were found, respectively.

40|$|Squalene {{epoxidase}} (SE) is {{the primary}} target of the allylamine antimycotic agents terbinafine and <b>naftifine</b> and also of the thiocarbamates. Although all of these drugs are employed primarily in dermatological therapy, SE from dermatophyte fungi has not been previously investigated. We report here the biochemical characterization of SE activity from Trichophyton rubrum {{and the effects of}} terbinafine and other inhibitors. Microsomal SE activity from T. rubrum was not dependent on soluble cytoplasmic factors but had an absolute requirement for NADPH or NADH and was stimulated by flavin adenine dinucleotide. Kinetic analyses revealed that under optimal conditions the Km for squalene was 13 microM and its Vmax was 0. 71 nmol/h/mg of protein. Terbinafine was the most potent inhibitor tested, with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 15. 8 nM. This inhibition was noncompetitive with regard to the substrate squalene. A structure-activity relationship study with some analogs of terbinafine indicated that the tertiary amino structure of terbinafine was crucial for its high potency, as well as the tert-alkyl side chain. <b>Naftifine</b> had a lower potency (IC 50, 114. 6 nM) than terbinafine. Inhibition was also demonstrated by the thiocarbamates tolciclate (IC 50, 28. 0 nM) and tolnaftate (IC 50, 51. 5 nM). Interestingly, the morpholine amorolfine also displayed a weak but significant effect (IC 50, 30 microM). T. rubrum SE was only slightly more sensitive (approximately twofold) to terbinafine inhibition than was the Candida albicans enzyme. Therefore, this difference cannot fully explain the much higher susceptibility (> or = 100 -fold) of dermatophytes than of yeasts to this drug. The sensitivity to terbinafine of ergosterol biosynthesis in whole cells of T. rubrum (IC 50, 1. 5 nM) is 10 -fold higher than that of SE activity, suggesting that the drug accumulates in the fungus...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between sterol biosynthesis inhibition, membrane integrity, and cell growth inhibition in Candida albicans was examined for five squalene epoxidase inhibitors. The compounds were the thiocarbamates tolnaftate and tolciclate and the allylamines <b>naftifine,</b> terbinafine, and SDZ 87 - 469. All compounds inhibited sterol biosynthesis, with the concentrations {{that caused a}} 50 % decrease in the total sterol-to-squalene ratio ranging from {{less than or equal}} to 0. 01 microM for terbinafine and SDZ 87 - 469 to 500 microM for tolnaftate. At 100 microM, the compounds also caused up to a 30 % release of intracellular [14 C]aminoisobutyric acid. With terbinafine and SD 2 87 - 469, aminoisobutyric acid release further increased in cells grown at concentrations that inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis. It is suggested that inhibition of ergosterol synthesis may render the C. albicans membrane susceptible to further damage, including direct damage from squalene epoxidase inhibitors...|$|E

40|$|Butenafine {{hydrochloride}}, N- 4 -tert-butylbenzyl-N-methyl- 1 -naphthalenemethylamine hydrochloride (butenafine), {{is a novel}} {{antifungal agent}} {{of the class of}} benzylamine derivatives. Butenafine was investigated for its activity against guinea pig dermatophytosis caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes or Microsporum canis in comparison with those of <b>naftifine,</b> tolnaftate, clotrimazole, and bifonazole. Topical butenafine showed excellent efficacy against dermatophytosis when it was applied once daily, and the effect was superior to those of all four reference drugs. When applied once at 24 or 48 h before infection, the drug exhibited excellent prophylactic efficacy against experimental T. mentagrophytes infection. The concentrations of butenafine in animal skin at 24 and 48 h after application of 0. 2 ml of a 1 % solution were several hundred times higher than those required to kill T. mentagrophytes and M. canis. The good efficacy of butenafine against dermatophytosis may be attributable to its fungicidal activity and long retention in the skin after topical application...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{antifungal}} {{agents were}} examined for effects on lipid biosynthesis and membrane integrity in Candida albicans. Lipids were labeled in vivo or in vitro with [14 C]acetate and analyzed by thin-layer and gas chromatography. Membrane integrity {{was measured by}} a recently developed [14 C]aminoisobutyric acid radiolabel release assay. The imidazole antifungal agents miconazole, econazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole, at concentrations inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis (0. 1 microM), decreased the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in vivo but not in vitro. Similarly, <b>naftifine,</b> tolnaftate, and the azasterol A 25822 B, at concentrations inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis (10, 100, and 1 microM, respectively), decreased the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in vivo only. This suggests that the effect on fatty acids observed with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors may be secondary to the effect on ergosterol. With imidazoles, oleic acid antagonized inhibition of cell growth but not inhibition of ergosterol. This suggests that, with the C- 14 demethylase inhibitors, decreased unsaturated fatty acids, rather than decreased ergosterol, are responsible for growth inhibition. Cerulenin, previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of both fatty acid and ergosterol biosynthesis, {{was found in the}} present study to inhibit the former (at 5 microM) but not the latter (up to 100 microM). Of the antifungal agents tested, econazole and miconazole (at 100 microM) produced complete release of [14 C]aminoisobutyric acid, which is consistent with membrane damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antifungal}} susceptibilities of six clinical Trichophyton rubrum isolates obtained sequentially {{from a single}} onychomycosis patient who failed oral terbinafine therapy (250 mg/day for 24 weeks) were determined by broth microdilution and macrodilution methodologies. Strain relatedness was examined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses. Data obtained from both broth micro- and macrodilution assays were in agreement and revealed that the six clinical isolates had greatly reduced susceptibilities to terbinafine. The MICs of terbinafine for these strains were > 4 μg/ml, whereas they were 128 μg/ml, whereas they were 0. 0002 μg/ml for the reference strain. The MIC of terbinafine for the baseline strain (cultured at the initial screening visit and before therapy was started) was already 4, 000 -fold higher than normal, suggesting {{that this is a}} case of primary resistance to terbinafine. The results obtained by the broth macrodilution procedure revealed that the terbinafine MICs and MFCs for sequential isolates apparently increased during the course of therapy. RAPD analyses did not reveal any differences between the isolates. The terbinafine-resistant isolates exhibited normal susceptibilities to clinically available antimycotics including itraconazole, fluconazole, and griseofulvin. However, these isolates were fully cross resistant to several other known squalene epoxidase inhibitors, including <b>naftifine,</b> butenafine, tolnaftate, and tolciclate, suggesting a target-specific mechanism of resistance.

Searches included: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and ongoing trials registries (August 2013). 129 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 18, 086 participants evaluated a range of interventions; mostly azoles. Pooling of data for several outcomes was only possible for two individual treatments. Terbinafine in 5 studies showed a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared to placebo (RR 4. 51, 95 % CI 3. 10 to 6. 56). Data for mycological cure could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured <b>naftifine</b> (1 %) compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2. 38, 95 % CI 1. 80 to 3. 14) but the quality of the evidence was graded low. Combinations of azoles with corticosteroids were slightly more effective than azoles for clinical cure, but there was no statistically significant difference with regard to mycological cure. 65 studies were assessed at ‘unclear’ and 64 at ‘high risk’ of bias; many were over 20 years old and most were poorly designed and inadequately reported. Although most active interventions showed sufficient therapeutic effect, this review highlights the need for further, high quality, adequately powered RCTs to evaluate the effects of these interventions which can ultimately provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decision making...|$|E
