5|$|Team Ninja {{kept working}} on the Ninja Gaiden project after its release, {{with the aim of}} pushing the action genre and their first such title as far as they could. To this end, they {{released}} downloadable expansions, known as Hurricane Packs, free of charge. Itagaki said that since the packs were born out of his team's interest, they did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> charge players for their efforts. The two packs were available over Xbox Live {{in the third quarter of}} 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Hortensian Law {{deprived}} the patricians {{of their}} last weapon against the plebeians, and thus resolved the last great political question of the era. No such important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. The important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate. In effect, the plebeians {{were satisfied with the}} possession of power, but did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy. This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.|$|E
5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E

25|$|In opposition, {{he was the}} {{spokesperson}} for Transport (he was also President of the Sri Lanka National Transport Workers' Union) and, being acknowledged as the best man {{to take care of}} the public transport sector, was expected to receive that portfolio in the event of the SLFP returning to power. However, after the victory in 1994 of the People's Alliance, the new Prime Minister, Chandrika Kumaratunga did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> revive the CTB and did not make Moonesinghe a Minister.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of these trade-offs imply {{that no matter what}} photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is {{greater than or equal to}} a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to Planck's constant. Heisenberg did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.|$|E
25|$|What {{is there}} that any man desires,—any man or any woman,—that does not lose half its value when it {{is found to be}} easy of access and easy of possession? Wine is valued by its price, not its flavour. Open your doors freely to Jones and Smith, and Jones and Smith will <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> enter them. Shut your doors obdurately against the same gentlemen, and they will use all their little {{diplomacy}} to effect an entrance. Captain Aylmer, when he heard the hearty tone of the girl’s answer, already began almost to doubt whether it was wise on his part to devote the innermost bin of his cellar to wine that was so cheap.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s, {{citizens}} of Wilmington became {{eager to take}} advantage of railroad transportation. Plans were developed to build a railroad line from the capital of Raleigh to Wilmington. This was later changed when the {{citizens of}} Raleigh did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> make the venture of a stock subscription to secure the railroad. The end point was changed to Weldon. When construction of the railroad line was finally completed in 1840, it was the longest single line of railroad track in the world. The railroad also controlled a line of steamboats that ran from Wilmington to Charleston; it was widely used for passenger travel and transportation of freight. Regular boat lines served Fayetteville, and packet lines traveled to northern ports. The city was a main stop-over point, contributing greatly to its commerce.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{perspective}} in the fiction at times {{can be much}} less successful in a European market. Although Italy is the strongest foreign market for the chick lit sold by single-title imprint Red Dress Ink, in that country romance readers do <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> read books about cowboys, as this type of occupation was not common in their culture. The paranormal romance genre is not popular {{in countries such as}} Poland and Russia, although historical romance tends to be very successful. Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe, where romances that feature babies are very popular. German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels, and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories. The alternate scenario also occurs, as other German translators censor the love scenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I {{and the subsequent}} boycott of, for example, French films left a noticeable gap in the market. By 1916, there already existed some 2000 fixed venues for movie performances and initially film screenings were supplemented or even replaced by variety turns. In 1917 a process of concentration and partial nationalisation of the German film industry began with the founding of Universum Film AG (UFA), which was partly {{a reaction to the}} very effective use that the Allied Powers had found for the new medium for the purpose of propaganda. Under the aegis of the military, so-called Vaterland films were produced, which equalled the Allies' films in the matter of propaganda and disparagement of the enemy. Audiences however did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> swallow the patriotic medicine without the accompanying sugar of the light-entertainment films which, consequently, Ufa also promoted. The German film industry soon became the largest in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Zach {{comes into}} the {{knowledge}} that Kendall agreed to act as the surrogate for Ryan and Greenlee's baby when Greenlee's chances of giving birth became non-existent. He utterly hates the idea, and is determined to ensure Kendall will not go through with it. Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that she never would have taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, but no matter their argumentative nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if she had not used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall. Zach does as suggested, and informs Kendall of his love for her again. This time Kendall does not hold back and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the accusations}} leveled towards Iðunn by Loki, Lee Hollander opines that Lokasenna was {{intended}} to be humorous and that the accusations thrown by Loki in the poem are not necessarily to be taken as [...] "generally accepted lore" [...] {{at the time it was}} composed. Rather they are charges that are easy for Loki to make and difficult for his targets to disprove, or which they do <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> refute.|$|E
500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up to look {{as if he had been}} fouled. How? Well, that is something I do <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{lawyer was}} absent, and, <b>not</b> <b>caring</b> <b>to</b> stroll {{around the town}} where he might meet acquaintances from Farley's, the boy {{remained}} alone {{until late in the}} afternoon, when Joe and Sam arrived.|$|R

500|$|Mather, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} the first director of the National Park Service, began to display apparent mental illness in 1917. His assistant, Horace Albright, reported this condition to Lane. [...] The Secretary chose to keep Mather in his position, while allowing Albright to perform the functions of Mather's job until Mather recovered, keeping all of this secret. According to Albright, Lane was not a conservationist, but did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> interfere in the decisions of his officials, and so let Mather and Albright have free rein. Lane wrote in 1917: ...|$|E
500|$|At dawn on {{the morning}} of 6 November 1914, in cold, foggy and bleak weather, Lody was fetched from his cell by the Assistant Provost-Marshal, Lord Athlumney. He asked, [...] "I suppose that you will <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> shake hands with a German spy?", to which the reply came, [...] "No. But I will shake hands with a brave man." [...] A small {{procession}} formed up for the short journey to the rifle range, comprising Lody and his armed escort, the Tower's Chaplain and the eight-man firing squad. John Fraser, one of the Yeoman Warders, witnessed it and later described it: ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher instituted {{economic}} policies reminiscent of Chamberlain's as Chancellor—control of inflation (even {{at the expense}} of unemployment), minimisation of budget deficits, and low rates of direct taxation. This was a point not lost on the Labour Party, and the Trades Union Congress adopted a slogan of [...] "Forwards to the Eighties not Backwards to the Thirties". Thatcher's critics denigrated both her policies and those of the 1930s in such comparisons, but she did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> defend those of the 1930s. Thatcher stated that the historical justifications for her economic positions were the policies of the Victorian era.|$|E

500|$|More recently, AllMusic's Richie Unterberger {{explains}} the international popularity of Harrison's single: [...] "'My Sweet Lord' has a quasi-religious feel, but nevertheless has enough conventional pop appeal to reach mainstream listeners {{who may or}} may <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> dig into the spiritual lyrical message." [...] Added to this was a slide guitar riff that Simon Leng describes as [...] "among the best-known guitar passages in popular music". Ian Inglis highlights the combination of Harrison's [...] "evident lack of artifice" [...] and Spector's [...] "excellent production", such that [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] can be heard [...] "as a prayer, a love song, an anthem, a contemporary gospel track, or a piece of perfect pop".|$|E
500|$|The Rules of the Game premiered on Friday, July 7, 1939, at the Colisée Theatre in Paris to a {{full house}} and later at the Aubert Palace also in Paris. It was shown on a double billing with a {{patriotic}} documentary about French history. The audience at the screening consisted {{of members of the}} right-wing organisations, who booed after a while into the screening; Paulette Dubost said people at the screening fought and one person tried to set fire to the theatre. Renoir said he [...] "depicted pleasant, sympathetic characters, but showed them in a society in the process of disintegration, so that they were defeated at the onset... the audience recognized this. The truth is that they recognized themselves. People who commit suicide do <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> do it in front of witnesses." ...|$|E
500|$|Manne {{is often}} {{associated}} with the once frequently criticized West Coast school of jazz. He has been considered [...] "the quintessential" [...] drummer in what was seen as a West Coast movement, though Manne himself did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> be so pigeonholed. In the 1950s, much of what he did could be seen as in the West Coast style: performing in tightly arranged compositions in what was a cool style, as in his 1953 album named The West Coast Sound, for which he commissioned several original compositions. Some of West Coast jazz was experimental, avant-garde music several years before the more mainstream avant-garde playing of Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman (Manne also recorded with Coleman in 1959); a good deal of Manne's work with Jimmy Giuffre was of this kind. Critics would condemn much of this music as overly cerebral.|$|E
