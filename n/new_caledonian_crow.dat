2500|$|While young {{birds in}} the wild {{normally}} learn to make stick tools from elders, a laboratory <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> named [...] "Betty" [...] spontaneously improvising a hooked tool from a wire. It was known that this individual had no prior experience {{as she had been}} hand-reared. New Caledonian crows have been observed to use an easily available small tool to get a less easily available longer tool, and then use this to get an otherwise inaccessible longer tool to get food that was out of reach of the shorter tools. One bird, [...] "Sam", spent 110 seconds inspecting the apparatus before completing each of the steps without any mistakes. This is an example of sequential tool use, which represents a higher cognitive function compared to many other forms of tool use and is the first time this has been observed in non-trained animals. Tool use has been observed in a non-foraging context, providing the first report of multi-context tool use in birds. Captive New Caledonian crows have used stick tools to make first contact with objects that were novel and hence potentially dangerous, while other individuals have been observed using a tool when food was within reach but placed next to a model snake. It has been claimed [...] "Their [...] tool-making skills exceed those of chimpanzees and are more similar to human tool manufacture than those of any other animal." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus moneduloides) are {{prolific}} tool {{users in}} captivity {{and in the}} wild, and have an inherited predisposition to express tool-oriented behaviours. To further understand the evolution and development of tool use, we compared the development of object manipulation in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> and common ravens (Corvus corax), which do not routinely use tools. We found striking qualitative similarities in the ontogeny of tool-oriented behaviour in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> and food-caching behaviour in ravens. Given that the common ancestor of <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> and ravens was almost certainly a caching species, we therefore propose that the basic action patterns for tool use in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> may have their evolutionary origins in caching behaviour. Noncombinatorial object manipulations had similar frequencies in the two species. However, frequencies of object combinations that are precursors to functional behaviour increased in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> and decreased in ravens throughout the study period, ending 6 weeks post-fledging. These quantitative observations {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> develop tool-oriented behaviour because of an increased motivation to perform object combinations that facilitate the necessary learning. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> (Corvus moneduloides) is an all-black, {{medium-sized}} {{member of}} the family Corvidae, native to New Caledonia. The bird {{is often referred to as}} the 'qua-qua' due to its distinctive call. It eats a wide range of food including many types of invertebrates, eggs, nestlings, small mammals, snails, nuts and seeds. The <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> sometimes captures grubs in nooks or crevices by poking a twig at the grub to agitate it into biting the twig, which the crow then withdraws with the grub still attached. This method of feeding indicates the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> is capable of tool use. They are able to make hooks. This species is also capable of solving a number of sophisticated cognitive tests which suggest that it is particularly intelligent. [...] As a result of these findings, the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> has become a model species for scientists trying to understand the impact of tool use and manufacture on the evolution of intelligence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{computer}} model of planning the rather complex behavior by <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> is developed and investigated. The model characterizes the following processes: 1) analysis of predictions of elementary actions, 2) generation {{of a simple}} knowledge database that describes the set of initial situations, actions, and results of actions, 3) planning a concrete chain of consecutive actions. The model is inspired by the biological experiment on <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus moneduloides) are {{the most}} {{prolific}} avian tool-users. Regional variation {{in the shape of}} their tools {{may be the result of}} cumulative cultural evolution [...] a phenomenon considered to be a hallmark of human culture. Here we show that hand-raised juvenile <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> spontaneously manufacture and use tools, without any contact with adults of their species or any prior demonstration by humans.

50|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> eats a {{wide range}} of food, {{including}} many types of insects and other invertebrates (some caught in flight with great agility, including night-flying insects which it catches at dusk), eggs and nestlings, small mammals, snails (which it drops from a height onto hard stones), and various nuts and seeds.|$|E
50|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> {{have been}} studied {{for their ability to}} reason about causal events. This {{intelligent}} species uses tools in a way that even chimpanzees cannot, making complex tools to bring food within reach.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which animals other than humans can reason about {{physical}} problems is contentious. The benchmark test for this ability has been the trap-tube task. We presented <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> {{with a series of}} two-trap versions of this problem. Three out of six crows solved the initial trap-tube. These crows continued to avoid the trap when the arbitrary features that had previously been associated with successful performances were removed. However, they did not avoid the trap when a hole and a functional trap were in the tube. In contrast to a recent primate study, the three crows then solved a causally equivalent but visually distinct problem—the trap-table task. The performance of the three crows across the four transfers made explanations based on chance, associative learning, visual and tactile generalization, and previous dispositions unlikely. Our findings suggest that <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> can solve complex physical problems by reasoning both causally and analogically about causal relations. Causal and analogical reasoning may form the basis of the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow's</b> exceptional tool skills...|$|R
40|$|Tool use is {{of great}} {{interest}} for cognitive research, largely {{because it can be}} particularly revealing about the underlying information processing mechanisms. Tool use that is inflexible or requires extensive experience to change, and that is only addressed towards specific targets such as food, is not likely to reflect unusual or particularly complex cognition. On the contrary, if tools are employed flexibly and for a variety of innovative purposes, then conventional combinations of inherited predispositions and associative learning are challenged and interesting questions emerge. Since <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus moneduloides) are especially adept at using and making tools for food extraction, we decided to examine their ability to generalise this to other contexts. We recorded how five pairs of <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> interacted with novel objects that were not associated with food. We observed eight occasions in which the first contact with the novel object was mediated by a tool, suggesting that the function of the tool was for exploration. This is the first report of non-foraging tool use in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows,</b> and it implies that the cognitive operations controlling tool-oriented behaviour in this species are more general than previously thought...|$|R
50|$|During the dry season, {{woodpecker}} finches use tools during {{half their}} foraging time to acquire up to 50% of their prey. This means they obtain even more food via tool use than chimpanzees, the most proficient non-human primate tool users. Another bird with a somewhat similar capability of tool use is the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow.</b>|$|E
50|$|Remains of Chatham ravens {{are most}} common in coastal sites on the Chatham Islands. On the coast, it may have frequented the seal and penguin colonies or fed in the {{intertidal}} zone, as does the Tasmanian forest raven (C. tasmanicus). It may also have depended on fruit, like the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> (C. moneduloides), {{but it is difficult}} to understand why a fruit eater would have been {{most common in}} coastal forest and shrubland when fruit was distributed throughout the forest.|$|E
50|$|There are twenty two {{endemic species}} of {{terrestrial}} birds, three endemic genera and one family. The <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> (Corvus moneduloides) {{is known for}} its intelligence. The laurel forest pigeon (Columba vitiensis hyponochroa), giant wood pigeon notou (Ducula goliath). Two genera are endemic: Drepanoptila (the green pigeon), and Eunymphicus, Ouvea parakeet. The New Caledonian parakeet known to be the basal species in the genus Cyanoramphus, which had its origins in New Caledonia from where it spread to many ocean Pacific islands.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of tool use include dolphins using sponges {{to feed on}} fish that bury themselves in the sediment, <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> that use sticks to get larvae out of trees, and chimpanzees that similarly use sticks to capture and consume termites.|$|R
40|$|Food caching is a {{paramount}} {{model for}} studying relations between cognition, brain organisation and ecology in corvids. In contrast, behaviour towards inedible objects is poorly examined and understood. We review {{the literature on}} object caching in corvids and other birds, and describe an exploratory study on object caching in ravens, <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> and jackdaws. The captive adult birds were presented with an identical set of novel objects adjacent to food. All three species cached objects, which shows the behaviour not to be restricted to juveniles, food cachers, tool-users or individuals deprived of cacheable food. The pattern of object interaction and caching did not mirror the incidence of food caching: the intensely food caching ravens indeed showed highest object caching incidence, but the rarely food caching jackdaws cached objects to similar extent as the moderate food caching <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows.</b> Ravens and jackdaws preferred objects with greater sphericity, but <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> preferred stick-like objects (similar to tools). We suggest that the observed object caching might have been expressions of exploration or play, and deserves being studied {{in its own right}} because of its potential significance for tool-related behaviour and learning, rather than as an over-spill from food-caching research.

50|$|Kacelnik is {{best known}} for his {{research}} on tool-making and tool-use in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows.</b> However, his research has involved many other species of animals, especially starlings and cowbirds, and he has made many contributions to optimal foraging theory, mechanisms of animal decision making, and brood parasitism.|$|R
50|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> is a {{moderately}} sized crow, (40 cm in length) similar {{in size to}} the house crow but less slender-looking. The bird has an all-black appearance with a rich gloss to its feathers of purple, dark blue and some green in good light. The beak, feet and legs are all black. The beak is moderate in size but is unusual in that {{the tip of the}} lower mandible is angled upwards, making it somewhat chisel-like in profile. It has been suggested that this beak morphology evolved due to the selective pressure of needing to hold a tool straight.|$|E
50|$|The park {{includes}} two biomes typical of New Caledonia: maquis shrubland overlying peridotite rock and tropical rainforest. There {{is a very}} high rate of biodiversity of New Caledonia. In particular, the park is known for {{being one of the}} last areas where the kagu, an endangered bird which has become a symbol of the country, can be seen in its natural habitat, with a population of about 700; this is the largest single population of the species in the wild. Other endemic and rare animals in the park include the crow honeyeater, notou, <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow,</b> and crested gecko.|$|E
50|$|New Caledonia {{has one of}} {{the most}} enigmatic birds of the world, the {{endangered}} kagu. It is related to the cranes and it lives very hidden. It is also the heraldic bird of the island. Another endemic bird is the New Caledonian rail. This critically endangered bird could be extinct but many believe that it still persists. Both the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar and the New Caledonian lorikeet are believed to persist under similar circumstances. There are also another twenty or so endemic birds on the island, including the tool-using <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow.</b> See Endemic birds of New Caledonia for more details. The seashells from New Caledonia are in great demand by collectors.|$|E
2500|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> {{have also}} been {{observed}} performing tool use behaviour that had hitherto not been described in non-human animals. The behaviour is termed [...] "insert-and-transport tool use". This involves the crow inserting a stick into an object and then walking or flying away holding both the tool and object on the tool.|$|R
2500|$|Other corvid species, such as [...] rooks (Corvus frugilegus), {{can also}} make and use tools in the laboratory, showing a degree of sophistication {{similar to that of}} <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows.</b> While not {{confirmed}} to have used tools in the wild, captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) have been observed using strips of newspaper as tools to obtain food.|$|R
50|$|Meta-tool use {{is using}} one tool on another tool {{to achieve the}} {{objective}} of the task. It is generally considered to be a behaviour requiring more complex cognitive ability than the use of just a single tool. Studies show that <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> are capable of meta-tool use, at a level rivalling the best performances seen in primates.|$|R
50|$|New Caledonia's animal land {{diversity}} {{was similar}} to that of some oceanic islands, particularly New Zealand and as in these islands, the biodiversity was greater before being inhabited by humans. The island has no native mammals except for bats and no native amphibians. The vertebrates are dominated by reptiles and birds. Today the island has 21 endemic species of birds, including one endemic family, the Rhynochetidae, represented by one living species, the kagu. The island is also home to the unusual tool-using <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow.</b> The separation of the Gondwana islands before the mammalian expansion that allowed the radiation of flightless birds (moa, kiwi, sylviornis, cagous) and Mesozoic reptilian forms such as the tuatara of New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|One species, the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow,</b> {{has also}} been intensively studied {{recently}} because {{of its ability to}} manufacture and use tools in the day-to-day search for food. On 5 October 2007, researchers from the University of Oxford presented data acquired by mounting tiny video cameras on the tails of New Caledonian crows. They pluck, smooth, and bend twigs and grass stems to procure a variety of foodstuffs. Crows in Queensland have learned how to eat the toxic cane toad by flipping the cane toad on its back and violently stabbing the throat where the skin is thinner, allowing the crow to access the nontoxic innards; their long beaks ensure that all of the innards can be removed.|$|E
5000|$|Some recent {{behavioral}} {{studies do}} not support the traditional view of sauropsid behavior as stereotyped and ritualistic (as in MacLean's reptilian complex). Birds have been shown to possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as the toolmaking of the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crow</b> and the language-like categorization abilities of the African grey parrot. Structures of the limbic system, which MacLean proposed arose in early mammals, have now been shown to exist across a range of modern vertebrates. The [...] "paleomammalian" [...] trait of parental care of offspring is widespread in birds and occurs in some fishes as well. Thus, like the basal ganglia, the evolution of these systems presumably dates to a common vertebrate ancestor.|$|E
50|$|Other corvid species, such as rooks (Corvus frugilegus), {{can also}} make and use tools in the laboratory, showing a degree of sophistication {{similar to that of}} <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows.</b> While not {{confirmed}} to have used tools in the wild, captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) have been observed using strips of newspaper as tools to obtain food.|$|R
40|$|SummaryA crucial {{stage in}} hominin {{evolution}} was {{the development of}} metatool use—the ability to use one tool on another [1, 2]. Although the great apes can solve metatool tasks [3, 4], monkeys have been less successful [5 – 7]. Here we provide experimental evidence that <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> can spontaneously solve a demanding metatool task in which a short tool is used to extract a longer tool that can then be used to obtain meat. Six out of the seven crows initially attempted to extract the long tool with the short tool. Four successfully obtained meat on the first trial. The experiments revealed that the crows did not solve the metatool task by trial-and-error learning during the task or through a previously learned rule. The sophisticated physical cognition shown {{appears to have been}} based on analogical reasoning. The ability to reason analogically may explain the exceptional tool-manufacturing skills of <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract One {{important}} element of complex and flexible tool use, particularly where tool manufacture is involved, {{is the ability to}} select or manufacture appropriate tools anticipating the needs of any given task – an ability that has been rarely tested in non-primates. We examine aspects of this ability in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> – a species known to be extraordinary tool users and manufacturers. In a 2002 study, Chappell and Kacelnik showed that these crows were able to select a tool of the appropriate length for a task among a set of different lengths, and in 2002, Weir, Chappell and Kacelnik showed that <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> were able to shape unfamiliar materials to create a usable tool for a specific task. Here we examine their handling of tool diameter. In experiment 1, we show that when facing three loose sticks that were usable as tools, they preferred the thinnest one. When the three sticks were presented so that one was loose and the other two in a bundle, they only disassembled the bundle when their preferred tool was tied. In experiment 2, we show that they manufacture, and modify during use, a tool of a suitable diameter from a tree branch, according to the diameter of the hole through which the tool will have to be inserted. These results add to the developing picture of <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>crows</b> as sophisticated tool users and manufacturers, having an advanced level of folk physics.
