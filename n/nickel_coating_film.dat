Generally, the <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> has {{thickness}} from 0. 05 mm to 0. 2 mm, {{and it is also}} ferromagnetic like iorn metals. Therefore, the traditional supersonic thickness tester and eddy current thickness tester are not competent to measure the <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on iron or steel metal surface, and the brush-electropalted nickel coatings are still lack of NDT method to measure its thickness.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the coating {{thickness}} and roughness on the mechanical strength and thermally induced stress voids in nickel-coated optical fibers is theoretically and experimentally investigated. Seven samples of nickel-coated optical fibers with identical fiber length but different coating thickness are prepared using electroless plating method. The thickness of the <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> {{is controlled by the}} plating time, with the thicknesses being 35, 65, 119, 218, 308, 419 and 565 nm, respectively. The mechanical and thermal stresses in these nickel-coated optical fibers are analyzed. The atomic force microscope measurement reveals that the roughness of the <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> is unchanged when the coating thickness is not larger than 65 nm. However, as the coating thickness is not less than 65 rim, the coating roughness increases with increasing the coating thickness. To increase the tensile strength of the nickel-coated optical fiber, the coating thickness should be not less than 65 nm, and the surface roughness of the <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> should not exceed 2. 93 nm. Alternatively, if the coating thickness is in the range of 35 to 218 nm, thermally induced stress voids are less found in the nickel coatings. However, if the coating thickness is in the range of 308 to 565 nm, the number of thermally induced stress voids increases with increasing the coating thickness. To minimize these voids, the surface roughness of the <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> should also be decreased. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Synchronization occurs {{widely in}} the natural and {{technological}} worlds, from the rhythm of applause and neuron firing to the quantum mechanics of coupled Josephson junctions, but has not been used to produce new spatial structures. Our understanding of self-assembly has evolved independently {{in the fields of}} chemistry and materials, and with a few notable exceptions has focused on equilibrium rather than dynamical systems. Here we combine these two phenomena to create synchronization-selected microtubes of Janus colloids, micron-sized spherical particles with different surface chemistry on their opposing hemispheres, which we study using imaging and computer simulation. A thin <b>nickel</b> <b>film</b> <b>coats</b> one hemisphere of each silica particle to generate a discoid magnetic symmetry, such that in a precessing magnetic field its dynamics retain crucial phase freedom. Synchronizing their motion, these Janus spheres self-organize into micrometre-scale tubes in which the constituent particles rotate and oscillate continuously. In addition, the microtube must be tidally locked to the particles, that is, the particles must maintain their orientation within the rotating microtube. This requirement leads to a synchronization- induced structural transition that offers various applications based on the potential to form, disintegrate and fine-tune self-assembled in-motion structures in situ. Furthermore, it offers a generalizable method of controlling structure using dynamic synchronization criteria rather than static energy minimization, and of designing new field-driven microscale devices in which components do not slavishly follow the external field. close 715...|$|R

The need for an alternative {{is based on the}} increasing copper prices the recent years. The aim of this thesis is to compare three different materials, stainless steel, copper and a <b>nickel</b> <b>coated</b> plain carbon steel. This comparison is based on a basic corrosion test and a literature survey to render a merit value for each environment/metal interface. The testing solution consists of 100 ppm Cl - concentration the specimens are tested in three different pH levels and at three different temperatures. The specimens have their weight measured before and after the test. The 15 μm thick <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> was performed by Ferroprodukter AB, composing of 9 % P and 91 % Ni. The copper and stainless steel specimens are both from Thermia’s actual water heater tank. The copper lining is made of pure copper and the stainless steel hull is made of ferritic stainless steel. The results from the corrosion test are measured in weight change by modulus, |Δw|/w, for the comparison of the three materials. It was found that stainless steel was the worst material, performing better at higher temperatures and higher pH, but overall performance is far from copper and nickel’s corrosion properties. The <b>nickel</b> <b>coating</b> and copper specimen showed comparable results and perform more or less equally well. Regarding identification of corrosion mechanics, it may consist of either pitting and general corrosion damage or a mixture of both. To avoid the fact that weight change may be both negative and positive, the solution to this was to incorporate a merit value based on the absolute value of the weight change, divided by the initial weight of the specimen. In conclusion, stainless steel total weight change by modulus accumulates to 16. 072 g, <b>nickel</b> <b>coated</b> specimen accumulates a weight change by modulus equal to 8. 544 g, important note: two of the <b>nickel</b> <b>coated</b> specimen account for ~ 72. 4 % of the total weight change by modulus which then accumulates to 2. 36 g.
