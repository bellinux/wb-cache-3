5|$|Despite the {{war with}} the Western Xia, the Song also settled land {{disputes}} with them by referring to prior agreements, as with the Liao. However, soon after the Jin dynasty overthrew the Liao dynasty, the Jurchens sacked the Song capital in 1127 during the Jin–Song wars, causing the Song court to flee south of the Yangtze River.

5|$|In 2007, after {{a highly}} publicized feud between Finkelstein and an {{academic}} opponent, Alan Dershowitz, Finkelstein's tenure bid at DePaul was denied. Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the decision.

5|$|North Korea's lack {{of large}} airstrips and {{aircraft}} meant it conducted only minimal air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also {{not able to}} effectively use sea transport. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam {{could be used for}} the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships.|$|E

5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> pollination, a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate several plant species. Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (Pollen basket) as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However {{it has been shown that}} even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential pollination of several plant species.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to make contact with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E
5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> her hiring.|$|E
5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 7th century on, Klis was an {{important}} Croat stronghold, and later, one of the seats of many Croatia's rulers. In the 9th century, Croatian duke Mislav of the Duchy of Croatia, from 835 to 845, made the castle of Klis seat of his throne. Despite Frankish overlordship, the Franks had almost <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> Croatia in the period from the 820s through 840s. After Mislav's death, starting with Duke Trpimir I, Klis was ruled by royal members of the House of Trpimirović, who were at first Dukes of the Croatian Duchy (dux Croatorum), and afterwards Kings of the Croatian Kingdom (rex Croatorum). They developed the early Roman stronghold into their capital. Relations with the Byzantines greatly improved under the Croatian duke Trpimir I, who moved the dux's main residence from Nin to Klis.|$|E
5|$|HMS Levant was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate of the , {{which saw}} Royal Navy service against France in the Seven Years' War, and against France, Spain and the American colonies during the American Revolutionary War. Principally a hunter of privateers, {{she was also}} {{designed}} to be a match for small French frigates, but with a broader hull and sturdier build at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability. Launched in 1758, Levant was assigned to the Royal Navy's Jamaica station from 1759 and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.|$|E

5|$|It is {{plausible}} that ceratosaurians underwent BDR {{independent of the}} tetanurans, and therefore has no bearing {{on the issue of}} avian digit homology. In particular, as demonstrated by teratological analysis, the abbreviation (mesomelia) and loss of digits (hypophalangia) in the forelimb of Limusaurus is likely the result of a developmental anomaly that appeared exclusively in and persisted throughout the evolutionary lineage of ceratosaurians, and is unconnected to the pattern of digital reduction and frameshift that occurred in tetanurans. This is supported by the hands of the ceratosaurians Ceratosaurus, Berberosaurus, and Eoabelisaurus having plesiomorphic (i.e. more similar to the ancestral condition of theropods than to derived abelisaurs) metacarpal bones comparable to those of the more basal theropod Dilophosaurus. The divergent developmental pathways of ceratosaurians and tetanurans is associated with a difference in forelimb function; tetanurans utilized their hands for grasping, while the hands of ceratosaurians almost certainly played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> predation.|$|E

For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E

When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E
