40|$|Background. Traumatic {{injuries}} of peripheral nerves {{leads to}} profound disability and 40 %, while plexus {{injury or damage}} to multiple nerves-stage reaches 76 %. Finding ways to increase the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment of patients with peripheral nerve injury consequences, given the substantial progress microsurgical reconstructive surgery, imperative. Objective. The aim was to study the morphological changes of peripheral nerves after <b>neurosuture</b> under influence of electrical stimulation at different time periods. Methods. Morphological plain and special and histochemical methods were used. The features of blood supply of peripheral nerve reconstruction were quantified by neurovasal quotient. Qualitative and quantitative regeneration of the sciatic nerve of rabbits that were exposed to electrical stimulation and comparison groups were analyzed. Results and Conclusion. Excessive development of connective tissue and little amount of vascular zones were found within the formation of neuroma without electrical stimulation. Study of long-term electrical stimulation on sciatic nerve regeneration after <b>neurosuture</b> (in rabbits) showed structural changes, indicating a speed-up and restoration of physiological conditions {{of the structure of}} nerve trunks during the experiment. The positive impact of electrical vector (in both qualitative and quantitative criteria) on signs of regeneration in nerve trunks in research groups towards comparison group was stated. Regenerative changes in electrical stimulation occur as dynamic newgrowth of stroma of nerve trunk (especially peryneurium cells) in the area of ​​ neuroma. These studies prove compensatory-adaptive (reparative) effect of prolonged electrical stimulation with the recovery of functionally capable structures of nerve fibers (remyelo- and stromal-angioregeneration) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. In {{his work}} the {{orthopaedic}} surgeon {{deals with a}} large number of peripheral nerve injuries, especially of the upper extremity. Most of these injuries involve the hand (30 %). Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the influence of some factors (age, aetiology, level of injury, associated injuries) on surgical treatment outcome of digital nerve injury of the hand. Methods. At the Department for Microsurgery 72 hospitalized patients were operated on due to the injury of common palmar digital nerves and proper palmar digital nerves. All operations were performed within the first 48 h after injury and primary <b>neurosuture</b> was done in all. Beside the evaluation of demographic parameters, we also assessed aetiology of injury, associated injuries, level of injury, as well as the vascular status of the injured finger. Functional recovery was measured by the Medical Research Council (MCR) scale (S 0 -S 4). Results. We found a statistically significant difference in sensory recovery according to age and aetiology of injury (p< 0. 05). Better results of sensory recovery were detected in cases with undamaged artery or where anastomosis was done, but without statistical significance. There was no statistical significance difference regarding the level and associated injuries. Conclusion. Two major factors in the recovery of digital nerve function are patient’s age and mechanism of injury. Having in mind the limited degree of recovery, the patient should be precisely informed preoperatively on the nature of injury and realistically expected results...|$|E
40|$|The larynx is the "bottleneck" of {{the human}} airway. For this reason, the effects of stenosing {{laryngeal}} pathologies on the vital factor respiratory gas exchange are particularly critical. Internal stabilization {{is a prerequisite for}} recovery of the laryngeal respiratory function in severe forms of inspiratory collapse (laryngomalacia). Effective laser surgery techniques have been developed to this end in recent years. Glottis-dilating surgery in cases of bilateral vocal cord motion impairment is now moving in the direction of endoscopic laser cordotomy or cordectomy, whereas arytenoidectomy and open surgical procedures are now used only rarely due to higher secondary morbidity rates. In individual cases, in particular if functional recovery is expected, temporary laterofixation of a vocal cord using an endoscopic suturing technique can be a helpful approach. Extensive laryngeal defects can be covered by means of composite grafts with mucosal lining, a supporting skeleton and their own vascularization. Autologous transplantation of the larynx, with its complex surgical and immunological problems, has become a manageable procedure. The problems of post-transplantation reinnervation and risk assessment of immunosuppression-induced recurrence of the tumor are still under consideration. Reanimation of the bilaterally paralyzed larynx by means of neurorrhaphy (<b>neurosuture),</b> neural grafting and, more recently, functional electrostimulation (pacemaker) represents a challenge for the coming years. In most cases of paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, a part of the muscles is maintained by synkinetic reinnervation when therapy is carried out, which however also prevents effective vocal cord movement due to simultaneous activity of agonists and antagonists. Modulation of reinnervation by means of electrostimulation and modern genetic therapy approaches justify hopes of better outcomes in the future...|$|E
