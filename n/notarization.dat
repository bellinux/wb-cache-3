500|$|Truman is {{the most}} recent {{president}} who did not earn a college degree. [...] In addition to having briefly attended business college, from 1923 to 1925 he took night courses toward an LL.B. at the Kansas City Law School (now the University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law), but dropped out after losing reelection as county judge. [...] He was informed by attorneys in the Kansas City area that his education and experience were probably sufficient to receive a license to practice law, but did not pursue it because he won election as presiding judge. [...] While serving as president in 1947, Truman applied for a license to practice law. A friend who was an attorney began working out the arrangements, and informed Truman that his application had to be notarized. [...] By the time Truman received this information he had changed his mind, so he never sought <b>notarization.</b> After rediscovery of Truman's application, in 1996 the Missouri Supreme Court issued Truman a posthumous honorary law license.|$|E

For example, the University of Northern Washington advertises that its degrees are [...] "attested and sealed for authenticity by a government appointed notary". In reality <b>notarization</b> only certifies that the document was signed by the person named.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924 Reis {{reached out}} to {{business}} contacts of his to assist him in his [...] "confidential mission" [...] for the Governors of the Bank of Portugal. [...] Reis wrote up the fraudulent contract and had it officially notarized by an assistant notary who was too casual and trusting to read it. [...] Counting on a similarly lazy approach among diplomatic staffs, he acquired three certifications for the <b>notarization</b> in the embassies of Britain, Germany ( [...] Weimar Republic [...] ) and France ( [...] French Third Republic [...] ). Then he rewrote the contract with a French translation, forged the signatures of Bank of Portugal officials (he traced them from the currency in his pocket) and affixed the notarizations, and two new bills as samples, to the contract.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{electronic}} <b>notarizations</b> {{does not}} mean that the notary can perform the electronic <b>notarizations</b> remotely as most states still require that the participants and the notary must all be physically present at the time of signing. There are also significant benefits to having the <b>notarizations</b> done electronically such as cost savings, superior security, authenticity, audit trails, and document integrity, which are things that are not available to paper based <b>notarizations.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Whereas {{commercial}} agreements or prenuptial agreements {{generally do}} not require legal formalities to be observed, when married couples enter a property agreement (agreement for the division of property at the termination of the marriage), stringent requirements are imposed, including <b>notarization,</b> witnesses, special acknowledgment forms. In some countries, these must be filed (or docketed) with a domestic court, and the terms must be [...] "so ordered" [...] by a judge. [...] This is done {{in order to ensure}} that no undue influence or oppression has been exerted by one spouse against the other. [...] Upon presenting a property agreement between spouses to a court of divorce, that court will generally assure itself of the following factors: signatures, legal formalities, intent, later intent, free will, lack of oppression, reasonableness and fairness, consideration, performance, reliance, later repudiation in writing or by conduct, and whichever other concepts of contractual bargaining apply in the context.|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{three groups of}} individuals with varied occupational experience in unfamiliar face matching. Notaries, who are often legally required to hold liability insurance to protect them {{in the event of}} bad <b>notarizations</b> (including those resulting from identity impersonation), bank tellers, who are professionally obligated to verify identity for financial transactions, and undergraduate students completed a brief online unfamiliar face-matching test. Despite their years of experience and weekly identity verifications, both professional groups performed similarly to the student group. Indeed, the only reliable individual difference predictor of performance was age, such that increasing age predicted declining performance. Unlike the forensic image experts studied by White et al. (2015), however, the professionals in the present study received no formal image comparison training, and were only “trained” via on-the-job experience.|$|R
50|$|An {{applicant}} for the {{notary public}} commission must also post a $5,000 bond, usually with {{an insurance company}} and pay an application fee of $10. The application is usually accompanied with an oath of office. If the Secretary of State's office approves the application, the Secretary of State then sends the commission to the clerk of the county where the applicant resides. If the applicant records the commission with the county clerk, they then receive the commission. Illinois law prohibits notaries from using the literal Spanish translation in their title and requires them to use a rubber stamp seal for their <b>notarizations.</b> The notary public can then perform their duties anywhere in the state, {{as long as the}} notary resides (or works or does business) in the county where they were appointed.|$|R

40|$|As {{passed in}} CS/SB 1754, this bill {{contains}} specific statutory changes aimed at promoting {{the development of}} electronic commerce in Florida. Electronic commerce is a broad concept that {{can be defined as}} the use of computers and telecommunications to conduct business transactions. These transactions include the placing and tracking of orders, the delivery of products and services, the exchange of funds, and the documentation of such events. In addition, electronic commerce may involve electronic submission of various types of documents to government entities such as regulatory agencies and courts. The bill would authorize the Secretary of State to commission notaries to perform electronic <b>notarizations</b> which could add trust, reliability, and authenticity to electronic transactions. The bill allows agencies to accept debit cards as a form of payment for goods and services. The bill would also authorize the Secretary of State to promulgate and implement rules for the voluntary licensure of private certification authorities which would issue digital certificates to be used with digital signatures to authenticate electronic commerce transactions. The bill would allow the use of electronic seals, based on digital signature technology, to be affixed to official engineering, land surveying, and mapping documents which are distributed in an electronic format.

50|$|<b>Notarization</b> and {{witnessing}} {{requirements on}} voter registration applications, ballot requests, and voted ballots present a real barrier to voting for many UOCAVA citizens.

Similarly, witnessing requirements, especially those that specify the age or citizenship of the witness, may disenfranchise voters who cannot satisfy this requirement due to their location or circumstances. <b>Notarization</b> or witnessing requirements for all absentee balloting materials should be removed, and the voter’s signature and date, under the self-administered oath on these voting materials, should verify {{the legitimacy of the}} voter and the application or ballot.|$|E
