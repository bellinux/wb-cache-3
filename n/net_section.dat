40|$|Despite {{fundamental}} {{differences in the}} mechanical behaviour of stainless steel and carbon steel, design provisions for stainless steel connections in current standards essentially follow the rules for carbon steel with some limited modifications. For the case of <b>net</b> <b>section</b> capacity, the design rules from EN 1993 - 1 - 3 for cold-formed carbon steel have been adopted for stainless steel connections in EN 1993 - 1 - 4 and the SCI/Euro Inox Design Manual without any modification.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the assumption implicit in Cochrane’s formula that stresses are uniformly distributed across the <b>net</b> <b>section</b> of a staggered bolted connection. The assumption {{was found to}} be overoptimistic for connections in steel having low ductility, leading to unconservative estimates for the tension capacity if the in-plane shear lag is not accounted for. The reduction factor of 0. 9 specified in the North American specification for cold-formed steel structures partially but not wholly addresses the problems inherent in the code equations. This paper points out that the “simplification” of Cochrane’s original formula into the standard formula used in steel design codes worldwide can lead to additional design capacity that may not be justified.

However, elon- gation {{is a problem in}} ultra-high strength steels, which has been reported to be low in traditional material tests. Although in these tests, ultra-high strength steels have exhibited good local strain properties, which suggests that traditional material test procedures are inappropriate. In this paper, notched specimens were used to develop material models and to define failure criteria. The results were verified using welded components and tensile tests. The failure point and capacity levels were determined in welded and <b>net</b> <b>section</b> tests. We conclude that the strain properties of ultra-high strength steels are good, where the full capacity of the <b>net</b> <b>section</b> stress was reached in the tensile tests.

40|$|The use of {{stainless}} steel in construction is steadily growing, with applications designed to exploit its structural properties, durability, appearance and fire resistance. The mechanical behaviour {{of stainless}} steel is fundamentally {{different from that of}} carbon steel. The stress-strain curve {{of stainless steel}} is rounded without a well-defined yield stress and exhibits significant strain hardening at relatively small strains. Nevertheless, design provisions for bolted connections between stainless steel structural members in current international standards are essentially based on the rules for carbon steel with some very limited modifications. As the connections form an essential part of all structural assemblages, a comprehensive understanding of their behaviour is vital for efficient design and consequently better performance of structures. For this reason, an investigation into the behaviour of stainless steel bolted connections has been carried out so as to better understand the response of these structural components. Suitable available test data have been reviewed and replicated using numerical models in order to study the behaviour of lap bolted connections and gusset plate connections in stainless steel under static tensile load. Strain-based criteria were defined to identify three failure modes: <b>net</b> <b>section</b> rupture, bolt shear and bearing failure. The developed FE models were successfully validated against the test results, after which they were employed to meticulously investigate the behaviour of bearing and <b>net</b> <b>section</b> rupture of lap bolted connections, as well as the <b>net</b> <b>section</b> failure of single angles connected to gusset plates. The results demonstrated that the response of stainless steel connections has some different aspects from that of carbon steel. The findings have been used to revise the design rules for <b>net</b> <b>section</b> and bearing capacities in Eurocode 3 Part 1. 4. These proposed rules take into account the particular mechanical characteristics of stainless steel and therefore offer an improvement to those currently available.

Munse and Chesson (1963) studied riveted and bolted joints and examined factors that reduce <b>net</b> <b>section</b> capacity, conducted numerous experiments on various specimens and connection details. Prior to these studies, tension member capacity was based solely on gross section yielding or <b>net</b> <b>section</b> rupture. Kulak and Wu (1997) studied shear lag in bolted angle tension members and examined shear lag effects and presented accountings for shear lag in American and Canadian design specifications (which are based on AISC LRFD specifications), conducted a number of tension tests considering only <b>net</b> <b>section</b> rupture. The failure of these specimens was preceded by a necking down of the net area between the leg edge and lead bolt hole. Rupturing of the specimen initiated at the leg edge and propagated through to the bolt hole and then on {{through the rest of the}} specimen. Barth et al. (2002) studied behavior of steel tension members subjected to uniaxial loading and performed load tests on three series of short tension member specimens to investigate the influence of varying connection eccentricity and connection length on the load capacity of the members. Pan (2004) studied the prediction of the strength of bolted cold-formed channel sections in tension and investigated the shear lag effect in bolted cold-formed steel tension members. Shear lag effect occurs when some elements of the tension member are not connected. This effect reduces the strength of the member because the stresses distributed over the entire section are not uniform.

The analysis in terms of strength and ductility shows that T+NSF joints are suitable for seismic design, because the straps yield before the connections fail.

The influence of various design parameters (strap thickness, number and diameter of screws, steel grade) in the failure mode is studied, and design criteria to induce a T+NSF response are given.

40|$|Marine {{fish farming}} is an {{important}} and growing industry. Fouling organisms that grow on the net cages and other structural components of the fish farms are a substantial problem for the industry. The overall {{aim of this study}} is to increase the understanding of how the bio fouling influence the hydrodynamic forces on the nets. More specifically the focus is on hydroid growth, and the use of models of net twine with artificial hydroid fouling. The models that were used ar made of two 1. 5 mm steel rods that are twisted together, with short pieces of 0. 32 mm multifilament fishing line fixed between them, similar to a test tube brush. The twisted steel rods were replicating a 3 mm twine, with the fishing lines acting as evenly distributed hydroid growth. Previously drag tests had been done with one and two of these models, with two parallel twines with variyng distance, and also a cross configuration. In the present study the goal was to investigate possible interaction effects between twines, by using various configurations with a higher number of twines; and also make small <b>net</b> <b>sections</b> and estimate the drag increase due to bio fouling. 16 twine models were made, and tests were done with a single twine; and 2, 4, 6 and 8 parallel twines; and also crossing twines, with the same numbers of twines in each direction. In total 18 different configurations were tested, with twine spacings of 12 mm and 24 mm. The experiments were done in a towing tank, with the twine models fixed in a frame, orthogonally to the direction of travel. The drag force was measured on the frame, and the contribution from the frame itself was subtracted from the total force to find the drag on the twine models. Then the drag coefficients were calculated and plotted in various diagrams to visualise any trends. All the configurations were tested at a range of velocities from 0. 05 m/s to 1. 4 m/s. Most of the results were consistent, except for the two lowest velocities (0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s) were the precision error was significant. It was found that the drag coefficient for the fouled twine models were decreasing with increasing current velocity. At 0. 1 m/s (Re = 300) the drag coefficients were between 3. 5 and 4. 0, while for 1. 4 m/s (Re = 4200) they were approximately 3. 0. This is probably either because of deflection of the hydroids at higher velocities, or because the hydroids themselves have a smaller diameter, and hence are in a lower Reynolds number range (from Re = 32 to Re = 448), where the drag coefficient is dependent on the velocity. The variations in drag coefficients between the different model configurations were small, there were some consistent trends, but the magnitude were insignificant. This means that the interaction effects between the twines are relatively small, and it is likely that data from tests with few twines can be extrapolated to net panel applications. The drag coefficients for the <b>net</b> <b>sections</b> in the middle of the cruciform configurations were calculated. For the <b>net</b> <b>sections</b> with 12 mm spacing the results were inconclusive, while for 24 mm spacing the net drag coefficient varied between 0. 66 and 0. 59 for different velocities. This is twice as high as empirical data for a similar clean net. Several possibilities for further work were identified during the work with the thesis. One is to do more similar experiments, both with equivalent models to verify the results, and with either more or less hydroids, to study the influence of the amount of fouling. Another is to try to quantify the bending stiffness of real hydroids compared to the stiffness of the hydroid models (fishing line). The mechanical properties of real hydroids and the hydroid replicas have only been compared qualitatively in previous studies, so quantifying these would be useful both for validation of the models, and for improving them. Further investigations of the drag coefficient of the hydroid stems independently, with regards to the Reynolds number dependency of the drag coefficients of the whole models, would also be interesting...|$|R
