5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal <b>Navy</b> <b>and</b> the United States <b>Navy,</b> <b>and</b> applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E

5|$|The F-4 {{was used}} {{extensively}} during the Vietnam War. It {{served as the}} principal air superiority fighter for both the <b>Navy</b> <b>and</b> Air Force, and became important in the ground-attack and aerial reconnaissance roles late in the war.

During the Vietnam War, one U.S. Air Force pilot and two weapon systems officers (WSOs), and one U.S. Navy pilot and one radar intercept officer (RIO) became aces by achieving five aerial kills against enemy fighter aircraft. The F-4 continued to form a major part of U.S. military air power throughout the 1970s and 1980s, being gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 in the U.S. Air Force, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat in the U.S. <b>Navy,</b> <b>and</b> the F/A-18 Hornet in the U.S. <b>Navy</b> <b>and</b> U.S. Marine Corps.|$|E
