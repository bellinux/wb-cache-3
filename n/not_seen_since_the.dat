5|$|In artistic terms, {{there was}} a revival in mosaic, and {{regional}} schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew {{on a range of}} cultural influences. During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early humanism as a renaissance of interest in classical authors. In Eustathius of Thessalonica, Byzantine humanism found its most characteristic expression. In philosophy, there was resurgence of classical learning <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 7th century, characterised by {{a significant increase in the}} publication of commentaries on classical works. In addition, the first transmission of classical Greek knowledge to the West occurred during the Komnenian period.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform {{the look of the}} Enterprise on a scale <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>The</b> Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
5|$|The new {{alignment}} of US-6 was opened on December 30, 1983. The dedication was {{planned for the}} next day, but lines of cars formed at the barricades as soon as news broke that the highway was complete. Some were residents anxious to see the area or visit relatives they had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours. The Highway Patrol requested the ceremony be canceled and the highway opened early, as {{they were unable to}} disperse the crowds.|$|E

5|$|While {{considering}} {{the character of}} Chang, absent since The Blue Lotus, Hergé thought of his artistic Chinese friend Zhang Chongren, whom he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> days of their friendship over twenty years earlier. Hergé and Zhang used to spend every Sunday together, during which Hergé learned much about Chinese culture {{for his work on}} The Blue Lotus. Later, Zhang moved back to his homeland and Hergé lost contact with his friend after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Hergé felt Chang and Tintin must be reunited, just as he hoped to see his friend again some day.|$|E
5|$|By 2001, {{the notable}} successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as Monsters, Inc. and, Shrek, respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis: The Lost Empire {{led to a}} growing {{perception}} that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In March 2002, just after the successful release of Blue Sky Studios' computer-animated feature Ice Age, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale plunged to a low <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> start of the studio's ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985. The Paris studio was also closed in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Cold War {{tensions}} between the United States and Soviet Union had escalated to a level <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Cuban Missile Crisis because of several factors. These included the United States' Strategic Defense Initiative, its planned deployment of the Pershing II weapon system in Europe in March and April, and FleetEx '83, the largest naval exercise held to date in the North Pacific. The military hierarchy of the Soviet Union (particularly the old guard led by Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov and Minister of Defence Dmitry Ustinov) viewed these actions as bellicose and destabilizing; they were deeply suspicious of U.S. President Ronald Reagan's intentions and openly fearful he was planning a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. These fears culminated in RYAN, the code name for a secret intelligence-gathering program initiated by Andropov to detect a potential nuclear sneak attack which he believed Reagan was plotting.|$|E

25|$|With {{the ability}} to record sound (beginning in the 1890s), flutes began to regain a {{popularity}} <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> classical era. Recordings of flute music became increasingly common, with professional flautists spending {{a great deal of}} time recording music. The 20th century brought the first recordings of Baroque music on modern flutes.|$|E
25|$|Season 1975/76 {{saw some}} big changes. The club rejoined the RDCA and the Women's XI, <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{start of the}} 20th century, was re-established. Their success was instant, winning the Victorian Women's Cricket Association premiership in its first attempt, thus ending the club's longest ever premiership drought. Instrumental in its {{creation}} and success were sisters Susanne & Jenny Chapman, and the team {{would go on to}} play until 1992/93.|$|E

25|$|Despite these losses, Boston's ambiance remains {{unique among}} world cities and, in many ways, has {{improved}} in recent years—racial tensions have eased dramatically, city streets bustle with a vitality <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, {{and once again}} Boston has become a hub of intellectual, technological, and political ideas. Nevertheless, the city had to tackle gentrification issues and rising living expenses. According to Money Magazine, Boston {{is one of the}} world's 100 most expensive cities.|$|E
25|$|Hungary's {{transition}} to a Western-style democracy {{was one of the}} smoothest among the former Soviet bloc. By late 1988, activists within the party and bureaucracy and Budapest-based intellectuals were increasing pressure for change. Some of these became reform socialists, while others began movements which were to develop into parties. Young liberals formed the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz); a core from the so-called Democratic Opposition formed the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), and the national opposition established the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). Civic activism intensified to a level <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1956 revolution.|$|E
25|$|After his suicide, Young's role in NYC {{management}} was assumed by Alfred E. Perlman, {{who had been}} working with the NYC under Young since 1954. Despite the dismal financial condition of the railroad, Perlman was able to streamline operations and save the company money. Starting in 1959, Perlman was able to reduce operating deficits by $7.7 million, which nominally raised NYC stock to $1.29 per share, producing dividends of an amount <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> end of the war. By 1964 he was able to reduce the NYC long term debt by nearly $100 million, while reducing passenger deficits from $42 to $24.6 million.|$|E

He died in Suva on 18 April 2004, from complications arising from the stroke. His state funeral, led by Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca, which was spread out over three days (28 to 30 April) saw an estimated 200,000 people – almost a quarter of Fiji's total population – line the streets to pay their last respects to the man they regarded as the father of the nation, in an outpouring of public grief <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> death of Mara's presidential predecessor, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, over a decade earlier.|$|E
25|$|The 1920/1921 {{season at}} the Vieux-Colombier began with popular re-runs from {{previous}} season, opening with Vildrac's Le Paquebot Tenacity followed by Nuit des rois, which Parisians had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the first}} season in 1914. The highly demanding Vieux-Colombier audiences were happy to see fine performances of classics under the deft direction of Copeau. Critics, though, wondered when new plays would be on the bill. In January, Copeau staged Henri Ghéon's Le Pauvre sous l'escalier ("The Beggar under the Staircase"), the story based on the medieval tale of the life of Saint Alexis. La Mort de Sparte ("The Death of Sparta"), a play by Copeau's friend Jean Schlumberger dating from before the war, garnered neither critical nor popular praise.|$|E
25|$|Jaime Reyes {{appears as}} a playable {{character}} in Injustice 2, voiced by Antony Del Rio. During the time interval between the two games, Jaime had the Beetle attached to his backbone and sought Batman's help {{to learn how to}} use it. After that, he became one of his allies in the protection of Earth. In the story mode, he and Firestorm are tasked with guarding Superman's cell from the Regime and Brainiac's forces. He is later brainwashed by Grodd into attacking Aquaman and Black Adam on Kahndaq. In his ending, Batman offers him a spot on the Justice League, but Jaime takes a break from heroics and starts living a normal life with his family, whom he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Scarab bonded to him.|$|E

25|$|As the {{possibility}} of a 2006 Liberal leadership convention emerged during the midpoint of the election campaign, most media speculation focused on the surfeit of potential candidates poised to replace Martin. Some optimistically billed this convention as being most likely to provide a broad field of skilled contenders <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1968 convention that included Pierre Trudeau, Robert Winters, Paul Martin, Sr., John Turner, Joe Greene, Mitchell Sharp and Allan MacEachen. Such speculation seemed rooted in the assumption that high-profile members of the Chrétien cabinet that had elected not to challenge the Martin juggernaut in 2003 (most commonly enumerated as John Manley, Allan Rock, Brian Tobin and Martin Cauchon) would return to federal politics, along with 2003 runner-up Sheila Copps and Martin's own presumptive heir Frank McKenna, prompting a balanced matchup between multiple household names.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{conservative}} financial {{approach and}} its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared {{with many of}} its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups. The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1970s oil crisis. This became {{a major issue in}} the 2004 presidential election. Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002–2006 period and the unemployment rate fell below 4%.|$|E
25|$|Baker quickly {{made the}} part his own, viewing figures {{for his first}} few years {{returning}} to a level <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> height of 'Dalekmania' a decade earlier. His eccentric style of dress and quirky personality (particularly his trademark long scarf and fondness for jelly babies), {{as well as his}} distinctive voice, made him an immediately recognisable figure and he quickly caught the viewing public's imagination. Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part. Baker himself suggested many aspects of his Doctor's personality, but the distinctive scarf was created by accident. James Acheson, the costume designer assigned to his first story, had provided far more wool than was necessary to the knitter, Begonia Pope, intending for her to choose a suitable colour. However, due to miscommunication Pope knitted all the wool she was given. It was Baker who suggested that he wear the ridiculously long scarf, which he did once it had been shortened a bit to make it more manageable.|$|E
