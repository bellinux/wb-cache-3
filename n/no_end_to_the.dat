25|$|The Ptolemaic {{approach}} of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: {{there seemed to}} be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler {{was the first person to}} abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.|$|E

25|$|During {{the final}} {{decade of the}} 19th Century, careful {{expansion}} nevertheless led to solid chapters at Yale (Sachem Hall), Columbia, Maryland, Penn State and Penn, among other storied schools. Dartmouth, Brown, and MIT followed soon after. Eventually Phi Sig was present at six of the eight Ivy League schools; even Canadian campuses were not excluded in the thinking of those who carried new chapters in all directions shortly {{after the turn of}} the century. Rho Chapter was organized at Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario in 1903, and seventeen other units were added during the decade. Under Cutter's and Barrett's leadership, the national organization was strengthened, and work was begun among the alumni to support their continued interest in the Fraternity after graduation. The Greek system's uniqueness among American organizations is based partly on this principle – the idea of continued involvement for members after undergraduate days. Phi Sigma Kappa was one of the early leaders in such efforts and remains one of the strongest alumni-oriented groups. If Founder Brooks' assessment of its purpose is true, then there would be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fraternity's influence on its members, and its role in their lives—another vital part of Phi Sig's heritage.|$|E

Revealing the news whilst interviewed on talk show Loose Women, Lane said that the pair would meet off-screen in Tenerife. Though she had not read the scripts, Lane thought they would be [...] "a really good combination". Coronation Street publicity said it would make [...] "exciting viewing" [...] for fans.

[...] Lane also revealed that the storyline was implemented because there was no other plausible way for Kylie to return. They did not carry on with the scenario with Becky and Steve, because the viewers needed [...] "something new". Lane was happy with the direction of the storyline because it paved the way for more [...] "explosive" [...] material. Kylie was also tipped to be the one in control of the relationship. She also acknowledged that certain aspects of their relationship would mirror Becky and Steve's relationship, in the sense that when Kylie is with David, a [...] "loved up" [...] nicer side to Kylie surfaces.|$|E
500|$|In chapter seven Townsend {{details the}} sheer horror of China's ongoing civil war. Among the factions {{competing}} for power in China, Townsend believes {{that none of}} them, neither the leaders nor their men, have any fixed loyalties or higher motivations apart from desire for loot. With every man only out for himself and [...] "China's microscopically few good men... too weak to be felt", Townsend predicts <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chaos. Much of the violence, Townsend explains in chapter eight, is fuelled by opium, the addiction of {{one out of every}} eight Chinese. Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies, {{to such an extent that}} many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food, and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade. In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords, in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China. The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal, brave, reliable, honest, and cleanly people, and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese. Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the Shanghai Incident of 1932, which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression, and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the [...] "foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese" [...] waged by Zhang Xueliang. Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of Manchukuo as [...] "a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there" [...] which has achieved [...] "stability and well-being for millions". Townsend concludes that informed observers are grateful for Japan's role in dealing with an unruly China.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} during {{the days of the}} Temple, seven days before Yom Kippur, they would move the High Priest from his house to the cell of the counselors and prepare another priest to take his place in case {{anything}} impure happened to him to make him unfit to perform the service. Rabbi Judah said that they prepared another wife for him, in case his wife should die, as [...] says that [...] "he shall make atonement for himself and for his house" [...] and [...] "his house" [...] means [...] "his wife." [...] But they told Rabbi Judah that if they would do so, then there would be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matter, as they would have to prepare a third wife in case the second died, and so on. The rest of the year, the High Priest would offer sacrifices only if he wanted to, but during the seven days before Yom Kippur, he would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifices, burn the incense, trim the lamps, and offer the head and the hind leg of the sacrifices. They brought sages from the court to the High Priest, and throughout the seven days they read to him about the order of the service. They asked the High Priest to read it aloud, in case he had forgotten or never learned.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{on the evening of}} the 14th of Nisan, Jews searched for leavened food in the house by candlelight. Any place into which one did not bring leavened food did not require checking. The Sages taught that one needed to check two rows in a wine cellar, as it was a place into which one brought leavened food. The House of Shammai taught that one needed to check the two front rows of the entire wine cellar, but the House of Hillel taught that one needed to check only the two outer rows that were uppermost.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997[...] They did not worry that perhaps a weasel had dragged leavened bread from house to house, or from place to place, for if they had, {{they would have had to}} worry that the weasel had dragged leavened bread from {{courtyard}} to courtyard and from city to city, and there would have been <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matter.. Rabbi Judah taught that they searched for leavened foods on the evening of the 14th, and on the morning of the 14th, and at the time that they destroyed the leavened foods (in the sixth hour – between 11 a.m. and noon). But the Sages maintained that if they did not search on the evening of the 14th, they needed to search on the 14th; if they did not search in the morning of the 14th, they needed to search at the time that they destroyed the leavened foods; if they did not search at that time, they needed to search after that time. And what they left over for the last morning meal before the Festival, they needed to put away in a hidden place, so that they should not need to search after it. Rabbi Meir taught that they could eat leavened foods through the fifth hour of the morning, and needed to burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour. Rabbi Judah taught that they could eat it through the fourth hour of the morning, needed to keep it in suspense during the fifth hour, and needed to burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour. Rabbi Judah also told that they used to put two unfit loaves of the thank offering on the roof of the Temple portico, and as long as the loaves lay there, all the people would eat leavened foods. When they would remove one loaf, the people would keep leavened foods in suspense, neither eating nor burning it. And when they removed both loaves, the people began burning their leavened foods. Rabban Gamaliel taught that unconsecrated leavened bread ( [...] , chullin) could be eaten through the fourth hour of the morning, and leavened bread that was a heave-offering ( [...] , terumah) could be eaten through the fifth hour, and they burned them at the beginning of the sixth hour. The Mishnah taught that during the entire time that one was permitted to eat leavened food, one was allowed to feed it to cattle, beasts, and birds; sell it to a gentile; and otherwise to benefit from it. When its period had passed, benefit from it was forbidden, and one was not even allowed to fire an oven or a pot range with it. Rabbi Judah taught that there was no destruction of leavened food except by burning. But the Sages maintained that one could also crumble it and throw it to the wind or casts it into the sea.|$|E
