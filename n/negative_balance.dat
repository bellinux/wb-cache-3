5|$|The mass balance, or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier {{is crucial to}} its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained <b>negative</b> <b>balance</b> loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

5000|$|The IRR {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the money-weighted {{performance}} of financial investments such as anindividual investor's brokerage account. For this scenario, an equivalent, more intuitive definition of the IRR is, [...] "The IRR is the annual interest rate of the fixed rate account (like a somewhat idealized savings account)which, when subjected to the same deposits and withdrawals as the actual investment, has the same ending balance as the actual investment." [...] This fixed rate account is also called the replicating fixed rate account for the investment. There are examples where the replicating fixed rate account encounters <b>negative</b> <b>balances</b> {{despite the fact that the}} actual investment did not. In those cases, the IRR calculation assumes that the same interest rate that is paid on positive balances is charged on <b>negative</b> <b>balances.</b> It has been shown that this way of charging interest is the root cause of the IRR's multiple solutions problem. If the model is modified so that, as is the case in real life, an externally supplied cost of borrowing (possibly varying over time) is charged on <b>negative</b> <b>balances,</b> the multiple solutions issue disappears. The resulting rate is called the fixed rate equivalent (FREQ).|$|R

40|$|Reproductive {{status is}} tightly coupled to {{metabolic}} state in females, and ovarian cycling in mammals is halted when energy output exceeds energy input, a metabolic condition known as <b>negative</b> energy <b>balance.</b> This inhibition of reproductive function during <b>negative</b> energy <b>balance</b> occurs due to suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in the hypothalamus. The GnRH secretagogue kisspeptin is also inhibited during <b>negative</b> energy <b>balance,</b> indicating that inhibition of reproductive neuroendocrine circuits may occur upstream of GnRH itself. Understanding the metabolic signals {{responsible for the}} inhibition of reproductive pathways has been a compelling research focus for many years. A predominant theory {{in the field is}} that the status of energy balance is conveyed to reproductive neuroendocrine circuits via the adipocyte hormone leptin. Leptin is stimulatory for GnRH release and lower levels of leptin during <b>negative</b> energy <b>balance</b> are believed to result in decreased stimulatory drive for GnRH cells. However, recent evidence found that restoring leptin to physiological levels did not restore GnRH function in three different models of <b>negative</b> energy <b>balance.</b> This suggests that although leptin may be an important permissive signal for reproductive function as indicated by many years of research, factors other than leptin must critically contribute to negative energy balance-induced reproductive inhibition. This review will focus on emerging candidates for the integration of metabolic status and reproductive function during <b>negative</b> energy <b>balance...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A glacier with a {{sustained}} <b>negative</b> <b>balance</b> {{is out of}} equilibrium and will retreat, while one with {{a sustained}} positive balance is out of equilibrium and will advance. Glacier retreat results {{in the loss of}} the low elevation region of the glacier. Since higher elevations are cooler than lower ones, the disappearance of the lowest portion of the glacier reduces overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. [...] However, if the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the local climate. Such a glacier will melt away with a continuation of this local climate.|$|E

2500|$|Mass {{balance is}} {{measured}} by determining the amount of snow accumulated during winter, and later measuring the amount of snow and ice removed by melting in the summer. The {{difference between these two}} parameters is the mass balance. If the amount of snow accumulated during the winter is larger than the amount of melted snow and ice during the summer, the mass balance is positive and the glacier has increased in volume. On the other hand, if the melting of snow and ice during the summer is larger than the supply of snow in the winter, the mass balance is negative and the glacier volume decreases. Mass balance is reported in meters of water equivalent. [...] This represents the average thickness gained (positive balance) or lost (<b>negative</b> <b>balance)</b> from the glacier during that particular year.|$|E

40|$|Background: The major stress {{response}} to critical illness {{leads to a}} catabolic state and loss of lean body mass. Aims: To test whether an increased rate of creatinine excretion might provide unique and timely information to monitor cell catabolism; to relate this information to balances of cell constituents (nitrogen, potassium, phosphate and magnesium); {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of nutritional therapy to reverse this catabolic process. Design: Prospective observational study. Methods: Children with severe traumatic brain injury admitted to the paediatric critical care units of The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada and Hospital das Clnicas, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeiro Preto, University of So Paulo, Brazil were studied. Complete 24 h urine collections were obtained for measurement of creatinine excretion rate and daily balances of nitrogen, potassium, phosphate and magnesium. Results: Seventeen patients were studied for 310 days. On Day 1, all had <b>negative</b> <b>balances</b> for protein and phosphate. Balances for these intracellular constituents became positive when protein intake was >= 1 g/kg/day and energy intake was >= 50 % of estimated energy expenditure (P < 0. 0001). Creatinine excretion rate was positively correlated with the urea appearance rate (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 0001), and negatively with protein balance (r = - 0. 45; P < 0. 0001). Sepsis developed in four patients; before its clinical detection, there were <b>negative</b> <b>balances</b> for all intracellular markers and an abrupt rise in the excretion of creatinine.
