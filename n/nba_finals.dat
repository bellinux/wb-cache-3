5|$|The Bill Russell <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> Most Valuable Player Award (formerly {{known as}} the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> Most Valuable Player Award) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1969 <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals.</b> The award is decided {{by a panel of}} eleven media members, who cast votes after the {{conclusion}} of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award. The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005 to commemorate Bill Russell.|$|E
5|$|The Boston Celtics went 11–1 in the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> during 13 seasons (1956–57 to 1968–69). They {{won eight}} {{straight}} NBA championships from 1959 through 1966. This period marks the largest stretch of seasons {{that a single}} team made up over 65% of Finals appearances, and also includes the only ever time the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> was decided in double overtime.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural {{winners of}} the trophy were the Philadelphia Warriors, who {{defeated}} the Chicago Stags. From 1957 to 1969, the Celtics won the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> 11 out of 13 times, including eight consecutive wins. The final {{winners of the}} trophy were the Philadelphia 76ers, who defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1983 <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals.</b> In 1984, the trophy was renamed the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy.|$|E

5|$|With the new duo of Malone and Erving, the 76ers won the 1983 <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals,</b> losing {{only once}} in the entire playoffs, as well as {{sweeping}} the Lakers. However, the 1984 <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> was conducted by the Celtics and Lakers, who faced {{each other for the}} first time since 1969. After an inspired performance from Bird, the Celtics toppled the Lakers 4–3. The final game of this series attracted the largest ever TV audience for an NBA game, and the second-largest ever for a basketball game, with only the game between the two stars played five years earlier having a larger audience. It was the last <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> played in the 2–2–1–1–1 format, until 2014.|$|E
5|$|As {{many stars}} either {{declined}} or retired following this win, {{it is largely}} recognized as the last <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> conducted by the Celtics dynasty.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} trip to the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals,</b> in which Miami faced off against the Dallas Mavericks, Wade had some {{especially}} memorable moments. His performance in games three, four, and five, in which he scored 42, 36, and 43 points, respectively, helped bring the Heat back from a 0–2 deficit to lead the series 3-2. In Game 3 Wade tied his career playoff high with 42 points and grabbed a career-high 13 rebounds. Fifteen of his 42 points came in the fourth quarter, in which the Heat erased a 13-point deficit over the final 6:29 with a 22–7 run which included a go-ahead jumper by NBA veteran Gary Payton that sealed the win. The Heat went on to win Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4–2, and Wade was presented with the Finals MVP trophy. He became the fifth youngest player in NBA history to capture <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> MVP honors and recorded the third highest scoring average by a player in his first <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> with 34.7 points per game. His 33.8 PER in the <b>NBA</b> <b>finals</b> was ranked by ESPN's John Hollinger as the greatest Finals performance since the NBA-ABA merger.|$|E

5|$|On September 25, 2015, it was {{confirmed}} that Nash {{would take on}} part-time consulting duties for the Golden State Warriors. During his first season with the team, the Warriors produced a record-breaking 73–9 season, although the team fell short in the 2016 <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The next season, the Warriors would win the 2017 <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> against the defending champions Cleveland Cavaliers, giving Nash his first NBA championship in any role.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> {{were the}} only Finals during this period not to feature the Spurs or Lakers, instead {{featuring}} the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks. It was the first <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> since 1971 that had both Western and Eastern Conference champions making their first Finals appearance in franchise history. The Mavericks won {{the first two games}} at home, but the turning point of the series was in Game 3, when the Heat overcame a 13-point deficit with less than 6 minutes left in the fourth quarter to win 98–96. The comeback was led by Dwyane Wade's 12 points in the final six minutes and a clutch outside jumpshot by Gary Payton, who was appearing in his third <b>NBA</b> <b>finals.</b> Miami swept all three of their home games, two of which were sparked by fourth quarter comebacks led by Wade; the Heat would win their first ever championship in game six.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> MVP award, and he cried while holding the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> trophy.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{returned}} to the <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> in 1982, time time led by new coach Pat Riley, in a rematch against the 76ers. The 76ers defeated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals in a 7-game series, but were defeated by Lakers in 6 games, with Johnson being named Finals MVP. Upon losing their past three <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> appearances, the 76ers decided that they needed one more piece to become champions, and enlisted Malone as their premier target. On September 15, 1982, they traded for Malone, who was also the league's reigning MVP.|$|E
