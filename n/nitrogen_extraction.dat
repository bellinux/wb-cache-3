40|$|Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench, {{a member}} of the Asteraceae family, is a plant rich in flavonoids, {{essential}} oils, phenolic compounds, saponins, polysaccharides and glycoproteins. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the protein content in dried roots of Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench after homogenization of roots with liquid <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>extraction</b> in 0. 01 mol L– 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and purification followed by fractionation of proteins using gel filtration chromatography. Total concentration of proteins was measured using the Bradford method, and evaluation of the molecular mass of proteins was accomplished by applying the SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The Bradford assay revealed that the highest concentration of proteins in fractions collected after gel filtration chomatography was 4. 66 – 6. 07 mg mL– 1. Glycoproteins, alkamides and polysaccharides in roots of Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench are chemical compounds responsible for their immunomodulatory properties.

40|$|This work reports {{liquid-liquid}} extraction of nitrogen compounds from oxidized and non-oxidized Brazilian petroleum samples. The experiments were accomplished in a laboratory-scale liquid-liquid apparatus in the temperature range of 303 K- 323 K, using methanol, n-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and their mixtures as extraction solvents, employing solvent to sample volume ratios of 1 : 2, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1, exploring {{up to three}} separation stages. Results show that an increase in temperature, solvent to oil ratio, and number of equilibrium stages greatly improves the nitrogen removal from the oxidized sample (from 2600 to 200 ppm). The employed oxidation scheme is thus demonstrated to be an essential and efficient step of sample preparation for the selective liquid-liquid removal of nitrogen compounds.

40|$|AbstractHydrothermal {{liquefaction}} (HTL) is {{a promising}} route for producing renewable fuels and chemicals from algal biomass. However, the protein {{fraction of the}} alga gives rise to nitrogen compounds in the oil fraction, which may render the oil unattractive for use in conventional refining processes. We report a two-stage HTL approach with the primary aim of reducing the nitrogen concentration in the bio-crude oil. A mild (< 200 °C) pre-treatment step (Stage I) is performed before more severe (250 – 350 °C) HTL conditions (Stage II) are applied to the microalga Chlorella {{for the production of}} bio-crude in a batch reactor. The pre-treatment resulted in up to 50 wt. % of the input nitrogen crossing into the Stage I aqueous phase and, following Stage II processing, reductions in the bio-crude nitrogen contents of up to 55 %, relative to the direct HTL of untreated Chlorella were observed. However, since considerable amounts of the starting material were lost in Stage I, overall lower quantities of bio-crude were isolated after Stage II processing, as compared to single-stage processing. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>extraction</b> during Stage I is enhanced by the addition of acids (1 N sulphuric or formic acid) but the process remains unselective. Overall, it is concluded that the two-stage approach to reducing the nitrogen content of bio-crudes from a protein-rich alga requires careful evaluation of the trade-off between the desired bio-crude properties and the yield obtained...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} {{two main}} issues. First, using an inter-temporal optimisation framework, the thesis analysed the tradeoffs between {{short and long-term}} objectives of soil use that smallholder farmers’ face in their production decisions. Second, using econometric models that account for simultaneity of choices and plot level data, the thesis explored the determinants of soil fertility and soil conservation adoption decision behaviour of smallholder farmers in the Central highlands of Ethiopia. Four major conclusions are drawn from the optimization results. First, steady state optimal output and input levels under the dynamic decision rule {{are found to be}} significantly higher than the static solutions suggesting that the static decision rule is sub-optimal. Second, current soil nutrient inputs and conservation efforts are well above the requirements of the static solutions suggesting smallholder farmers consider some of the long-term (dynamic) costs of soil degradation. Third, current farmer practices involve net <b>nitrogen</b> <b>extraction</b> of 16. 2 kg/ha from bottomlands and 56. 7 kg/ha from slopping lands entailing a total soil user cost of Birr 255 per ha and Birr 928 per ha, respectively. This suggests that current smallholder farmer practices discount the future heavily and hence over exploit the soil resource stock. Fourth, a comparison of steady state dynamic solutions when nutrient stocks are the sole determinant of soil quality with a situation where both nutrient stocks and rooting depth impinge on soil quality confirm the main hypothesis that the socially optimal path of soil use also depends on the nature of soil degradation smallholder farmers face on their plots. The econometric analysis of soil fertility and soil conservation adoption confirmed that awareness of soil degradation, public assistance with sharing initial costs of constructing soil conservation structures, improved security of land tenure and farmers’ education and access to information on soil degradation were found essential for farmers to adopt soil fertility management practices and invest in soil conservation. On the other hand, improved small farmers’ access to short-term credit for the purchase of inorganic fertilizers present a disincentive for long-term conservation practices, an important trade off with serious policy implications.

40|$|In Niger, {{the acute}} and chronic {{malnutrition}} constitutes {{a public health}} problem among children aged from six to fifty-nine months. The use of local foods was identified in the national protocol of malnutrition management as an alternative for ready to use therapeutic foods that are currently used. Among these local foods, the powder of dried leaves of Moringa oleifera was analyzed in order to know {{the composition of the}} powder of dried leaves of Moringa oleifera produced in Niger compared to the available data. To achieve this, four samples from the three main Moringa production regions in Niger namely Tillab& 233;ri, Niamey both located in the river basin and southern Maradi of the Sahel-Sudanese zone, were analyzed. The chromatographic analysis hasbeen made in the laboratory of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi- Arid Tropics. The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>extraction</b> technique was done using H 2 SO 4 digestion + salicylic acid + H 2 O 2 and selenium. It was measured using the calorimetry auto analyzer, based the Bertholet reaction. Total phosphorous, iron, zinc, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and copper was also extracted, using the same method. Phosphorus was measured by calorimetry using the method of molybdo-phosphate reduced to ascorbic acid. The other elements were measured using atomic spectroscopy absorption. The results correspond to the average of two parallel tests. Five standards enabled to make the calibration and a control sample was analyzed in the same conditions. The test is valid if the regression is about 0, 9950 - 0, 9999. The powder of dried leaves of Moringa produced in Niger turned out be rich in proteins with an average of 24, 8 [%] (Confidence Interval at 95 [%]: 19, 34 - 30, 24) with values going from 21, 58 [%] in Tillab& 233;ri to 28, 72 [%] in Niamey and in micronutrients. According to regions, the composition varies for iron between 51, 9 and 55, 12 mg/ 100 g, 0, 45 and 1, 58 mg/ 100 g for zinc, 1192, 5 and 1957, 5 mg/ 100 g for calcium, 414, 37 and 714, 37 mg/ 100 g for magnesium, 1587 and 2037 mg/ 100 g for potassium, 207, 75 and 326, 25 mg/ 100 g for sodium, 32 and 61 mg/ 100 g for phosphorus.

As proteínas foram extraídas com NaCl 0, 5 M em pH 7, 0. Na avaliação da digestibilidade in vitro, utilizou-se o método da hidrólise pela pepsina mais pancreatina. As marcações isotópicas na farinha integral de feijão, o extrato protéico total, a fração globulina e a fração albumina foram, respectivamente: 1, 394 ± 0, 011; 1, 403 ± 0, 012; 1, 399 ± 0, 007 e 1, 399 ± 0, 028 átomos% de 15 N, não sendo encontrada diferença estatística entre as mesmas (P> 0, 05). Entretanto, foram encontradas diferenças significativas (P 0, 05).

Hence, application of fertilizer nitrogen results in higher biomass yields and protein yield and concentration in plant tissue is commonly increased.

Increasing nitrogen supply generally improves kernel integrity and strength, resulting in better milling properties of the grain. In oil seed crops, protein levels are increased upon nitrogen fertilization, whereas oil concentration is decreased. Effects of nitrogen fertilization on oil composition and quality are inconsistent.

Anoxic solid-phase samples taken from a bioreactor previously used to treat metal and As contaminated water using sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) were subjected to the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and long-term column leaching tests. The results from TCLP experiments showed that the concentration of As leached from solid-phase sulfide material (SSM) samples after an 18 h extraction time was < 300 lg l 1, which is below the current maximum Australian TCLP leachate value for As, and thus would not be characterized as a hazardous waste. In terms of percent total As leached, this was equivalent to < 8. 5 % for SSM samples initially containing 61. 3 mg kg 1 As. The levels of As extracted by the TCLP {{was found to be}} significantly lowered or underestimated in the presence of dissolved oxygen, with As concentrations increasing with decreasing headspace-to-leachant volume ratios. The concentration of As was also consistently higher in <b>nitrogen</b> purged <b>extractions</b> compared to those performed in air.

In this method, for mixing the two phases, bubble dispersion of the organic phase (colloidal gas aphrons [CGAs]) is used instead of its drop dispersion in the aqueous phase. Through increased contact area and enhanced buoyancy force of organic phase, this performance mode leads to more satisfactory phase disengagement, less extraction time and more recovery of metal ions in high aqueous/organic (A/O) ratios. The results of experiments conducted on dilute (128 mg Cu/l) and dense (2000 mg Cu/l) synthetic solutions indicated 22 % and 2. 5 % (on average) increased recovery, respectively in the DNPDSE method compared with the SX method.

The conclusions highlight that the policy framework is most developed when it comes to defining environmental targets and sets a number of instruments to reduce pressures by encouraging the adoption of more resource efficient practices, but it becomes less specific when tackling sectors (drivers) and supporting more environmental sound economic development...|$|R
30|$|Characteristic {{physiological}} responses of plants to different treatments were evaluated {{to determine if}} the defense mechanisms of the genotypes are related to their CC, SC, and HC values. Relative CC unit leaf area was determined according to a previous study (Davenport et al. 2005) using a SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) analyzer (SPAD- 502 Chlorophyll Meter, Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). Stomatal conductance values were measured with a Porometer (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA). The sensor was equilibrated by considering water vapor in the ambient atmosphere as 0  % relative humidity and wetted filter paper at 100  % relative humidity. After equilibration, each leaf was inserted into the head of the Porometer sensor and a measurement taken (Limm et al. 2009). HC measurement was previously described (Wei et al. 2012). Briefly, each leaf was homogenized in liquid <b>nitrogen</b> and ice-cold <b>extraction</b> buffer (50  mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH  6.8, and 1  mM hydroxylamine) then added. The mixture was centrifuged at 12, 000 [*]g for 10  min at 4  °C and an equal amount of titanium reagent (0.1  % TiCl 2 in 20  % H 2 SO 4) added to the supernatant. The titanium reagent mixtures were centrifuged at 12, 000 [*]g for 10  min and supernatants measured at 410  nm absorbance. H 2 O 2 content was computed from a standard curve prepared from H 2 O 2 solutions of known concentrations.|$|R
40|$|Marine biofilms are {{microbial}} aggregates that ubiquitously develop on substrates in seawater. Biofilms are {{not simple}} layers of microorganisms adhering to a surface followed by new organisms growing on top, but they instead have a complex developmental process making biofilms dynamic, diverse and functional communities. The {{negative effects of}} biofilms on ships, underwater cables and pipelines have spawned research in antifouling approaches; however, {{little is known about}} their development in a northern temperate estuary, such as Narragansett Bay. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the first steps in biofouling in this area by assessing biofilm biomass through chlorophyll, carbon, <b>nitrogen,</b> total DNA <b>extractions</b> and percent biomass coverage, as well as bacterial biofilm community composition through the use of a molecular technique, the automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Comparisons were made between biofilms on control surfaces and surfaces treated with a commercial foul-release coating, between biofilms grown in the summer and winter seasons, as well as over a 90 -day immersion time. Biofilm biomass data revealed no overall significant differences between seasons or across surface types; however, immersion time had a significant effect as biomass tended to accumulate over time. Bacterial community composition obtained from ARISA profiles was influenced by immersion time, as communities separated out into ‘early,’ ‘mid,’ and ‘late’ groupings. It was also influenced by season as well as surface type. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Gap {{junctions}} are intercellular {{channels to}} facilitate electrical and metabolic communication between adjacent cells. Connexin 43 {{is the most}} predominant type of connexin expressed on rat detrusor muscle cells. We investigated the connexin 43 expressions in various age groups of either sex in normal rats. Methods: Eighty Sprague-Dawley rats were used for analysis. Each group was quantified by 8 rats at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months of age in either sex. In each animal, bladder was removed without any kind of intervention and fresh-frozen in liquid <b>nitrogen.</b> Total RNA <b>extraction</b> was done with easy-BLUE total RNA extraction kit. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was done for connexin 43 and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control using ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System. Results: In female rats, no age-related change was detected in connexin 43 expressions. In male rats, connexin expression at 3 months of age showed significant decrease compared with 1 week, 2 weeks, and 6 months of age (P< 0. 05). When connexin expression at the same age in male and female were compared, only 3 months group in male showed significant decrease than the same age group in female. Conclusions: Our {{data suggest that the}} expressions of connexin 43 mRNA in normal detrusor muscle cell showed age-related changes especially in male rats. Although it is difficult to interpret these findings at this stage, age should be considered as a possible compounding factor affecting connexin 43 expressions in male rats...|$|R
40|$|During {{composting}} {{of livestock}} manure, transformations {{of organic matter}} result in gaseous emissions, which can harm the environment. Two experiments were done in enclosures to measure the fluxes of NH 3, N 2 O, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 O emitted by 8 heaps of compost representing the range of biodegradability of nitrogen and carbon in the livestock manure. The heaps were monitored for the first 2 months, corresponding to the thermophilic phase during which nearly all-mass losses occur. Four parameters describe the NH 3 emission kinetics and the main influential factors were noted: (1) the response time to reach maximum intensity is affected mainly by the initial micro-flora; (2) the amplitude depends mainly on C biodegradability and also on micro-flora; (3) the emission duration depends mainly on N biodegradability; and (4) the cumulative emission, which varied from 16. 5 to 48. 9 % of the nitrogen initially present in the heap, depends both on C and N biodegradability. A predictive model for NH 3 and CO 2 emissions for the thermophilic phase of the composting of livestock manure is proposed. The variability in cumulative emissions of CO 2 and of NH 3 is well explained by the contents of soluble elements and hemicellulose in the dry matter (Van Soest fractioning), and soluble <b>nitrogen</b> (12 h <b>extraction</b> at 4 °C in water). In our conditions of favourable aeration and humidity, N 2 O and CH 4 emissions were low. The role of the biodegradable carbon in reducing NH 3 emission is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} rapid-solidification-processed many {{stainless}} steels by gas atomization and achieved strength improvements of over 50 % relative to conventionally-processed stainless steels with concomitant improvement in corrosion and oxidation behavior. These strength improvements are most pronounced after aging treatments when elevated concentrations of oxygen and vanadium {{are present in}} the stainless steel. An austenitic (FCC) stainless steel was prepared by gas atomization and consolidated by hot extrusion at 900 C. These specimens were heat treated for 1 hour at 1, 000 C and aged at 600 C for 500 hours. The microstructure of each alloy composition was observed in TEM with bright field imaging. After aging, most alloys showed the same precipitate morphology as before aging. An obvious change, however, was found only in the alloy with highest oxygen content. A high number density of 15 to 20 nm diameter precipitates was measured in this alloy. Moreover, with weak-beam dark field imaging, a very high number density of coherent, 6 to 10 nm diameter precipitates is observed throughout the matrix by Moire fringe contrast. An atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) investigation showed that FIM provides high contrast imaging the precipitates. In order to get a more global view of the structure, energy-filtered composition imaging on a LEO EM 912 was used to map the oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> in carbon <b>extraction</b> replicas of the aged specimens. These images confirm that the 18 nm precipitates are oxides, however, it appears that the 8 nm precipitates are not extracted...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Establish {{and compare}} {{the content of the}} total lipids in the liver, {{skeletal}} muscle, gill and brain pond carp active life condition and under artificial hibernation carbon. Methodology. The experiments were conducted on the Ukrainian scaly carp breed (Cyprinus caprio L.) weighing 250 – 270 g. To conduct research to form two groups (control — 5 copies of the fish and an experimental — each point hypobiosis exposure to 5 copies of the fish). Introduction of fish hypobiotically state conducted for the use of a patented model artificial hibernation. The selection of material performed by opening the first and second fish group on the 3, 6 and 24 hours of exposure, then it is frozen and stored in liquid <b>nitrogen.</b> Lipid <b>extraction</b> after homogenization of brain tissue, liver, skeletal muscle and gills was performed according to Folch. The content of the total lipids (from the weight of the dry residue) after extraction was determined using the gravimetric method. The separation into individual lipid fractions were determined thin layer chromatography by plates "Silufol". Quantitative determination of total phospholipids — hydroxamate method; cholesterol — colorimetric method with three ferric chlorides. All the results are treated variation-statistical method using the Student's t-tests. Findings. These results suggest that the content of total lipids, phospholipids and cholesterol in the tissues of the carp pond in the active state of life is significantly different. The content of the total lipids in the liver, skeletal muscle, gill and brain in a carp pond introducing carbon dioxide into a state of artificial hibernation (hypercapnic hypoxia-medium) is reduced in comparison with the control. Under these conditions, noted a slight increase in tissue phospholipids, as well as a significant increase in cholesterol and the coefficient (CL/PL), especially in the liver, indicating that the use of lipids in energy and adaptation processes. Originality. Lipid composition studied liver, skeletal muscle, gill and brain carp active life condition and carbon dioxide under artificial hibernation. The content of the total lipids in the tissues of the research carp throughout the exposition of artificial hibernation carbon dioxide decreases, indicating that the use of lipids in energy processes. The growth of the content of phospholipids and cholesterol in the tissues of the carp in the conditions of artificial hibernation carbon dioxide leads to the development of adaptive adaptation of organisms to the environment. Practical value. The results make it possible to assess the redistribution of lipids in fish tissue of the body due to changes in environmental conditions (artificial carbon hibernation) ...|$|R
40|$|Diglycolamide-functionalized calix[4]arenes (C 4 DGAs) {{with varying}} {{structural}} modifications were evaluated for actinide complexation from their extraction behavior toward actinide ions such as UO 22 +, Pu 4 +, PuO 22 +, and Am 3 + {{in the room}} temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1 -n-octyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide (C 8 mimNTf 2). The formation constants were calculated for Am 3 + which showed a significant role of ligand structure, nature of substituents, and spacer length. Although the alkyl substituents on the amidic <b>nitrogen</b> increase the <b>extraction</b> efficiency of americium at lower acidity because of the inductive effect of the alkyl groups, at higher acidity the steric crowding around the ligating site determines the extraction efficiency. All C 4 DGAs formed 1 : 1 complexes with Am 3 + while for the analogous Eu 3 + complexes no inner sphere water molecules were detected and the asymmetry of the metal ligand complex differed from one another as proved by time-resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLIFS). Thermodynamic studies indicated that the extraction process, predominant by the Am 3 +-C 4 DGA complexation reaction, is exothermic. The unique role of the medium on Am 3 + complexation with the C 4 DGA molecules with varying spacer length, L-IV and L-V, was noticed {{for the first time}} with a reversal in the trend observed in the RTIL compared to that seen in a nonpolar molecular diluent like n-dodecane. Various factors leading to a more preorganized structure were responsible for favorable metal ion complexation. The solvent systems show promise to be employed for nuclear waste remediation, and sustainability options were evaluated from radiolytic stability as well as stripping studies...|$|R
40|$|Northern {{wetlands}} contain ≈ 30 % of the world’s terrestrial carbon store, {{resulting from}} the incomplete decomposition of plant material inhibited because oxygen diffusion is limited by water saturation of the soil. While this behaviour results in a sink for CO 2, anaerobic pathways of decomposition result in wetlands being a large, but variable, source of CH 4. Northern wetlands tend to be nitrogen-impoverished, therefore they are not {{an important source of}} N 2 O. However, <b>nitrogen</b> deposition, peat <b>extraction,</b> and other land-use changes have the potential to alter their greenhouse gas (GHG) sink/source function. Until recently, most of the studies on the atmosphere-biosphere exchange of greenhouse gases from northern wetlands were short-term and seasonal. In 1998 the Peatland Carbon Study began continuous measurements of the carbon dynamics of a northern peatland and developed several ecosystem models to be used in simulations of the response of peatlands to climate variability and change. The continuous measurements have established the dominant role of climate variability in determining the magnitude and sign of the fluxes of GHGs. The Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS) was developed to use either direct measurements or modeled climate from a land surface process model such as the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) which has been modi- fied to incorporate the physical attributes of wetlands as inputs. PCARS illustrates the relative importance of various components of the ecosystem in determining the interannual variability in GHG exchange. Evaluation of PCARS has helped identify significant gaps in our knowledge of peatland systems. A second, more phenomenological model, the Peat Accumulation Model (PAM), demonstrates the overall importance of precipitation in controlling decadal to millennial scale variations in sink/source strength of CO 2. The Canadian Global Coupled Climate Carbon Model (CGC 3 M) Network is attempting to parameterize wetland processes for the inclusion in a global terrestrial ecosystem model for climate simulations, but it is a significant challenge to develop an efficient, yet realistic, wetland simulator for global scale modelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{radionuclide}} {{of uranium}} (U) is major radionuclide {{contained in the}} long life of high level radioactive liquid waste (HLLW) generated from reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The radioactive waste have to be treated to ready for long term disposal.   Separation of  the U at high efficiencies greatly lowers {{the volume of the}} long life alpha radioactive waste to be disposed and decreases the hazard level of the waste. The technology assessment of selective separation of U was carried-out as alternative and strategy for HLLW management in the future. The selective separation technology of  U  from fission products at very high efficiencies was developed by the extraction process using TBP-kerosene solvent and increasing the separation by exposure of nitrogen (N 2) laser radiation at wavelength 337. 1 nm.   In the extraction process for simulation waste containing U and Zr in 5 M HNO 3 (Zr as one of fission product which difficult to be separated from U)   using 30 % TBP-kerosene solvent and by exposure of nitrogen laser radiation shows that  increasing of distribution coefficient of U (Kd U) can obtains 135 %  and  increasing of separation factor of U and Zr (SF (U/Zr)) is 189 %. The increasing of Kd U using N 2 laser higher than using CO 2 laser (at the wave-number 944 cm - 1) which increase of Kd U only 100 %. In Indonesia, assessment for adaptation of the separation technology by extraction for separation of U process using 30 % TBP-kerosene solvent should be carried-out as alternative for treatment the HLLW generated from 99 Mo radioisotope production and from post irradiation examination of nuclear fuel. doi: [URL] [How to cite this article : Gunandjar, G.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of atmospheric CO 2 {{is now one}} third higher than {{it was during the}} eighteenth century, and significantly increased during the last several hundred thousand years. CO 2 concentration is causing substantial warming and other changes in global climate by altering the heat and water balances of Earth’s surface and atmosphere. Today, scientists, engineers, and researchers on the carbon cycle are working not only {{to be sure that the}} experiment is adequately documented, but also to provide information and tools that can be properly managed. The challenge of controlling atmosphere CO 2 level is a topic of expanding public concern, national policies, and international agreement. The importance of soil dynamics on the organic carbon cycle has been outlined to remark that the soil system may capture and reserve almost 16 % of the global CO 2 emissions. It is therefore important to have a wide knowledge of which are the soil compartments having a high potential for carbon sequestration. The present work is associated to the life project “De-urbanizing and recovering the ecological functioning of the coastal systems of La Pletera” and reports the first preliminary results in order to verify the carbon sequestration potential of different areas either altered by anthropic activities or having a proper and natural ecological development. The main question arisen is the convenience to maintain saltmarsh coastal systems and demonstrate that these areas are strong contributors of soil organic carbon storage, instead of disregard in favour of new land use. It is known that the saltmarsh ecosystems may retain until 37 % of organic carbon due its peculiar dynamics of wet-dry cycles. Similarly, organic agriculture and pastureland may also be consistent in preserving organic carbon in soil if adequately managed. Six soil environments were selected in the whole area of study such as: Ruderal (RU); soil under Elymus elymoides (ELY); soil under Arthrocnemum fruticosum (SAAR); soil under Salicornia patula (SAER); soil under corn cultivation (AGR); soil under pasture (PAS) and soil samples collected at three depths (0 - 5 cm, 5 - 20 cm, and 20 - 40 cm) in order to differentiate the development of soil properties along profiles. Soil characterization included mineralogical and physical analyses such as texture and structural stability of aggregates, determined in order to compare the resistance of the various soils to degradation, together with soil chemical characteristics such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Soil organic carbon (SOC), Soil extractable carbon (FA&HA), Total <b>nitrogen</b> (TN), <b>Extraction</b> of easily extractable glomalin (EE-GRSP), Extraction of total glomalin (GRSP), Dissolve organic carbon (DOC), and soil respiration. Results clearly showed that SAAR soil was the most adequate to preserve organic carbon as it showed the highest clay content, structural stability, glomalin and soil organic carbon, whilst the carbon loss by respiration was the lowest among the other soils. Similarly, the mineralization coefficient of SAAR soil was 1360 %, 1220 %, 580 %, 360 %, 280 % lower than AGR, SAER, PAS, RU and ELY respectively. This trend provided a twofold information, on the one end the agricultural soil should be managed differently as it showed a large carbon loss with respect to the carbon content; on the other hand the carbon lost by the SAER soil which should has been apparently a suitable carbon sink was absolutely inadequate to preserve organic carbon. The overall results of this work should be used for eventual soil restoration practices at the Pleter...|$|R
