40|$|Abstract. Managing the {{configuration}} of heterogeneous enterprise security mechanisms is a wholly complex task. The effectiveness of a configuration may be constrained by poor understanding and/or management of the overall security policy requirements, which may, in turn, unnecessarily expose the enterprise to known threats. This paper proposes a threat management approach, whereby knowledge {{about the effectiveness of}} mitigating countermeasures is used to guide the autonomic configuration of security mechanisms. This knowledge is modeled in terms of Semantic Threat Graphs, a variation of the traditional Threat/Attack Tree, extended in order to relate semantic information about security configuration with threats, vulnerabilities and countermeasures. An ontology-based approach to representing and reasoning over this knowledge is taken. A case study on <b>Network</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Controls</b> demonstrates how threats can be analyzed and how automated configuration recommendations can be made based on catalogues of best-practice countermeasures. ...|$|R
40|$|Computing {{facilities}} networked {{together but}} controlled by different administrations pose {{a problem of}} <b>access</b> <b>control.</b> Who decides who can use what? We specify a formal model for an <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system which allows users and services from different administrations {{to communicate with each}} other, while still allowing the administrators to retain control of their own parts of the network. The model, written in the Z specification language, has been developed as the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system for ADMIRAL, though it is not specific to ADMIRAL. It provides a framework for administrators to build <b>access</b> <b>control</b> systems to meet their differing requirements. A system based on the model would allow users to log in to a distributed computing system and to make requests for services in any part of the system, without having to provide any more information about themselves. After this initial log in all subsequent <b>access</b> <b>control</b> decisions are handled automatically, and remain invisible to the user unless access is refused. We also discuss the experience we have had animating this model in Prolog. KEY WORDS <b>Networks</b> <b>Access</b> <b>control</b> Formal model Z specification Prolog 1. Objectives of the Model In a conventionally organized network, very little attention is paid to <b>access</b> <b>control</b> on a network-wide basis. Usually individual machines provide their own facilities. This can lead to frustration both for users and for administrators; users are continually faced with log-in prompts, and administrators have to control a multitude of tables on different machines. Most <b>access</b> <b>control</b> schemes designed for networks are based around a centralized service, or are controlled by a single administration. These fail to address the problems associated with <b>access</b> <b>control</b> in a multi-administration network. In such a <b>network,</b> several autonomous <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system (ACSs) have to interact. The model described here has been developed as the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system for project ADMIRAL.

40|$|Abstract—Systems and <b>networks</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> {{configuration}} {{are usually}} analyzed independently {{although they are}} logically combined to define the end-to-end security property. While systems and applications security policies define <b>access</b> <b>control</b> based on user identity or group, request type and the requested resource, network security policies uses flow information such as host and service addresses for source and destination to define <b>access</b> <b>control.</b> Therefore, both <b>network</b> and systems <b>access</b> <b>control</b> have to be configured consistently in order to enforce endto-end security policies. Many previous research attempt to verify either side separately, {{but it does not}} provide a unified approach to automatically validate the logical consistency between both of them. Thus, using existing techniques requires error-prone manual and ad-hoc analysis to validate this link. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layer modeling and verification system that can analyze the configurations and policies across both application and network components as a single unit. It combines policies from different devices as firewalls, NAT, routers and IPSec gateways as well as basic RBACbased policies of higher service layers. This allows analyzing, for example, firewall polices in the context of application <b>access</b> <b>control</b> and vice versa. Thus, by incorporating policies across the network and over multiple layers, we provide a true endto-end configuration verification tool. Our model represents the system as a state machine where packet header, service request and location determine the state and transitions that conform with the configuration, device operations, and packet values are established. We encode the model as Boolean functions using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We used an extended version of computational tree logic (CTL) to provide more useful operators and then use it with symbolic model checking to prove or find counter examples to needed properties. The tool is implemented and we gave special consideration to efficiency and scalability. I...|$|R

40|$|While {{traditional}} {{network security}} {{policies have been}} enforced by manual configuration of individual network components such as router ACLs, firewalls, NATs and VLANs, emerging enterprise network designs and products support global policies declared over high level abstractions [2, 1, 14, 13]. We further the evolution of simpler and more powerful network security mechanisms by designing, implementing, and testing a flow-based network security policy language and enforcement infrastructure. Our policy language, FSL, expresses basic <b>network</b> <b>access</b> <b>controls,</b> directionality in communication establishment (similar to NAT), network isolation (similar to VLANs), communication paths, and rate limits. FSL supports modular construction, distributed authorship, and efficient implementation. We have implemented FSL as the primary policy language for NOX, a network-wide control platform, and have deployed it within an operational network for over 10 months. We describe how supporting complex policy objectives and meeting the demanding performance requirements of network-wide policy enforcement have influenced the FSL language design and implementation. ...|$|R
