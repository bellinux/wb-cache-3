It is an analysis based on observation data collected with 29 public wholesalers in Brazil in 2009 with information on origin and destination of traded horticultural, such as warehouses, from a significant sample. Systemic patterns can be observed through two aspects: the performance of economic activity of main Brazilian wholesalers warehouses and remaining functions of assembly and distribution of local and regional productions.

40|$|In January 2002 all {{consumers}} in New South Wales and Victoria gained {{the ability to}} exercise choice of their retail electricity supplier. This introduction of 'full retail competition' is {{the final stage of}} the reform process that began in Australia in 1991. Over the course of the 1990 s the electricity industry has been radically reformed in terms of its structure {{and the manner in which}} it delivers electricity. Vertically integrated companies have been separated, a <b>national</b> <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> established, retail choice introduced and in some cases state owned assets pnvatised. From the point of view of consumers, however, it is the introduction of retail competition in the mass market that provides the most visible change to the manner in which they deal with the supply of electricity. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of retail competition in electricity and the cost and benefits of its implementation. In particular the potential benefits will be identified, both to consumers and to the creation of a dynamic industry that provides for an optimal allocation of resources. In the first section the general background to the reform of the Australian electricity industry is given. In the following section the benefits to {{consumers in}} terms of electricity pricing are noted. In the third section the costs of retail competition are identified and in the final section some of the dynamic benefits of retail competition are analysed. [Introduction...|$|E
40|$|Two {{trends in}} the {{development}} field slow resolving small farmers' difficult entry into marketplaces. The first is that in seeking to enhance small farmer competitiveness, analysts and policy makers tend to look towards production rather than marketing improvements, missing growth linkages to other sectors in which farmers become embedded through their marketing activities. The second is that where marketing is considered, there {{tends to be a}} disproportionate focus on non-traditional crops grown for specialty export markets. This paper analyzes how small farmers from the Las Pilas region of El Salvador competed against imports to become potato, cabbage and tomato suppliers to wholesalers in the <b>national</b> <b>wholesale</b> <b>market,</b> the Tiendona. Enduring relationships with buyers in the wholesale market created opportunities and pressures for Las Pilas farmers to market and produce a diversity of crops over the course of 25 years and stimulate linked sectors of their local economy. This type of hands-on, tacit learning about marketing contrasts with 1) supply-driven assistance programs aimed at improving production and; 2) being informed about marketing opportunities by a broker. The analysis suggests that farmer learning through marketing is as important to success in production as learning about production directly. The Tiendona is flooded by Guatemalan and Honduran tomatoes. Long-standing sourcing arrangements between Salvadoran wholesalers and Guatemalan and Honduran growers were altered by small wholesalers' collective actions pressuring the marketplace administration to cede vending space to them. Las Pilas small farmers were then able to enter the marketplace as suppliers to the small wholesalers. The Tiendona's public, contested nature contrasts with export marketing channels where there are few public pressure points to influence marketplace policies and buyers' sourcing decisions. Power asymmetries and coordination problems between producers and buyers can dissuade production. The case examined here finds robust marketing relationships between small wholesalers and small farmers driving crop diversification and production and marketing success. by Daniel J. Moss.

40|$|Lyons, Robert E. Trial {{gardens are}} {{research}} tools {{for the evaluation}} of a diverse array of different plants, depending upon the objectives of the researcher. Many institutions have trial gardens, and each has its own, specific reasons for including them in their research programs. Plant breeding companies, commercial growers, colleges and universities, and public gardens and arboreta are all trial garden stakeholders, with each a key player in the evaluation process from initial plant introduction to homeowner installation. Through both quantitative and qualitative methods, this current research aimed to create a holistic view of trial gardens and what they mean to the horticulture industry. Survey data offered insights into current trial garden trends and helped to identify advantages and disadvantages of different trial garden stakeholders. The majority (54 %) of survey respondents indicated that the main advantage to having trials at public gardens and arboreta was the opportunity to educate visitors about the best plants to grow in their region, and 74 % of respondents agreed that it is important for public gardens and arboreta to have plant trialing as part of their mission. However, respondents also indicated a decline in the amount of plant material being sent to public gardens for trialing in the last five years. Interviews with stakeholder organizations shed light on this recent industry shift and helped to identify a new model for the future. Two levels of trial garden stakeholders emerged from the research. The first, breeding companies and commercial growers, conducted trials for a <b>national,</b> <b>wholesale</b> <b>market,</b> while the second, universities and public gardens, primarily focused on a regional, retail market. The process of trialing traditional annual bedding plants compared with herbaceous perennials has several distinctions as well, including minimum evaluation time and space required. Establishing and accommodating these differences helped to recognize ways in which public garden trials can have the most effective influence on the retail market. A recommendation for collaboration between public gardens and retail garden centers was presented herein based on key findings from interviews and survey results. Because visitors were often frustrated that they could not find public garden trial winners at their local garden center, a proposition arose that encouraged partnerships between public gardens, local retail garden centers, and local nurseries. Together, these organizations can grow, promote, and sell trial winners while boosting the local green industry. Ultimately, this elucidated the connection among the various trial garden stakeholders while offering strategies for public gardens and arboreta to play a more meaningful role in, and have a positive influence on, their regional horticulture industry.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} debate about how supply-side policy initiatives might potentially affect key participants within the National Electricity Market (NEM) {{in attempts to}} curb growth in carbon emissions. Most debate and analysis within this sector has focused on assessing the impact that a 2 ̆ 7 cap-and-trade 2 ̆ 7 carbon trading scheme, and more recently, a carbon tax scheme, may have on promoting fuel-switching strategies and impacts on existing electricity generating assets each having a defined set of carbon emission intensity factors. The introduction of a carbon price signal achieves this by changing marginal cost relativities {{in order to promote}} increased dispatch and investment in less carbon-emission-intensive types of generation technologies, including gas-fired generation and renewable generation technologies. As Australia transitions towards a carbon-constrained economy, alternative policy settings create signals throughout the national electricity industry. To evaluate policy outcomes a model containing many of the salient features of the <b>national</b> <b>wholesale</b> electricity <b>market</b> is required. These features include intra-regional and inter-state trade, realistic transmission network pathways, and competitive dispatch of all generation technologies with price determination based upon variable cost and branch congestion characteristics...|$|R

The <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> system regulated by the WML and considered as a main fish marketing channel has reduced its function and role in the recent decades. It was caused by an appearance of large scale fish suppliers and consumers such as supermarkets which play the role in fixing price, classifying equal quality, and ensuring a constant supply. In addition, {{the volume of the}} fisheries products handled at the <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> is decreased, while a competition between <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> and the outsiders is increased. At the same time, many wholesalers and middle-wholesalers in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are also having financial difficulties. The principle on the marketing method of the WML has been differed expandedly from the recent trend of business style. The WML was amended in 1999 for the purpose of negotiation behavior if the wholesalers that should be changed in term of bargaining power enabling the wholesalers to have more ability to compete in fresh food merchandise.

40|$|In the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China (PRC), since 1978 {{when the}} Communist Party adapted the {{political}} resolution on promoting economic reform and liberalization at the Third Plenary Session of the 11 th General Committee held in Beijing, three laws were {{enacted by the}} central government regarding the establishment and operation of whole sale markets for agricultural products and fair trade markets for foodstuff. These laws have become widespread and now apply to <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> in big cities and fair trade markets in most residential areas, all over the PRC. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the character of the three laws by comparing them with the Japan 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 Central <b>Wholesale</b> <b>Market</b> Law 2 ̆ 7 which was enacted by the Japanese Diet in 1971. The first law is the 2 ̆ 7 Administrative Act on Fair Trade Markets in Urban and Rural Areas 2 ̆ 7, which was enacted in 1983. This law has played a significant role in the establishment and administration of the fair trade markets. Furthermore, to a certain degree it also had directive function on <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> set up. However, this act doesn 2 ̆ 7 t include provisions for the management of <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> yet. The second law is the 2 ̆ 7 Register Administrative Act on Commodity Trade Markets 2 ̆ 7, which was enacted in 1993 and revised in 1996. Under this act, commodity trade markets have been established and pay tax for operation of the retail business. The third law is the 2 ̆ 7 Administrative Act on <b>Wholesale</b> <b>Markets</b> 2 ̆ 7 which was enacted in 1994. This is the first act on <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> in the PRC. It not only gives a definition of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets,</b> but also detailed regulations on establishment, administration and the operation of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets,</b> trading and fostering dealers, etc. This act is regarded as a symbol of agricultural products marketing system that is shifting from quantity growth to quality improvement. A comparison of the present situation of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> with this act indicated that this act will play important roles in the aspects of (1) separation of administrator, investor and manager, (2) classification between <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> and fair trade <b>markets,</b> central <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> and local <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets,</b> (3) unitary permission procedures, (4) fostering dealers, (5) improvement of <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> information, and so on. Therefore, this act will contribute to the development of agricultural produce <b>wholesale</b> <b>marketing</b> system and price stability at the <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> level in the PRC. 以上のように,卸売市場の開設と運営に関連しながら,中国における農産物流通制度の改革の中で集貿市場の復活拡大と卸売市場の出現発展,それらにかかわっている三つの卸売市場法規の目的と内容を明らかにし,特に卸売市場の開設･運営の実態と「卸売市場に関する管理弁法」との乖離点及びこの「弁法」の意義を検討してきた. こうした検討を通じて,以下のようなことが明らかになったといえるであろう. (1) 1983 年の「都市と農村における集市貿易に関する管理弁法」は集貿市場の開設と管理に重要な役割を果たし,卸売市場にも一時期役に立った. しかし,卸売市場の運営について同「弁法」は言及していない. (2) 1993 年に制定, 1996 年に改正された「商品取引市場の登録管理に関する弁法」は,すべての商品交易市場対して登録管理法規として役割を果たしたが, 1993 年以来,同弁法によって種々の市場管理体制が強化されてきた. (3) 「卸売市場に関する管理弁法」は,中国初の卸売市場に関する法規であり,卸売市場の開設,そして市場管理,市場運営,取引方法,取扱業者の育成など諸方面について詳しく定めている. この弁法は中国の卸売市場整備上,量的発展段階から質的整備段階へと転換していく標識として位置付けられている. 実際には,卸売市場の設立,運営の実態との比較によって,同弁法は①卸売市場の管理者,投資者及び経営者の分離,②卸売市場と集貿市場,中央卸売市場と地方卸売市場の区分,③卸売市場開設の許可手続きの簡素化,④取扱業者の経営能力養成,及び⑤卸売市場情報システムの改善等について重要な役割を発揮しているであろう. 以上の改善を通じて,同「弁法」が農産物流通の円滑化と価格安定に大きく貢献していくことが期待される...|$|R
