25|$|As {{the head}} of a family, Hazlitt was <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> in need of money. Through William Godwin, with whom he was {{frequently}} in touch, he obtained a commission to write an English grammar, published on 11 November 1809 as A New and Improved Grammar of the English Tongue. Another project that came his way was the work that was published as Memoirs of the Late Thomas Holcroft, a compilation of autobiographical writing by the recently deceased playwright, novelist, and radical political activist, together with additional material by Hazlitt himself. Though completed in 1810, this work did not {{see the light of day}} until 1816, and so provided no financial gain to satisfy the needs of a young husband and father. Hazlitt in the meantime had not forsaken his painterly ambitions. His environs at Winterslow afforded him opportunities for landscape painting, and he spent considerable time in London procuring commissions for portraits.|$|E

Bessie Braddock is commemorated in Liverpool by the statue in Lime Street Station, {{and by a}} blue plaque erected at her modest home in ZigZag Road. In a 2014 Fabian Society essay the Labour MP Lisa Nandy wrote that Bessie [...] "brought her experiences {{of life in the}} slums of Liverpool right into the heart of Westminster. <b>Now,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> we need the voices of working women to be heard in parliament".|$|E

Perry chose to release it as a standalone track rather than save it for her album [...] "because <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> {{there is a need}} for our world to unite". NBC also felt its message spoke [...] "directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes" [...] for its inspirational themes. The song reached number one in Australia and number eleven in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Prism {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "Perry and her longtime collaborators Dr. Luke and Max Martin often go for a darker, moodier intimacy à la high-end Swedish divas Robyn and Lykke Li. Perry has always {{done a great job}} of letting us know she's in on the joke of pop stardom. Sadly, she doesn't always bring that same sense of humor and self-awareness to the joke of pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that [...] "Katy's superpower, <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational..... Now she grasps that she's making the mainstream, not just swimming in it".|$|E
500|$|... "Anticipating" [...] is a teen pop and dance-pop {{that lasts}} {{for three minutes}} and 16 seconds. Corey Moss of MTV noted the song also has a 1970s disco sound, while Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{compared}} it to early Madonna tracks such as [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983). Glenn Gamboa of Newsday compared the song to Janet Jackson's [...] "All for You", calling it [...] "pleasant, shimmering R-styled pop". According to the sheetmusic published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is composed in the key of F major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 112 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans from the low-key of F3 to the high-note of A4. The song has a basic sequence of B(9)–C–Dm7–B(9) as its chord progression. Lyrically, it talks about friendship and camaraderie between women. During the bridge, Spears sings, [...] "Gotta really {{let me know if}} you want me / You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy". During the time of the album's release, her official site stated that [...] "the girl-power anthem 'Anticipating' proves that Britney is, <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> {{a force to be reckoned}} with." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas {{was waiting at the}} hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E

2500|$|During World War I, {{opinions}} of Japanese Canadians improved slightly. They {{were seen as}} an ally of the United Kingdom and some Japanese Canadians enlisted in the Canadian Forces. On the home front, many businesses began hiring groups that had been underrepresented in the workforce (including women, Japanese immigrants, and Yugoslavian and Italian refugees who had fled to Canada during the war) to help fill the increasing demands of Britain and its allies overseas. Businesses {{that had previously been}} opposed to doing so were now more than happy to hire Japanese Canadians as there was [...] "more than enough work for all". However, {{at the end of the}} war, soldiers returning home to find their jobs filled by others, including Japanese immigrants, were outraged.

Congress should make comprehensive data privacy and cybercrime legislation a top priority." [...] Marcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days. He expressed concerns that they may have had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology said, [...] "Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing login information from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information." [...] Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted {{in a way that was}} fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach. Katie Szpyrka, a long time user of LinkedIn from Illinois, United States, filed a $5 million lawsuit against LinkedIn, complaining that the company did not keep their promises to secure connections and databases. Erin O’Harra, a spokeswoman working for LinkedIn, when asked about the lawsuit, said that lawyers were looking to take advantage of that situation to again propose the bills SOPA and PIPA in the United States Congress. [...] An amended complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2012 on behalf of Szpyrka and another premium LinkedIn user from Virginia, United States, named Khalilah Gilmore–Wright, as class representatives for all LinkedIn users who were affected by the breach.
