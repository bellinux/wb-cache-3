40|$|Superconducting, flux-based qubits are {{promising}} {{candidates for the}} construction of a large scale quantum computer. We present an explicit quantum mechanical calculation of the coherent behavior of a flux based quantum bit in a noisy experimental environment such as an integrated circuit containing bias and control electronics. We show that <b>non-thermal</b> <b>noise</b> sources, such as bias current fluctuations and magnetic coupling to nearby active control circuits, will cause decoherence of a flux-based qubit on a timescale comparable to recent experimental coherence time measurements.

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{simulations}} and by experiments on aggregation of gliding bacteria, we study {{a model of}} the collective dynamics of self-propelled hard rods on a substrate in two dimensions. The rods have finite size, interact via excluded volume and their dynamics is overdamped by the interaction with the substrate. Starting from a microscopic model with <b>non-thermal</b> <b>noise</b> sources, a continuum description of the system is derived. The hydrodynamic equations are then used to characterize the possible steady states of the systems and their stability {{as a function of the}} particles packing fraction and the speed of self propulsion.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the fluctuation {{spectrum of the}} shape of a lipid vesicle or cell exposed to a nonthermal source of noise. In particular we take into account constraints on the membrane area and the volume of fluid that it encapsulates when obtaining expressions for the dependency of the membrane tension on the noise. We then investigate three possible origins of the <b>non-thermal</b> <b>noise</b> taken from the literature: A direct force, which models an external medium pushing on the membrane. A curvature force, which models a fluctuating spontaneous curvature, and a permeation force coming from an active transport of fluid through the membrane. For the direct force and curvature force cases, we compare our results to existing experiments on active membranes. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 1 supplementary materia...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} how active forces modeled as <b>non-thermal</b> random <b>noise</b> affect the average dynamical properties of a Rouse polymer. As the power {{spectrum of the}} noise is not known we keep the analytical treatment as generic as possible and then present results for {{a few examples of}} active noise. We discuss the connection between our results and recent experimental studies of dynamics of labeled DNA telomeres in living cells, and propose new chromatin tracking experiments that will allow one to determine the statistical properties of the active forces associated with chromatin remodeling processes...|$|R
40|$|Magnetotactic {{bacteria}} possess organelles called magnetosomes that confer {{a magnetic}} {{moment on the}} cells, resulting in their partial alignment with external magnetic fields. Here we show that analysis of the trajectories of cells exposed to an external magnetic field {{can be used to}} measure the average magnetic dipole moment of a cell population in at least five different ways. We apply this analysis to movies of Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB- 1 cells, and compare the values of the magnetic moment obtained in this way to that obtained by direct measurements of magnetosome dimension from electron micrographs. We find that methods relying on the viscous relaxation of the cell orientation give results comparable to that obtained by magnetosome measurements, whereas methods relying on statistical mechanics assumptions give systematically lower values of the magnetic moment. Since the observed distribution of magnetic moments in the population is not sufficient to explain this discrepancy, our results suggest that <b>non-thermal</b> random <b>noise</b> is present in the system, implying that a magnetotactic bacterial population should not be considered as similar to a paramagnetic material...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{different}} {{definitions of}} pressure {{for a system}} of active spherical particles driven by a <b>non-thermal</b> coloured <b>noise.</b> We show that mechanical, kinetic and free-energy based approaches lead to the same result up to first order in the non-equilibrium expansion parameter. The first prescription {{is based on a}} generalisation of the kinetic mesoscopic virial equation and expresses the pressure exerted on the walls in terms of the average of the virial of the inter-particle forces. In the second approach, the pressure and the surface tension are identified with the volume and area derivatives, respectively, of the partition function associated with the known stationary non-equilibrium distribution of the model. The third method is a mechanical approach and is related to the work necessary to deform the system. The pressure is obtained by comparing the expression of the work in terms of local stress and strain with the corresponding expression in terms of microscopic distribution. This is determined from the force balance encoded in the Born-Green-Yvon equation. Such a method has the advantage of giving a formula for the local pressure tensor and the surface tension even in inhomogeneous situations. By direct inspection, we show that the three procedures lead to the same values of the pressure, and give support to the idea that the partition function, obtained via the unified coloured noise approximation, is more than a formal property of the system, but determines the stationary non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the model...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method for}} performing a robust Bayesian analysis of non-Gaussianity present in pulsar timing data, simultaneously with the pulsar timing model, and additional stochastic parameters such as those describing red spin noise and dispersion measure variations. The parameters used to define the presence of non-Gaussianity are zero for Gaussian processes, giving a simple method of defining the strength of non-Gaussian behaviour. We use simulations to show that assuming Gaussian statistics when the noise in the data is drawn from a non-Gaussian distribution can significantly increase the uncertainties associated with the pulsar timing model parameters. We then apply the method to the publicly available 15 year Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data release 1 dataset for the binary pulsar J 0437 $-$ 4715. In this analysis we present a significant detection of non-Gaussianity in the uncorrelated <b>non-thermal</b> <b>noise,</b> but we find {{that it does not}} yet impact the timing model or stochastic parameter estimates significantly compared to analysis performed assuming Gaussian statistics. The methods presented are, however, shown to be of immediate practical use for current European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) datasets.

40|$|The L-band {{radiometry}} {{data and}} in-situ ground and snow measurements performed during the 2016 / 2017 winter campaign at the Davos-Laret remote sensing field laboratory are presented and discussed. An improved {{version of the}} procedure for the computation of L-band brightness temperatures from ELBARA radiometer raw data is introduced. This procedure includes a thorough explanation of the calibration and filtering including a refined radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation approach. This new mitigation approach not only performs better than conventional “normality” tests (kurtosis and skewness) but also allows for the quantification of measurement uncertainty introduced by <b>non-thermal</b> <b>noise</b> contributions. The brightness temperatures of natural snow covered areas and areas with a reflector beneath the snow are simulated for varying amounts of snow liquid water content distributed across the snow profile. Both measured and simulated brightness temperatures emanating from natural snow covered areas and areas with a reflector beneath the snow reveal noticeable sensitivity with respect to snow liquid water. This indicates the possibility of estimating snow liquid water using L-band radiometry. It is also shown that distinct daily increases in brightness temperatures measured over the areas with the reflector placed on the ground indicate {{the onset of the}} snow melting season, also known as “early-spring snow”...|$|E
40|$|The Dicke model {{describes}} the coherent interaction of a laser-driven ensemble of two level atoms with a quantized light field. It is realized within cavity QED experiments, which {{in addition to}} the coherent Dicke dynamics feature dissipation due to e. g. atomic spontaneous emission and cavity photon loss. Spontaneous emission supports the uncorrelated decay of individual atomic excitations as well as the enhanced, collective decay of an excitation that is shared by N atoms and whose strength is determined by the cavity geometry. We derive a many-body master equation for the dissipative Dicke model including both spontaneous emission channels and analyze its dynamics on the basis of Heisenberg-Langevin and stochastic Bloch equations. We find that the collective loss channel leads to a region of bistability between the empty and the superradiant state. Transitions between these states are driven by <b>non-thermal,</b> markovian <b>noise.</b> The interplay between dissipative and coherent elements leads to a genuine non-equilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime, which is expressed via a non-conservative force and a multiplicative noise kernel appearing in the stochastic Bloch equations. We present a semiclassical approach, based on stochastic nonlinear optical Bloch equations, which for the infinite-range Dicke Model become exact in the large-N-limit. The absence of an effective free energy functional, however, necessitates to include fluctuation corrections with O(1 /N) for finite N<∞ to locate the non-thermal first-order phase transition between the superradiant and the empty cavity...|$|R
