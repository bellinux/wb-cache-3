5|$|On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Nominally, the pact was a <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty,</b> but it {{included}} a secret protocol {{in which the}} independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were divided into spheres of interest, with Finland falling to the Soviet sphere of interest.|$|E
5|$|At first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet {{diplomatic}} {{hints that}} Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty.</b> Although the treaty {{is known as}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

5|$|Between 1938 and 1940, {{following}} German–Italian mediation in the First and Second Vienna Awards, and the Hungarian {{invasion of}} Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary enlarged its territory. It absorbed parts of southern Czechoslovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia {{and the northern}} part of Transylvania, which the Kingdom of Romania ceded. One of the ethno-cultural areas that changed hands between Romania and Hungary at this time was the Székely Land. The support that Hungary received from Germany for these border revisions meant that {{the relationship between the two}} countries became even closer. On 20 November 1940, Hungary formally joined the Axis Tripartite Pact. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the Prime Minister, Count Pál Teleki, Hungary concluded a friendship and <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not, as Germany's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. After the Yugoslav military coup of 27 March 1941, when the Germans asked the Hungarian Regent, Miklós Horthy, for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using Hungarian territory, Teleki was unable to dissuade the Regent. Concluding that Hungary had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with the Germans against the Yugoslavs, Teleki shot himself. Horthy informed Hitler that evening that Hungary would abide by the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia, though it would likely cease to apply should Croatia secede and Yugoslavia cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|The 1174 peace did {{not deal}} with the long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis, however, and these resurfaced during the late 1170s. The two kings now began to compete for control of Berry, a prosperous region of value to both kings. Henry had some rights to western Berry, but in 1176 announced an extraordinary claim that he had agreed in 1169 to give Richard's fiancée Alice the whole province {{as part of the}} marriage settlement. If Louis accepted this, it would have implied that the Berry was Henry's to give away in the first place, and would have given Henry the right to occupy it on Richard's behalf. To put additional pressure on Louis, Henry mobilised his armies for war. The papacy intervened and, probably as Henry had planned, the two kings were encouraged to sign a <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> in September 1177, under which they promised to undertake a joint crusade. The ownership of the Auvergne and parts of the Berry were put to an arbitration panel, which reported in favour of Henry; Henry followed up this success by purchasing La Marche from the local count. This expansion of Henry's empire once again threatened French security and promptly put the new peace at risk.|$|E
25|$|Basis Nord was {{a secret}} naval base of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in Zapadnaya Litsa Bay, west of Murmansk {{provided}} by the Soviet Union. The base {{was part of a}} partnership that developed between Germany and the Soviet Union following German-Soviet <b>Non-Aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> of 1939, along with a broad economic agreement of 1940.|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} {{appeared to}} be stable for the Baltic states. The Soviet Union {{was not a significant}} threat as Joseph Stalins rise to power was underway, and the state retreated to the Socialism in one country ideology. The Soviets signed <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties</b> with their neighbor states between 1926-1933, including Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Poland.|$|R
50|$|In January 1934 Germany {{signed a}} non {{aggression}} pact with Poland {{followed by a}} trade treaty later in the year. By the spring Hitler was openly pondering what inducements {{he might have to}} offer to obtain a military alliance with Poland. Between 1919 and 1939 Poland pursued a policy of balance between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and obtained <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties</b> with the former.|$|R
50|$|The forcible {{annexation}} of the Baltic states was an illegal act under both customary and conventional international law. Under customary law the annexation violated {{the basic principles}} such as state sovereignty and independence, the prohibition against violent seizure of territory and the prohibition against intervention. In conventional law {{the actions of the}} Soviet Union violated practically every provision of every major convention between the Soviet Union and the respective Baltic states. The Secret Protocols with Germany was a violation of Article 2 of the Estonian and Latvian <b>Non-Aggression</b> <b>treaties.</b> The threat to use force and the ultimatum to conclude the Treaties of Mutual Assistance violated the spirit and letter of the respective Peace <b>Treaties,</b> the <b>Non-Aggression</b> <b>Treaties,</b> the Conciliation Conventions, the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Protocol for the Renunciation of War. The Soviet action in the military occupation, forcible intervention and annexation constituted an act of aggression within the meaning of Article 2 of the Conventions for the Definition of Aggression of 1933, nor was there any justification according to Article 3 and the Annex of that same convention.|$|R
25|$|The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 {{established}} a <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union {{with a secret}} protocol describing how Poland and the Baltic countries would be divided between them. In the Invasion of Poland of 1939 the two powers invaded and partitioned Poland, and in June 1940 the Soviet Union also occupied Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} argued that Molotov continued the talks with Britain and France {{to stimulate the}} Germans into making an offer of a <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> and that the triple alliance failed because of the Soviet determination to conclude a pact with Germany. Another {{point of view is}} that the Soviet's pursuit of a triple alliance was sincere and that the Soviet government turned to Germany only when an alliance with the Western powers proved impossible.|$|E
25|$|Some critics, such as Viktor Suvorov, {{claim that}} Stalin's primary motive for signing the Soviet–German <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> was Stalin's {{calculation}} {{that such a}} pact {{could result in a}} conflict between the capitalist countries of Western Europe. This idea is supported by Albert L. Weeks. However, other claims by Suvorov, such as the Stalin's planning to invade Germany in 1941, have remained under debate among historians, with some like David Glantz opposing, and others like Mikhail Meltyukhov supporting it.|$|E
50|$|The March started October 2 (Gandhi's birthday), 2009 in Wellington, New Zealand and {{finished}} on January 2, 2010 in Punta de Vacas, Mendoza, Argentina. The March {{was intended to}} rise worldwide awareness for nonviolence. Concrete demands of the March are: abolition of nuclear weapons; withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories; the progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons; the signing of <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties</b> among nations and the renunciation by governments of war {{as a way to}} resolve conflicts.|$|R
50|$|The {{background}} of the occupation of the Baltic states covers the period before the first Soviet occupation on 14 June 1940, stretching from independence in 1918 to the Soviet ultimatums in 1939-1940. The Baltic states gained their independence {{during and after the}} Russian revolutions of 1917; Lenin's government allowed them to secede. They managed to sign <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties</b> in the 1920s and 1930s. Despite the treaties, the Baltic states were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 {{in the aftermath of the}} German-Soviet pact of 1939.|$|R
5000|$|Relevant events began {{regarding}} the Baltic {{states and the}} Soviet Union when, following Bolshevist Russia's conflict with the Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - several peace treaties were signed with Russia and its successor, the Soviet Union. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Soviet Union and all three Baltic States further signed <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties.</b> The Soviet Union also confirmed that it would adhere to the Kellogg-Briand Pact with regard to its neighbors, including Estonia and Latvia, and entered into a convention defining [...] "aggression" [...] that included all three Baltic countries.|$|R
25|$|European {{geopolitics}} were fundamentally altered on August 23, 1939, when Foreign Ministers of the USSR and Nazi Germany formally {{signed a}} mutual <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> known to {{history as the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The agreement included secret protocols providing for the Nazi invasion and division of Poland. Germany's September 1 invasion of Poland brought an immediate response from its treaty partners France and Great Britain, who declared war on Germany on September 3. World War II had begun.|$|E
25|$|In August 1939, Stalin {{accepted}} Hitler's proposal into a non-aggression {{pact with}} Nazi Germany, negotiated {{by the foreign}} ministers Vyacheslav Molotov for the Soviets and Joachim von Ribbentrop for the Germans. Officially a <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> only, an appended secret protocol, also reached on 23 August, divided the whole of eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The USSR was promised {{the eastern part of}} Poland, then primarily populated by Ukrainians and Belarusians, in case of its dissolution, and Germany recognised Latvia, Estonia and Finland as parts of the Soviet sphere of influence, with Lithuania added in a second secret protocol in September 1939. Another clause of the treaty was that Bessarabia, then part of Romania, was to be joined to the Moldovan SSR, and become the Moldovan SSR under control of Moscow.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Ottomans {{considerably}} changed the mood within Constantinople. The rewards reaped by the Empire were outstanding considering that {{only a short time}} had passed since the city (and possibly the Empire itself) stood on the brink of destruction. John VII appeared to have achieved numerous other benefits for Byzantium. The first was a <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, Süleyman who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute. The Empire also gained Mount Athos and coastal land of the Black Sea from Constantinople to Varna. As an added bonus, Imperial authority was asserted over a number of Aegean Islands. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated as these would serve in the future as refuge for any seeking to escape Ottoman expansion, even if only as a temporary refuge.|$|E
5000|$|After the Baltic states proclaimed {{independence}} {{following the}} signing of the Armistice, Bolshevik Russia invaded at the end of 1918. Izvestia said in its December 25, 1918, issue: [...] "Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are directly on the road from Russia to Western Europe and therefore a hindrance to our revolutions... This separating wall has to be destroyed." [...] Bolshevik Russia, however, did not gain control of the Baltic States and in 1920 concluded peace treaties with all three of them. Subsequently, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, additional <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties</b> were concluded with all three Baltic States: ...|$|R
25|$|The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was an August 23, 1939, {{agreement}} between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany colloquially named after Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The treaty renounced warfare between the two countries. In addition to stipulations of <b>non-aggression,</b> the <b>treaty</b> included a secret protocol dividing several eastern European countries between the parties.|$|R
2500|$|The Soviet Union {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany on 23 August 1939. In {{addition}} to stipulations of <b>non-aggression,</b> the <b>treaty</b> included a secret protocol that divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland into German and Soviet [...] "spheres of influence", anticipating potential [...] "territorial and political rearrangements" [...] of these countries. Stalin and Hitler later traded proposals after a Soviet {{entry into the}} Axis Pact.|$|R
25|$|On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany {{broke the}} <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> and invaded the Soviet Union {{with the largest}} and most {{powerful}} invasion force in human history, opening the largest theater of World WarII. Although the German army had considerable early success, their attack was halted in the Battle of Moscow. Subsequently, the Germans were dealt major defeats first at the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942–43, and then in the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943. Another German failure was the Siege of Leningrad, in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by German and Finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered. Under Stalin's administration and the leadership of such commanders as Georgy Zhukov and Konstantin Rokossovsky, Soviet forces took Eastern Europe in 1944–45 and captured Berlin in May 1945. In August 1945 the Soviet Army ousted the Japanese from China's Manchukuo and North Korea, contributing to the allied victory over Japan.|$|E
500|$|In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> {{with a secret}} protocol. The parties gave each other rights to [...] "spheres of influence" [...] (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the USSR). It also raised the {{question}} of continuing Polish independence. The agreement was crucial to Hitler because it assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I, after it defeated Poland.|$|E
500|$|Further {{allegations}} of [...] "Bolshevization" [...] were made after Lithuania signed the Soviet–Lithuanian <b>Non-Aggression</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 28 September 1926. The treaty was conceived {{by the previous}} government, which had been dominated by the Christian Democrats. However, Christian Democrats voted against the treaty, while Antanas Smetona strongly supported it. It drew sharp criticism as Lithuania exchanged Soviet recognition of its rights to the Vilnius Region for international isolation, as the treaty demanded that Lithuania make no other alliances with other countries. At the time, the Soviet Union was {{not a member of}} the League of Nations; France and the United Kingdom were looking for reliable partners in Eastern Europe, and the Baltic states were contemplating a union on their own. On 21 November, a student demonstration against [...] "Bolshevization" [...] was forcibly dispersed by the police. About 600 Lithuanian students gathered near a communist-led workers' union. The police, fearing armed clashes between the two groups, intervened and attempted to stop the demonstration. Seven police officers were injured and thirteen students were arrested. In an attempt to overthrow the government legally, the Christian Democrats suggested a motion of no confidence in response to the incident, but it was rejected.|$|E
50|$|X-COM must {{maintain}} a good rapport with other {{organizations in the}} city. If X-COM angers any of them, or fails to contain the alien incursion, organizations will demand compensation or even actively attack X-COM forces. They will also withdraw their support (if any) for the X-COM project. For example, the Transtellar organization would prevent Agents and science personnel from travelling around the city. The corporations and political organizations will make profits, perform research, manufacture items, and even fight covert battles with one another independently of the player. For example, if Megapol, the city police, are making lots of money, {{they will be able}} to maintain a strong presence in the city, attacking alien ships and other hostile aircraft. The more damage to the city, and the greater Megapol's financial trouble, the less {{they will be able to}} respond to enemy attacks across the city. One of these organizations, the Cult of Sirius, is a group of religious fanatics who worship the aliens, and is inherently hostile to X-COM. The aliens, rather than simply signing <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties</b> with the various corporations, will attempt to infest their CEOs and take control of the organizations themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1919 and 1939 Poland {{pursued a}} policy of balance between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany seeking <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaties</b> with both In early 1939 Germany demanded that Poland join the Anti-Comintern Pact as a {{satellite}} state of Germany. [...] Poland, fearing a loss of independence, refused, and Hitler told his generals on 23 May 1939 {{that the reason for}} invading Poland was [...] "Danzig is not the object to which it goes. It is for us the extension of the living space in the East." [...] To deter Hitler, Britain and France announced that an invasion meant war, and tried to convince the Soviet Union to join in this deterrence. Moscow played along but found it could gain control of the Baltic states and parts of Poland by allying with Germany, which it did in August 1939. London's deterrence had failed, but Hitler did not expect a wider war. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939 and rejected the British and French demands that it withdraw resulting in their declaration of war on September 3, 1939 in accordance to the defense treaties they signed with Poland and publicly announced.|$|R

500|$|Yugoslavia's {{situation}} worsened in October 1940 when Italy invaded Greece from Albania, and {{the initial}} failure of the Italians to make headway only increased Yugoslav apprehension that Germany {{would be forced to}} help Italy. In September and November 1940 respectively, Germany forced the Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Romania to accede to the Tripartite Pact. In early November 1940, General Nedić, who believed that Germany would win the war, proposed to the government that it abandon its neutral stance and join the Axis as soon as possible in the hope that Germany would protect Yugoslavia against its [...] "greedy neighbors". A few days later Prince Paul, having realised the impossibility of following Nedić's advice, replaced him with the ageing and compliant General Petar Pešić. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the Prime Minister of Hungary, Count Pál Teleki, Hungary concluded a friendship and <b>non-aggression</b> <b>treaty</b> with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not. Germany's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. Over the next few months, Prince Paul and his ministers laboured under overwhelming diplomatic pressure, a threat of an attack by the Germans from Bulgarian territory, and the unwillingness of the British to promise practical military support. Six months prior to the coup, British policy towards the government of Yugoslavia had shifted from acceptance of Yugoslav neutrality to pressuring the country for support in the war against Germany.|$|E

It argued that something resembling fascism was the unfortunate [...] "wave of the future" [...] and echoed authors such as Lawrence Dennis and later James Burnham.|$|E
2500|$|A 1939 {{entry in}} Cocea's own diary {{admits that the}} [...] "unexpected" [...] <b>Non-Aggression</b> <b>Treaty</b> between the Soviets and Nazi Germany {{was the source of}} [...] "doubting" [...] and [...] "bitterness" [...] among left-wing Romanians, but scolds his old friend Nicolae L. Lupu for having then lost faith in socialism. In {{contrast}} to his earlier political stances, Cocea was, by 1938, a member of the National Liberal Party, probably because a new wave of repression had led the PCR to implode.

50|$|Allegations of pro-communist stance {{continued}} with {{the signing of}} the Soviet-Lithuanian <b>Non-Aggression</b> Pact.

The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E.
