5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker <b>necked</b> than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker <b>necked</b> than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter <b>necked</b> and more secretive. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero II {{features}} many popular {{real world}} Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer guitars, including the Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, Gibson Flying V, (these three {{being the only}} ones available from the start) Gibson Sonex 180 and Gibson Explorer. Oddities such as the double <b>necked</b> Gibson EDS-1275 and unusual looking Gibson Corvus also make an appearance. Several available finishes are also recognizable from popular guitarists, including Zakk Wylde's bullseye Les Paul. As play progresses, several custom shaped guitars become available, although some are notable {{in the real world}} such as the USA and Battle Axe (a similar looking bass is played by Gene Simmons, and the guitar was played by John Christ of Samhain/Danzig fame). Basses, such as the Music Man StingRay, Gibson Thunderbird, and the Höfner bass (as made famous by Paul McCartney, the bassist for the Beatles) are also available for co-op play.|$|E

25|$|Many Finned or Cetioscolopendra aeliani: A , short <b>necked</b> archeocete. It has {{a number}} of lateral {{projections}} that look like dorsal fins, but turned the incorrect way. Compare to the armor on Desmatosuchus, but much more prominent.|$|E
25|$|Waterhorse: A large pinniped, {{similar to}} the long <b>necked</b> and merhorse. Only the males are maned, but females appear to have snorkels. Both of their eyes are rather small. They are {{noteworthy}} for being behind both salt and fresh water sightings.|$|E
25|$|Puumala {{is carried}} by its rodent host, the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) and is present {{through most of}} Europe {{excluding}} the Mediterranean region. Dobrava and Saaremaa carried respectively by the yellow <b>necked</b> mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) are reported mainly in eastern and central Europe.|$|E
25|$|In the Amami Islands, {{in which}} the kiln sites are located, the {{emergence}} of kamuiyaki led to the disappearance of native Kaneku-type earthenwares {{in the first half}} of the 11th century. Only a small number of earthenwares continued to be produced and they imitated soapstone cauldrons. The common vessel forms of kamuiyaki include urns (kame), small mouthed, short <b>necked</b> jars (tsubo), wide mouth jars (hachi), grating bowls (suribachi) and bowls (wan).|$|E
25|$|Instruments used in {{traditional}} Azeri music include the stringed instruments tar (skin faced lute), the kamancha (skin faced spike fiddle), the oud, originally barbat, and the saz (long <b>necked</b> lute); the double-reed wind instrument balaban, the frame drum ghaval, the cylindrical double faced drum naghara (davul), and the goshe nagara (naqareh) (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the garmon (small accordion), tutek (whistle flute), daf (frame drum) and nagara (drum) (barrel drum).|$|E
25|$|Situated on {{the western}} side of the suburb of Gwelup, lies the {{remainder}} of the once broader Lake Gwelup and accompanying bushland nature reserve. As one of the few wetlands that has a mostly intact native bushland, Lake Gwelup is home {{to a wide variety of}} local and visitor birds (waders, raptors, ducks etc.) as well many frogs (notably Moaning Frogs Heleioporus eyrei), reptile species (e.g. dugites, skinks and long <b>necked</b> turtles). Native flora in the bushland include Marri (Corymbia calophylla), Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), Flooded Gum (E. rudis), Tuart (E. gomphocephela) as well as at least four species of Banksia, many annual wildflowers (incl. orchids) and fungi. One of the most spectacular species of visiting birds is the Rainbow Bee-eater (Merops ornatus).|$|E
25|$|Given this climate, the StingRay guitar {{was quietly}} {{dropped from the}} line. The Sabre guitar soldiered on until 1984. A {{graphite}} <b>necked</b> StingRay Bass debuted in 1980. Fender had been opposed to the idea. The neck was made by Modulus. It was called the Cutlass and the two pickup variant, the Cutlass II. Neither it, nor the new translucent finishes, were able to turn the financial tide and by 1984 the company was near bankruptcy. Music Man was in good company as both Fender and Gibson reached the nadir of mismanagement in the early 1980s. After looking at a few offers Music Man was sold to Ernie Ball on March 7, 1984. Music Man's remaining physical assets were sold on June 1, 1984. The production of amplifiers, which were manufactured at a separate factory, ceased.|$|E
25|$|Pottery {{produced}} by the Caddoan Mississippian culture {{is some of the}} finest known in North America. It is usually found in the areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma. About 1200 CE as the Caddoan culture emerged from local woodland cultures such as Fourche Maline, a distinctive pottery tradition emerged, unmistakable because of its designs, materials and fine execution. These early pots were often grog tempered, although sometimes finely ground bone was used. Two main forms emerged that would become Caddoan pottery standards for the next 1000 years, a long slender <b>necked</b> bottle and a carinated form of bottles and bowls. Caddo pottery is considered to be some of the finest Mississippian pottery because of its thinness, symmetry, and very smooth finish, with some of its best examples being bottle forms with extensive geometric engravings. Pieces are often dark brown and black with a glossy finish achieved by the application of a fine slip made from a mixture of sifted fine clay or paint and buffed to a high finish. The first Europeans to encounter Caddoan pottery were members of the Hernando de Soto Expedition in 1541, who described it as matching even the finest potters of their European homeland.|$|E
500|$|Dinocephalosaurus (meaning [...] "terrible-headed reptile") is a genus of long <b>necked,</b> aquatic protorosaur that {{inhabited}} the Triassic seas of China. The genus contains {{the type and}} only known species, D. orientalis, which was named by Li in 2003. Unlike other long-necked protorosaurs (which form a group known as the tanystropheids), Dinocephalosaurus convergently evolved a long neck not through elongation of individual cervical vertebrae, but through the addition of cervical vertebrae that each have a moderate length. Like other tanystropheids, however, Dinocephalosaurus probably used its long neck to hunt for prey, utilizing a combination of suction, created by {{the expansion of the}} throat, and the fang-like teeth of the jaws to ensnare prey. It was probably a marine animal by necessity, as suggested by the poorly-ossified and paddle-like limbs which would have prevented it from going ashore.|$|E
500|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or [...] "cow bird" [...] is seen amongst flocks of cattle, for instance in ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even {{the head of the}} animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend to be shorter <b>necked</b> and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled back into a curve.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] is a live {{performance}} of the song by Powderfinger for their Across the Great Divide tour in 2007. The music video contains the performance featured on the DVD for the Across the Great Divide tour, filmed in Melbourne in 2007. The performance features a piano solo by the pianist Lachlan Doley, who performed keyboards and piano throughout the tour. The music video, produced by PVC {{as part of the}} tour DVD, is completely in black and white and throughout features optical filters that warp and alter the visual display. These filters intensify from the bridge and continue {{until the end of the}} clip. The music is performed differently from the original studio recording, with improvised solos, including Ian Haug playing the sitar part on a double <b>necked</b> guitar with synthesised effects to emulate the sitar sound, and the {{performance of the}} song ends with a ritardando, where the tempo slows to an end.|$|E

2500|$|Heavy silks {{in solid}} colors became fashionable for both {{day and evening}} wear, and a skirt might be made with two bodices, one long-sleeved and high <b>necked</b> for {{afternoon}} wear and one short-sleeved and low-necked for evening. The bodices themselves were often triangular, and featured a two-piece front with a closure and a three-piece back construction.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]22-250 started {{life as a}} wildcat {{cartridge}} {{developed from}} the [...]250 Savage case <b>necked</b> down to take a [...]224 caliber bullet. In {{the early days of}} the cartridge there were several different versions that varied only slightly from one to the next, including one developed in 1937 by Grosvenor Wotkyns, J.E. Gebby and J.B. Smith who named their version the 22 Varminter.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, IMI also {{developed}} a 9mm Action Express, which was a [...]41 AE <b>necked</b> down to 9mm. It offered a much larger case capacity than the standard 9mm case, allowing velocities that matched that of the [...]357 Magnum when loaded with light bullets. This move anticipated the parallel development of the [...]357 SIG from the [...]40 S in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]270 Winchester (or 6.8×64mm) was {{developed}} by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1923 and unveiled in 1925 as a chambering for their bolt-action Model 54. The cartridge is a <b>necked</b> down [...]30-03, {{which is the same}} length as the [...]280 Remington, both of which are longer than the [...]30-06 Springfield. The [...]270, [...]280, and [...]30-06 were all derived from the [...]30-03 parent case.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum is a belted, bottlenecked rifle cartridge, {{developed}} by Roy Weatherby in 1957. The cartridge {{is based on}} the [...]378 Weatherby Magnum <b>necked</b> up to accept the [...] bullet. The original [...]378 Weatherby Magnum parent case was inspired by the [...]416 Rigby. The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum was designed as an African dangerous game rifle cartridge for the hunting of heavy, thick skinned dangerous game.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]25 NAA {{cartridge}} {{was developed}} by North American Arms based upon a wildcat bottleneck cartridge using [...]32 ACP brass <b>necked</b> down to grip a [...]25 caliber bullet, {{with the goal of}} increasing penetration beyond what either a [...]25 ACP or [...]32 ACP could do. [...] Likewise, the [...]32 NAA {{was developed by}} North American Arms to increase the penetration of a [...]32 caliber bullet relative to a [...]380 ACP cartridge.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]300 Winchester Magnum (also {{known as}} [...]300 Win Mag or 300WM) (7.62×67mm) is a belted, bottlenecked magnum rifle {{cartridge}} that {{was introduced by}} Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1963. The [...]300 Winchester Magnum is a magnum cartridge designed to fit in a standard rifle action. It {{is based on the}} [...]375 H Magnum, which has been blown out, shortened, and <b>necked</b> down to accept a [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) bullet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Research Armament Industries (RAI) in the United States began {{development}} of a new, long-range sniper cartridge capable of firing a , [...] diameter bullet at [...] that could lethally penetrate five layers of military body armour at [...] After preliminary experiments, a [...]416 Rigby case <b>necked</b> down to take a [...] bullet was selected, since this diameter presents an optimum of sectional density and penetrating capability for practical spin stabilized rifle bullets (bullets up to about 5 to 5.5 calibers in length).|$|E
2500|$|The [...]270 Weatherby Magnum was {{the first}} belted magnum based on the [...]300 H Magnum to be {{developed}} by Roy Weatherby. It has the characteristic double-radius shoulders and is <b>necked</b> down to accommodate the [...]277in bullets. Like most Weatherby cartridges, the [...]270 Weatherby was standardized by the Small Arms and Ammunitions Manufacturers Institute in 1994, {{and it has a}} SAAMI maximum pressure limit of 62,500 psi.
