3000|$|... 0.88 / 0.71). The exo-PG {{activities}} varied significantly {{depending on}} the applied cultivation conditions. Trials performed at high level of HCl concentration resulted in no activity due to the repression of fungal growth, {{with the exception of}} experiments utilizing apple pomace as inducer substrate. These trials without fungal growth have been excluded for analysis. The ANOVA results indicated that the most important factors affecting exo-PG activity were the inducer substrates sugar beet pulp and apple pomace as well as the factor HCl concentration. The high moisture content in apple pomace (73 %) diluted the total HCl concentration in the medium. In general, acidic pH treatment of media is advantageous in SSF processes applying fungi, due to their tolerance towards low pH-values, which is minimizing the risk of contamination during cultivation. Moreover, many fungi secrete PG in acidic media and this is also the pH range where majority of their PGs show optimum catalytic activity (<b>Niture</b> 2008).|$|E
