5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had not precisely specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> how far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence precisely where he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it should be done in small stages to frequently rate the chronometers. Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Gal√°pagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit had several {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; the plaintiff could count on always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe the plaintiff money and had the case dismissed. In addition, it worked for executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a plaintiff at assizes could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> which sort of judge his case would come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E
25|$|Captain Bratge was in Remagen on {{the western}} {{approach}} to the bridge directing traffic onto the bridge.

25|$|After Auschwitz the Christian churches {{no longer}} wish {{to convert the}} Jews. While they may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of the {{theological}} grounds that dispense them from this mission, the churches have become aware that asking the Jews to become Christians is a spiritual way of blotting them out of existence and thus only reinforces {{the effects of the}} Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Pretrial motions in Bonie's {{case were}} to have started the week {{following}} the body's discovery. Instead, the trial was continued so that a forensic anthropologist for the city could examine the bones to establish the cause of death.

25|$|Furthermore, Burr {{was unsure}} of Hamilton's {{intentions}} (as historians still are today). Seeing Hamilton fire {{into the brush}} above his head, Burr could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> if Hamilton had thrown away his shot or simply missed his target. According {{to the principles of}} the code duello, Burr was entirely justified in taking aim at Hamilton, under the hypothesis that Hamilton had shot first. Continuing this line of reasoning, {{it is not clear that}} Burr did more than react to hearing Hamilton fire before he had any time to realize where the shot had gone.|$|E

25|$|The SM83, ST86 and ST89 {{were not}} subject to the cable and braking issue and were {{therefore}} kept in service. Originally Oslo ordered seventeen SL95s and planned to keep either the SM83 or the SM91 units. However, the options for another fifteen SL95s was redeemed, allowing all non-articulated trams to be retired. As the SL95 units were delivered, retirement of SM83 commenced in mid 1999. The choice to retire SM83 before SM91 was both that the former were in worse technical condition and that the need to raise the voltage on the tramway to 750 volts. SM91 had proven that it could adapt to such in Gothenburg, an outcome that the SM83 could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of duplicating.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} no {{agreed-upon}} scientific method for making experiments reproducible. Indeed, many alchemists included in their methods irrelevant {{information such as}} {{the timing of the}} tides or the phases of the moon. The esoteric nature and codified vocabulary of alchemy appeared to be more useful in concealing the fact that they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of very much at all. As early as the 14th century, cracks seemed to grow in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical. Clearly, there needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated by other people, and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.|$|E
25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a ‚Ç¨300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have {{a chilling effect on}} the development of free software in France, since any modern desktop system is {{supposed to be able to}} read music and video content, and their designers could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> whether they would face felony charges.|$|E

Alexius is also terrified - {{he would never have}} challenged his rival if he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>sure</b> he <b>was</b> too much of a coward to accept.

25|$|Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started {{claiming}} in 1846 {{that only}} those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed {{that under the}} previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga {{under the control of}} Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no one could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> {{about the extent of}} either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|The attack force staged {{through an}} {{airfield}} on Kendari, {{spending the night}} of 16 January there, refueling and taking off {{in the early hours}} next morning. Two targets had been assigned: the B-17s were to attack shipping in Menado Bay, while the LB-30S bombed an airport in the vicinity. However, their orders were so unclear that the LB-30 crews could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> where the airport was and they had to spend fifteen or twenty minutes searching before they finally found the field at Langoan, beside a lake, about 20 miles south of Menado. Almost in the instant that the last plane reported its bombs away, they were hit by five Zeros, and for six minutes the three LB-30s were under fire. They managed to shoot down one of the Zeros before themselves escaping into the weather; but two of the aircraft had been fatally hurt.|$|E

25|$|After {{some days}} of deliberation, Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan captain {{announced}} on 5 April {{that he was}} resigning from the post of captain of the One Day International and Twenty20 sides in the long-term interest of the team. According to him, as he would be 37 {{by the time of}} the 2015 World Cup, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of his place in the side then and it would be better for a new captain to be groomed now, who would be at the peak of his career during that tournament. He stated he was willing to captain the team for the upcoming tours of England and possibly Australia if the selectors felt this would aid the transition to a new captaincy. A day after Sangakkara's announcement, Mahela Jayawardene resigned from the post of vice-captain, and Aravinda de Silva from the post of Chairman of Selectors.|$|E
25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{was interviewed}} twice by his {{employers}} who {{concluded that they}} could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> he was Gilligan's only source. Eventually they took the decision to publicly acknowledge that an employee had come forward who might be the source. The announcement contained sufficient clues for alert journalists to guess Kelly's identity, and the Ministry of Defence confirmed the name when it was put to them. It usually refuses to comment on such matters, and it was alleged by some critics of the government that the Ministry of Defence was implementing a government decision to reveal Kelly's name {{as part of a}} strategy to discredit Gilligan. Andrew Rawnsley has claimed that Blair on 8 July sanctioned a strategy designed to reveal Kelly's identity; Lord Hutton found that the decision was only to confirm that a civil servant had come forward, without giving a name, because there was uncertainty that Kelly was in fact Gilligan's source.|$|E
