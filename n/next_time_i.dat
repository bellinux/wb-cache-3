By the following year he was an editor, working on such films as Success at Any Price and Where Sinners Meet. Other notable films which Hively edited include: Annie Oakley (1935), starring Barbara Stanwyck; the 1936 comedy Smartest Girl in Town, starring Gene Raymond and Ann Sothern; The Man Who Found Himself (1937), which marked the starring debut for Joan Fontaine; Garson Kanin's 1938 comedy, <b>Next</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Marry, starring Lucille Ball, James Ellison, and Lee Bowman; and the second installment of The Saint franchise, 1939's The Saint Strikes Back, which marked the first time George Sanders appeared in the role. After his work on The Saint, Hively would {{be given the opportunity to}} direct his own films, beginning with 1939's They Made Her a Spy.|$|E

Ribby and Dr. Maggoty arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, {{only to find that}} the magpie (who has left by the back door) and a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie.

500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{enduring}} folklore of the Titanic sinking {{is that the}} musicians played the hymn [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee" [...] as the ship sank, but {{this appears to be}} dubious. The claim surfaced among the earliest reports of the sinking, and the hymn became so closely associated with the Titanic disaster that its opening bars were carved on the grave monument of Titanics bandmaster, Wallace Hartley, one of those who perished. Violet Jessop said in her 1934 account of the disaster that she had heard the hymn being played. In contrast, Archibald Gracie emphatically denied it in his own account, written soon after the sinking, and Radio Operator Harold Bride said that he had heard the band playing ragtime, then [...] "Autumn", by which he may have meant Archibald Joyce's then-popular waltz [...] "Songe d'Automne" [...] (Autumn Dream). George Orrell, the bandmaster of the rescue ship, Carpathia, who spoke with survivors, related: [...] "The ship's band in any emergency is expected to play to calm the passengers. After Titanic struck the iceberg the band began to play bright music, dance music, comic songs– anything that would prevent the passengers from becoming panic-stricken... various awe-stricken passengers began to think of the death that faced them and asked the bandmaster to play hymns. The one which appealed to all was 'Nearer My God to Thee'." [...] According to Gracie, who was near the band until that section of deck went under, the tunes played by the band were [...] "cheerful" [...] but he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' as claimed in the newspaper [...] "I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic." [...] Several survivors who were among the last to leave the ship claimed that the band continued playing until the slope of the deck became too steep for them to stand, Gracie claimed that the band stopped playing at least 30 minutes before the vessel sank. Several witnesses support this account including A. H. Barkworth, a first-class passenger who testified: [...] "I do not wish to detract from the bravery of anybody, but I might mention that when I first came on deck the band was playing a waltz. The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> passed where the band was stationed, the members had thrown down their instruments and were not to be seen." ...|$|E

[...] "The <b>Next</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Fall" [...] was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. Solitude/Solitaire, which made it to number twenty-three on the Billboard 200 chart, outsold Chicago 18, the first Chicago album without him, which peaked at number thirty-five.

2500|$|It {{would be}} {{three years before}} REZ {{returned}} to the studio to record their next album and much changed in the Contemporary Christian music industry during that time.

[...] Amy Grant had scored her first No.1 US pop hit the same year with [...] "The <b>Next</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Fall," [...] a duet with former Chicago lead singer Peter Cetera. [...] Even Christian alternative music had made inroads into the mainstream when The 77s signed with Island Records and their self-titled album received a favorable review in Rolling Stone.

In 1992, Cetera released his fourth studio album, World Falling Down, which earned him three hits on the Adult Contemporary charts, including the single [...] "Restless Heart". Cetera's former position was filled by bassist and singer-songwriter Jason Scheff, son of Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff.
