5|$|In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a <b>nose</b> <b>ring.</b> Nose {{piercing}} {{has been}} {{practiced by the}} Bedouin tribes of the Middle East and the Berber and Beja peoples of Africa, as well as Australian Aboriginals. Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility. The name of the Nez Perce tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe. The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama. Nose piercing also remains popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh and is practiced in a number of Middle Eastern and Arab countries.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{new year}} at McKinley High. New Directions glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) are now sharing an apartment and a bed. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad, is running for Congress but doing badly in the polls. Glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) is now a senior, while fellow members Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) are juniors. Club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), a senior, {{has no idea what}} to do about his future. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) has a new boyfriend (LaMarcus Tinker); her former boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) moved to another state. Three New Directions members have left: Sam, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who also broke up with Puck (Mark Salling), and Sam's ex-girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), who has completely reinvented herself with pink hair, a <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> and a tattoo; she has taken up smoking, and has made friends with a group of outcast girls called the Skanks. She refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of numerous Mahasatikals (or Mastikal – hero stones {{for a woman}} who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty. Ritual death by sallekhana and by jalasamadhi (drowning in water) were also practiced. Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds. Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (honnasara and honnagala sara), bracelets (Kaduga) and wristlets (Kaftkina). Women wore a nose jewel (bottu), <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> (mugutti), bangles (bale or kankana) and various types of necklaces (honna gante sara and kati sutra). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights and ram fights. There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as agraharas, ghatikas, brahmapura or matha. Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Talagunda, Aihole, Arasikere and other places.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a ban on}} the {{practice}} that was enacted in 1972, as many as 800 dancing bears were in the streets of India during {{the latter part of the}} 20th century, particularly on the highway between Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. Sloth bear cubs, which were usually purchased at the age of six months from traders and poachers, were trained to dance and follow commands through coercive stimuli and starvation. Males were castrated at an early age, and their teeth were knocked out at the age of one year to prevent them from seriously injuring their handlers. The bears were typically fitted with a <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> attached to a four-foot leash. Some were found to be blind from malnutrition.|$|E
500|$|The artwork for Bedtime Stories {{was shot}} by French fashion {{photographer}} Patrick Demarchelier, at the Eden Roc Miami Beach Hotel in the United States in August 1994. She also worked with hairstylist Sam McKnight for the pictures, which were directed by Fabien Baron. McKnight recalled {{that it was a}} [...] "low-key" [...] photoshoot featuring less than 50 people, and was conducted on Madonna's birthday, hence it was wrapped up fast since the singer had to go for her party. The cover was released online, and depicted the singer upside down, looking upward with heavy make-up, a <b>nose</b> <b>ring,</b> blond hair, and simple neon fonts. Inspired by actress Jean Harlow, the singer sported over-plucked eyebrows for the photos which were designed by makeup artist Francois Nars.|$|E

Bart discovers that Duncan is a fast runner and {{suggests}} that he should be a racehorse. Homer enters Duncan at the Springfield Downs race track, with Bart as the jockey. However, a frightened Duncan loses his first race as he refuses to leave the stall until all other horses have finished. Homer and Bart find a strategy for Duncan to win by turning him into a frightening horse named [...] "Furious D", complete with dyed hair and one of Lisa's bracelets for a <b>nose</b> <b>ring.</b> He intimidates the other horses and wins several races. Homer is soon invited by the losing jockeys to have a beer in their lounge, which {{turns out to be a}} secret lair. The jockeys reveal themselves to be crazy, arrogant elf-based creatures and demand Homer to have Duncan lose the upcoming race, threatening to eat Homer's brain if he refuses to comply.

500|$|... "Kill Switch" [...] {{was written}} outside the mytharc {{of the series}} as a {{standalone}} story, which Gibson intended to be reminiscent of the [...] "dark visions" [...] of filmmaker David Cronenberg and to contain [...] "many obvious pokes and prods at high-end academic cyberculture." [...] Gibson's initial idea for the episode eventually evolved into the episode's final act. This was later combined with Maddox's idea of a deserted house with shuttered windows, surrounded by a chain-link fence. The episode involved the merging of human and artificial intelligence on the World Wide Web, a concept that had been floating around cyber-futuristic circles at the time. The episode's rewriting and revision process took {{a significant amount of}} time and it was over a year before the episode was completed due to other priorities that series creator Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz had. When they were finally available, they made some revisions to the script, including upping Esther's attitude and Mulder and Scully's reactions to her. A scene involving Scully trying on a fake <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> was deleted from the script. Gibson originally started watching the series on the suggestion of his daughter, 15 years old at the time. During filming, Gibson spent a majority of his time on the set only [...] "because [...] daughter insisted on being there." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was taken}} from a shoot by fashion {{photographer}} Mario Testino, in which Madonna modelled Versace clothes for their upcoming Fall/Winter 1995 campaign. Subsequently, other images taken from the shoot appeared in fashion magazines, such as Vanity Fair and Vogue Italia. The packaging included with the release showed Madonna looking [...] "deliciously cosmopolitan" [...] as she wore a tight-fit white cocktail attire, while the back cover artwork is predominantly more playful. The front cover artwork presented Madonna leaning against a wall {{with an expression of}} [...] "romantic loss or absorption." [...] Designed as the Madonna album which would appeal to a larger audience in contrast to her previous records, Bedtime Stories and [...] Erotica, the booklet featured red roses inside and a golden yellow flower on the back cover. According to The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan, the fact that Madonna removed her <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> for the cover shot indicated she [...] "wants the album to be taken on its own merits." [...] In 2013, the artwork was dubbed as one of the [...] "20 Most Fashionable Album Covers Ever" [...] by the Dutch edition of Elle magazine. The title of the album derives from her 1990 song of the same name since it had received little attention during the release of its original album, I'm Breathless.|$|E

2500|$|For safety reasons, many show {{societies}} require bulls over 12 {{months to}} be led with a <b>nose</b> <b>ring.</b> [...] A bull may be led by a rope tied through the ring, although a halter (headcollar) is usually also used {{so as not to}} rely unduly on the <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> for control. If the bull has horns, the lead rope may also be fastened around those and then passed down through the <b>nose</b> <b>ring.</b> [...] Some shows require other cattle {{to be led}} with nose grips (bulldogs). Several methods exist for handling a bull with a ring installed. [...] One method of leading a bull is to have one person {{on either side of the}} bull with both halter lead ropes through the ring, which prevents the bull from gaining pace and also from running into the handlers. Another practice is for one handler to use a rope and the other a bull-staff attached to the ring.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> is a ring made {{of metal}} {{designed}} to be installed through the nasal septum of domestic cattle, usually bulls. [...] Nose rings are often required for bulls when exhibited at agricultural shows. There also is a clip-on ring design used for controlling other cattle for showing or handling. Nose rings are also used to prevent pigs rooting, and to encourage the weaning of young calves and other livestock by discouraging them from suckling.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{estimated}} that 42% of all livestock-related human fatalities {{are a result of}} bull attacks, and only about one in twenty victims of a bull attack survives. Dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers {{in some parts of the}} United States. [...] Most cattle breeders recognize the importance of looking after expensive bulls that are expected to improve herds and profits. Nonetheless, the dangers of bull handling, particularly from dairy bulls in close quarters, are regularly proven by the obituaries. Good bull management and safety practices require caution in handling beef and dairy bulls, and use of the <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> and chain is a recommended precaution for modern farmers.|$|E

40|$|Outdoor sows are nose ringed to {{maintain}} grass cover. Intact pasture insures the sows possibility to graze {{and is also}} assumed to reduce the nutrient leaching. However, no evidence of reduced leaching from fields with ringed sows is available. Rooting behaviour constitutes {{an essential part of}} the sows’ natural behavioural repertoire. In organic husbandry it is an established aim to consider the animals’ natural behaviour, and by allowing <b>nose</b> <b>ringing</b> in organic pig production the natural behaviour of the animals has been prevented in order to consider the environment. The purpose of this experiment was to relate grazing and rooting activity of sows to grass cover and nutrient leaching. Three treatments were tested on 78 sows in total: 1 : sows with <b>nose</b> <b>rings,</b> 2 : sows without <b>nose</b> <b>rings,</b> 3 : sows without <b>nose</b> <b>rings</b> and with a gradual pasture allocation. All treatments were carried out with pregnant and lactating sows. The stocking rate was the same for all three treatments and the experiment was carried out May to September 2002. The behaviour of the sows, level of activity and position in the field were registered for one day each week during the entire grazing season. In July and September the grass cover was quantified by remote sensing and in September soil samples were taken in order to determine the nutrient leaching. Data were analysed using ANOVA. The incidence of grazing behaviour was the same in all three treatments. Grass cover was twice as dense in fields with ringed sows than in fields with unringed sows (p< 0. 05). When unringed sows graze as much as ringed it would indicate that the nourishment in the grass is similar even though the cover is less, i. e. the grass is growing more in the fields with unringed sows. Growing grass absorbs nutrients, which may result in a reduced nutrient leaching. ...|$|R

2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a <b>nose</b> <b>ring</b> to control a bull. [...] But a ring in his nose is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E
