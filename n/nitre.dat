5|$|Nitrogen is {{the most}} common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere. Despite this, it is not very {{abundant}} in Earth's crust, making up only 19parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. The only important nitrogen minerals are <b>nitre</b> (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and sodanitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's {{first act}} as {{secretary}} {{was to meet}} with assistant secretary John Archibald Campbell, who had opposed Breckinridge's nomination, believing he would focus on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest. During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him. Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint Isaac M. St. John, head of the Confederate <b>Nitre</b> and Mining Bureau, as permanent commissary general. Davis made the appointment on February 15, and the flow of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John. With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a draft; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of prisoner exchanges with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French <b>nitre</b> beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, doubtless. He {{needed to}} know his kinds of men; to regard {{intensely}} the chemic affinities and natural properties, to keep his phosphorescents his <b>nitres</b> and charcoals well apart; {{to get out of}} these English what they were capable of giving him, namely, heavy strokes,--and never ask them for what they had not: them or the others; but treat each according to his kind. Just, candid, consummately polite: an excellent manager of men, as well as of war-movements, though Voltaire found him shockingly defective in ESPRIT. The English, I think, he generally quartered by themselves; employed them oftenest under the Hereditary Prince,--a man of swift execution and prone to strokes like themselves. [...] "Oftenest under the Erbprinz," [...] says Mauvillon: [...] "till, after the Fight of Kloster Kampen, it began to be noticed that there was a change in that respect; and the mess-rooms whispered, 'By accident or not?'"--which shall remain mysterious to me. In Battle after Battle he got the most unexceptionable sabring and charging from Lord Granby and the difficult English element; and never was the least discord heard in his Camp;--nor could even Sackville at Minden tempt him into a loud word.|$|R
5|$|Most of North Island is {{dominated}} by chenopod shrubs, generally less than a metre (3ft) high. The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (prickly saltwort), Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (sea rocket). Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (<b>nitre</b> bush), the last of these being the only plant on the island to grow over m (5ft) high. In areas where limestone {{is close to the}} surface, the vegetation consists of Pimelea microcephala (shrubby rice-flower), Spyridium globulosum (basket bush) and Acanthocarpus preissii.|$|E
5|$|Most Hungarian lords and the prelates {{opposed the}} {{restoration}} of paganism. They preferred the devout Christian Andrew to his pagan brother Levente, even if, {{at least according to}} Kristó and Steinhübel, the latter was the eldest among Vazul's three sons. The Hungarian chronicles write that Levente, who died in short time, did not oppose his brother's ascension to the throne. The three bishops who had survived the pagan uprising crowned Andrew in Székesfehérvár {{in the last quarter of}} 1046 or in the spring of 1047. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that Andrew was crowned with a crown that the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos had sent to him. Nine enamelled plaques from this golden crown were unearthed in Nyitraivánka (Ivanka pri <b>Nitre,</b> Slovakia) in the 19th century. Andrew soon broke with his pagan supporters, restored Christianity and declared pagan rites illegal. According to Kosztolnyik, Andrew's epithets (the White or the Catholic) are connected to these events.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} Paraceratherium {{appears to have}} varied across its range, based on the types of {{geological}} formations {{it has been found}} in. The Hsanda Gol Formation of Mongolia represents an arid desert basin, and the environment is thought to have had few tall trees and limited brush cover, as the fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to the ground. A study of fossil pollen showed that much of China was woody shrubland, with plants such as saltbush, mormon tea (Ephedra), and <b>nitre</b> bush (Nitraria), all adapted to arid environments. Trees were rare, and concentrated near groundwater. The parts of China where Paraceratherium lived had dry lakes and abundant sand dunes, and the most common plant fossils are leaves of the desert-adapted Palibinia. Trees in Mongolia and China included birch, elm, oaks, and other deciduous trees, while Siberia and Kazakhstan also had walnut trees. Dera Bugti in Pakistan had dry, temperate to subtropical forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, <b>nitre</b> and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
25|$|The state-controlled {{manufacture}} of gunpowder by the Ottoman Empire through early supply chains to obtain <b>nitre,</b> sulfur and high-quality charcoal from oaks in Anatolia {{contributed significantly to}} its expansion between the 15th and 18th century. It was not until later in the 19th century when the syndicalist production of Turkish gunpowder was greatly reduced, which coincided with the decline of its military might.|$|E

Middle English styled it <b>nitre.</b> Old French had niter. By the 15th century, Europeans referred to it as saltpeter and later as nitrate of potash, as the chemistry of the compound was more fully understood.|$|E

He eventually studied chemistry under the Dutch naval medical officer Johannes L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort (18291908) after the latter's arrival in 1857. Pompe van Meerdervoort, who had a camera and photography manual though little experience as a photographer, also instructed Ueno Hikoma in photography.|$|E
25|$|The first {{possible}} literary {{reference to}} the salt cementation parting process is in the Arthashastra, a 4th-century BC treatise from India, that mentions heating of gold with Indus earth. Indus earth is taken to mean soils high in salt, <b>nitre</b> and ammonium salts and therefore ideal for the cementation parting process. A better known and more detailed early description is given by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC quoting an earlier lost book, On the Erythraean Sea from the 2nd century BC by Agatharchides of Cnidus. An experiment recreating the process as described by Diodorus Siculus by heating a mixture of the gold {{and salt in a}} sealed pot for 5 days was done by Notton and was found to be successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} Clan members in that century were Kazimierz Siemienowicz, General of artillery, {{military}} engineer, artillery specialist and the pioneer of rocketry, whose publication was for 200 years {{used as the}} main artillery manual in Europe, and Michał Sędziwój (Michael Sendivogius, Sędzimir) (1566–1636), from the Sędzimir branch of the Clan, was a famous European alchemist, philosopher and medical doctor. A pioneer of chemistry, he developed ways of purification and creation of various acids, metals and other chemical compounds. He discovered that air {{is not a single}} substance and contains a life-giving substance-later called oxygen-170 years before Scheele and Priestley. He correctly identified this 'food of life' with the gas (also oxygen) given off by heating <b>nitre</b> (saltpetre). This substance, the 'central nitre', had a central position in Sędziwój's schema of the universe. Sędziwój was famous in Europe, and was widely sought after as he declared that he could make gold from quicksilver, which would have been a useful talent. During a demonstration on how to make the gold, in presence of the Emperor Rudolph II, Sędziwój was captured and robbed by a German alchemist named Muhlenfels who had conspired with the German prince, Brodowski, to steal Sędziwój's secret.|$|E

500|$|The English word {{nitrogen}} (1794) {{entered the}} language from the French nitrogène, coined in 1790 by French chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756–1832), from the French <b>nitre</b> (potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter) and the French -gène, [...] "producing", from the Greek -γενής (-genes, [...] "producer, begetter"). Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen {{is the essential}} part of nitric acid, which in turn was produced from niter. In earlier times, niter had been confused with Egyptian [...] "natron" [...] (sodium carbonate) — called νίτρον (nitron) in Greek — which, despite the name, contained no nitrate.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} to discuss the {{possibility}} of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle. His 1665 New Experiments and Observations touching Cold, articulated the dispute known as the primum frigidum. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time.

Prismatic Brown Powder is a large-grained product the Rottweil Company introduced in 1884 in Germany, which {{was adopted by the}} British Royal Navy shortly thereafter. The French navy adopted a fine, 3.1 millimeter, not prismatic grained product called Slow Burning Cocoa (SBC) or [...] "cocoa powder". These brown powders reduced burning rate even further by using as little as 2 percent sulfur and using charcoal made from rye straw that had not been completely charred, hence the brown color.|$|E
2500|$|Accepting as proved by Boyle's {{experiments}} that air {{is necessary for}} combustion, Mayow showed that fire is supported not by the air as a whole but by a more active and subtle part of it.

In combustion the particulae nitro-aereae – either pre-existent in the thing consumed or supplied by the air – combined with the material burnt; as Mayow inferred from his observation that antimony, strongly heated with a burning glass, undergoes an increase of weight which can be attributed to nothing else but these particles.|$|E
