For a transportation package containing substances that could generate hydrogen gas, the package designer should calculate the gas generation rate and ensure that it is limited to a molar quantity of no more than 5 percent by volume in the package over a 60 -day shipping period under standard temperature and pressure conditions. In addition, the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> (MNOP) of the containment vessel should be designed below the design pressure. Therefore, the MNOP calculations should include the hydrogen gas generated in the payload and released into the inner cavity. Package designers have used various approaches to estimate hydrogen gas generation and demonstrate compliance with the regulatory limits. Because it may be difficult to directly measure the hydrogen gas concentrations during transportation operations, it is important that designers use consistent and reliable methods to evaluate hydrogen gas generation.

A laboratory test was conducted to evaluate the performance of five types of newly manufactured drip tapes, especially under a low pressure distribution system. The five drip products that were tested were (i) Toro Drip in PC (PCS 1810 - 18 - 100), (ii) T-Tape (TT 15 - 1245 - 0100), (iii) Mister_LS (MLD-HDT 100), (iv) Mister_PS (MLD- 1 PC 25), and (v) Netafim (Techline CV 560 050). Drip tapes tested in this study have design discharge rates of 4. 00 L/hr @ 206. 84 Kpa (1. 06 gph @ 30 psi), 1. 02 L/hr @ 55. 16 Kpa (0. 27 gph @ 8 psi), 3. 785 L/hr @ 172. 37 Kpa (1. 00 gph @ 25 psi), 3. 785 L/hr @ 172. 37 Kpa (1. 00 gph @ 25 psi), and 0. 984 L/hr @ 206. 84 Kpa (0. 26 gph @ 20 psi), respectively. All of them, except T-Tape, were pressure compensating (PC) emitters; the T-Tape was non-pressure compensating (NPC). For all products, except Toro, the emitter spacing was 0. 305 m (12 inches) and for Toro, it was 0. 46 m (18 inches). Mister_PS (MLD- 1 PC 25) was the point source (PS) emitter and all others were line source emitters. Drip products were tested with 15 different <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> ranging from 5. 97 KPa (0. 87 psi) to 344. 74 KPa (50. 00 psi). From an evaluation of 60 emitters from each product, the Toro brand showed an average uniformity coefficient (UC) of 91. 24 %, with a coefficient of variation (Cv) of 0. 06, T-Tape drip products showed an average UC of 96. 63 % with a Cv of 0. 04, Mister_ LS showed an average UC of 93. 12 % with a Cv of 0. 08, Mister_PS showed an average UC of 96. 33 % with a Cv of 0. 04, and Netafim showed an average UC of 97. 92 % with a Cv of 0. 02.

40|$|On December 12, 2007, {{the second}} largest oil spill {{in the history of}} Norwegian oil {{exploration}} occurred on StatoilHydro's Statfjord Alpha platform. The spill was caused by a snapped 20 ″ oil off-loading hose. Thorough investigations by StatoilHydro [1] and by the Norwegian authorities [2] revealed the chain of events that led to this incident. One of the links in this chain was the unintended fast closure of the shuttle tanker's bow loading valve during off-loading. This closure initiated a pressure surge in the oil off-loading system. As part of the internal investigation by StatoilHydro, TNO carried out a water hammer analysis of the entire oil off-loading system, including the off-loading hoses to the seabed and further subsea piping up to the platform. These simulations revealed that high pressures could occur in the oil off-loading system due to fast closure of the bow loading valve followed by multiple reflections at diameter changes. The maximum pressures were more than 100 bar above the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> of 10 bar. The diameter changes were introduced into the oil off-loading system to maximize the off-loading capacity. The results of the water hammer analysis provided the missing link between the fast closure of the valve and the damaged hose and also showed that this damage most likely occurred within 0. 5 second after the closure of the valve. Based on the results of this analysis, also other oil off-loading systems are being reinvestigated to prevent a similar incident to occur in the future. Copyright © 2009 by ASME...|$|E

40|$|Since the TSPs do not undergo any {{displacement}} {{relative to}} indications developed within the TSPs during normal operation, tube burst at these locations is prevented by the TSP. Thus, the burst capability requirement of 3 times the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> differential <b>pressure</b> is obviated {{by the presence}} of the TSP, and the RG 1. 121 requirement relative to 3 ∆PNO is inherently met. If the TSPs did not undergo displacements during a postulated SLB event, the same would be true of the RG 1. 121 requirement relative to 1. 43 ∆PSLB. However, the TSPs are subjected to out-of-plane loads during a SLB, and TSP displacements are predicted to occur at local areas on the TSPs thus exposing cracks presumed to exist in the tube within the span of the TSP. The principal requirement of the tube expansions is to restrict TSP deflection to a value such that the probability of burst (POB) during a postulated SLB event is essentially negligible. It can be shown that the burst probability for the STP- 2 SGs under peak bounding SLB loading is negligible even without tube expansion; however, 16 hot leg tubes will be expanded at plates C, F and J (see Figure 3 [...] 2 of WCAP 15163, Rev 1) to provide added margin for the probability of burst.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{renewable}} energy has drawn increasing attention in the recent years. Wave energy with its relatively high power density is a major resource that has remained untapped until recently. Different types of wave energy converters have been proposed for extracting the energy from the waves. In this thesis, a heaving semi-submerged buoy, moving relative to a fixed reference to drive hydraulic power take-off, was studied. To meet stringent in-service and operational requirements, the components of a wave energy converter (WEC) need to {{have high levels of}} reliability and availability. Hence, it is necessary to develop mathematical models that enable a numerical solution with sufficient accuracy and computational efficiency, and apply these models to assess the energy capture and the safety and availability of the system based on relevant reliability theory. The studied wave energy converter system consists of several subsystems, i. e., a floating buoy, a hydraulic pump, check valves, transmission lines, accumulators, a hydraulic motor and an electric generator, where energy is converted between several energy domains, and each belongs to a different engineering discipline. An integrated dynamic model in the state space form was established for this system of components. The dynamic characteristic of the considered wave energy converter system was studied, with particular reference to high frequency oscillations (HFO) of the buoy and the transient pressures in the pipelines. High frequency oscillations (HFOs), as defined in this thesis, refer to the motions of the buoy that oscillates at frequencies much higher than those of the incident waves. HFOs were observed in the time interval when no fluid was pumped or sucked between the hydraulic pump and accumulators. This type of motion is mainly caused by the fluid compressibility of the hydraulic pump. The analytical solutions of the oscillating frequencies, which depend on the hydraulic cylinder parameters, were derived in this study. The results show that the HFOs contribute significantly to the wear damage of the hydraulic pump, especially to the wear loss of cylinder bore. Because of the notable effect on the wear estimation, a dynamic wave energy converter model that can describe the HFOs is developed in the thesis. The transient pressure in the pipeline, which accompanies any sudden change in the rate of fluid flow, was another detrimental load studied in the thesis. The magnitudes of the transient pressures can be many times larger than the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> and may cause fatigue and catastrophic failures. This fact raises {{the question of how to}} predict and mitigate the pressure pulsations. In this study, pipeline dynamics were taken into account in the form of modal representations. In addition, to predict the opening and closing times of the valve operation, which directly affect the magnitude of the transient pressures, a dynamic model of the check valves is also introduced. By combining the subsystem models of pipelines and check valves with the models of other subsystems employed in the wave energy converter system, the transient pressures were calculated numerically. Moreover, the effect of the pipelines connected between the hydraulic pump and check valves on the electric power production is also investigated in this research work. The hydraulic pump, which converts the kinetic energy of the buoy into hydraulic energy of the working fluid, plays an important role in the proposed wave energy converter system. Wearing of the piston rings and cylinder bore significantly contribute to hydraulic pump failure. This research focuses on wear damage of the piston rings and cylinder bore under random sea state conditions. An abrasive wear model that considers the effect of the sealed pressure, lubrication condition, surface roughness, material properties, relative velocity and the cutting efficiency was developed. Based on the wear model and hypothesis of linear cumulative loss, a W -   T f approach (wear work rate versus time duration for wear damage growth till failure) was provided to estimate the piston ring wear resistance. By taking into account the occurrence probability of each sea state, a long-term wear damage estimation model was finally derived and given in the thesis. Because it is very time consuming to calculate the wear damage by considering all of the sea states, focus should be on the sea states that represent the most significant contribution to wear. In this thesis, the relative contribution of wear for the piston ring and cylinder bore from different sea states was calculated. The primary sea states contributing to wear can be found easily from the obtained figures. The last topic of this research work is to construct modal bond graphs for the transmission lines. To model a pipeline with fluid pressures and flow rates at its two ends (i. e., the upstream side and downstream side) as input-output variables, four possible boundary conditions—pressure inputs at both ends, flow rate inputs at both ends and the two cases of mixed inputs—should be taken into account. The pipeline dynamics can be approximately modelled with modal models, which can be represented in the bond graph forms. To derive the modal models, two methods, separation of variables (SOV) and rational transfer function (RTF*) may be used. In this thesis, modal bond graph representations were reviewed and new bond graph models were proposed for combinations of the solution methods and input-output configurations not yet presented in the literature, which include a bond graph for the two mixed input cases developed using the SOV technique and bond graphs for the other two cases (i. e., pressure inputs or flow rate inputs) constructed based on RTF solutions. It is found that the modal models derived by SOV and RTF have the same accuracy when the same number of modes is employed. With the developed bond graph models, the pipelines which are coupled with any other dynamic elements and systems can be modelled and analysed straightforwardly.

A pressure vessel design known as the composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) was identified to provide a weight savings over traditional single-material pressure vessels typically made of metal and this technology has been in use for space flight applications since the 1970 's. A typical vessel design consisted of a thin liner material, typically a metal, overwrapped with a continuous fiber yarn impregnated with epoxy. Most designs were such that the overwrapped fiber would carry a majority of load at <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressures.</b> The weight advantage for a COPV versus a traditional singlematerial pressure vessel contributed to widespread use of COPVs by NASA, the military, and industry. This technology is currently used for personal breathing supply storage, fuel storage for auto and mass transport vehicles and for various space flight and aircraft applications. The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) was recently asked to review the operation of Kevlar 2 and carbon COPVs to ensure they are safely operated on NASA space flight vehicles. A request was made to evaluate the life remaining on the Kevlar COPVs used on the Space Shuttle for helium and nitrogen storage. This paper provides a review of Kevlar COPV testing relevant to the NESC assessment. Also discussed are some key findings, observations, and recommendations that may be applicable to the COPV user community. Questions raised during the investigations have revealed the need for testing {{to better understand the}} stress rupture life and age life of COPVs. The focus {{of this paper is to}} describe burst testing of Kevlar COPVs that has been completed as a part of an the effort to evaluate the effects of ageing and shelf life on full scale COPVs.

The relationship between <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> heads in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of the submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to the allowable minimum <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically. However, a microirrigation system designed to meet the required water application uniformity according to the allowable maximum <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head would be better when x > 0. 5 because, in general, water application uniformity increases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimentally}} determined stiffness {{coefficient of}} bagasse {{is described in}} this paper. This property defines the behaviour of the reaction forces exerted upon the bagasse layer when being compressed during juice-extraction in a sugar-cane mill. This information is important for correctly analysing sugar-cane mill operation and design. An experimental device was used for obtaining the stiffness coefficient; it consisted of a piston, a piston-skirt, a hydraulic press and instrumentation for measuring the pressures so produced and piston position at different times. Compression rate, humidity level and degree of bagasse fragmentation were the experimental factors {{taken into account in}} the experimental design. The investigation was carried out with 40 %- 80 % humidity level and up to 0. 06 compression rates. All experimental factors proved statistically significant in the bagasse stiffness coefficient experimental model so obtained. Bagasse was seen to behave as a very rigid elastic material under <b>normal</b> sugar-mill <b>pressure</b> <b>operating</b> conditions, having 50 MPa to 20, 000 MPa stiffness coefficient values...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{accurately}} predicting water quality through models has increasingly been crucial in meeting rigorous standards and customer expectations. There are several endeavours on developing robust water quality models for water distribution systems. In this paper, two variants of the EPANET 2 water quality model have been assessed to inform future research. The models are the multiple species extension EPANET-MSX and the pressure-dependent extension EPANET-PDX. Water quality {{analysis was conducted}} on a hypothetical network considering various <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. Different kinetic models were employed to simulate water quality. First order, limited first order and zero order models were used for predicting chlorine residual, disinfection by-products (DBPs) and water age respectively. Generally, EPANET-MSX and EPANET-PDX provided identical water quality results for <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> conditions with adequate pressure but different results for pressure-deficient networks. Also, a parallel first order model with fast and slow reacting components was used for chlorine decay and DBPs using the EPANET-MSX model for a network <b>operating</b> under <b>normal</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions...|$|R

Maintaining proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack operating temperature across transient current profiles presents a significant challenge for fuel cell vehicles. Liquid cooled systems require active control of coolant temperature and flow rate to match heat rejection to heat generation. Evaporative cooling is an alternative to conventional liquid cooling in automotive sized PEMFC stacks. In an evaporatively cooled system, liquid water is injected directly into the cathode flow channels where it evaporates, both cooling and humidifying the stack. This paper uses a validated simulation to explore the inherent temperature regulation abilities of an evaporatively cooled PEMFC stack {{across a range of}} current profiles and drive cycles. Results show that throughout the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> current range, stack temperature varies by less than± 2. 0 °C, this is comparable to liquid cooling but without the need for active temperature control. The introduction of variable <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> and cathode stoichiometry using proportional integral control, can further reduce temperature variation to± 1. 0 °C and± 1. 2 °C respectively for step increases in current demand. Variable <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> is also shown to improve warm up time and reduce heat loss at low operating loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{modern world}} is heavily {{dependent}} on crude oil and its associated products and the petroleum industry has taken responsibility to meet the rising consumer demand. Oil and gas production can be broadly subdivided into three separate fields of science and technology, notably production processes in the reservoir, production {{of oil and gas}} from the wells and finally surface gathering, separation and transportation. This research focused on the problem that oil producers usually face with waxy crude oil during its production, processing and transportation. Wax build up, especially in the crude oil production pipeline, is the key task for the operators to deal with as it may cease crude flow through the pipeline and associated production facilities. Research efforts to date, have addressed flow assurance issues of crude oil displacement through the production pipeline and processing facilities but {{further research is needed to}} determine the best outcome to cope with situation. The principal objective of this research is to simulate crude flow through the production pipeline using hydrocarbon simulation software Aspentech HYSYS 3. 2 and PIPESYS to investigate the root cause and analyse flow assurance issues with the aim of elimination of such issues through the production pipeline. The simulation focused on the study of crude oil properties including temperature, pressure and viscosity affecting the crude oil flow from the reservoir or through the production pipeline, and the results compared with <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> conditions of the wellhead and production pipeline. Three different scenarios involving the detailed study of temperature and pressure were simulated at temperatures and pressures above or below the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> condition reference points. The simulation results reveal that the crude oil flow through the production pipeline predominantly decreases due to a gradual drop of temperature along the cumulative length of the pipeline. The viscosity of the crude oil accordingly increases with the drop in temperature, which consequently reduces the flowrate of crude oil through the pipeline. Conversely, an increment in crude oil production is obtained with an increase in crude oil temperature from 60 ºC to 65 ºC. Moreover, there is no direct significant effect on the viscosity of crude oil with an increase or decrease in <b>pressure</b> compared to <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. However, a significant drop in production is observed with the drop in temperature and <b>pressure</b> below the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> temperature and <b>pressure</b> of the pipeline. The outcome of this study will enable design engineers to understand the complications which usually occur while operating such facilities and give special consideration to those issues at the detailed engineering design stage of future similar facilities...|$|R

Due to the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> of the regenerator unit increasing almost proportionally with the reboiler load (Wen et al. 2007), the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> should not be too high. Combining the simulation and experimental results, it was more appropriate to set the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> of the regenerator unit at 200  kPa.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} program {{funded by}} the CANDU Owners Group (COG) is studying an out-reactor instrumented defected fuel experiment in Stern Laboratories (Hamilton, Ontario) with guidance from Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). The objective of this test is to provide experimental data for validation of a mechanistic fuel oxidation model. In this experiment a defected fuel element with UO 2 pellets will be internally heated with an electrical heater element, causing the fuel to crack. By defecting the sheath in-situ the fuel will be exposed to light water coolant near <b>normal</b> reactor <b>operating</b> conditions (<b>pressure</b> 10 MPa and temperature 265 - 310 °C) causing fuel oxidation, especially near the hotter regions of the fuel in the cracks. The fuel thermal conductivity will change, resulting in {{a change in the}} temperature distribution of the fuel element. This paper provides 2 D r-θ plane strain solid mechanics models to simulate fuel thermal expansion, where conditions for fuel crack propagation are investigated with the thermal J integral to predict fuel crack stress intensity factors. Finally since fuel crack geometry can affect fuel oxidation this paper shows that the solid mechanics model with pre-set radial cracks can be coupled to a 2 D r-θ fuel oxidation model...|$|R
