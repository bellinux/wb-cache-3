40|$|In mixed pool/bilateral {{electricity}} markets, participants {{can sign}} bilateral contracts several {{weeks or months}} {{in advance of the}} pool market-clearing. Any uncommitted generator capacity may be sold to the pool and any remaining un-serviced demand is met through the pool, both at the pool spot price. In this thesis, in contrast to financial rights, we consider only physical bilateral contracts, where the generator and load are obliged to produce and consume power levels at least equal to the stipulated bilateral amount. Bilateral contracts have the advantage that they satisfy {{at least part of the}} needs of both buyers and sellers at a predictable price instead of relying solely on the uncertain real-time spot price at the pool market-clearing time. However the risk of signing a bilateral contract is that it commits the partners to a price that may be disadvantageous compared to the pool spot price. Thus, if the spot price turns out to be lower than the bilateral price, then the seller comes out ahead while the buyer loses compared to the alternative of having traded solely in the real-time market. Conversely, if the spot price turns out to be higher than the bilateral price, then the seller loses out while the buyer benefits compared to having traded solely in the real-time market. Here we propose a systematic bilateral <b>negotiating</b> <b>approach</b> between a generator and load in mixed pool/bilateral markets. Under this approach the generator and load respond rationally to a stream of bilateral bids/counter-bids and offers/counter-offers considering their respective expected benefits while accounting for the risks incurred by the uncertainty of pool spot price prediction. This <b>negotiating</b> <b>approach</b> is tested numerically and shown to be a valuable and practical tool in arriving at a mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable bilateral contract...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The present chapter {{focuses on}} the {{clinical}} relationship with foreign entities in which  the foreignness is both a state language and a legal status, and thus a contingent and not existential condition. The issue concerns the translatability of language and meaning of the Other: this raises the issue of understanding {{and the possibility of}} communication and exchange. Starting from the discussion of the concepts of culture and context in the post-modern paradigm, a general model of clinical and social intervention is proposed involving a form of negotiation setting, based on extraneousness and contingency. Context and culture do not respond to universal categories, to limited space-time frames but they are {{the way in which the}} subject intends the world and his experience. This semiotic-clinical disposal represents a criterion of knowledge of the individual configurations. So it is possible to intercept the personal resources to orient a contingency-based intervention that promotes a process of co-construction of meaning, a product of the relationship between the actors. The object of the relation is the relational process in a clinical and social setting; thus, the model can direct the organization and provision of services for foreign nationals. The role of the interpreter is also considered in its general function and in particular contexts of service. The <b>negotiating</b> <b>approach</b> overcomes some critical issues integrating the semiotic socio-constructivist model with other social sciences. </p...|$|E

The key concern in a supply chain is to coordinately managing and controlling of all the primary and support activities of the company that will be achieved with an appropriate integration of supply chain. In fact, having an integrated approach to the processes, internal and external, and emphasis on win-win approach instead of <b>negotiating</b> <b>approach</b> between elements of the chain are the most important issues in supply chain integration context. This study investigates the impact of supply chain integration on competitive capability. According to the findings of the study, supply chain integration has direct positive influence on competitive capability. In more depth, integration with suppliers has direct negative impact on competitive capability elements of cost leadership and differentiation. Internal integration has no direct impact on competitive capability. On the other hand, internal integration influences on cost leadership and differentiation indirectly through integration with suppliers and integration with customers.

It is argue that current bilateral and multilateral Trade and Investment Agreements are shrinking in their legal framework the policy space need for development in countries that need it the most. This study, underlines the fact that the legal provisions contain in the Cote d’Ivoire IEPA do reduce actually its ability to set up policies tool aim at achieving development goals. It is the sustainability of the IEPA legal provisions that is questioned under this topic with regard to sensitive issues such as the safeguard measures, the stand still clause, the MFN clause, the Rules of Origin etc… [...] In so doing, the analysis reveals as well the ambiguity of the IEPA relationship with the Cotonou Agreement and the multilateral trade rules of the WTO. This ambiguity is highlighted in an attempt to drawn the attention of the region on the fact that; if there is indeed a need to update the Economic Partnership Agreement currently negotiating with the EC, this cannot be done without first of all updating the <b>negotiating</b> <b>approach</b> of the region. In fact, its weak bargaining approach coupled with that overwhelming of the EC has resulted in the agreement currently on the table. Substantial changes can be made with this regard by acknowledging the insufficiencies in the legal framework of the IEPA but also in learning lesson from mistakes the region itself and Cote d’Ivoire have done in negotiating EPAs and its Interim version. Thus, since EPAs often triggered the debate on liberalization and what it may carry in terms of consequences on developing countries’ economies, examples of countries that took a different step toward liberalization and whose current situation may be use as a testimony by ECOWAS are quoted.

40|$|In {{a cluster}} of three {{documents}} released on September 4 th 2003 prior to departure for Cancun, the European Commission set out its position on agricultural issues in the WTO. The first of these documents was a memorandum addressing a number of frequently asked question on EU agriculture and the WTO. The areas covered included: {{a summary of the}} EU position on modalities; a summary of the EU/US framework proposal; the relationship between the June 2003 CAP-reform measures and the WTO negotiations; the meaning of the term 'decoupling' and its relevance to WTO negotiations; the impact of CAP reform on developing countries; the justification for high EU agricultural expenditures; the case for GIs; the trade-distorting effects of export credits; the trade-distorting effects of single-desk selling; how systems of food-aid delivery can distort trade; the EU's approach to the 'precautionary principle'; the impact of the CAP on developing countries; the extent to which EU market-access concessions have brought benefits to developing countries; the extent to which European agricultural markets are still a fortress; the EU position on tariff escalation; why EU cotton subsidies do not harm developing countries. The second of these documents was a speech by Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler which set out ten key ingredients for success in Cancun: slashing trade-distorting forms of support; cutting export subsidies substantially; giving developing countries a better deal; not being over-ambitious; opening up markets to agricultural imports; maintaining the direction of policy reform and not back-tracking; avoiding recourse to cheap propaganda; abandoning extreme positions; having realistic expectations; avoiding piracy of partners' names. Commissioner Fischler was extremely critical of what he termed extreme positions and those who stoop to low propaganda. He maintained forcefully that 'not all farm spending is evil' and defined the common objective at the WTO as to 'reduce all farm subsidies which distort international trade and harm the interests of developing countries'. He stated that the EU would 'vigorously defend our right to support our farmers' arguing that no one had the right to 'wipe out European agriculture will all the jobs, the environmental benefits, the cultural heritage our farmers provide'. Finally Commissioner Fischler placed considerable emphasis on seeking protection for geographical indications. The third of these documents was the Commission's press pack ' EU Agriculture and the WTO'. In the foreword to this text Commissioner Fischler maintained {{that as a result of}} the process of CAP reform the EU has 'essentially said goodbye to the old system of trade-distorting agricultural support'. As a consequence the EU had set itself to 'negotiate offensively at the WTO', with the EU demanding 'something in return' for the reforms it was committed to implementing. Once again the point was emphasised that not all forms of farm support are bad and that the overall level of agricultural support is irrelevant. The relevant issue is the trade-distorting nature of the support being extended. Within this logic, the EU argues that WTO rules should encourage less trade-distorting and non-trade-distorting forms of support whilst progressively imposing disciplines on trade-distorting forms of support. Here, in the Commission's view, Europe has made major strides. The Commission also believes that the EU has made significant progress in opening up its markets to developing countries (although the impact is questionable - see the accompanying news item on the impact of the EU's EBA scheme). The first section of the press pack sets out the justification for the CAP (mainly with reference to the multifunctional nature of agriculture in the EU), the impact of reform to date and the on-going direction of reform. The second section looks at the EU's approach to agricultural negotiations in Cancun with an emphasis on: the importance of addressing non-trade concerns; the importance of negotiated liberalisation of agricultural markets; the need to substantially cut trade-distorting forms of support (by 55 %); the EU's willingness to cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 36 % and a minimum of 15 %; the need to reduce all forms of export support by 45 % and the phasing-out of export subsidies of particular interest to developing countries; renewing the 'peace clause'; establishing special safeguards; protection of geographical indications. In this section the EU acknowledged its interest in securing an opening up of third-country markets and called for full and complete duty-free access for all originating LDC products to all developed and advanced developing country markets. In section 3 the press pack looks at the EU's approach to developing countries in the WTO. It reiterates the EU's wider development co-operation policy objectives and the openness of EU agricultural markets to developing country exports compared to other OECD importers. It sets out the different multilateral trade regimes that the EU applies to developing countries. It highlights the importance the EU attaches to special and differential treatment for developing countries, particularly with regard to longer time frames for the implementation of commitments made and the provisions for trade-related technical assistance. This section also seeks to explain why undifferentiated agricultural trade liberalisation does not help the poorest developing countries. Finally the press pack provides a useful glossary of terms used in the WTO trade debates. Comment: While the EU has put forward proposals for stricter disciplines on 'amber' and 'blue box' support it made no reference to disciplining 'green box' support, the category of support into which the EU is seeking to shift the vast majority of its support to agriculture. This basic reality was not lost on developing countries and the Cairns Group. The EU's commitment to cutting export subsidies was seen by many as going back on the Doha agreement to the eventual elimination of export subsidies. New Zealand's trade minister, Jim Sutton, summed up the response to this aspect of the EU proposals by declaring ' we're after fundamental reform in these areas. Export subsidies must go in this round'. While on market-access commitments the EU was willing to allow a special safeguard to protect sensitive products from excessive imports, this was clearly seen as inadequate in the face of EU efforts to make green-box support untouchable. Overall it was clear that few developing country representatives accepted the EU's view of the non-trade-distorting nature of the new forms of agricultural support brought about by the June 2003 round of CAP reforms. The EU 'offensive' <b>negotiating</b> <b>approach</b> thus laid the seeds for disagreement, since there was little consensus on the fundamentals underpinning the EU's approach, with many seeing the new round of CAP reform as a vehicle for making trade distortions more efficient rather than a vehicle for removing or reducing trade distortions. The Commission press pack contained certain discrepancies. For example it claimed that 'the latest CAP reforms will bring about a reduction in trade-distorting subsidies of the order of US$ 80 billion per year (the equivalent of € 72. 5 billion), compared to the pre-reform situation, as EU amber and blue box subsidies will fall substantially'. What makes this claim remarkable is that the EU annual agricultural budget for 2004 totals only € 45. 8 billion. It is therefore difficult to see how CAP reform can lead to annual reductions in trade-distorting forms of support of € 72. 5 billion, a full 33 % more than total annual EU agricultural budget expenditures. Highlighting figures such as this scarcely makes EU claims credible. Other aspects of the press pack were also misleading, with the references to improved market access neglecting to mention the declining price attractiveness of the EU market in the face of CAP-reform led price reductions.

Multiple sources of information were used, namely relevant literature, consultations with health service agencies, organisations working with CALD communities, and focus groups with consumer advisory bodies within health services. The findings identified the strategies adopted by healthcare services in delivering healthcare to CALD clients, and the barriers to accessing care and treatment.

Questionnaires were derived from self-determination theory, the transtheoretical model and the integral model of treatment motivation. It was investigated to which extent clinicians of patients with SMI were able to estimate their patient's perspective on motivation for engaging in treatment, to which extent they agreed on the patient's motivation and which factors were associated with estimation and agreement on treatment motivation. It was found that clinicians were poorly to moderately capable of estimating their patient's type of motivation and readiness for change. Further, agreement {{on the level of}} motivation between patients and clinicians was moderate. These findings were consistent across diagnostic groups (psychotic and personality disorders). A higher quality therapeutic relationship was generally associated with higher clinician-rated motivation. The patient's ethnicity and socially desirable responding were factors that differentiated between scales of different motivation theories. It is concluded that patients with SMI and their clinicians have different perceptions on the patient's motivation for engaging in psychiatric treatment, regardless of the theoretical framework that is used to measure motivation. The findings imply that a <b>negotiated</b> <b>approach</b> is needed where both perceptions of clinicians and patients on motivation for treatment are considered to ensure effective mental health interventions. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Clinicians show poor to moderate capability in estimating how patients perceive their motivation for engaging in treatment, especially so when the patient's motives revolve around feelings of shame and guilt. Clinicians generally give higher motivation ratings for patients where they experience a higher quality therapeutic relationships with, whereas—depending on the scale that is used to measure motivation—they give lower ratings to patients who respond in socially desirable ways and to ethnic minority patients. As patients with SMI and their clinicians have different perceptions on the patient's motivation for engaging in psychiatric treatment (regardless of the theoretical framework that is used to assess motivation), this implies that a <b>negotiated</b> <b>approach</b> is needed where both perceptions of clinicians and patients on motivation for treatment are considered to ensure effective mental health interventions...|$|R

40|$|In the September 2008 Legislative Council election, Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s democrats {{managed to}} retain their veto {{position}} in the political reform process. Now, the democrats face the dilemma {{of what to do}} with Beijing 2 ̆ 7 s 2007 plan for Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s democratization. According to the plan, the people of Hong Kong could see the direct election of the chief executive and the entire legislature in 2017 and 2020, respectively. Although the plan is not perfect, Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s pan-democratic camp may need to adopt a <b>negotiated</b> <b>approach,</b> given the current political reality and the balance of power between local democrats and Beijing. It is suggested here that there is room for negotiation in the latter 2 ̆ 7 s reform plan. If some moderate democrats are willing to pursue a negotiated strategy, Beijing 2 ̆ 7 s political reform plan for Hong Kong stands a significant chance of being approved. Recent developments in Hong Kong indicate that such a prospect could indeed materialize...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of patient participation in decision-making regarding post-operative ambulation on ambulation behaviors, occurrence of post operative complications, and overall satisfaction for patients undergoing bowel surgery. A convenience sample consisted of 39 subjects, aged 20 - 80, who underwent bowel surgery at a 300 -bed medical center in a midwest metropolitan area. An active <b>negotiated</b> <b>approach</b> to encourage patient participation in decision-making regarding post-operative ambulation was utilized for subjects in the experimental group (n = 19). It was hypothesized that subjects in the experimental group would ambulate farther and more frequently, would experience fewer post-operative complications, and would have higher levels of satisfaction than subjects in the control group (n = 20). No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding frequency of ambulation, distance ambulated, or level of satisfaction with care (p 3 ̆e. 05). Subjects in the control group did experience a significantly greater number of complications than did subjects in the experimental group (p 3 ̆c. 05) ...|$|R
