5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate a}} new kind of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with the creation of {{a new kind of}} family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their <b>natural</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{connection}} with healthcare philosophy, {{the theory of}} <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed {{with a series of}} <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher John Locke. With regard to the <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> of man, Locke states, Although partially informed by his religious understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a human right becomes relevant.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{identifies}} the problematic theoretical {{nature of human}} rights under Franco's regime, {{in the light of}} either a traditionalist or a totalitarian objective <b>natural</b> <b>right's</b> discursive hegemony. This contradictory theoretical alternative was already present in Ramiro de Maeztu's legal-political doctrine, which as the theoretical seed of the regime, led to those contradictions as embodied in two authors: F. Elías de Tejada and L. Legaz Lacambra. Drawing on a political critique of the text itself, the conclusion evinces the doctrinal state of human rights in the current Spanish constitutional system, exposing its contradictions as derived not from a traditionalist or a totalitarian objective <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> but from a subjective <b>natural</b> <b>right...</b>|$|R

25|$|By the 17th Century, the Medieval teleological view {{came under}} intense {{criticism}} from some quarters. Thomas Hobbes instead founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) {{was subject to}} contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death {{at the hands of}} another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind's <b>natural</b> <b>rights,</b> whereas previously it could be said that <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign's decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. Jeremy Bentham's modifications on legal positivism further developed the theory.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{liberalism}} {{is a set}} {{of ideas}} that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers individual liberty {{to be the most important}} goal, because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.|$|E
25|$|The Enlightenment and {{the colonial}} era both {{changed the nature of}} European {{philosophy}} and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.|$|E
25|$|James L. Richardson {{identified}} five central {{themes in}} Locke's writing: individualism, consent, {{the concepts of}} the rule of law and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of <b>natural</b> <b>rights,</b> he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.|$|E

40|$|What {{happened}} to the doctrine of <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> in the nineteenth century? We know that it flourished in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. We know that something like it - the doctrine of human rights and new forms of social contract theory - flourished again {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century and continues to flourish in the twenty-first. In between there was a period of decline and hibernation - uneven, to be sure, and never complete - but a period in which to invoke <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> was always to invite intellectual ridicule and accusations of political irresponsibility. Thus article asks: How far can the decline of <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> in the nineteenth century be attributed to the reaction against the revolution in France? How far it was the effect of independent streams of thought, like positivism and historicism? Why was radical thought so ambivalent about <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> throughout the nineteenth century, and why was socialist thought in particular inclined to turn its back on i? As a framework for thought, <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> suffered a radical decline in the social and political sciences. But things were not so clear in jurisprudence, and <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> lived on to a much riper old age in the writings of some prominent economists. So we have to ask: What is it about this theory that allowed it to survive in these environments, when so much of the rest of intellectual endeavor in the nineteenth century was toxic or inhospitable to it. Finally, I shall ask how far American thought represents an exception to all of this. Why and to what extent did the doctrine survive as a way of thinking in the United States, long after it had lost its credibility elsewhere...|$|R

25|$|The liberal {{philosophical}} {{tradition has}} searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The {{moral and political}} suppositions of liberalism {{have been based on}} traditions such as <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> and utilitarian theory, although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles. Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and individual liberty, supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as pluralism, toleration, autonomy, bodily integrity and consent.|$|E
25|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Spanish priest and philosopher Francisco Suarez (1548-1617) {{expressed}} his objections to colonialism {{in his work}} De Bello et de Indis (On War and the Indies). In this text and others, Suarez supported natural law and conveyed his beliefs that all humans had rights to life and liberty. Along these lines, he argued for the limitation of the imperial powers of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor by underscoring the <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> of indigenous people. Accordingly, native inhabitants of the colonial Spanish West Indies deserved independence and each island {{should be considered a}} sovereign state with all the legal powers of Spain.|$|E
25|$|As a moral philosopher, Mosterín {{does not}} believe in the {{existence}} of intrinsic or <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but he thinks that any political society can create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with the role played by perception in empirical science.|$|E
