40|$|Within {{sustainable}} design, design {{researchers and}} practitioners are developing <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> <b>approaches</b> equipped to influence domestic resource consumption {{in a variety}} of ways. However, as it turns out, the outcomes of these approaches in terms of their actual effects on sustainability are not quite as high as the desired effects. This is often taken to be a direct consequence of rebound effects or unpredicted user behaviour. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, this article explores the implications of the combination of two research strands, practice theory and human-centred design that may assist designers by going beyond behaviour towards gaining an understanding of use practices. Practice theory takes practices as its main unit of analysis; human-centred design works closely with potential future users. The translation of these two starting points in a design approach was explored in a still ongoing exemplar project on bathing that is elaborated on here.

40|$|This study assesses three {{different}} and <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> <b>approaches</b> {{to increase the}} failure stress and elastic damage limit of T-shaped structural joints made of carbon fibre-epoxy composite. The ply orientations to the laminate within the T-joint radius bend, which is highly susceptible to delamination failure, were designed using a numerical optimisation method and two design-of-experiment methods to increase the failure load. Finite element modelling and experimental testing proved that all three designs successfully tailored the ply orientations within the radius bend region to increase the delamination initiation load of the T-joint, while maintaining its original stiffness and weight. The new designs resulted in large improvements to the damage initiation load under both bending loading (up to ∼ 125 % increase) and tensile loading (up to ∼ 85 %) compared to a conventional composite T-joint with a quasi-isotropic ply design. The three new designs also increased the elastic damage limit and absorbed strain energy capacity of the T-joint. The improved designs lower and generate a more uniform interlaminar stress field within the radius bend region, and this increases the initiation load for delamination failure...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model-driven {{approach}} to content repurposing. Our work is inspired by the OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The MDA is an approach to system specification and interoperability based {{on the use of}} hierarchically organized formal models. The MDA approach uses a platform-independent base model (PIM), and one or more platform-specific models (PSM), each describing how the base model is implemented on a different platform. In this way, the PIM is unaffected by the specifics of different implementation technologies, so {{it is not necessary to}} repeat the process of modeling an application or content each time a new technology or presentation format comes along. The essence of our solution is the Multimedia Metamodel (MM), which defines various platform-independent multimedia concepts. Using the Multimedia Metamodel we have explored <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> <b>approaches</b> for content repurposing solutions. The metamodel can be used as a conceptual basis for content repurposing and creation of platform-independent multimedia content allowing authoring for device and network independence.

The problems investigated are not only previously unsolved theoretically but also of practical importance in many applications: voltage conversion, naval piloting and navigation and robotics, for example. The book considers general switched-system models and provides more efficient design methods to bring together theory and application more closely than was possible using classical methods. It also discusses several different classes of switched systems. For general switched linear systems and switched nonlinear systems comprising unstable subsystems, it introduces novel ideas such as invariant subspace theory and the time-scheduled Lyapunov function method of designing switching signals to stabilize the underlying systems. For some typical switched nonlinear systems affected by various complex dynamics, the book proposes <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> <b>approaches</b> based on intelligent control concepts. It is a useful source of up-to-date design methods and algorithms for researchers studying switched systems and graduate students of control theory and engineering. In addition, it is a valuable reference resource for practising engineers working in switched-system control design.
