50|$|<b>Nepadutant</b> (INN) (code name MEN-11420) is a glycosylated bicyclic cyclohexapeptide drug {{which acts}} as a highly {{selective}} NK2 receptor antagonist.

40|$|In the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, tachykinin NK 2 receptors are localized both on {{smooth muscle}} and nerve fibres. NK 2 receptor antagonists reduce exaggerated intestinal motility in various diarrhoea models but {{the site of}} action contributing to this effect is unknown. In this study we investigated the effects of atropine (1. 4 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, i. v.), hexamethonium (13. 5 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, i. v.), and <b>nepadutant</b> (0. 1 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, i. v.), a selective tachykinin NK 2 receptor antagonist, on distension (0. 5 and 1 [*]ml) -, or irritation (acetic acid, 0. 5 [*]ml of 7. 5 % v v− 1) -induced motility in the rat distal colon in vivo. The effects of atropine, hexamethonium or Nω-nitro-L-argininemethylester (L-NAME, 1. 85 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, i. v.) on [βAla 8]NKA(4 - 10) (10 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1, i. v.) -induced colonic contractions were also investigated. When the colonic balloon {{was filled with a}} subthreshold volume (0. 5 [*]ml), the intraluminal instillation of acetic acid triggered a high-amplitude phasic colonic motility which was partially reduced by <b>nepadutant</b> and suppressed by either hexamethonium or atropine. Filling of the balloon with 1 [*]ml evoked reflex (hexamethonium-sensitive), atropine-sensitive phasic colonic motility: <b>nepadutant</b> had no significant effect on the distension-evoked motility. Neither hexamethonium nor atropine significantly reduced [βAla 8]NKA(4 - 10) -induced colonic contractions, whereas <b>nepadutant</b> suppressed them. Following L-NAME pretreatment, [βAla 8]NKA(4 - 10) -induced colonic contractions were inhibited by both atropine and hexamethonium. In hexamethonium-pretreated animals, an atropine-sensitive component of [βAla 8]NKA(4 - 10) -induced colonic contractions was also evident. These results indicate that the application of irritants onto the colonic mucosa induces the release of endogenous tachykinins which enhance excitatory cholinergic mechanisms through the stimulation of NK 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{synthesized}} {{and fully}} characterized the NK 2 receptor antagonist <b>nepadutant</b> and its by-products using {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) and restrained molecular dynamics. The agent consists of an active bicyclic hexapeptide combined with a sugar residue. Analysis of the high-performance liquid chromatogram and the mass spectroscopy spectra yields traces of three by-products with the same molecular weight as the main product. The conformation of the molecules in the bicyclic hexapeptide segment, the active region, is well defined, whereas the sugar moiety is disordered. For the peptide region of <b>nepadutant</b> {{and all of its}} by-products, the NMR observables can be described by a single backbone conformation, more specifically a βI, βII-turn arrangement. The active dipeptide unit Trp–Phe occupies the i+ 1 and i+ 2 position of a βI-turn. The by-product profile is characterized by different forms of sugars which are caused mainly by isomerization in the process of ring opening...|$|E
40|$|Ibodutant (MEN 15596, [1 -(2 -phenyl- 1 R-{[1 -(tetrahydropyran- 4 -ylmethyl) -piperidin- 4 -ylmethyl]-carbamoyl}-ethylcarbamoyl) -cyclopentyl]-amide) is a tachykinin NK 2 {{receptor}} (NK 2 R) antag-onist {{currently under}} phase II clinical trials for irritable bowel syndrome.

40|$|Because {{the role}} of tachykinin receptors in colonic {{peristalsis}} remains incompletely understood, we studied the effect of tachykinin receptor antagonists on mouse colonic peristaltic activity. Peristaltic activity was assessed by quantifying the amplitude and interval of distension-induced pressure waves in proximal and distal colon segments of mice using a modified Trendelenburg set-up. We studied {{the effect of the}} NK 1, NK 2 and NK 3 tachykinin receptor antagonists RP 67580 (2 mM), <b>nepadutant</b> (1 mM) and SR 142801 (0. 3 mM) respectively. Gradual distension of proximal and distal colon segments induced repetitive rhythmic pressure waves which were blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 mM) and virtually abolished by hexamethonium (0. 1 mM) demonstrating their neuronal origin. The NK 1 receptor blocker RP 67580 significantly reduced the amplitude of the pressure waves in segments of proximal (5. 90. 7 to 1. 80. 8 cmH 2 O, n= 7) and distal (4. 80. 6 to 1. 50. 7 cmH 2 O, n= 6) colon. RP 67580 significantly reduced the interval in the proximal (667 to 876 s, n= 5) but not in the distal colon. The NK 2 receptor blocker <b>nepadutant</b> significantly reduced the amplitude (5. 20. 5 to 3. 30. 7 cmH 2 O, n= 7) and the interval (527 to 396 s, n= 7) in the proximal colon without affecting peristaltic parameters in the distal colon. Blockade of NK 3 receptors by SR 142801 did not affect the amplitude or interval of peristaltic waves in the proximal and distal colon. Combined blockade of NK 1, NK 2 plus NK 3 receptors significantly reduced the amplitude in the proximal colon (6. 50. 9 to 1. 60. 8 cmH 2 O, n= 6) and prolonged the interval (635 to 10622 s, n= 6). Our study shows that mouse colonic peristaltic activity has a strong tachykininergic component that is mediated mainly by NK 1 receptors {{and to a lesser extent}} by NK 2 receptors. We could not demonstrate a role for NK 3 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Motor effects {{produced}} by tachykinins were studied in human isolated corpus spongiosum and cavernosum. In quiescent preparations neurokinin A caused potent contractions (pD 2 = 8. 3 [*]–[*] 7. 9 respectively) prevented by the NK 2 receptor-selective antagonist <b>nepadutant,</b> whereas [Sar 9]SP sulfone and senktide (NK 1 and NK 3 receptor-selective agonists) produced no effect or spare contractions. In KCl-precontracted corpus spongiosum septide (pD 2 = 7. 1) and [Sar 9]SP sulfone (pD 2 = 7. 7) produced tetrodotoxin-resistant relaxations, abolished by the tachykinin NK 1 receptor-selective antagonist SR 140333. [Sar 9]SP sulfone (1 [*]μM) produced similar relaxations in precontracted corpus cavernosum. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) elicited tetrodotoxin-sensitive relaxations, which were additive to those {{produced by}} [Sar 9]SP sulfone. Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) totally prevented both [Sar 9]SP sulfone- and EFS-induced relaxations. These {{results show that}} tachykinin NK 1 and NK 2 receptors mediate opposite motor effects in human penile tissues, suggesting a possible modulatory role of tachykinins on smooth muscle tone in these organs...|$|E
40|$|The tachykinin {{family of}} {{peptides}} are {{distributed throughout the}} nervous system and are thought to {{play a critical role}} in inflammation and immunomodulation. Tachykinins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and disease processes including inflammatory pain, emesis, depression, Parkinson’s disease and inflammatory bowel syndrome. In the airways of animals, substance P and neurokinin A are released from a subset of airway sensory nerves, and evoke vasodilatation, bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, leukocyte recruitment, airways hyperreactivity and cough. These observations have led to suggestions that tachykinins may also be viable targets for the treatment of obstructive airways disease. Clinical trials in humans assessing the utility of tachykinin receptor antagonists such as <b>nepadutant</b> and saredutant for the treatment of asthma are limited, and the results for the most part have been inconclusive. Several new tachykinin receptor antagonists have been recently designed to target multiple tachykinin receptor subtypes and to readily penetrate into the central nervous system. Future clinical trials with these compounds should help to shed some light on the role of tachykinins in obstructive airways disease. Copyright 2004 Adis Data Information B...|$|E
40|$|MEN 11420 (<b>nepadutant)</b> is a potent, {{selective}} {{and competitive}} antagonist of tachykinin NK 2 receptors. The {{objective of the}} present study was to assess the capability of the drug to antagonize the stimulatory effects of neurokinin A (NKA) on gastrointestinal motility, as well as to change the fasting migrating motor complex (MMC). Thirty-four male volunteers were randomized to treatment with either placebo or MEN 11420 in a double-blinded manner. Effects of MEN 11420 (8 [*]mg intravenously) were evaluated as changes in phases I, II and III of MMC, as well as contraction frequency, amplitude and motility index during baseline conditions and during stimulation of motility using NKA (25 [*]pmol[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1 intravenously). NKA preceded by placebo increased the fraction of time occupied by phase II, increased contraction frequency, amplitude and motility index. MEN 11420 effectively antagonized the motility-stimulating effects of NKA. MEN 11420 reduced the phase II-stimulating effect of NKA. In addition, the stimulatory effect of NKA on contraction frequency and amplitude, as well as motility index were inhibited by MEN 11420. MEN 11420 did not affect the characteristics of MMC during saline infusion. Plasma levels of MEN 11420 peaked during the first hour after infusion and decreased to less than half during the first 2 [*]h. In conclusion, intravenous MEN 11420 effectively inhibited NKA-stimulated, but not basal gastrointestinal motility, and was well tolerated by all subjects...|$|E
40|$|Tachykinin NK 2 receptors are {{expressed}} in the gastrointestinal tract of both laboratory animals and humans. Experimental data indicate a role for these receptors in the regulation of intestinal motor functions (both excitatory and inhibitory), secretions, inflammation and visceral sensitivity. In particular, NK 2 receptor stimulation inhibits intestinal motility by activating sympathetic extrinsic pathways or NANC intramural inhibitory components, whereas a modulatory effect on cholinergic nerves or a direct effect on smooth muscle account for the NK 2 receptor-mediated increase in intestinal motility. Accordingly, selective NK 2 receptor antagonists can reactivate inhibited motility or decrease inflammation- or stress-associated hypermotility. Intraluminal secretion of water is increased by NK 2 receptor agonists via a direct effect on epithelial cells, and this mechanism is active in models of diarrhoea since selective antagonists reverse the increase in faecal water content in these models. Hyperalgesia in response to intraluminal volume signals is possibly mediated through the stimulation of NK 2 receptors located on peripheral branches of primary afferent neurones. NK 2 receptor antagonists reduce the hyper-responsiveness that occurs following intestinal inflammation or application of stressful stimuli to animals. Likewise, NK 2 receptor antagonists reduce intestinal tissue damage induced by chemical irritation of the intestinal wall or lumen. In healthy volunteers, the selective NK 2 antagonist <b>nepadutant</b> reduced the motility-stimulating effects and irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms triggered by intravenous infusion of neurokinin A, and displayed other characteristics that could support its use in patients. It is concluded that blockade of peripheral tachykinin NK 2 receptors {{should be considered as}} a viable mechanism for decreasing the painful symptoms and altered bowel habits of irritable bowel syndrome patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the novel {{mammalian}} tachykinin, hemokinin 1 (HEK- 1), have been investigated by radioligand binding and functional in vitro and in vivo experiments. Similar to SP (Ki= 0. 13 nM), HEK- 1 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner and with high affinity [3 H]-substance P (SP) binding to human NK 1 receptor (Ki= 0. 175 [*]nM) while its affinity for [125 I]-neurokinin A (NKA) binding at human NK 2 receptor was markedly lower (Ki= 560 [*]nM). In isolated bioassays HEK- 1 was a full agonist at tachykinin NK 1, NK 2 and NK 3 receptors. In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK- 1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK- 1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK- 1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. The responses to HEK- 1 were antagonized by GR 82334 in RUB (pKB= 5. 6 ± 0. 07), by <b>nepadutant</b> in RPA (pKB= 8. 6 ± 0. 04) and by SR 142801 in GPI (pKB= 9. 0 ± 0. 2) with apparent affinities comparable to that measured against tachykinin NK 1, NK 2 and NK 3 receptor-selective agonists, respectively. Intravenous HEK- 1 produced dose-related decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ED 50 = 0. 1 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1) and salivary secretion in anaesthetized rats (ED 50 = 6 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1) with potencies {{similar to that of}} SP. All these effects were blocked by the selective tachykinin NK 1 receptor antagonist, SR 140333. We conclude that HEK- 1 is a full agonist at tachykinin NK 1, NK 2 and NK 3 receptors, possesses a remarkable selectivity for NK 1 as compared to NK 2 or NK 3 receptors and acts in vivo experiments with potency similar to that of SP...|$|E
