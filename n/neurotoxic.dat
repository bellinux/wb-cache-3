5|$|It {{spends much}} of its time {{underwater}} in order to hunt, but returns to land to digest, rest, and reproduce. It has very potent <b>neurotoxic</b> venom which it uses to prey on eels and small fish. Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the <b>neurotoxic</b> effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.nidulans are <b>neurotoxic</b> if ingested. The toxin was {{identified}} as polyporic acid, a terphenyl compound first identified from a mycelial culture of the fungus in 1877. This chemical, present at 20–40% of the dry weight of the fruit bodies, inhibits the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. It is found in other mushrooms, but in much lower amounts. In a poisoning case reported in 1992, one German family who consumed H.nidulans experienced nausea, impaired movement, visual impairment, liver and kidney failure; symptoms began about 12 hours after consuming the mushroom. Additionally, the urine of all three poisoning victims temporarily turned violet. They recovered fully a week later. Similar symptoms and recovery were reported in a 2013 poisoning case, in which the fungus was confused with the edible Fistulina hepatica. The set of symptoms arising from consumption of H.nidulans {{has been called the}} <b>neurotoxic</b> delayed syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} fruit bodies cause <b>neurotoxic</b> symptoms if ingested, {{an effect}} {{attributable to the}} compound polyporic acid, which is present in high concentrations. When an alkaline solution {{is placed on the}} fungus, the flesh turns violet. The fungus is used in mushroom dyeing to produce purple colors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with <b>neurotoxic</b> domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neurotoxic</b> {{effect of}} {{mephedrone}} on serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems remains controversial. Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to DA nerve endings in the striatum and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain <b>neurotoxic</b> components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly <b>neurotoxic</b> in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a <b>neurotoxic</b> effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E
5|$|While {{members of}} the Liliaceae s.s. {{have been used as}} food sources in humans, the bulbs of some species are {{poisonous}} to household pets (bulb toxicosis) if eaten and may cause serious complications, such as renal failure in cats from Lilies, particularly Lilium longiflorum (Easter Lily). Dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression. Most Fritillaria (e.g. Fritillaria imperialis, Fritillaria meleagris) bulbs contain poisonous <b>neurotoxic</b> alkaloids such as imperialin (peiminine), which may be deadly if ingested in quantity, while other species such as Fritillaria camschatcensis and Fritillaria affinis are edible. Tulips can cause skin irritation due to the presence of tuliposides and tulipalins, which are also found in the flowers, leaves and stems of Fritillaria. These are also toxic to a variety of animals.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for <b>neurotoxic</b> PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

25|$|A Lancet review {{identified}} 201 chemicals {{with the}} ability to cause clinical <b>neurotoxic</b> effects in human adults, as described in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Most of them are commonly used. Many additional chemicals {{have been shown to be}} <b>neurotoxic</b> in laboratory models. The article notes that children are more vulnerable and argues that new, precautionary approaches that recognise the unique vulnerability of the developing brain are needed for testing and control of chemicals in order to avoid the previous substantial before starting restrictions on usage. An appendix listed further industrial chemicals considered to be <b>neurotoxic.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Neurotoxic</b> venom acts on {{the nervous}} system and brain.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{allegations}} {{have been}} made via the Internet and in consumer magazines purporting <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of aspartame leading to neurological or psychiatric symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and mood changes. Review of the biochemistry of aspartame has {{found no evidence that}} the doses consumed would plausibly lead to <b>neurotoxic</b> effects.|$|E

25|$|<b>Neurotoxic</b> {{effects may}} also be caused by {{rattlesnake}} venom. These effects vary by species, and within species by population.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{research}} suggests that acute exposure to alcohol is not <b>neurotoxic</b> in adults and actually prevents NMDA antagonist-induced neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Manganese {{may affect}} liver function, but the {{threshold}} of acute toxicity is very high. On the other hand, more than 95% of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion. Any existing liver damage may slow this process, increasing its concentration in blood plasma. The exact <b>neurotoxic</b> mechanism of manganese is uncertain but there are clues pointing at the interaction of manganese with iron, zinc, aluminum, and copper. Based {{on a number of}} studies, disturbed iron metabolism could underlie the <b>neurotoxic</b> action of manganese.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{suppresses}} {{brain function}} during intoxication; but upon withdrawal rebound effects {{occur in the}} glutamate/NMDA system and with excess glutamate activity glucocorticoid release; due to the repeated intoxication, followed by acute withdrawal, a <b>neurotoxic</b> effect that damages {{the central nervous system}} develops, leading to persisting impairments in verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities as well as impairment of spatial orientation. Due to developmental processes occurring during adolescence including myelinization and restructuring of the synapses, adolescents are thought to be more vulnerable to the <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{is even more}} complex in countries like India, with its rich mix of vipers (family Viperidae) and highly <b>neurotoxic</b> cobras and kraits of the family Elapidae.|$|E
25|$|Impairments {{in theory}} of mind, {{as well as}} other social-cognitive deficits are {{commonly}} found in people suffering from alcoholism, due to the <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of alcohol on the brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|Spider venoms work {{on one of}} two {{fundamental}} principles; they are either <b>neurotoxic</b> (attacking the nervous system) or necrotic (attacking tissues surrounding the bite). In some cases, the venom affects vital organs and systems. The venoms of the widow spiders, Brazilian wandering spider and Australian funnel-web are <b>neurotoxic.</b> Heart muscle damage is an unusual complication of widow venom {{that may lead to}} death. Pulmonary edema, which is fluid accumulation in the lungs, is a feared and potentially serious but uncommon complication of funnel-web venom. Recluse and South African sand spider venoms are necrotic. Recluse venom may also cause severe hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), though this is typically uncommon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neurotoxic</b> {{behavior}} of aluminum {{is known to}} occur upon entry into the circulatory system, where it can migrate to the brain and inhibit some of the crucial functions of the blood brain barrier (BBB). A loss of function in the BBB can produce significant damage to the neurons in the CNS, as the barrier protecting the brain from other toxins found in the blood {{will no longer be}} capable of such action. Though the metal is known to be <b>neurotoxic,</b> effects are usually restricted to patients incapable of removing excess ions from the blood, such as those experiencing renal failure. Patients experiencing aluminum toxicity can exhibit symptoms such as impaired learning and reduced motor coordination. Additionally, systemic aluminum levels are known to increase with age, and have been shown to correlate with Alzheimer’s Disease, implicating it as a <b>neurotoxic</b> causative compound of the disease. Despite its known toxicity, aluminum is still extensively utilized in the packaging and preparing of food, while other toxic metals such as lead have been almost entirely phased-out of use in these industries.|$|E
25|$|Many {{solvents}} {{are known}} or suspected to be cataractogenic, greatly increasing {{the risk of}} developing cataracts in the lens of the eye. Solvent exposure has also been associated with <b>neurotoxic</b> damage causing hearing loss and color vision losses.|$|E
25|$|Pretreatment with NCS-382, a GHB {{receptor}} antagonist, prevents both learning/memory {{deficits and}} neuronal loss in GHB-treated animals, suggesting that GHB's <b>neurotoxic</b> actions are mediated via {{activation of the}} GHB receptor. In addition, the neurotoxicity appears {{to be caused by}} oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid has {{a potent}} <b>neurotoxic</b> effect. Studies have {{demonstrated}} that quinolinic acid {{may be involved in}} many psychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative processes in the brain, as well as other disorders. Within the brain, quinolinic acid is only produced by activated microglia and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Extreme binge {{drinking}} {{can lead to}} brain damage faster and more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism). The <b>neurotoxic</b> insults are due to very large amounts of glutamate which are released and over-stimulate the brain as a binge finishes. This results in excitotoxicity, a process which damages or kills neurons (brain cells). Each {{binge drinking}} episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain {{is thought to be}} particularly susceptible to the <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month. With prolonged abstinence neurogenesis occurs which can potentially reverse the damage from alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{not well}} adsorbed by activated carbon. This should be of particular concern to those using the material in filters for respirators, fume hoods or other gas control systems as the gas is undetectable to the human senses, toxic to metabolism and <b>neurotoxic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{effect would}} {{be an increase in}} red tide events, which could contribute to the accumulation of toxins (domoic acid, brevetoxin, saxitoxin) in small organisms such as anchovies and shellfish, in turn increasing occurrences of amnesic shellfish poisoning, <b>neurotoxic</b> shellfish poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a <b>neurotoxic</b> protein {{produced}} by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents {{the release of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction and thus causes flaccid paralysis. Infection with the bacterium causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially in medicine, cosmetics and research.|$|E
25|$|Assumption that a {{reported}} injury {{was caused by}} a spider is the most common source of false reports, which in some cases have led to misdiagnosis and mistreatment, with potentially life-threatening consequences. Many spider bites are relatively painless but the spider is often trapped and easily found. With <b>neurotoxic</b> envenomation, serious symptoms arise within a few hours.|$|E
25|$|Proteolytic venom is also dual-purpose: firstly, it is {{used for}} defense and to {{immobilize}} prey, as with <b>neurotoxic</b> venoms; secondly, many of the venom's enzymes have a digestive function, breaking down molecules in prey items, such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. This is an important adaptation, as many vipers have inefficient digestive systems.|$|E
