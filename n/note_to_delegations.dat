According <b>to</b> a high-level <b>delegation</b> that met with rebel general Laurent Nkunda to discuss topics raised by negotiations, rebel command response was [...] "positive". Due to Kenyan Jamhuri (Independence) Day celebrations the mediators, after consulting with both parties, decided to adjourn the talks and resume on the 17th of that month. A statement released by Obasanjo stated that he was [...] "pleased <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that <b>delegations</b> are making steady progress towards agreement on the ground rules for substantive discussions."

40|$|International audienceTask {{delegation}} presents one of {{the business}} process security leitmotifs. It denes a mechanism that bridges the gap between both workfow and access control systems. There are two important issues relating <b>to</b> <b>delegation,</b> namely allowing task <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> complete, and having a secure delegation within a workfow. Delegation completion and authorisation enforcement are specied under specic constraints. Constraints are dened from the delegation context implying {{the presence of a}} xed set of <b>delegation</b> events <b>to</b> control the <b>delegation</b> execution. In this paper, we aim <b>to</b> reason about <b>delegation</b> events <b>to</b> specify <b>delegation</b> policies dynamically. <b>To</b> that end, we present an event-based task <b>delegation</b> model <b>to</b> monitor the <b>delegation</b> process. We then identify relevant events for authorisation enforcement <b>to</b> specify <b>delegation</b> policies. Moreover, we propose a technique that automates delegation policies using event calculus <b>to</b> control the <b>delegation</b> execution and increase the compliance of all delegation changes in the global policy...|$|R

To that end, we propose an event-based task <b>delegation</b> model <b>to</b> control the <b>delegation</b> execution.

40|$|Three {{perspectives}} on delegation in the European Union {{are presented in}} this article. The transaction-costs perspective focuses on information asymmetries between policy makers and implementers. According to the commitment perspective, policy makers delegate authority {{as a solution to}} commitment problems. The consensus-building perspective views the decision to delegate as a trade-off between decisiveness and inclusiveness during the bargaining process. Hypotheses are derived from these perspectives regarding the amount of <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> both the European Commission and to member states in legislation. From detailed information on eighty-six EU laws, there is some evidence for the transaction-costs perspective as an explanation of <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> the Commission. With respect <b>to</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> member states, there is some evidence for both the transaction-costs perspective and the consensus-building perspective...|$|R
