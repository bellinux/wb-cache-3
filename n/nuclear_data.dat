On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. On the other hand, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> shows that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|AbstractClarifying the {{evolutionary}} relationship between island organisms {{and those of}} the adjacent mainland is critical in understanding the dispersal and evolution of species. Considerable research has been conducted on the relationship between plants of the East Asian mainland and the Japanese archipelago as well as the roles of the East China Sea and the Korea (Tsushima) Strait in plant evolution. However, most previously studied species have limited range distributions, which may preclude a comprehensive understanding. Acer mono is a widespread deciduous tree in East Asia. By integrating chloroplast DNA sequences and <b>nuclear</b> microsatellite <b>data,</b> we identified a close genetic relationship between Japanese and subtropical mainland populations. However, different details are revealed by chloroplast DNA sequences and <b>nuclear</b> microsatellite <b>data.</b> The chloroplasts from the northwestern part of the eastern subtropical populations were more closely related to the archipelago populations (CP 2 clade), but no shared haplotypes were found, which may indicate an ancestral connectivity. Contrarily, plants from {{the eastern part of the}} eastern subtropics and the archipelago populations were assigned into the same gene pool based on <b>nuclear</b> microsatellite <b>data</b> (K =  6), which probably reflects a recent glaciation connection via pollen dispersal. Our study implies that the Korea (Tsushima) Strait may have been a long-term barrier for A. mono, while the East China Sea may have served as a corridor for pollen dispersal...|$|R
