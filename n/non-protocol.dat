We implement two parallelization approaches, Locking and Independent Protocol Stacks (IPS), in the UDP/IP/FDDI protocol stack in the x-kernel on an SGI Challenge XL multiprocessor. We then conduct a set of multiprocessor experiments designed to measure packet processing times under specific conditions of cache state. These measurements are then used to parameterize the analytic component of a simulation model of multiprocessor protocol processing, designed to reflect the impact on protocol execution time of the <b>non-protocol</b> workload.

40|$|We present UDP {{datagram}} demultiplexing {{techniques that}} can yield potentially substantial application-independent performance gains over BSD-derived UDP implementations. Our demultiplexing strategies exploit local host and UDP implementation features [...] (1) how UDP processes connection-less datagrams, (2) local host application as client or server, and (3) local host application "density" [...] resulting in straight-forward hash-based search strategies that caused demultiplexing speedups {{as high as}} 24 -to- 1 over BSD's one-behind cache. Furthermore, while past researchers have shown that cache-based schemes yield little performance benefit for UDP, we show that cache-based implementations can actually degrade demultiplexing performance. Finally, we recommend simple, <b>non-protocol</b> altering local host modifications for existing and future UDP implementations. We used four server traffic traces and eight algorithms in our trace-driven simulations, and executed more than 60 simulations to obtain our results...|$|E
40|$|We explore processor-cache {{affinity}} scheduling {{of parallel}} network protocol processing, {{in a setting}} in which protocol processing executes on a shared-memory multiprocessor concurrently with a general workload of <b>non-protocol</b> activity.

In addition, we compare the performance of two parallelization alternatives, Locking and Independent Protocol Stacks (IPS), with very different caching behaviors. We find that IPS (which maximizes cache affinity) delivers much lower message latency and significantly higher message throughput capacity, yet exhibits less robust response to intra-stream burstiness and limited intra-stream scalability. 1 Introduction In many modern computer architectures, there is {{a significant difference in the}} amount of ti [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Since its {{inception}} as a laboratory {{animal in the}} early 1970 s, the zebrafish has proven itself a rising star {{in the world of}} comparative biomedical sciences due to its short generation time, ease of care, external fertilization, and transparent larvae. In a very few decades, the zebrafish has been utilized as a model organism for as many experimental topics and modalities as its rodent counterparts, which have been in use for centuries. Whereas the rodent world has had time to develop biosecurity protocols and specific pathogen free lines, the zebrafish community has had little time to cleanse the animals of contaminating infectious organisms from their tenure as ornamental fish in the pet trade. Initially, because they were used primarily for developmental genetics studies, the need for biosecurity and elimination of infectious disease was not viewed as particularly important. However, as zebrafish have been used as model organisms in sensitive studies of biomedical and neurobehavioral phenomena, the scientific community must evaluate the potential for subclinical infections to alter experimental data. Pseudoloma neurophilia, a microsporidian endoparasite, is currently one of the most commonly diagnosed infections in zebrafish facilities worldwide. Because of its tropism for the central nervous system, and because of the opportunistic nature of microsporidia, it is vital to understand the potential effects that infection can have on behavior and studies involving immunosuppression. Armed with this knowledge, researchers {{will be able to make}} informed decisions regarding biosecurity and husbandry protocols in order to mitigate the effects of infection-associated, <b>non-protocol</b> induced variation. The hypothesis of this dissertation is that infection of zebrafish by Pseudoloma neurophilia causes <b>non-protocol</b> induced variation in neurobehavioral and biomedical experiments. In order to explore experimental protocols most likely to be influenced by P. neurophilia, I first performed a retrospective study with the intention of identifying the most common features of neuronal and muscular infections. Five hundred fifty-nine zebrafish infected with P. neurophilia submitted to ZIRC (Zebrafish International Resource Center, Eugene, OR) from 86 laboratories between the years 2000 and 2013 were examined via histopathology. Parasite clusters (PCs) occurred in distinct axonal swellings, frequently with no associated inflammation. Inflammation was observed in viable cell bodies distant from PCs. Multiple PCs occasionally occurred within a single axon, suggesting axonal transport. PCs occurred most frequently in the spinal cord ventral white matter (40. 3...|$|E

40|$|Objectives 					 Determine {{what happens}} to {{patients}} after unsuccessful SUI operations and to 						explore the reasons why these patients change doctors. 				 				 					Materials and Methods 					 One hundred consecutive failed patients treated for SUI were interviewed 						about the exams requested after persistence of the incontinence as well as 						the reasons they abandoned their primary doctors through a structured 						questionnaire. 				 				 					Results 					 Among the patients with cases of anterior colporrhaphy, bladder suspensions 						or slings, 34. 3 %, 13. 7 % and 8. 3 %, respectively, were not offered any further 						type of investigative procedures to clarify the failure.

40|$|This single-center {{study was}} carried out on living related and {{unrelated}} renal transplant recipients (RTRs) to evaluate the usefulness of surveillance biopsies in monitoring stable renal allografts using immuno-histological markers for immune-activation. This is a prospective, longitudinal study. Protocol biopsies of 60 RTRs with stable graft function were evaluated at three, six and 12 months post-transplant. Immuno-histological evaluation {{was carried out}} using immune-activation markers (perforins, granzyme and interleukin- 2 R), phenotypic markers (CD- 3 and CD- 20), viral markers and C 4 d. The demographic and clinical profile was recorded for each patient. All cases of acute sub-clinical rejection (SCR) were treated and borderline SCR cases were followed-up without treatment. SCR at three and six months post-transplant was evident in 16. 7 % and 3. 7 % of RTRs, respectively. Positive statistical association of SCR was seen with HLA-DR mismatches, whereas patients receiving induction therapy and tacrolimus-based immunosuppression exhibited a lower incidence of SCR. T cell phenotype with persistent expression of immune-activation markers exhibited positive statistical association with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy at 12 -month follow-up biopsy. The mean creatinine levels were significantly lower in the protocol biopsy group than the <b>non-protocol</b> biopsy group. No {{significant difference was found}} between the mean creatinine levels of the SCR group after treatment and the non-SCR cases within the protocol biopsy group.

40|$|A {{resource}} is {{provided for the}} creation of an institutional program that balances the scientific mission of an institution with the well-being of the animals used in support of the research. The concept of harmonizing scientific goals with animal well-being was first suggested {{in the early part of}} the twentieth century and later revitalized in the literature of the 1950 s. Harmonization can best be achieved through the pro-motion of a team initiative. The team should include, at a minimum, the scientist, veterinarian, institutional animal care and use committee, and animal care staff. It is the respon-sibility of this animal research team to promote and balance the generation of scientifically valid data with animal well-being. The team must strive to minimize or eliminate <b>non-protocol</b> variables that could adversely affect the validity and repeatability of the experimental data. Good experimen-tal design coupled with excellent communication between team members can often minimize or eliminate many vari-ables and result in both better science and animal well-being. To ensure the scientific validity of experimental data, scientists must be aware of the complex nature of the envi-ronment in which their animals are maintained. To ensure repeatability of an experiment, scientists must document and publish both the inanimate and social environments in which their animals are housed. Better documentation of environmental variables and their correlation with experi-mental results will promote critical knowledge about the relationships between an animal’s environment, its well-being, and science.

40|$|Objective: Compare the {{effectiveness}} between spontaneous breathing trial with low-pressure support protocol and liberal or <b>non-protocol</b> directed method. Material and Method: The authors conducted a retrospective study involving 577 {{patients who were}} arranged and appropriate to {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} on general surgical intensive care unit between July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2007. Two hundred and twenty two patients were weaned by their host surgeons or team (liberal group). Three hundred and fifty five patients underwent once daily spontaneous breathing trial with low-pressure support protocol. Patients assigned to this protocol had the pressure support level decreased to 5 - 7 cm of water for up to two hours each day. If signs of intolerance occurred, the process was restrained while patients who tolerated the two-hour trial without signs of distress were extubated. The authors collected demographic data, cause of ICU admission, APACHE II score at arranged time to weaning, weaning process time, ventilator day, and ICU length of stay. Results: There was statistical difference between liberal and protocol in age (59. 2 + 19. 3 vs. 55. 6 + 19. 8; p = 0. 03) but there was no statistical difference in gender (male 74. 3 vs. 67. 9 %; p = 0. 2) and APACHE II score at arranged time to wean (14. 7 + 7. 4 vs. 15. 3 + 6. 3; p = 0. 2).

40|$|In {{clinical}} trials, {{we often}} compare two treatment groups using repeated binary measures over time. In such trials, we may encounter missing observations, adverse side effects, or non-responsiveness to therapy which for ethical reasons, {{may result in}} increased medical intervention beyond the protocol therapy. We developed a family of statistical tests based on the Wilcoxon statistic which orders the vectors of repeated binary observations and events where the ordering is determined by 'clinical relevance'. For some scenarios, clinically meaningful ordering of the vectors may be defined by a natural algorithm, while for other scenarios the ordering is obtained {{from a group of}} clinicians. We present the statistical development of the proposed method, effects of the variability of rankings among clinicians, examples of the application of the proposed method using data from a clinical trial on otitis media, and simulation studies comparing the statistical power of the proposed method to more traditional methods of analysis. Our simulation studies indicate that the proposed method is competitive with and, for some scenarios, is preferable to the traditional methods. Although the proposed method is not applicable to every situation, we believe that for some diseases and scenarios, this simple method is noteworthy {{in the sense that it}} can be adjusted to extremely complex situations if vectors can be hierarchically ordered in a reasonable fashion, it can be focused on alternatives that have high clinical relevance, and it can be readily adapted to accommodate <b>non-protocol</b> 'outcomes' and missing data.

Methods/Design The International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment - in Depression (iSPOT-D) is a multi-centre, international, randomized, prospective, open-label trial. It is enrolling 2016 MDD outpatients (ages 18 - 65) from primary or specialty care practices (672 per treatment arm; 672 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls). Study-eligible patients are antidepressant medication (ADM) naïve or willing to undergo a one-week wash-out of any <b>non-protocol</b> ADM, and cannot have had an inadequate response to protocol ADM. Baseline assessments include symptoms; distress; daily function; cognitive performance; electroencephalogram and event-related potentials; heart rate and genetic measures. A subset of these baseline assessments are repeated after eight weeks of treatment. Outcomes include the 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (primary) and self-reported depressive symptoms, social functioning, quality of life, emotional regulation, and side-effect burden (secondary).

40|$|Patient-reported {{outcomes}} (PROs), such as health-related {{quality of}} life (HRQL) are increasingly used to evaluate treatment effectiveness in clinical trials, are valued by patients, and may inform important decisions in the clinical setting. It is of concern, therefore, that preliminary evidence, gained from group discussions at UK-wide Medical Research Council (MRC) {{quality of life}} training days, suggests there are inconsistent standards of HRQL data collection in trials and appropriate training and education is often lacking. Our objective was to investigate these reports, {{to determine if they}} represented isolated experiences, or were indicative of a potentially wider problem. We undertook a qualitative study, conducting 26 semi-structured interviews with research nurses, data managers, trial coordinators and research facilitators involved in the collection and entry of HRQL data in clinical trials, across one primary care NHS trust, two secondary care NHS trusts and two clinical trials units in the UK. We used conventional content analysis to analyze and interpret our data. Our study participants reported (1) inconsistent standards in HRQL measurement, both between, and within, trials, which appeared to risk the introduction of bias; (2), difficulties in dealing with HRQL data that raised concern for the well-being of the trial participant, which in some instances led to the delivery of <b>non-protocol</b> driven co-interventions, (3), a frequent lack of HRQL protocol content and appropriate training and education of trial staff, and (4) that HRQL data collection could be associated with emotional and/or ethical burden. Our findings suggest there are inconsistencies in the standards of HRQL data collection in some trials resulting from a general lack of HRQL-specific protocol content, training and education. These inconsistencies could lead to biased HRQL trial results. Future research should aim to develop HRQL guidelines and training programmes aimed at supporting researchers to carry out high quality data collection...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The microsporidian parasite, Pseudoloma neurophilia, is {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed infectious disease in laboratory populations of the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Infections by P. neurophilia are generally subclinical, however, they can become acute either incidentally or due to experimental immune suppression. <b>Non-protocol</b> induced variation can confound results in laboratory experiments using such fish. As a result, there has been growing interest in sensitive diagnostic assays for P. neurophilia and demand for P. neurophilia specific-pathogen free zebrafish lines among the zebrafish research community. The high prevalence of P. neurophilia in zebrafish provides the opportunity to investigate the progression of infection and transmission characteristics of a microsporidian parasite in a well-developed model vertebrate host species. I developed a real-time PCR-based assay combined {{with the use of}} sonication to improve spore disruption which has a sensitivity that is 10 - 100 times more sensitive than a previously published conventional PCR-based assay. The microsporidium infects ovaries and eggs, thus, I developed a sampling method for the testing of water from spawning fish and demonstrated the utility of testing spawn water, eggs, and sperm for the non-lethal detection of P. neurophilia in adult fish. The presence of P. neurophilia in spawn water and eggs from infected adults provided the initial evidence of vertical transmission of P. neurophilia in zebrafish. Intraovum transmission of P. neurophilia was directly observed by histological screening of larval fish spawned from infected adults and by analyzing eggs using a transmitted light dissecting microscope. The prevalence of intraovum transmission was determined by screening surface-decontaminated eggs from 27 paired spawns using the real-time PCR based assay. Intraovum transmission was detected in 4 of the 27 spawns and the prevalence of intraovum P. neurophilia in the eggs from these spawns was determined to be approximately 1...|$|E

For germinoma, six patients relapsed with germinoma and five with NGGCT (one palliative, one teratoma patient excluded). Five-year overall-survival (OS) for the whole-group (n[*]=[*] 11) was 55 %. Four of six germinoma relapses and two of five relapsing with NGGCT were salvaged; patients were salvaged with either standard-dose-chemotherapy (SDC) and re-irradiation or HDC[*]+[*]AuSCR with/without re-irradiation. Of 45 relapsed NGGCT patients, 13 were excluded (three <b>non-protocol</b> adherence, five teratoma, five palliation). Five-year OS for the remaining 32 relapsed malignant NGGCT patients treated with curative intent was 9 % (95 %CI: 2 - 26 %).

40|$|Background: The use of {{granulocyte}} colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can enable dose {{intensification of}} chemotherapy in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, given its acquisition cost, {{it is important to}} assess its cost effectiveness within a resource-constrained health service. Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness, from the UK NHS perspective, of G-CSF given in addition to doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide (ACE) versus ACE alone in the management of SCLC. Methods: Using data from a UK Medical Research Council trial (LU 19) to assess chemotherapy dose intensification in patients with previously untreated SCLC of any disease extent, a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken. Resource use data, including hospitalisations and <b>non-protocol</b> cancer treatments, were collected during the first 6 -month treatment phase of the trial. Mean costs (Lstg, 2003 values) of managing patients in the two arms of the trial were calculated. Mean survival duration was calculated for the two groups using patient-specific follow-up data collected in the trial. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken, and uncertainty in cost effectiveness was expressed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Results: The use of G-CSF in addition to ACE chemotherapy is more costly (Lstg 4647) but results in longer mean survival duration (0. 20 years; 0. 18 years when discounted). This generates an incremental cost per additional life-year of Lstg 25 _ 816 for ACE + G-CSF therapy. The probability of the addition of G-CSF being cost effective, if decision makers are willing to pay Lstg 30 _ 000 for an additional life-year, is 0. 57. Secondary analysis suggests that cost effectiveness is likely to be sensitive to assumptions about the health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) experienced by patients. Conclusion: Based on data collected in the LU 19 trial, chemotherapy dose intensification using G-CSF in SCLC adds to health service costs but increases survival duration. Its overall cost effectiveness is likely to be finely balanced. Cost-effectiveness, Cost-utility, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Etoposide, Lenograstim, Neutropenia, Small-cell-lung-cancer...|$|E

Innovations in practice have included the introduction of decision making protocols, daily sedation interruptions and new drugs and monitoring technologies. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare protocol-directed sedation management with traditional non-protocol-directed practice in mechanically ventilated patients in an Australian critical care setting. A randomized, controlled trial design was used to study 312 mechanically ventilated adult patients in a general critical care unit at an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to receive protocol directed sedation management developed from evidence based guidelines (n= 153) or usual clinical practice (n= 159). The median (95 % CI) duration of ventilation was 58 hrs (44 – 78 hrs) for patients in the <b>non-protocol</b> group and 79 hrs (56 – 93) for those patients in the protocol group (p= 0. 20). Results were not significant for length of stay in critical care or hospital, the frequency of tracheostomies, and unplanned extubations. A Cox proportional hazards model estimated that protocol directed sedation management was associated with a 22 % decrease (95 % CI: 40 % decrease to 2 % increase, p= 0. 07) in the occurrence of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Few randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effectiveness of protocol-directed sedation outside of North America. This study highlights the lack of transferability between different settings and different models of care. Qualified, high intensity nursing in the Australian critical care setting facilitates rapid, responsive decisions for sedation management and an increased success rate for weaning from mechanical ventilation. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} is a life-saving {{intervention for}} critically ill newborn infants with respiratory failure {{admitted to a}} neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Ventilating newborn infants can be challenging due to small tidal volumes, high breathing frequencies, {{and the use of}} uncuffed endotracheal tubes. Mechanical ventilation has several short-term, as well as long-term complications. To prevent complications, weaning from the ventilator is started as soon as possible. Weaning aims to support the transfer from full mechanical ventilation support to spontaneous breathing activity. To assess the efficacy of protocolized versus non-protocolized ventilator weaning for newborn infants in reducing the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, the duration of weaning, and shortening the NICU and hospital length of stay. To determine efficacy in predefined subgroups including: gestational age and birth weight; type of protocol; and type of protocol delivery. To establish whether protocolized weaning is safe and clinically effective in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation without increasing the risk of adverse events.

We did not find any randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials conducted on weaning from mechanical ventilation in newborn infants. Two randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria on type of study and type of intervention, but only included a proportion of newborns. The study authors could not provide data needed for subgroup analysis; we excluded both studies. Based on the results of this review, {{there is no evidence to}} support or refute the superiority or inferiority of weaning by protocol over <b>non-protocol</b> weaning on duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in newborn infant...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} the possible evolution of emissions of {{primary particulate matter}} in Europe up to 2020 {{as a consequence of}} further economic development and progressing implementation of emission control legislation, in particular of the Protocols that also influence primary emissions of PM. Furthermore, it explores the potential for further PM emission reductions through extensions of the existing protocols (i) to additional countries, (ii) by stricter emission limit values, and (iii) to other sectors. Based on the implementation of the RAINS model as it was used for the Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) program of the European Commission, the report analyses three emission control cases: (i) the situation in the year 2000, (ii) the current legislation case for 2020, and (iii) a case with further control measures. Results are presented for three groups of countries: (i) the 15 old Member States of the European Union, Norway and Switzerland, (ii) the 10 new Member States, and (iii) the other countries in Europe including the European area of Russia and Turkey. The analysis concludes that primary emissions of PM are expected to decline in the future due to current legislation, between 2000 and 2020 by approx. 40 - 45 percent in the EU- 25 and by 8 - 9 percent in the non-EU countries. Tightened emission limit values in a potential revision of the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols would have a relatively small effect on total PM emissions in 2020, especially if the protocols would not receive ratifications from additional Parties. In the EU- 25, PM 2. 5 emissions would decline in 2020 at maximum by an additional 7 percent if the most advanced technical measures were implemented. A significantly larger reduction potential could be harvested through ratification and subsequent implementation of the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols by additional Parties. This could reduce PM 2. 5 emissions in the non-EU countries by up to 25 percent in 2020 compared to the current legislation situation. While the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols contain obligations for PM emissions from certain emission sources, in 2020 the majority of PM emissions is expected to originate from sources for which these protocols do not specify emission limit values. For the EU- 25, about 80 percent of the identified technical potential for further PM reductions emerges from sources that are not covered in the Protocols. In the non-EU countries, more than 60 percent of the technical reduction potential relates to these sources. Approximately two thirds of this technical reduction potential from the <b>non-protocol</b> sectors emerge from small non-industrial combustion sources, especially wood and coal stoves...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Determinar se a acurácia preditiva do julgamento clínico isolado pode ser melhorada com o uso suplementar de um protocolo de desmame objetivo como ferramenta de suporte para a tomada de decisão. MÉTODOS: Estudo prospectivo multicêntrico de coorte realizado em três UTIs clínicas/cirúrgicas. Foram incluídos no estudo todos os pacientes de difícil desmame (falha no primeiro teste de ventilação espontânea [TVE]), sob ventilação mecânica (VM) por mais de 48 h, admitidos em uma das UTIs entre janeiro de 2002 e dezembro de 2005. Os pacientes do grupo protocolo (GP) foram extubados após teste de tubo T de acordo com um protocolo de desmame e comparados com o grupo de pacientes extubados sem o uso do protocolo (GNP). O desfecho primário foi a taxa de reintubação em até 48 h após a extubação. RESULTADOS: Foram incluídos 731 pacientes - 533 (72, 9 %) no GP e 198 (27, 1 %) no GNP. A taxa global de reintubação foi de 17, 9 %. As taxas de sucesso da extubação no GP e no GNP foram 86, 7 % e 69, 6 %, respectivamente (p OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the predictive accuracy of clinical judgment alone can be improved by supplementing it with an objective weaning protocol as a decision support tool. METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study carried out at three medical/surgical ICUs. The study involved all consecutive difficult-to-wean ICU patients (failure in the first spontaneous breathing trial [SBT]), on mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 h, admitted between January of 2002 and December of 2005. The patients in the protocol group (PG) were extubated after a T-piece weaning trial and were compared with patients who were otherwise extubated (<b>non-protocol</b> group, NPG). The primary outcome measure was reintubation within 48 h after extubation. RESULTS: We included 731 patients- 533 (72. 9 %) and 198 (27. 1 %) in the PG and NPG, respectively. The overall reintubation rate was 17. 9 %. The extubation success rates in the PG and NPG were 86. 7 % and 69. 6 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups in terms of age, gender, severity score, or pre-inclusion time on MV. However, COPD was more common in the NPG than in the PG (44. 4 % vs. 17. 6 %; p < 0. 001), whereas sepsis and being a post-operative patient were more common in the PG (23. 8 % vs. 11. 6 % and 42. 4 % vs. 26. 4 %, respectively; p < 0. 001 for both). The time on MV after the failure in the first SBT was higher in the PG than in the NPG (9 ± 5 days vs. 7 ± 2 days; p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of difficult-to-wean patients, the use of a weaning protocol improved the decision-making process, decreasing the possibility of extubation failure...|$|E
