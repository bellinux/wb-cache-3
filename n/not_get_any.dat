5|$|In 1956, Mikan was the Republican {{candidate}} for the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him {{to cash in on}} his life insurance.|$|E
5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. Splitting aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As a general rule, a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for blackjack, the rules for resplitting, the rules for doubling, the rules for multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E

5|$|Four matches {{followed}} the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested {{for the first}} of these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season. He returned for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68. He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> more opportunities to push for selection, as he was rested from the next two matches against Hampshire and Sussex. Australia won the former by eight wickets after conceding a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} the tour, before winning the second by an innings by 325 runs.|$|E

Due to the injuries {{of a lot of}} first team players, Ngwat-Mahop was included in Bayern's squad for a match against Borussia Mönchengladbach, although he did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> playing time in that match. Ngwat-Mahop was also included in Bayern's squad for yet another match, this time against for an away contest against Energie Cottbus. In this match, on 12 May 2007, he was brought in, to replace Ali Karimi in the 88th minute, wearing number 38, to make his full professional debut for FC Bayern Munich, in what was an away 0–3 win for his team. That was his sole appearance in the Bundesliga for the 2006–07 season.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seventh}} inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time southpaw Bill Hallahan, {{who served as}} both a starter and {{reliever}} for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10–4 and did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-day}} rest, the Lady Vols resumed their season with {{three games in}} five days, {{starting}} with their final non-conference opponent, Memphis, on the road. UT started strong, taking a 16–6 lead {{to open up the}} game, only to give it back up. Memphis delighted its home crowd by taking a 38–31 lead with two minutes to go in the half, but Tennessee rallied and took a two-point lead to the locker room. Once again, Tennessee pulled away in the second half, 91–65, behind three players who scored over twenty: Holdsclaw (31), Randall (21), and Catchings (20). The next game was against Auburn, a program that is traditionally competitive within the conference. Once again, Summitt's team started the game strong, leading 32–16 before Auburn woke up, cutting the lead to five by the half. However, the Tigers would <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> closer than this, as Holdsclaw's 39 points helped Tennessee to yet another win, 79–63. The final game of this stretch was the rematch with Vanderbilt, played on President's Day in front of a sellout crowd at the Commodores' quirky Memorial Gymnasium and a national television audience on ESPN. The Commodores started off strong, taking a 16–7 lead in front of their home crowd. However Tennessee responded with seventeen straight points to take the lead, and led by nine at the halftime. As in previous games, the Lady Vols made a big run to open up the second half to put the game out of reach. UT won 91–60, with UT shooting over fifty percent yet again. The final game of the regular season came against LSU, a respectable SEC team which beat the Lady Vols the previous season in Baton Rouge, but still a few seasons away from becoming a national power. Tennessee played well on Senior Night, starting with a 32–8 lead that would never be given up. Tennessee completed the season with a 90–58 win, giving them a perfect 30–0 regular season.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the bonus}} DVD of Still <b>Not</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Any...,</b> while making the CD {{the members of}} Simple Plan thought of many names {{including}} Get Rich or Die Trying, Enema of the State, and In The Zone. The group decided on the name Still <b>Not</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Any...</b> {{for a list of}} explained reasons. The most popular and most likely reason is that the members of Simple Plan thought that they were <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> good reviews, Bouvier once noting that the band only had one recent good review in Alternative Press. Still <b>Not</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Any...</b> was a musical departure from the group's previous album. The band still kept its style of downbeat lyrics matched to upbeat music, but managed to transcend from the standard pop punk genre. Although many of the tracks on this CD still carry the feeling of teen angst that is probably most noticeable in the song [...] "I'm Just a Kid" [...] from No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls, the general slant of this album tends toward slightly deeper and more mature lyrical themes, as well as a more mainstream sound that edges away from the pure pop punk style of the group's last album. Some critics have pointed towards the inclusion of [...] "classic" [...] or [...] "mainstream" [...] rock elements, claiming the album [...] "de-emphasizes punk-pop hyperactivity in favor of straightforward, well-crafted modern rock".|$|R
