5|$|<b>Ness</b> {{returned}} {{in the first}} sequel, Melee, alongside an EarthBound-themed item and battle arena. Lucas of Mother 3 joined <b>Ness</b> in Brawl. Several years after Brawl release, Official Nintendo Magazine wrote that <b>Ness</b> was an unpopular Smash character who should be removed from future installments. <b>Ness,</b> however, {{returned in}} the latest Smash games, 3DS/Wii U, and Lucas was later added as downloadable content. Nintendo also produced <b>Ness</b> and Lucas Amiibo figurines.|$|E

5|$|EarthBound <b>Ness</b> became {{widely known}} from his later {{appearance}} as an ensemble cast {{member in the}} Super Smash Bros. fighting game series, including the original Super Smash Bros. (1999) and its sequels: Melee (2001), Brawl (2008), and 3DS/Wii U (2014). Ness's inclusion in the original release was among its biggest surprises, and renewed Mother series fans' faith in new content from Nintendo. <b>Ness</b> {{was one of the}} game's most powerful characters, according to IGN, if players could perfect his odd controls and psychic powers. In Europe, which did not see an EarthBound release, <b>Ness</b> was better known {{for his role in the}} fighting game than for his original role in the role-playing game.|$|E
40|$|Background: Dengue is a {{notifiable}} {{infectious disease}} in many countries, but under-reporting of cases to National Epidemiological Surveillance Systems (<b>NESSs)</b> conceals the true {{extent of the}} disease burden. The incidence of dengue identified in a cohort study was compared with those reported to <b>NESSs.</b> Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Puerto Rico to assess the efficacy of a tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in children aged 9 – 16 years. The incidence of dengue {{in the placebo group}} was compared with that reported to <b>NESSs</b> in a similar age group (10 – 19 years) from June 2011 to April 2014. Results: Three thousand six hundred and fifteen suspected dengue cases were identified in the study over 13   527 person-years of observation. The overall incidence of confirmed dengue was 2. 9 per 100 person-years (range 1. 5 to 4. 1 per 100 person-years). In the <b>NESSs</b> combined, over 3. 2 million suspected dengue cases were reported during the same period, corresponding to over 1 billion person-years of observation. The incidence of confirmed dengue reported by the <b>NESSs</b> in the same locality where the study took place was 0. 286 per 100 person-years across Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico (range 0. 180 to 0. 734 per 100 person-years). The incidence of confirmed dengue was 10. 0 -fold higher in the study than that reported to <b>NESSs</b> in the same localities (range 3. 5 - to 19. 4 -fold higher). Conclusions: There is a substantial under-reporting of dengue in the <b>NESSs.</b> Understanding the level of under-reporting would allow more accurate estimates of the dengue burden in Latin America...|$|R

5|$|The 2008 {{fighting}} game Super Smash Bros.

Their movesets are similar, with both being based on their psychic powers within their respective games. Official Nintendo Magazine Thomas East thought that both characters should be dropped from future Super Smash Bros. games, adding that Lucas was too similar to <b>Ness.</b> Both characters returned in the sequel, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where <b>Ness</b> is readily available and Lucas is available as downloadable content.|$|E

5|$|The party {{continues}} {{to travel to}} the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, <b>Ness</b> visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, <b>Ness</b> and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness — human emotions — and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence. In a post-credits scene, <b>Ness,</b> whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges <b>Ness</b> to come and find him.|$|E

40|$|We study nonequilibrium steady states (<b>NESSs)</b> {{in quantum}} spin- 1 / 2 chains {{in contact with}} two heat baths at {{different}} temperatures.

This setting allows us to treat <b>NESSs</b> with a nonzero temperature gradient analytically. We develop a perturbation theory for this weak-coupling situation and show a simple condition for the existence of nonzero temperature gradient. This condition is independent of the integrability of the system. Comment: 26 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

At the lower level, the structure is de ned in terms of local quantities (detailed dimensions of the blade structure and stresses).
