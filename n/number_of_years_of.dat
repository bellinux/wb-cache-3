40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine the role of fatigue, depression, and personality traits in males with and without multiple sclerosis (MS) and to investigate the influence of age and the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> education on these constructs. Participants were 30 males with MS and 30 males without MS from Shiraz City, Iran, who were selected following a sampling method. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R), and a demographic questionnaire were applied. Resulting data showed that patients with MS had significantly higher fatigue, depression, and neuroticism compared to control group. Resulting data showed that patients without MS had higher levels of extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness compared with patients with MS. There was no significant effect for age and the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> education on fatigue and depression, nor on the Big Five personality traits...|$|R

25|$|Many renters {{retained}} {{ties to the}} estates, diversifying their household's {{sources of}} income and level of economic security.

25|$|On Thursday 23 November 1978 {{the station}} moved to two new medium wave {{frequencies}} (275m and 285m) which allowed a major increase in transmitter powers and improved {{coverage of the}} UK. 247 metres was passed to Radio 3. The station was on medium wave only until the early 80s, when it took over the Radio 2 FM frequency {{for a number of}} hours on weekend afternoons and late weekday evenings. Eventually the BBC set up an FM channel specifically for Radio 1 and after a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> parallel broadcasting, relinquished the medium wave frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Fiscal {{conservatism}} in the UK {{was arguably}} most popular during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who, after a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> deficit spending under the previous Labour government, advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases {{to balance the}} budget. In 2010, {{as a result of}} the deterioration in the UK's public finances—according to fiscal conservatives caused by another spate of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, the late-2000s recession and by the European sovereign debt crisis—the Liberal Democrat-Conservative Coalition embarked on an austerity programme, featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises, in an attempt to halve the deficit and completely eliminate the structural deficit over the five-year parliament.|$|E

30|$|To some extent, these {{positive}} gaps {{may depend}} on the fact that, even controlling for ISCED level, those in academic school tend to stay longer in school, and therefore have less time to spend in the labour market. To check this, we have depurated county-specific ATEs from the effect due to the differential <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> schooling between each treatment and counterfactual in the aggregation procedure. As shown in Table  11, the estimated gaps decline in most cases, especially among females. The positive premium associated to vocational education, however, remains, especially among males.|$|R
25|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, abbots {{continue}} to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that {{make use of the}} term (some orders of monks, as the Carthusians for instance, have no abbots, only priors). A monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the Pope, and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability—a certain number of monks in vows, a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> establishment, a certain firmness to the foundation in economic, vocational and legal aspects. Prior to this, the monastery would be a mere priory, headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{financial}} difficulties {{which included a}} period in financial administration, QPR was bought by Formula One tycoons and multi-millionaires Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore in a £14million takeover in August 2007. In spending £690,000 to acquire a 69% majority stake in the club from a Monaco-based consortium led by Italian football agent, Antonio Caliendo, Ecclestone spent £150,000 on his 15%, while Briatore bought 54% for £540,000 through a British Virgin Islands registered company, Sarita Capital. In addition, Briatore and Ecclestone were believed to have promised £5million in convertible loan facilities to help buy players and have covered £13million of debt, in a total commitment to the club of around £20million. At the time of purchase, the remaining 31% of shareholders turned down the offer of 1p a share.|$|E
25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Basic Education {{is defined}} as the levels from {{preschool}} to middle school and includes other types of education such as special education, indigenous schools, bilingual school and adult remedial education. The state contains nearly 2,000 schools at this level including 1,225 preschools, 1,392 primary schools and 364 middle schools. Education Media Superior includes high schools, vocational schools and technical schools for those who graduate middle school. There are 115 campuses of this type located in all the municipalities of the state, but it covers less than 80% of the demand for this kind of education. The average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> schooling in the state is 7.5 years, meaning the completion of primary school and {{a little over a year}} in middle school. Levels of schooling increase with younger generations, with nearly all under 5 attending preschool before primary school. Nearly all children of age attend and finish primary school, and nearly all of these begin middle school. However, 8.8% of the population fifteen and older have not enrolled in school at all. 19% have completed primary, 27.2% have completed at least middle school/technical school, 17.9% have completed high school and 14.5 have gone onto higher education.|$|E
25|$|More than 6000 {{occupational}} schemes were {{in place}} in the UK in 2015, of which over 5000 were in deficit. The total shortfall of the schemes was over 360 billion pounds as of February 2015. A large number of UK employers offer their employees access to a defined benefit occupational pension scheme, often based on final salary. In such an arrangement, the employee was typically promised a pension of a fixed proportion of their salary in the period leading up to retirement. The proportion would depend on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> service with the employer. Post retirement increases are typically partly discretionary. The amounts payable are restricted by taxation rules, the maximum being typically either a pension of one-sixtieth of final salary for each year of membership or a pension of one-eightieth of their salary per year of membership plus a tax free lump sum of three-eightieths. With increases in longevity and reductions in interest rates, such arrangements were becoming progressively unaffordable. So following a review by a Pensions Commission, to get a given income, the length it is necessary to pay into a pension in the public sector is linked to longevity.|$|E
500|$|The 1982 strike {{ended with}} a players' revolt against their own union, as some members {{suggested}} that Garvey step down as executive director.

[...] A new five-year agreement was ratified, providing severance packages to players upon retirement, an increase in salaries and post-season pay, and bonuses based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience in the league. Additionally, the NFLPA was allowed to receive copies of all player contracts.|$|E
