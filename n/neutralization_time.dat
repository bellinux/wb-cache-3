40|$|In-medium {{production}} of leading hadrons in hard reactions, carrying the main {{fraction of the}} jet momentum, involves two stages: (i) the parton originated from the hard process propagates through the medium radiating gluons due to the initial hard collision, {{as well as to}} multiple interactions in the medium; (ii) perturbative color neutralization, e. g. picking up an anti-colored parton produced perturbatively, followed by evolution and attenuation of the (pre) hadron in the medium.

This investigation was performed by Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators on Spacelab- 1. A plasma consisting of 10 to the 19 th argon ion-electron pairs was injected into space for 1 ms while an electron beam was also being emitted into space. The electron beam energy and current were as high as 5 keV and 300 mA. While the orbiter potential was positive before the plasma injection and began to decrease during the plasma injection, it was near zero for 6 to 20 ms after the plasma injection.

Average current {{in the single}} {{harmonic}} ring reaches 2. 5 A at extraction, with peak current of 13 A. The background pressure is {{on the order of}} 1 µTorr nitrogen and the ionization cross section is approximately 5 x 10 - 22 m 2 at injection. The resulting <b>neutralization</b> folding <b>time</b> is 0. 5 ms and is much shorter than the 14 ms acceleration time. After 3 ms into the acceleration cycle, measurements indicate the tune is increasing with time. The tune shift from injection to extraction is measured to be + 0. 5.

Infectious pseudotyped viruses expressing envelope glycoproteins representative of the viral quasi-species infecting each patient were tested for sensitivity to neutralization by pools of sera from HIV- 1 chronically infected patients and by an updated panel of 13 human monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (HuMoNAbs). A progressive significantly enhanced resistance to neutralization was observed over calendar time, by both human sera {{and most of the}} HuMoNAbs tested (b 12, VRC 01, VRC 03, NIH 45 - 46 (G 54 W), PG 9, PG 16, PGT 121, PGT 128, PGT 145). Despite this evolution, a combination of two HuMoNAbs (NIH 45 - 46 (G 54 W) and PGT 128) still would efficiently neutralize the most contemporary transmitted variants. In addition, we observed a significant reduction of the heterologous neutralizing activity of sera from individuals infected most recently (2003 - 2007) compared to patients infected earlier (1987 - 1991), suggesting that the increasing resistance of the HIV species to <b>neutralization</b> over <b>time</b> coincided with a decreased immunogenicity.

Thus, we investigated whether sequential plasma from these subjects superinfected with discordant HIV- 1 subtypes, who exhibit broad nAbs against heterologous viruses, also neutralize their discordant early autologous viruses with increasing potency. Comparing the neutralization capacities of sequential plasma obtained before and after superinfection of 4 subjects to those of matched plasma obtained from 4 singly infected control subjects, no difference in the increase in neutralization capacity was observed between the two groups (p = 0. 328).

40|$|Aqueous {{chloride}} {{operations at}} the Los Alamos Plutonium Facility cannot directly dispose of acidic waste solutions because of compatibility problems with existing disposal lines. Consequently, all hydrochloric acid must be neutralized and filtered prior to exiting the facility. From a waste minimization standpoint, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles as the acid neutralization agent is attractive since this process would take a stream destined for transuranic waste {{and use it as}} a reagent in routine plutonium residue processing. Since Los Alamos National Laboratory has several years of experience using magnesium hydroxide as a neutralizing agent for waste acid from plutonium processing activities, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles appeared to be an attractive extension of this activity.

40|$|Evolution {{in time of}} {{radiation}} defects induced by negatively-charged pions and muons in crystals with diamond structures is considered. Negative pions and muons are captured by the nucleus and ionize an appropriate host atom, forming a positively-charged radiation defect in a lattice. As {{a result of an}} evolution in time, this radiation defect transforms into the acceptor center. An analysis of the full evolution process is considered for the first time. Formation of this acceptor center can be divided into three stages. At the first stage, the radiation defect interacts with a radiation trace and captures electrons. The radiation defect is neutralized completely in Si and Ge for a short time t ≤ 10 − 11 s, but in diamond, the complete <b>neutralization</b> <b>time</b> is very large t ≥ 10 − 6 s. At the second stage, broken chemical bonds of the radiation defect are restored. In Si and Ge, this process takes place for the neutral radiation defect, but in diamond, it goes for a positively-charged state. The characteristic time of this stage is t < 10 − 8 s for Si and Ge and t < 10 − 11 s for diamond. After the chemical bonds’ restoration, the positively-charged, but chemically-bound radiation defect in diamond is quickly neutralized because of the electron density redistribution. The neutralization process is characterized by the lattice relaxation time. At the third stage, a neutral chemically-bound radiation defect captures an additional electron to saturate all chemical bonds and forms an ionized acceptor center. The existence of a sufficiently big electric dipolar moment leads to the electron capture. Qualitative estimates for the time of this process were obtained for diamond, silicon and germanium crystals. It was sown that this time is the shortest for diamond (≤ 10 − 8 s) and the longest for silicon (≤ 10 − 7 s...|$|E

40|$|A few broadly {{neutralizing}} antibodies, {{isolated from}} HIV- 1 infected individuals, recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp 41 that are transiently exposed during viral entry. The best characterized, 4 E 10 and 2 F 5, are polyreactive, binding to the viral membrane and their epitopes in the MPER. We present {{a model to}} calculate, for any antibody concentration, the probability that during the pre-hairpin intermediate, the transient period when the epitopes are first exposed, a bound antibody will disable a trivalent gp 41 before fusion is complete. When 4 E 10 or 2 F 5 bind to the MPER, a conformational change is induced that results in a stably bound complex. The model predicts that for these antibodies to be effective at <b>neutralization,</b> the <b>time</b> to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in this conformation, about five minutes or less for 4 E 10 and 2 F 5. We investigate the role of avidity in neutralization and show that 2 F 5 IgG, but not 4 E 10, is much more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment. We attribute this to 2 F 5 interacting more stably than 4 E 10 with the viral membrane. We use the model to elucidate the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and propose {{an extension of the}} model to analyze neutralization data. The extended model predicts the dependencies of IC 50 for neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp 41, and the number of gp 41 bridging the virus and target cell {{at the start of the}} pre-hairpin intermediate.

40|$|Severe, glucocorticoid-resistant asthma {{comprises}} 5 - 7 % {{of patients}} with asthma. IL- 17 is a biomarker of severe asthma, and the adoptive transfer of Th 17 cells in mice is sufficient to induce glucocorticoid-resistant allergic airway disease. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) is an environmental toxin that correlates with asthma severity, exacerbation, and risk of adverse outcomes. Mice that are allergically sensitized to the antigen ovalbumin by exposure to NO 2 exhibit a mixed Th 2 /Th 17 adaptive immune response and eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment to the airway following antigen challenge, a phenotype reminiscent of severe clinical asthma. Because IL- 1 receptor (IL- 1 R) signaling is critical in the generation of the Th 17 response in vivo, we hypothesized that the IL- 1 R/Th 17 axis contributes to pulmonary inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in NO 2 -promoted allergic airway disease and manifests in glucocorticoid-resistant cytokine production. IL- 17 A <b>neutralization</b> at the <b>time</b> of antigen challenge or genetic deficiency in IL- 1 R resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment to the airway following antigen challenge but did not protect against the development of AHR. Instead, IL- 1 R-/- mice developed exacerbated AHR compared to WT mice. Lung cells from NO 2 -allergically inflamed mice that were treated in vitro with dexamethasone (Dex) during antigen restimulation exhibited reduced Th 17 cytokine production, whereas Th 17 cytokine production by lung cells from recipient mice of in vitro Th 17 -polarized OTII T-cells was resistant to Dex. These results demonstrate that the IL- 1 R/Th 17 axis does not contribute to AHR development in NO 2 -promoted allergic airway disease, that Th 17 adoptive transfer does not necessarily reflect an endogenously-generated Th 17 response, and that functions of Th 17 responses are contingent on the experimental conditions {{in which they are}} generated. © 2013 Martin et al...|$|R

Neutralization was dependent on the presence of complement. The species-specific MAb reacted with all 15 serovars by a microimmunofluorescence assay and a dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with heat-treated elementary bodies. On the other hand, this same MAb reacted with all serovars, except those in the C complex, by the dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with viable organisms and neutralized in vitro all 10 serovars tested, except those in the C complex. When neutralization assays were performed in a solution containing Mg 2 +, neutralization by both polyclonal antisera and MAbs was significantly reduced. A dose response to Mg 2 + supplied as MgSO 4 revealed that all concentrations tested from 50 to 800 microM had some effect.

40|$|The {{surface of}} a {{divertor}} plate has usually {{a certain degree of}} ''roughness. '' Depending on the material and the exposure time, the size of surface features may range from submicrons to a fraction of a millimeter, covering a range of spatial scales from well below the electron gyroradius, {rho}{sub e} to significantly above the ion gyroradius, {rho}{sub i}. The plasma approaches the divertor plate along a magnetic field which forms a shallow angle, {alpha} << 1, with the plate surface. Under such circumstances, a significant ''shadowing'' effect takes place, with {{only a small part of}} the surface being accessible to the plasma particles. A methodology is presented that allows one to find the fraction ({var_epsilon}{sub e} and {var_epsilon}{sub i}) of the surface geometrically accessible for the electrons and the ions. At small {alpha}, {var_epsilon}{sub e,i} are typically small, meaning a strong local enhancement of heat and particle fluxes. In a broad range of parameters, {var_epsilon}{sub e}, is also much smaller than {var_epsilon}{sub i}. As the surface features are usually greater than the Debye radius, this leads to the formation of an ambipolar potential which causes reflection of part of the ions from the surface. The resulting albedo of the divertor plate for the plasma ions can be as high as 50 %. Gradual diffusion of the plasma electrons into the zones reflecting the ions, reduces ambipolar fields and brings the ion albedo back to very small values. We present estimates of the time scales governing the <b>neutralization</b> process. This <b>time</b> scale shows itself up in the sheath boundary conditions for non-steady-state perturbations. The effect of surface roughness on secondary electron emission is discussed and it is shown that, depending on the surface structure, it may be smaller or greater than for a perfectly flat plate.
