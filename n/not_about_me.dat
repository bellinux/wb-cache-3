In an NPR review he comments: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> [...] It's totally fictional. [...] It's put together of composites, of conversations I heard—you know, things I saw in movies, newspapers, books, whatever. [...] It comes out as stories. [...] That's it.

Beghe has turned down television appearances to speak about his experiences, stating: [...] "I {{just wanted to make}} sure that the story isn’t about me. It’s <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> It’s about helping others who are still lost in the cult, or toying with the idea of getting involved." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Pinkerton tour, Sharp {{left the}} band and Weezer went on a five-year hiatus. Cuomo moved to simpler songwriting with less {{personal}} lyrics; he stated that Weezer's subsequent albums the Green Album (2001) and Maladroit (2002) were [...] "very intentionally <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Not {{about what was going}} on in my life, at least in a conscious way." [...] Rolling Stone described the [...] "squeaky-clean power pop" [...] Green Album as the [...] "anti-Pinkerton", with album art and a production style that recalled the band's debut.|$|E

500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disappointed by Pinkertons reception, Cuomo {{intended}} {{to return to}} simpler songwriting with less personal lyrics. He stated that Weezer's subsequent albums, the Green Album (2001) and Maladroit (2002), were [...] "very intentionally <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Not {{about what was going}} on in my life, at least in a conscious way." [...] He also developed a greater appreciation for pop music, feeling that its multiple disciplines —including lyrics, improvisation, and image —produce a multifaceted art [...] "that moves people and is important, and relevant to our culture in a way that serious classical music isn't right now." [...] In June 2008, he graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Harvard and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1999 at {{the height}} of Emin's Turner Prize fame, she created a number of monoprint {{drawings}} inspired by the public and private life of Princess Diana for a themed exhibition called Temple of Diana held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as They Wanted You To Be Destroyed (1999) related to Princess Diana's bulimia eating disorder, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as Love Was on Your Side and a description of Princess Diana's dress with puffy sleeves. Other drawings highlighted The things you did to help other people written next to a drawing by Emin of Diana, Princess of Wales in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase [...] "It makes perfect sence to know they killed you" [...] (with Emin's trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they [...] "could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings" [...] and [...] "It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They're quite sentimental I think and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long. It's <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> changing the world; it's just about fun music - pure and simple. Music is so powerful.

60|$|It was {{shortly after}} this that the veteran offered to do second girl's work {{in my house}} if I would take him. The place was not vacant; and as the summer was now drawing to a close, and I feared to be left with him on my hands for the winter, it seemed well {{to speak to him}} upon the subject of economy.

6000|$|The {{streets were}} lined with {{thousands}} of the pleasure-loving people of the city, who had come out {{to see the show}} of the Empress going in state to the cathedral. They were gathered even on the flat house-tops and in the entrances to the public buildings and open places. But the glory of the sight was centred, <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> with my escort of guards and chanting priests, but in Irene's self. Preceded and followed by glittering regiments of soldiers, she drove in her famous golden chariot, drawn by eight milk-white steeds, each of which was led by a bejewelled noble. Her dress was splendid and covered with sparkling gems, and on her yellow hair she wore a crown. As she went the multitudes shouted their welcome, and she bowed to right and left in answer to the shouts. Now and again, however, bands of armed men, clad in a dress of a peculiar colour, emerged from side streets and hooted, crying: ...|$|E

60|$|But to go on: after I had thus secured {{one part}} of my little living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private place, to make such another deposit; when {{wandering}} more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea at a great distance; I had found a perspective glass or two {{in one of the}} seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship; but I had it <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to look any longer: whether it was a boat, or not, I do not know; but as I descended from the hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more without a perspective glass in my pocket.|$|E
