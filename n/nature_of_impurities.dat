The conversion efficiency strongly depends on material details, such as the electronic band structure and the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities.</b> Here we show an anomaly in the inverse spin Hall effect in weak ferromagnetic NiPd alloys near their Curie temperatures with a shape independent of material details, such as Ni concentrations. By extending Kondo's model for the anomalous Hall effect, we explain the observed anomaly as originating from the second-order nonlinear spin fluctuation of Ni moments. This brings to light an essential symmetry difference between the spin Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect which reflects the first order nonlinear fluctuations of local moments. Our finding opens up a new application of the spin Hall effect, by which a minuscule magnetic moment can be detected. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

In ferromagnetic-metallic manganites ($R$=La, Nd, and Sm), a few percent of Fe substitution dramatically decreases the ferromagnetic transition temperature, leading to a spin glass insulating state with short-range charge-orbital correlation. For each $R$ species, the phase diagram as a function of Fe concentration is closely similar to that for $R_{ 0. 6 }$Sr$_{ 0. 4 }$MnO$_{ 3 }$ obtained by decreasing the ionic radius of $R$ site, indicating that Fe doping in the phase-competing region weakens the ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction, relatively to the charge-orbital ordering instability. We have also found a contrastive impact of Cr (or Ru) doping on a spin-glass insulating manganite ($R$=Gd). There, the impurity-induced ferromagnetic magnetization is observed at low temperatures {{as a consequence of the}} collapse of the inherent short-range charge-orbital ordering, while Fe doping plays only a minor role. The observed opposite <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> doping may be attributed to the difference in magnitude of the antiferromagnetic interaction between the doped ions.

Stoichiometrically, it has been calculated that for every 100 kg of biodiesel, 10 kg of glycerol are produced. Based on the technology imposed by various biodiesel plants, glycerol wastes may contain numerous kinds of impurities such as methanol, salts, soaps, heavy metals and residual fatty acids. This fact often renders biodiesel-derived glycerol unprofitable for further purification. Therefore, the utilization of crude glycerol though biotechnological means represents a promising alternative for the effective management of this industrial waste. This review summarizes the effect of various impurities-contaminants that are found in biodiesel-derived crude glycerol upon its conversion by microbial strains in biotechnological processes.

40|$|Effects of {{randomly}} distributed impurities on conductance, spin polarization and electronlocalization in realistic gated semiconductor quantum point contacts (QPCs) have beensimulated numerically. To {{this end}} density functional {{theory in the}} local spin-densityapproximation has been used. In the case when the donor layer is embedded far from thetwo-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) the electrostatic confinement potential exhibits theconventional parabolic form, and thus the usual ballistic transport phenomena take place bothin the devices with split gates alone and with an additional metallic gate on the top. In the opposite case, i. e. when the randomly distributed donors are placed not far away fromthe 2 DEG layer, there are drastic changes like the localization of electrons in the vicinity ofconfinement potential minima which give rise to fluctuations in conductance and resonances. The conductance {{as a function of}} the voltage applied to the top gate for asymmetricallycharged split gates has been calculated. In this case resonances in conductance caused byrandomly distributed donors are shifted and decrease in amplitude while the anomaliescaused by interaction effects remain unmodified. It has been also shown that for a wide QPCthe polarization can appear in the form of stripes. The importance of partial ionization ofthe random donors and the possibility of short range order among the ionized donors areemphasized.
