60|$|General Remarks.--Four of {{the five}} species, forming this genus, though {{certainly}} distinct, are closely allied. I have already shown, that although the characters separating Lepas, Pæcilasma, and Dichelaspis are not very important, yet if they be neglected these three natural little groups must be confounded together. Dichelaspis is much more closely united to Pæcilasma than to Lepas, and, {{as far as the}} more important characters of the animal's body are concerned, there is no important difference between them. Consequently, I at first united Pæcilasma and Dichelaspis, but the latter forms so natural a genus, and is so easily distinguished externally, that I have thought it a pity to sacrifice it. The carina, (which seems to afford better characters than the other valves in Dichelaspis,) from generally running up between the terga and in ending downwards, in three of the species, in a deeply <b>notched</b> <b>disc</b> or fork, more resembles that in Lepas than in Pæcilasma; in the manner, however, in which the imbedded disc, in D. Warwickii and D. Grayii, nearly cuts off the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle, there is a resemblance to Pæcilasma eburnea. In {{the extent to which the}} valves are separated from each other, in the bilobed form of the scuta, (the two segments in Dichelaspis, perhaps, answering to the upper and lateral projections in the scuta of Conchoderma virgata,) and in the basal half of the scuta not descending to the base of the capitulum, there is a considerable resemblance to Conchoderma; in both genera the adductor muscle is attached under the umbones of the scuta; but the structure of the mouth and cirri and caudal appendages shows that the affinity is not stronger to Conchoderma than to Lepas. It appears at first probable, that Dichelaspis would present a much closer affinity to Pæcilasma fissa, in which, owing to the scuta being formed of two segments, there are seven valves, than to any other species of that genus; but in P. fissa the primordial valve is triangular and is situated on the basal segment, whereas, in Dichelaspis, it is elliptic and is seated between the two segments, and is more in connection with the occludent than with the basal segment; and this I cannot but think is an important difference: in other respects, P. fissa shows no more affinity to Dichelaspis than do the other species of the genus. Finally, I may add that Dichelaspis bears nearly the same relation to Pæcilasma, as Conchoderma does to Lepas.|$|E

The study group consisted of 215 Caucasian patients with normal-tension glaucoma with scotoma on single localisation or with preperimetric glaucoma. During regular follow-up visits, ophthalmic examination was carried out and medical history was recorded. The results of the visual field were allocated as paracentral scotomas, arcuate scotomas, peripheral defects, or hemispheric defects. Statistical analysis was conducted with Statistica 12, and p< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results. Risk factors such as <b>notch,</b> <b>disc</b> hemorrhage, general hypertension, migraine, and diabetes were strongly associated with specific visual field defects. Paracentral defect was significantly more frequent for women (p= 0. 05) and patients with disc hemorrhage (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Level set {{methods are}} a general and {{powerful}} technique to represent an object's boundary by {{the means of}} an implicit function that has a specific value on the boundary. This property permits the easy modeling of interfaces between different fluids that interact under prescribed/evolving conditions or that act under specified constraints. The Cactus Code is a general framework for developing computational solutions for a varied class of partial differential equations (PDEs). Amongst many Cactus applications are: numerical relativity, astrophysical flows and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The purpose of this research work is to test and implement level set methods for solving problems with evolving surfaces within the Cactus framework. Once this method is implemented in Cactus it can be further used and upgraded to implement free surface flow and multiphase CFD problems {{making it easier for}} other scientists to conduct research in this field. To benchmark and validate the implementation, a simple problem of a <b>notched</b> <b>disc</b> moving in a rotational velocity field (known as Zalesak’s Problem) is solved using Cactus. A simple implementation of a specific level set method must maintain constant volume of the disc after a full rotation. The results show the importance of reinitializing the signed distance function which is used to represent the interface of the <b>notched</b> <b>disc.</b> The shape of the <b>notched</b> <b>disc</b> changes to decrease sharp corners and becomes smoother {{at the end of a}} full rotation. Although the disc preserves its volume throughout the rotation by using this simple level set method, its shape changes drastically. Implementing advanced versions of simple level set methods 8, 15 that preserve the shape of the interface over arbitrary velocity fields is deferred for future research. The results of Zalesak’s Problem on different grid resolutions and under different flow conditions will be presented to validate as well as verify the correct implementation of the algorithm. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} the small punch (SP) testing technique and standardized impact testing {{lies in the fact}} that the SP tests carried out in accordance with CWA 15627 Small Punch Test Method for Metallic Materials use disc-shaped test specimens without a notch. Especially in tough materials, the temperature dependence of SP fracture energy ESP in the transition area is very steep and lies close to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. In this case, the determination of SP transition temperature TSP can lead to significant errors in its determination. Efforts to move the transition area of penetration testing closer to the transition area of standardized impact tests led to the proposal of the <b>notched</b> <b>disc</b> specimen 8 mm in diameter and 0. 5 mm in thickness with a "U" shaped notch 0. 2 mm deep in the axis plane of the disc. The paper summarizes the results obtained to date when determining the transition temperature of SP tests TSP, determined according to CWA 15627 for material of pipes made of P 92, P 22, and a heat treated 14 MoV 6 - 3 steel in the as delivered state. Although the results obtained confirmed the results of other works in that the presence of a notch in a SP disc is insufficient to increase the transition temperature significantly and certainly not to the values obtained by Charpy testing, comparison of the different behaviors of the alloys tested reveals some evidence that the notch reduces the energy for initiation. This implies that the test on a <b>notched</b> <b>disc</b> is more a test of crack growth and would be a useful instrument if included in the forthcoming EU standard for SP testing.

40|$|Currently used {{conventional}} tillage systems for small-scale vegetable {{production in the}} region of Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico require a considerable amount of hand labor, energy and materials for all activities. Seedbed preparation can require up to 60 % of the total production cost in some systems in Mexico. Further, soil is degraded and eroded due to the system. Conservation tillage may reduce costs and prevent soil degradation, but appropriate tools, such as, no-tillage seeders for small-scale farmers are not available. This papers reports on the design and construction of a prototype of a no-tillage seeder for small-scale conservation tillage using a 2 -wheeled tractor. Three main functions received particular attention: opening of the soil, placing seed and/or fertilizer and closing the slot. Because of its vapor conservation and good seedling emergence, tools to create T-shaped slots were chosen, with adapted depth control and closing and covering devices. A systematic design process was applied in order to reach the required decisions. Function diagrams were defined from where morphologic charts guided the selection of the configuration of the seeder. A preliminary evaluation included testing of two furrow opener disc types (notched and fluted), and four crop residue levels, 0, 30, 60 and 100 %, with respect to performance of the seeder.

The regions at the boundary of the test area (Saint-Venant distance) must be excluded from the evaluation.

In some applications, temperature effects and the heat generated from inelastic deformation can not be neglected in order to achieve a good accuracy of the simulation. In this thesis, a model for simulation of coupled thermo-mechanical problem at large strains is presented. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the mechanical problem is based on a non-associated thermoplastic constitutive model with mixed isotropic and kinematic hardening, while in the second part a non-local Gurson model is considered. The non-associated formulation {{makes it possible to}} model a thermodynamic consistent heat generation that can be adopted to fit experimental data. Simulations with the thermoplastic model show that the heat generation in cyclic loading is completely different if a case with isotropic hardening is compared with kinematic hardening even though the uniaxial mechanical responses as well as the mechanical dissipations are equal. In ductile materials, voids will often nucleate and grow during plastic loading.

The tests were carried out either in pure mode I or in pure mode II conditions by using the cracked chevron <b>notched</b> Brazilian <b>disc</b> (CCNBD) specimen. A total number of 44 CCNBD specimens were tested, half in pure mode I and the rest in pure mode II, to obtain reliable values for mode I and mode II fracture toughness (KIc and KIIc) of the tested marble. The average value of KIc for this marble was approximately about 1. 12 mMPa showing a good agreement with those reported for similar coarse grain marbles. The mode II fracture toughness {{was found to be}} 2. 25 mMPa in average which is approximately twice the mode I fracture toughness. However, the conventional fracture criteria suggest that the mode I fracture toughness should be higher than the mode II fracture toughness, (KIc>KIIc). According to these criteria, the ratio of KIIc / KIc is a figure typically between 0. 63 and 0. 96. It is shown in this paper that enhanced mode II fracture toughness of CCNBD specimen could be due to the effects of highly negative T-stress when the specimen is subjected to mode II. It is also shown that an improved prediction for the ratio KIIc / KIc can be achieved when the effect of T-stress is taken into account...|$|R

An FPZ is a region that involves different types of damage around the pre-existing and/or stress-induced crack tips in engineering materials. This highly damaged area includes micro- and meso-cracks, which emerge prior to the main fracture growth or extension and ultimately coalescence to macrofractures, leading to the failure. The experiments and numerical simulations were designed for this study to investigate the following features of FPZ in rocks: (1) ligament connections and (2) microcracking and its coalescence in FPZ. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan technique was also used to investigate the FPZ behaviour in selected rock specimens. The CT scan {{results showed that the}} fracturing velocity is entirely dependent on the appropriate amount of fracture energy absorbed in rock specimens due to the change of frequency and amplitudes of the dynamic loading. Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) was used to compute the displacements, tensile stress distribution and plastic energy dissipation around the propagating crack tip in FPZ. One of the most important observations, the shape of FPZ and its extension around the crack tip, was made using numerical and experimental results, which supported the CT scan results. When the static rupture and the cyclic rupture were compared, the main differences are twofold: (1) the number of fragments produced is much greater under cyclic loading than under static loading, and (2) intergranular cracks are formed due to particle breakage under cyclic loading compared with smooth and bright cracks along cleavage planes under static loading...|$|R
