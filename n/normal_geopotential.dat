40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{geopotential}} approach to investigate the present Brazilian Height System (BHS). Geopotential numbers are derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite surveying and disturbing potential on selected benchmarks. A model for the disturbing potential {{can be obtained by}} an existing set of spherical harmonic coefficients such as the Earth Gravity Model 2008 (EGM 08). The approach provides absolute evaluation of local <b>normal</b> <b>geopotential</b> numbers (aka spheropotential numbers) related to a so-called World Height System (WHS). To test the validity of the proposed methodology, a numerical experiment was carried out related to a test region in Southern Brazil. The accuracy of the derived geopotential numbers was tested versus local <b>normal</b> <b>geopotential</b> numbers based on 262 GPS/leveling points. The root mean square error (RMSE) value for metric offset of BHS derived from geopotential numbers and the disturbing potential modeling in the test area was estimated to be near 0. 224 meters in the absolute view. Therefore, since these spheropotential numbers are referred to a local datum, these results of comparisons may be an indicator of the mean bias of local network due to the effect of local Sea Surface Topography (SSTop) and possible offset between the unknown reference for the BHS and the quasigeoid model in the region...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) TDRSS data to geopotential model recovery is assessed. Simulated TDRSS one-way and Bilateration Ranging Transponder System (BRTS) observations have been generated and orbitally reduced to form <b>normal</b> equations for <b>geopotential</b> parameters. These <b>normals</b> have been combined {{with those of}} the latest prelaunch T/P gravity model solution using data from over 30 satellites. A study of the resulting solution error covariance shows that TDRSS can make important contributions to geopotential recovery, especially for improving T/P specific effects like those arising from orbital resonance. It is argued that future effort is desirable both to establish TDRSS orbit determination limits in a reference frame compatible with that used for the precise laser/DORIS orbits, and the reduction of these TDRSS data for geopotential recovery...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this diploma {{work is to}} present several height systems and to compare {{calculated}} heights between different height systems in selected leveling line. For the test area part of Primorska from Koper to Kozina was selected. Levelling line is 37, 351 kilometers long and is passing from point 9000 to point 2839, between 9000 and 2839 is 48 other points. Height difference between the lowest and the highest point is 497, 98692 meters. Whole classical geodesy is based on point and the third coordinate of point is height. Heights are very important for geodesy and many other professions, because of {{that is very important}} that when one has to choose gone height system, it has to consider requests of many professions. Which height system is better to choose and what advantages or disadvantages has one height system, was common thread of my diploma work. We have determined heights of the chosen levelling line in different height systems in the test area. These are: <b>normal</b> orthometric heights, <b>geopotential</b> number, dynamic heights, orthometric heights and normal heights. The official height system in Slovenia are normal orthometric heights. The official height system in many European countries are normal heights and this height system would be most appropriate and useful for Slovenia too. Normal heights satisfy all five basic conditions for ideal height system. Normal heights are also very good connected with ellipsoidal heights...|$|R
