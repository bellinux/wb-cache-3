40|$|We {{describe}} the binding characteristics of two <b>natural</b> <b>borates</b> (colemanite and ulexite) to calf thymus DNA by UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and a competitive DNA binding assay. Our {{results suggest that}} colemanite and ulexite interact with calf thymus DNA under a non-intercalative mode of binding and do not alter the secondary structure of the DNA helix. The FT-IR spectroscopy {{results indicate that the}} two borates might interact with DNA through sugar-phosphate backbone binding. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
50|$|Béhierite is a {{very rare}} mineral, a <b>natural</b> {{tantalum}} <b>borate</b> of the formula (Ta,Nb)BO4. Béhierite {{is also one of}} the most simple tantalum minerals. It contains simple tetrahedral borate anions, instead of more common among minerals, planar BO3 groups. It forms a solid solution with its niobium-analogue, schiavinatoite. Both have zircon-type structure (tetragonal, space group I41/amd) and are found in pegmatites. Béhierite and holtite are minerals with essential tantalum and boron.|$|R

40|$|Borate {{minerals}} form in a {{wide variety}} of geologic environments and their derivatives have many large-scale industrial applications. However, various analytical obstacles make boron itself difficult to study. 11 B MAS NMR has long been applied to this task, but previous efforts have largely failed to resolve crystallographically distinct sites with the same coordination number. This shortcoming limits attempts to correlate NMR parameters with local structure and hence, the utility of NMR as a probe of detailed structural aspects. We find that the use of ultrahigh-field NMR enhances the resolution of both three- and four-coordinate boron in some cases, providing new analytical opportunities. A collection of <b>natural</b> <b>borate</b> minerals was analyzed by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy at 14. 1 and 21. 1 T. The 11 B MAS NMR spectrum of ulexite (CaNaB 5 O 9 (OH) 6 · 5 H 2 O) shows only a single three-coordinate boron site at 14. 1 T, despite having two such sites in the crystal structure (Figure 1). At 21. 1 T, two BO 3 sites are apparent and can be fit to obtain distinct NMR parameters. Similarly, the 11 B MAS spectrum of howlite (Ca 2 B 5 SiO 9 (OH) 5) at 14. 1 T exhibits a complex pattern in the four-coordinate region, but all four crystallographically inequivalent sites can be detected in the 21. 1 T spectrum (Figure 2). This resolution permits peak assignments according to the local geometry and/or connectivity.

40|$|Freshwater Lake Ulubat (c. 1. 5 m {{deep and}} c. 138 km 2) {{receives}} sediment from a 10. 414 km 2 {{area in the}} seismically active Susurluk Drainage Basin (SDB) of NW Turkey. The B and trace element contents of the lake infill {{seem to be a}} link between the fresh landforms of the SDB and the lacustrine sediment. Deposition in Lake Ulubat has been 1. 60 cm. a- 1 for the last 50 a according to radionucleides; however the sedimentation rate over the last millennium was 0. 37 cm. a- 1 based on 14 C dating. The B content of the lacustrine infill displays a slight increase at 0. 50 m and a drastic increase at 4 m depth occurring c. 31 a and c. 1070 a ago respectively. Probably the topmost change corresponds to the start of open mining in the SDB and the second one to the <b>natural</b> trenching of <b>borate</b> ore-deposits. These dates also show indirectly a 1. 4 cm. a- 1 erosion rate during the last millennium as the borate beds were trenched up to 15 m. By extrapolation, it is possible to establish that the formation of some of the present morphological features of the southern Marmara region, especially river incision, began in the late Pleistocene, and developed especiall...|$|R
