5|$|Benjamin Lewis Crosby, Jr. (March 22, 1868 – December 29, 1892) was an American {{football}} player, coach, and law student. Born in Halcott Centre, New York, Crosby attended Yale University {{beginning in}} 1889; while there, {{he was a}} popular student and sportsman. He was a two-year starter {{on the football team}} and a backup on the crew team. During his junior year, he was replaced on the football team by freshman Frank Hinkey and never returned to a starting position. The remainder of Crosby's time at Yale was successful and he enrolled at the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Law</b> School after graduation.|$|E

This began a two-month search process to fill her vacant Senate seat. Under <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>law,</b> the governor appoints a replacement.

5000|$|The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> University <b>Law</b> Review {{was founded}} in 1924 as a {{collaborative}} effort between law students {{and members of the}} local bar. [...] Its first editor-in-chief was Paul D. Kaufman. Between 1924 and 1950, it was variously known as the Annual Review of the <b>Law</b> School of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> University, the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> University <b>Law</b> Quarterly Review, and the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> University <b>Law</b> Review. Since 1950, it has been known exclusively as the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> University <b>Law</b> Review.|$|R

Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of American Indian Movement (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents. The motion (argued March 2)—which also {{asked the court to}} require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged COINTELPRO involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, {{ruling that}} the New York State Legislature was not {{required}} to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material. The Court said the New York State Legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>law.</b> He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated {{the impact of the}} decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths.|$|E

Flywheel (a crooked lawyer) and Chico as Flywheel's assistant, Emmanuel Ravelli (a half-wit who Flywheel uses as a fall-guy). The series was originally titled Beagle, Shyster, and Beagle, with Groucho's character named Waldorf T. Beagle, until a real lawyer from New York named Beagle contacted NBC and threatened to file a lawsuit unless the name was dropped. Many of the episodes' plots were partly or largely based upon Marx Brothers films.|$|E

Later he served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and as Special Assistant Attorney General of New York. In 1954 Harlan was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and a year later president Dwight Eisenhower nominated Harlan to the United States Supreme Court following the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1891 season, both Crosby and John A. Hartwell, {{the other}} {{starting}} end, who later followed Crosby as Navy football coach, {{were injured in}} a game. While observing a team practice, Hartwell and Crosby noticed the play of backup end Frank Hinkey. After watching Hinkey for a time, Hartwell {{decided to return to}} practicing for fear of losing his starting position; Crosby did not consider this necessary. By the next game, Hinkey had replaced Crosby as the starting end and he did not regain the position. The team finished the season with a perfect record and would be retrospectively named national champions. Crosby remained popular through his senior year at the university, {{and he was one of}} three graduates presented with a class award. Upon graduation from the school, Crosby enrolled in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Law</b> School and joined a law office in New York City.|$|E
5|$|In {{his younger}} years, Harlan {{attended}} The Latin School of Chicago. He later attended two boarding {{high schools in}} the Toronto Area, Canada: Upper Canada College and Appleby College. Upon graduation from Appleby, Harlan returned to the U.S. and in 1916 enrolled at Princeton University. There, {{he was a member of}} the Ivy Club, served as an editor of The Daily Princetonian, and was class president during his junior and senior years. After graduating from the university in 1920, he received a Rhodes Scholarship, which he used to attend Balliol College, Oxford. He studied jurisprudence at Oxford for three years, returning from England in 1923. Upon his return to the United States, he began work with the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland (now known as Dewey & LeBoeuf), one of the leading law firms in the country, while studying law at <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Law</b> School. He received his LL.B. degree in 1924 and earned admission to the bar in 1925.|$|E
40|$|Navigating {{the laws}} of how to {{properly}} submit a petition {{to be placed on}} a local election ballot can often be quite complex and contain many technicalities that can render the petition moot. As a result, many petitioners who lack the expertise in filling out all the requisite forms are left off the ballot. This Note examines the statutes and court decisions that have led to the current body of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>laws</b> governing the designation petition process and discusses the constitutionality of removing a petitioner from a primary ballot due their omission in a cover sheet. The Note proceeds by comparing the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>laws</b> with {{the laws of}} other States and concludes by recommending amendments to the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> designating petition <b>law</b> that would make it more fair to those who lack the expertise in its technicalities...|$|R

5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>law</b> at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, and within a few years more buildings had gone up, {{just in time for the}} construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E
5|$|In October 1892, {{shortly after}} he began {{attending}} <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Law</b> School, Crosby was invited by former Yale coach Walter Camp to live in Annapolis, Maryland {{to serve as the}} coach for the United States Naval Academy football team; the program was acting in response to the appointment of Crosby's former teammate, Henry L. Williams, as coach for the Army team. Navy had first extended the offer to Camp, who suggested Crosby would fulfil the role more effectively. Crosby accepted the invitation, and became the second head coach in Navy history and the first who was independent of the program. The previous coach, Vaulx Carter, attended the academy, and had revived the program. Crosby's strategy for practices {{was one of the most}} intensive used at the academy during its early years; after classes every day, the team played two 45 minute games against a team of 22 backup players, followed immediately by a long swimming session in a cold pool. Shortly before the season began, Crosby hired former St. John's College, Johns Hopkins, and Lehigh player Paul Dashiell to serve as his assistant coach.|$|E
25|$|In New York, {{the first}} case to adopt Wood's rule was Martin v New York Life Ins Co in 1895. Bartlett J {{asserted}} that <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>law</b> now followed Wood's treatise, which meant that an employee who received $10,000, paid in a salary over a year, could be dismissed immediately. The case did not make reference to the previous authority. Four years earlier, in 1891, Adams v Fitzpatrick had held that <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>law</b> followed the general practice of requiring notice similar to pay periods. However, subsequent New York cases continued to follow the at-will rule into the early 20th century.|$|E
