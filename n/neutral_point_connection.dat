40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} operation of a three-phase pulsewidth modulation rectifier system formed by the star-connection of three single-phase boost rectifier modules (-Rectifier) without a mains <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> <b>connection.</b> The current forming operation of the-Rectifier is analyzed and it is shown that the phase current has the same high quality and low ripple as the Vienna Rectifier. The isolated star point of-Rec-tifier results in a mutual coupling of the individual phase module outputs {{and has to be}} considered for control of the module dc link voltages. An analytical expression for the coupling coefficients of the-Rectifier phase modules is derived. Based on this expres-sion, a control concept with reduced calculation effort is designed and it provides symmetric loading of the phase modules and solves the balancing problem of the dc link voltages. The analysis also provides insight that enables the derivation of a control concept for two phase operation, such {{as in the case of}} a mains phase failure. The theoretical and simulated results are proved by experimental analysis on a fully digitally controlled, 5. 4 -kW prototype. Index Terms—Pulsewidth modulation (PWM). I...|$|E

Nowadays, the choice of <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> grounding mode mainly relies on operation experiences or theoretical analysis which could not give a direct view {{of the dynamics of}} electric power system during disturbances.

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} adaptive grid MHD simu-lation of {{the solar}} wind interaction with comet Halley shows that the boundary of the diamagnetic cavity is a closed, well defined surface. On this surface magnetic field <b>neutral</b> <b>points</b> should exist, and indeed, two O-type <b>neutral</b> <b>points</b> were found at the cavity boundary. In addition, the transi-tion from closed magnetic field lines around the diamagnetic cavity to open field lines in the comet tail requires the for-mation {{of at least one}} X-type <b>neutral</b> <b>point.</b> Such a <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> was also found in the simulated cometary ionosphere downstream from the cavity. The results of numerical simu-lations show that the plasma density near the <b>neutral</b> <b>points</b> increases significantly.

40|$|Multiphase (n-phase) {{machines}} are often designed with l sub-windings on stator, each having k phases, {{and the machine}} is typically operated with l isolated <b>neutral</b> <b>points.</b> However, such a machine can also operate with a single <b>neutral</b> <b>point,</b> which improves the fault-tolerant properties. When a machine is inverter supplied, low order harmonics may be present due to the low switching frequency and nonlinear inverter properties. Moreover, low order zero-sequence harmonics can be deliberately injected to increase dc bus voltage utilisation. This paper investigates a phenomenon {{that has not been}} reported so far in relation to asymmetrical multiphase machines with a single <b>neutral</b> <b>point,</b> namely that the presence of balanced low order harmonics in leg voltages produces unbalanced phase voltage harmonics and consequently unbalanced phase current harmonics. By analysing the <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> (common mode) voltage harmonics, imbalance in the phase voltage harmonics is explained. Analytical expressions for <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> voltage harmonics and phase voltage harmonics are provided for asymmetrical machine configurations with a single <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> having arbitrary numbers of sub-windings and sub-winding phases.

In multilevel inverter, thethree basic types of topologies used are diode clamped inverter (<b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> clamped), capacitorclamped (flying capacitor) and cascaded multi cell with separate dc sources.

40|$|It is {{generally}} held that protanopes and deuteranopes see only regions of blues and yellows in the visible spectrum, with an achromatic <b>point,</b> called the <b>neutral</b> <b>point,</b> separating these regions. Considerations of a zone model of color {{vision for the}} dichromatic observer led us to predict that a reduced form of red/green discrimination would allow equilibrium blue judgements {{to be made by}} protanopes. We show that protanopes can make equilibrium blue determinations with as much reliability as they make <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> settings. Our results indicate that protanopes but not deuteranopes are able to rely on a reduced form of red/green discrimination in the short wavelength part of the spectrum. Protanopes describe wavelengths longer than the <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> as yellow. Between the <b>neutral</b> <b>point</b> and equilibrium blue, different wavelengths are described as having varying aspects of blue and green; and short of equilibrium blue they appear reddish blue.

The results of our experiments showing that the protanopic equilibrium blue is invariant with intensity variations, {{as it is in the}} trichromat, add support to the idea of a reduced form of red/green discrimination for protanopes.
