The flatness degree and the edge information are effectively {{used to estimate}} the noise volume. We propose a <b>noise</b> <b>estimator</b> for reducing noise in the AWGN (additive white gaussian noise) corrupted images using three intermediate image maps (FGM(flatness gray map), FIM(flatness index map), NEM(noise estimate map)). The proposed <b>noise</b> <b>estimator</b> is fed into the conventional {{noise reduction}} filters as a pre-processor.

In this paper, {{we propose}} a new spatial {{subtraction}} array (SSA) structure which includes independent component analysis (ICA) -based <b>noise</b> <b>estimator.</b> Recently, SSA {{has been proposed}} to realize noise-robust hands-free speech recognition. In SSA, noise reduction is achieved by subtracting the estimated noise power spectrum from the noisy speech power spectrum. The conventional SSA uses null beamformer (NBF) as a <b>noise</b> <b>estimator,</b> but NBF suffers from the adverse effect of microphone-element errors and room reverberations in real environments. To improve the problem, we newly replace NBF with ICA which can adapt its own separation filters to the element error and the reverberation. The affections by the element error and the reverberation can be mitigated in the proposed ICA-based <b>noise</b> <b>estimator.</b> Experimental results reveal that the accuracy of noise estimation by ICA outperforms that of NBF, and speech recognition performance of the proposed method overtakes that of the conventional SSA...|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} a wide range of subspace algorithms for noise PSD estimation, we compare the performance of the principal-component-analysis based estimator, i.e., (PCAB), with the <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> based on the interaural transfer function (ITFB), [41], and with the <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> relying on cross-relation error minimization (CRB) [42], therein considering the diffuse noise assumption.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, the <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> in (13) and the {{previous}} method in [17] are equivalent.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> in Fig.  2 {{was evaluated}} {{in comparison to}} the previous methods including the single-channel SPP-based <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> (SC-SPP) [5], the improved dual-channel <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> (ImNPSD) [17], the dual-channel <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> (DC-NPSD) [6], and the bias-corrected blocking method of the interaural transfer function (BB-ITF) [15]. The proposed <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimator</b> in (23) is referred to as “Prop” in all plots. To make the comparison consistent, the smoothing factor for the estimation of auto-and cross-PSDs was fixed at α[*]=[*] 0.65 in all tested algorithms. As mentioned in Section 4, long-term smoothing can reduce the estimator variance, but at the same time, short-term smoothing is required to capture the fast time-varying statistics of the signals. Thus, as a compromise between these two contradictory requirements, we experimentally chose a smoothing factor that can balance the tracking performance and LogErr. BB-ITF was implemented using the fast least-mean square (FLMS) algorithm [55] based on a 256 -tap prediction error filter. The forgetting factor for signal power smoothing was set to 0.9, and the step size for updating the weight was 0.1. We also used a causality delay of 32 samples to account for the largest possible ITD of the binaural system. The same error signal, i.e., (4 a) in [15] was utilized to implement ImNPSD.|$|R

Using local <b>noise</b> <b>estimator</b> modified by Gaussian weight, we define an energy functional, drive the final equation and use it in an iterative denoising process. We show that although Laplacian is known as edge detector, {{it can be used}} for noise removal purposes. The algorithm is implemented in section 4. In section 5, results are shown and described. Moreover, figures of the denoising method are shown in comparison with Wiener, ROF and BM 3 D filters based on TV value and visual performance.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, a {{class of}} {{binaural}} <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimators</b> based on speech blocking has been discussed. The <b>noise</b> PSD <b>estimators</b> rely on adaptive target speech cancelation. The comparison reveals individual strengths and weaknesses. For instance, ITFB provides binaural noise estimation, {{which is one of}} the key factors toward achieving a performance similar to the ideal reference noise reduction. The CRB, in turn, provides the lowest speech leakage, which is another key factor. These factors are in line with our observations from the real-time evaluation.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a Laplacian-based image filtering method. Using a local <b>noise</b> <b>estimator</b> function in an energy functional minimizing scheme {{we show that}} Laplacian that has been known as an edge detection function {{can be used for}} noise removal applications. The algorithm can be implemented on a 3 x 3 window and easily tuned by number of iterations. Image denoising is simplified to the reduction of the pixels value with their related Laplacian value weighted by local <b>noise</b> <b>estimator.</b> The only parameter which controls smoothness is the number of iterations. Noise reduction quality of the introduced method is evaluated and compared with some classic algorithms like Wiener and Total Variation based filters for Gaussian noise. And also the method compared with the state-of-the-art method BM 3 D for some images. The algorithm appears to be easy, fast and comparable with many classic denoising algorithms for Gaussian noise.|$|E

We show that the estimator is consistent for d in (0, 1), asymptotically normal for d in (0, 3 / 4), and if the spectral density is sufficiently smooth near frequency zero, the rate of convergence can become arbitrarily close to the parametric rate, sqrt(n). A Monte Carlo study reveals that the proposed estimator performs well in the presence of a serially correlated perturbation term.

40|$|A noise {{measurement}} in the Swedish Ringhals- 2 PWR {{was performed in}} January 2002 by using twelve gamma-thermometers and two in-core neutron detectors, all located on the same axial level in the reactor. The gamma-thermometers are very versatile tools since they allow estimating the core-averaged moderator temperature noise throughout the core. This core-averaged temperature noise was then used to estimate the MTC by noise analysis, via a new MTC <b>noise</b> <b>estimator.</b> It was shown that whatever {{the location of the}} neutron detector might be, the MTC is always correctly estimated by this new MTC <b>noise</b> <b>estimator,</b> without any calibration to a known value of the MTC prior to the {{noise measurement}}. For the purpose of comparisons, the MTC was also estimated by using a single gamma-thermomemeter and a single core-exit thermocouple, together with an in-core neutron detector. In such cases, the WC was systematically underestimated, with a stronger bias for the core-exit thermocouple than for the gamma-thermometer. This shows that the main reason of the MTC underestimation by noise analysis in all the experimental work until now was due to the radially non-homogeneous temperature noise throughout the core.
