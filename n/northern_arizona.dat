50|$|Hesperosuchus was a {{terrestrial}} animal, where it's {{speed and}} ability to run fast is the most advantageous as a fitness trait. <b>Northern</b> <b>Arizona's</b> landscape during the Triassic period was surrounded by numerous bodies of water like lakes and streams. This supports that Hesperosuchus likely lived close to water although being a full on land dwelling animal. The ganoid scales found in the general area where Hesperosuchus was found belong to fresh water fish of the Triassic period, belonging to the genus Semionolus or Lepidolus, which lived in shallow lakes and streams. The phytosaur teeth and small sterospondyl vertebrae found near Hesperosuchus support the presence of lakes or streams crossing a flood plain. Also the many small teeth found, which some, belong to amphibians of the Triassic period supports the occupying of near water habitats.|$|R
