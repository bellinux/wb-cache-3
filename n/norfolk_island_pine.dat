5000|$|Photographer William Boag {{travelled}} Queensland between 1870 and 1878 {{with his}} horse-drawn darkroom, undertaking commissions, photographing places across Queensland, and selling prints of [...] "spec" [...] photos. In November 1871 Boag travelled the southern shores of Moreton Bay. Amongst the photographs he took {{there is one}} showing a pair of <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Pines</b> - juvenile, but well above house height - standing where Shore Street begins to rise as it heads northwards to the Point. These {{are thought to be}} the two landmark <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Pines</b> on Bell's property.

25|$|In 1903, {{workers for}} the Commercial Pacific Cable Company took up {{residence}} on the island {{as part of the}} effort to lay a trans-Pacific telegraph cable. These workers introduced many non-native species to the island, including the canary, cycad, <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>pine,</b> she-oak, coconut, and various deciduous trees; along with ants, cockroaches, termites, centipedes, and countless others.|$|E
25|$|Norfolk Island has 174 native plants; 51 of {{them are}} endemic. At least 18 of the endemic species are rare or threatened. The Norfolk Island palm (Rhopalostylis baueri) and the smooth tree-fern (Cyathea brownii), the tallest tree-fern in the world, are common in the Norfolk Island National Park but rare {{elsewhere}} on the island. Before European colonization, most of Norfolk Island was covered with subtropical rain forest, the canopy of which was made of Araucaria heterophylla (<b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>pine)</b> in exposed areas, and the palm Rhopalostylis baueri and tree ferns Cyathea brownii and C. australis in moister protected areas. The understory was thick with lianas and ferns covering the forest floor. Only one small tract (5km2) of rainforest remains, which was declared as the Norfolk Island National Park in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Romantic {{descriptions}} of the beauty, mild climate, and fertile soil of Norfolk Island in the South Pacific led the British government to establish a subsidiary settlement of the New South Wales colony there in 1788. It was hoped that the giant <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>pine</b> trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might {{provide the basis for}} a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy. However, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807. The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.|$|E

25|$|The Colony's first Surveyor General John Septimus Roe {{recognised}} {{the qualities}} of the area and tried to protect it, by identifying the land to be set aside for public purposes. By 1835 Roe's protection was overturned and the first shipment of five tonnes of Jarrah was cut on Mt Eliza, becoming the colony's first export. Logging in the area continued until 1871 when Roe's successor Malcolm Fraser persuaded the then Governor Weld to set aside 1.75km² as public reserve. In 1890 this was enlarged to its current size by Sir John Forrest, {{the first president of}} the Board appointed under the Parks and Reserves Act 1895. Forrest planted the first tree, a <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Pine</b> (Araucaria heterophylla), and other trees were introduced to the site, Eucalyptus ficifolia and exotic species of Pinus; few of these were successful due to lack of irrigation.|$|E

'August 14.--I marked out to-day {{some pretty}} places {{for the two}} wooden houses for the [...] "Southern Cross" [...] sailors at Kohimarama (Focus of Light), a quiet retired spot, with a {{beautiful}} sparkling beach, the schooner lying just outside the little bay {{a third of a}} mile off. Forty or fifty acres of flat pasturage, but only sixteen properly cleared, and then an amphitheatre of low hills, covered with New Zealand vegetation. I passed fine ferns to-day quite thirty feet in the stem, with great spreading-fronds, like branches of the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>pine</b> almost.|$|E
60|$|May 3.--Breakfasted at my {{old friend}} Gally Knight's, with whom, in former days, I used to make little parties to see poor Monk Lewis. After breakfast I drove to Lee and Kennedy's, and {{commissioned}} seeds and flowers for about £10, including some specimens of the Corsican and other pines. Their collection is very splendid, but wants, I think, the neatness that I would have expected in the first nursery-garden in or near London. The essentials were admirably cared for. I saw one specimen of the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>pine,</b> the only one, young Lee said, which has been raised from all the seed that was sent home. It is not treated conformably to its dignity, for they cut the top off every year to prevent its growing out {{at the top of}} the conservatory. Sure it were worth while to raise the house alongst with the plant.|$|E

6000|$|The {{day after}} this, namely May 15, the Bishop and Mr. Patteson rowed into Cascade Bay, Norfolk Island, amid a heavy surf, but they saw no cascade, as {{there had been}} no rain for a long time; and there were only rocks surmounted by pine trees, no living creature, no landing- place, as they coasted along. At last they saw a smooth-looking rock with an iron staple, and {{concluding}} that it was the way of approach, they watched their time, and through the surf which broke over it they leapt on it, and dashed ashore before the returning swell caught them. They walked inland, and met a man, one of twelve convicts who had been left behind to receive the Pitcairners, who had not yet arrived, but were on their way from their original island in H.M.S. 'Juno.' The vegetation and climate struck them as beautiful; there were oranges, lemons, sweet potatoes, and common potatoes, and English vegetables, and the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>pine</b> growing to a great height: 'but,' writes Coley, 'it is coarser in the leaf and less symmetrical in shape than I had expected. I thought to have seen the tree of Veitch's nursery garden on a scale three or four times as large, and so I might have done in any of the gardens; but as they grow wild in the forest, they are not so very different from the more common fir tribe.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Every {{morning for}} {{the next two or three}} weeks the stroke of ten found Norris, unkempt and haggard, at the lawyer's door. The long day and longer night he spent in the Domain, now on a bench, now on the grass under a <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>pine,</b> the {{companion}} of perhaps the lowest class on earth, the Larrikins of Sydney. Morning after morning, the dawn behind the lighthouse recalled him from slumber; and he would stand and gaze upon the changing east, the fading lenses, the smokeless city, and the many-armed and many-masted harbour growing slowly clear under his eyes. His bed-fellows (so to call them) were less active; they lay sprawled upon the grass and benches, the dingy men, the frowsy women, prolonging their late repose; and Carthew wandered among the sleeping bodies alone, and cursed the incurable stupidity of his behaviour. Day brought a new society of nurserymaids and children, and fresh-dressed and (I am sorry to say) tight-laced maidens, and gay people in rich traps; upon the skirts of which Carthew and [...] "the other black-guards"--his own bitter phrase--skulked, and chewed grass, and looked on. Day passed, the light died, the green and leafy precinct sparkled with lamps or lay in shadow, and the round of the night began again--the loitering women, the lurking men, the sudden outburst of screams, the sound of flying feet. [...] "You mayn't believe it," [...] says Carthew, [...] "but I got to that pitch that I didn't care a hang. I have been wakened out of my sleep to hear a woman screaming, and I have only turned upon my other side. Yes, it's a queer place, where the dowagers and the kids walk all day, and at night you can hear people bawling for help as if it was the Forest of Bondy, with the lights of a great town all round, and parties spinning through in cabs from Government House and dinner with my lord!" ...|$|E
