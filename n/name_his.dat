5|$|Alt Clut (named {{after the}} Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, the Medieval {{capital of the}} Strathclyde region) may have had its origins with the Damnonii people of Ptolemy's Geographia.

From Patrick's letter it is clear that Ceretic was a Christian, and it is likely that the ruling class of the area were also Christians, at least in <b>name.</b> <b>His</b> descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba.|$|E

5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to <b>name</b> <b>his</b> discovery, Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.

This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E

5|$|Edward is an Anglo-Saxon name, {{and was not}} {{commonly}} given {{among the}} aristocracy of England after the Norman conquest, but Henry was devoted to the veneration of Edward the Confessor, and decided to <b>name</b> <b>his</b> firstborn son after the saint.

Henry of Almain would remain a close companion of the prince, both through the civil war that followed, and later during the crusade.

5|$|Higginbotham's {{desire to}} play regular first-team {{football}} led to him joining Derby County for a £2million fee – {{a large sum}} for a young player with just four top-flight appearances to his <b>name.</b> <b>His</b> decision to leave Manchester United was praised by the player he failed to displace, Denis Irwin. Higginbotham made his debut in a 2–2 draw with Southampton, and had a good start to his Derby career until he was substituted at half-time during his third appearance after struggling to contain Everton's Niclas Alexandersson. Manager Jim Smith soon switched to a new system without any full-backs but Higginbotham adapted well to playing on the left-side of a three-man defence. Derby avoid relegation out of the Premier League on the penultimate day of 2000–01 with a 1–0 victory over former his club Manchester United at Old Trafford.|$|E
