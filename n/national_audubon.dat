5|$|Breeding {{colonies of}} Atlantic puffins provide an {{interesting}} spectacle for both bird watchers and tourists. For example, four thousand puffins nest {{each year on}} islands {{off the coast of}} Maine and visitors can view them from tour boats which operate during the summer months. There is a Project Puffin Visitor Centre in Rockland providing information on the birds and their lives, and on the other conservation projects being undertaken by the <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society who run the centre. Similar tours operate in Iceland, the Hebrides, and Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} the <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators.|$|E

5|$|The Sierra Club and the San Diego <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society, {{as well as}} {{some other}} groups, sued the FHWA, USACE, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to block the {{construction}} of the toll road over alleged breaches of the Endangered Species Act in October 2001; however, a San Diego judge sided with the contractor and the federal government in March 2003. The environmental concerns were resolved by the developer for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year; in return, the environmental groups agreed not to appeal the court decision. Some community groups also opposed the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{population of}} brown and Peruvian pelicans {{is estimated at}} 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru. The <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society estimates the global population of the brown pelican at 300,000. Numbers of brown pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely {{as a consequence of}} environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970. With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972, its population has recovered, and it was delisted in 2009.|$|E

50|$|In 1895, Audubon {{societies}} {{were organized}} in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, {{and during the}} next few years, bird lovers in many other states followed suit. St. Louis Audubon Society (SLAS) was established in 1916 as the St Louis Bird Club. In 1944, the Bird Club became the first local Audubon chapter in the United States. The <b>national</b> committee of <b>Audubon</b> societies was organized at a meeting held in Washington, D.C. in 1902. 1905 saw the organization of the <b>National</b> Association of <b>Audubon</b> Societies for the Protection of Wild Birds and Animals; William Dutcher was president, and T. Gilbert Pearson was secretary and financial agent. During this time, Albert Willcox provided financial support, more than $331,072 in 1905 and 1906. At the end of 1906, the Association had an interest-bearing endowment fund of more than $336,000 and an income from other sources of approximately $9,000.|$|R
5|$|After {{recovering}} from serious poisoning inflicted by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb (in From Russia, with Love) the MI6 agent James Bond is sent by his superior, M, on an undemanding {{mission to the}} British colony of Jamaica. He is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6's Station J in Kingston, and his secretary. Bond is briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Doctor Julius No, a reclusive Chinese-German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a guano mine. The island has a colony of roseate spoonbills at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there. The spoonbills are protected by the American <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society, two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No's airstrip.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led {{to the use of the}} term as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{her last}} public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The {{committee}} issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, she also testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, {{she was unable to}} accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on The Today Show and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E

5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962–1964, {{and a plan}} to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who {{said that they would}} damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).|$|E
5|$|Funds {{for the new}} Bonsall bridge were {{approved}} by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) in October1988, and construction was scheduled to begin in early 1989. In November1989, the California Coastal Commission gave the go-ahead for the realignment of SR76 in western Oceanside, from I-5 to Frontier Drive. However, in February1990, the Sierra Club, <b>National</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society, and League for Coastal Protection filed a lawsuit to have the approval overturned, citing concerns over the destruction of habitat. The Bonsall bridge was completed in early 1990, while the old bridge became a National Historic Place. In 1992, the City of Oceanside offered to purchase land as additional habitat for the songbird, {{even though it was}} not a party to the lawsuit. The following year, the City Council voted to use the Lawrence Canyon land for commercial use instead of for the environmental mitigation, thus stalling the project. Following this, the CTC rejected the proposal to build the highway, requiring Caltrans to find another parcel to use for constructing habitat. The CTC did approve the proposal a month later, provided that this land was found before construction began. In October, the City Council decided to use the Lawrence Canyon land for mitigation after all. Nevertheless, a city councilman raised concerns that the expressway would not be adequate to handle 2010 traffic levels.|$|E
