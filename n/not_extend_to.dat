5|$|Finally, the 1681 Scottish Test Act {{required}} {{all public}} officials and MPs to swear unconditional {{loyalty to the}} King but with the crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal Catholicism did <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> Catholicism in general and his failure to understand this resulted in his deposition and exile by the Glorious Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Otherside Entertainment, a new {{developer}} {{founded by}} Paul Neurath and other Looking Glass and Irrational veterans, {{announced a new}} entry in the series, entitled Underworld Ascendant. The new title is an officially licensed part of the series set in the Stygian Abyss, but this licensing agreement does <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> the Ultima name or greater IP, effectively orphaning Underworld from the Ultima series.|$|E

5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, 2006, a {{jury found}} Green guilty on {{one count of}} assault and battery for {{punching}} Artest in the stands, but acquitted him of an assault charge for throwing the cup. On May 1, 2006, Green was sentenced to 30 days in jail and two years' probation. On November 7, 2006, the Pistons issued a letter to Green informing {{him that he was}} banned for life from attending any Pistons home games under orders from the NBA (although the ban does <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> other events at the Palace of Auburn Hills).|$|E
5|$|The Tortoise Club {{is open to}} the 1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid (as well {{as their}} {{respective}} coxwains), but does <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> the Boat Club committee's Bosun (boatswain), Secretary, or Treasurer unless they are also 1st VIII, 1st Torpid, or coxwains to those boats. The unique emblem of the Tortoise Club is the tortoise badge. The College of Arms' narrative should not be misunderstood to imply use of the Tortoise emblem by the general Oriel College Boat Club membership or members of the Oriel Society – these have their own appropriate emblematic devices.|$|E

In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TFL).|$|E
5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Larger scale state-generating {{processes}} {{developed in}} Slavic {{areas in the}} 9th century. Great Moravia, the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great Moravia included what is now Moravia and western Slovakia, plus parts of Bohemia, Pannonia and southern regions of Lesser Poland. The glory of the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular. Such finds do <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> the lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia {{took place during the}} reign of Svatopluk I {{at the end of the}} 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and Magyar invasions, it ceased to exist entirely.|$|E
50|$|One {{effect of}} these changes, which were <b>not</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> the non-white {{population}} of the Union, was to dilute {{the influence of the}} non-white electors in Cape Province and Natal.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{leaders of}} the Kilab {{continued}} to hold the title of amir al-ʿarab after the Ayyubid conquest of Aleppo in 1182. As a result, Haditha's jurisdiction initially did <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> the Aleppo region (northern Syria). However, during {{the latter half of}} az-Zahir Ghazi (r. 1193–1216) of Aleppo's reign, the Kilab were brought under Haditha's authority and were stripped of the amir al-ʿarab title. According to medieval Arab historian Ibn al-Adim (d. 1262), the Kilab's status was downgraded because of the growing power of the Tayy clans, while al-Hamdani asserts that the numerically-superior Kilab were weakened by a divided leadership. Following the extension of Haditha's jurisdiction to their traditional territory, some of the Kilab migrated north to Anatolia, while those who remained became allies of Haditha's Al Fadl clan.|$|E
5|$|Prost won his fourth, and final, title, {{but in a}} {{year where}} he was {{regularly}} challenged by teammate Hill, and Ayrton Senna. Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, as the clause in the Frenchman's contract did <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> 1994 and Senna {{would be able to}} join Williams for the upcoming season, and instead opted to retire as the driver with the record for most grand prix victories — a record which stood for almost a decade. On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost was surprised by the gesture, as Senna had declined a handshake the race before. Prost's performances earned him an OBE.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Peoria {{was laid}} out in 1845 by Isaac Litzenberger. Litzenberger soon opened a store. When the {{railroad}} was built in Miami County, it was <b>not</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Peoria, and the town declined.|$|R

5|$|The {{impetus for}} {{federation}} did <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> {{the administration of}} cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does <b>not</b> <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E
