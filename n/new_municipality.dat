5|$|At a {{referendum}} held on January 14, 1895, 46 of 53 voters approved incorporation as a Borough. Citizens of Englewood Township challenged {{the creation of}} a borough, but accepted the <b>new</b> <b>municipality</b> as a township, given its more rural character. A bill supporting the creation of the Township of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 18, 1895, and the New Jersey Senate on the next day. Governor of New Jersey George Werts signed the bill into law, and Teaneck was an independent municipality.|$|E
5|$|The {{south bank}} of the Vardar river {{generally}} comprises highrise tower blocks, including the vast Karpoš neighbourhood which {{was built in the}} 1970s west of the centre. Towards the East, the <b>new</b> <b>municipality</b> of Aerodrom was planned in the 1980s to house 80,000 inhabitants {{on the site of the}} old airport. Between Karpoš and Aerodrom lies the city centre, rebuilt according to plans by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The centre is surrounded by a row of long buildings suggesting a wall ("Gradski Zid").|$|E
5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they ought to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the <b>new</b> <b>municipality</b> was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E

5|$|Teaneck {{was created}} on February19, 1895 by {{an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature from {{portions}} of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which are now defunct (despite existing municipalities with similar names), along with portions of Bogota and Leonia. Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation by a 46–7 margin. To address the concerns of Englewood Township's leaders, the <b>new</b> <b>municipality</b> was formed as a township, rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time. On May3, 1921, and June1, 1926, portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township.|$|E
5|$|There are 290 {{municipalities}} in Sweden, {{each with}} its own coat of arms. A local government reform in the 1960s–1970s made all cities part of a municipality. The city arms often—but not always—became the coat of arms of the <b>new</b> <b>municipality.</b> As some municipalities were created at this time by merging smaller communities, this led in some cases to arms consisting of two parts, each derived from one of the communities. Some new municipalities also lacked historical cities within, and therefore created wholly new coats of arms. Municipalities which carry the name of a city (with a few exceptions—see below) traditionally display a mural crown on top of their coat of arms. While no law forbids other municipalities from using the mural crown, it is customarily reserved for those bearing former city arms. Kalmar was the first to establish city arms in 1247, and Stockholm, Skara and Örebro were also among the first cities in Sweden to establish city arms. As recently as 2007, Härryda Municipality was among the last municipalities in Sweden to replace its logo with a newly registered coat of arms. Municipal arms may not use any colors (tinctures) other than argent, Or, gules, azure, sable and vert. As in other heraldic traditions, the rule of tincture applies and it is the blazon—not the image—that is legally registered.|$|E
