5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. <b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E

In view of this, we first summarized and analyzed the achievements, status quo and existing problems in <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> reform {{in recent years in}} China. Then, we made an overview on the global <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> and marketing experiences and domestic situation in <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> sector. On this basis, we presented the following proposals and implement approaches to ultimately achieving the market-oriented reform of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> in China. First, the ex-factory prices for those residential gas users will be adjusted, which should be differentiated from those for the non-residential gas users. Second, the present <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> mechanism should be perfected with pipeline fees and gas storage fees being both added. Third, an integrated <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> system should be improved with differential <b>prices</b> implemented. Fourth, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> spot transaction should be promoted and energy measurement in <b>gas</b> metering and <b>pricing</b> should also be put into practice...|$|R

40|$|About 50 % of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in Indonesia is {{exported}} {{to other countries}} despite of the demand of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is relatively high, which may cause supply shortage in future. One {{of the reasons is}} that the export <b>price</b> of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is higher than the domestic price. Indonesia has become an energy exporter for a long time, and has subsidized the cost of its domestic energy supply. <b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> is one of the fuels which have been supported by the government. Many of the crude oil importing countries set the domestic <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> with references to the prices of crude oil mix, of which Japanese crude cocktail (JCC) method is commonly used to determine the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> in the country. However, JCC is heavily dependent on crude oil prices and excludes the other substitution fuels. In this paper, the determination of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> for domestic consumption in Indonesia using netback market value is investigated. The method takes into account prices of all competitive fuels with proper weightings of their shares in each consumer sector, by which the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> does not depend only on crude oil prices, but also on other substitution fuel prices. Netback market value method will provide the relative <b>prices</b> of the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for the consumers to other fuels. Information of all types of fuel including prices and consumption amounts in the past will be used to calculate <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> and analyzed in comparison with the actual price.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2006 Russia greatly increased {{the price of gas}} for Ukraine to bring it inline with market values. The dispute between Russian state-owned gas supplier Gazprom and Ukraine over <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> started in March 2005 (over the price of natural gas and prices for the transition of Gazprom's gas to Europe). The two parties were unable to reach an agreement to resolve the dispute, and Russia cut gas exports to Ukraine on 1 January 2006 at 10:00 MSK. The supply was restored on 4 January, when a preliminary agreement between two gas companies was settled. Other disputes arose in October 2007 and in January 2009, this dispute again resulted in 18 European countries reporting major falls or cut-offs of their gas supplies from Russia transported through Ukraine. Gas supplies restarted on 20 January 2009 and were fully restored on 21 January 2009.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the slate}} of {{chemical}} products {{that can be}} made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from natural gas and petroleum, the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa, China, India and the United States where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there. In the United States, the best example of the industry is Eastman Chemical Company which has been successfully operating a coal-to-chemicals plant at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site since 1983. Similarly, Sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1970s, Sydvaranger started {{planning}} using {{natural gas}} to produce pellets through direct reduction. Originally Karmøy was envisioned as a proper site, but it was eventually decided that {{there would not be}} built a pipeline there. Korf Stahl took contact with Sydvaranger and proposed a joint venture to establish a facility in Emden, Germany. They established Norddeutsche Ferrowerke (NFW) in 1976, which was owned 74.9 percent by Sydvaranger and 25.1 percent of Korf Stahl. Construction cost 400million Deutsche Mark (NOK1100million) and had an annual production of 1.2million tonnes. Financing was in part secured through state guarantees, loans from German banks and a DM45million loan from the European Coal and Steel Community. Natural gas was delivered from Norway via Norpipe. Construction started on 17 July 1978 and was taken into use {{in the second half of}} 1980. Rising <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> and interest rates combined with sinking ore prices made the plant a financial disaster. The Norwegian government agreed in April 1981 to subsidize operations, which kept the plant going until July 1982, when it filed for bankruptcy.
