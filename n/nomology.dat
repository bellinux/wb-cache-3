50|$|In philosophy, <b>nomology</b> (from the Greek νόμος, law, and λόγος, reason) is {{concerned}} with the thinking process of the mind. The Oxford English Dictionary defines <b>nomology</b> as the 'branch of science and philosophy concerned with the laws or principles governing the operation of the mind, especially as defined by custom or culture'.|$|E
50|$|In 19th century <b>nomology</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as one of two grand divisions of philosophy, the other being metaphysics.|$|E
50|$|The name <b>nomology</b> {{may come}} from Aristotle (Aristotle, 1995). The ‘-ology’ suffix implies ‘order’, ‘word’ and ‘reason’, and is about being subjectively {{reasonable}} or ‘logical’ as in sociology and psychology. The ‘nom-’ part implies ‘rule’ and ‘law’, and is about being objectively lawful or ‘nomical’ as in economics. A nomological approach requires taking account of both subjective and objective aspects in a decision. <b>Nomology</b> provides the framework for building a nomological network of relationships between constructs in decision making.|$|E
40|$|String Theory is {{the result}} of the {{conjunction}} of three conceptually independent elements: (i) the metaphysical idea of a nomological unity of the forces, (ii) the model-theoretical paradigm of Quantum Field Theory, and (iii) the conflict resulting from classical gravity in a quantum world - the motivational starting point of the search for a theory of Quantum Gravity. String Theory is sometimes assumed to solve this conflict: by means of an application of the (only slightly extended) model-theoretical apparatus of (perturbative) Quantum Field Theory, interpreting gravity as the result of an exchange of gravitons, taken here to be dynamical states of the string. But, String Theory does not really solve the conflict. Rather it exemplifies the inadequacy of the apparatus of Quantum Field Theory in the context of Quantum Gravity: After several decades of development it still exists only in an essentially perturbative formulation (with minor non-perturbative extensions and vague ideas with regard to a possible non-perturbative formulation). And, due to its quantum field theoretical heritage, it is conceptually incompatible with central implications of General Relativity, especially those resulting from the general relativistic relation between gravity and spacetime. All known formulations of String Theory are background-dependent. And no physical motivation is given for this conceptual incompatibility. On the other hand, although String Theory identifies all gauge bosons as string states, it was not even possible to reproduce the Standard Model. Instead, String Theory led to a multitude of internal problems - and to the plethora of low-energy scenarios with different <b>nomologies</b> and symmetries, known as the String Landscape. All attempts to find a dynamically motivated selection principle remained without success, leaving String Theory without any predictive power. The nomological unification of the fundamental forces, including gravity, is only achieved in a purely formal way within the model-theoretical paradigm of Quantum Field Theory - by means of physically unmotivated epicycles like higher dimensionality, Calabi-Yau spaces, branes, etc. Finally, the possibility remains that some of the central (implicit) assumptions of String Theory are physically wrong. On the one hand, the idea of a nomological unity of the forces could be simply wrong. On the other hand, even if a nomological unity of all fundamental forces should be realized in nature, the possibility remains that gravity is not a fundamental force, but a residual, emergent and possibly intrinsically classical phenomenon, resulting from a quantum substrate without any gravitational degrees of freedom. ...|$|R

40|$|Because {{violations}} of information security (ISec) and privacy have become ubiquitous in {{both personal and}} work environments, academic attention to ISec and privacy has taken on paramount importance. Consequently, a key focus of ISec research has been discovering ways to motivate individuals to engage in more secure behaviors. Over time, the protection motivation theory (PMT) has become a leading theoretical foundation used in ISec research to help motivate individuals to change their security-related behaviors to protect themselves and their organizations. Our careful review of the foundation for PMT identified four opportunities for improving ISec PMT research. First, extant ISec studies do not use the full <b>nomology</b> of PMT constructs. Second, only one study uses fear-appeal manipulations, even though these are a core element of PMT. Third, virtually no ISec study models or measures fear. Fourth, whereas these studies have made excellent progress in predicting security intentions, {{none of them have}} addressed actual security behaviors. This article describes the theoretical foundation of these four opportunities for improvement. We tested the <b>nomology</b> of PMT, including manipulated fear appeals, in two different ISec contexts that model the modern theoretical treatment of PMT more closely than do extant ISec studies. The first data collection was a longitudinal study in the context of data backups. The second study was a short-term cross-sectional study in the context of anti-malware software. Our new model demonstrated better results and stronger fit than the existing models and confirms the efficacy of the four potential improvements we identified. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper uses <b>Nomology,</b> a {{decision}} science approach to structuring qualitative decisions, to put Drama Theory, and Confrontation and Collaboration Analysis, into a framework {{based on a}} succession of dichotomies. The first dichotomy is based on whether the two parties mainly agree or disagree. The second is based on whether to use direct or indirect action. These combine to form four General Political Adjustment Activities, which have corresponding dilemmas: Collaboration (Harmony), Cooperation (Agreement), Confrontation (Persuasion) and Conflict (Escalation). The third dichotomy is based on whether to use a more personal approach or to use one’s position, such as one’s control over resources, people and influence. This generates eight Principal Political Adjustment Activities along with corresponding Dilemmas...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>Nomology,</b> {{a generic}} meta-model {{that is based}} in decision science. We show that all qualitative decision-making is based on dichotomous thinking, using different axes. As a consequence, the natural form of decision-making is {{as a form of}} adjustment, ensuring that balance is achieved within all the dichotomies. The two most important of these axes deal with the issue what should we do: more planning or more putting plans into effect, and where should we do it: more with people or more in place or with systems. These combine to form four primary activities: Proposition, Perception, Pull and Push. A complication occurs with subjective decision-making, such as with one’s committing (introverted) and convincing (extroverted) processes. In both cases the “people ” aspect becomes oneself. Consequently, the Pull aspect of putting one’s plans to oneself becomes a trivial event and the four activities reduce to three, or trichotomies. These are well known in the West as the dialectic, based on thesis, antithesis and synthesis. Committing examples include analysis, design and implementation; needs, preferences and values; getting, doing and making; somatic, psychic, and pneumatic. Convincing examples include technical, contextual and situational; self, others and purpose; involving, protecting and observing. We show that parallels can be drawn between an Oriental systems methodology, Wuli, Shili, Renli (WSR), and the Adjusting, Convincing and Committing dimensions in <b>Nomology.</b> We use this match to explore the commonalities between several Shili and convincing trichotomies, for example that Shili can involve mathematics, theory and practice.

Cognitive task analysis provides a foundation for preliminary schema descriptions, which can then be elaborated according to more detailed models of cognitive and attentional processes. The resulting theory provides a rich explanatory framework for the cognitive processes underlying game play, as well as detailed hypotheses for the hierarchical structure of pleasures and rewards motivating players. Game engagement is accounted for as a process of schema selection or development, while immersion is explained in terms of schema execution. This framework is being developed not only to explain the substructures of game play, but also to provide schema models that may inform game design processes and provide detailed criteria for the design of patterns of game features for entertainment, pedagogical and therapeutic purposes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{implications}} of qualitative distinctions between multiple criteria are considered. Some contributions to theory about the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) are challenged.

It is suggested that differences between decision alternatives should provide a first phase basis for discovering criteria. A criteria tree should be structured ‘top down ’ as a second phase by clustering criteria on the basis of qualitative difference. On any level the differences between criteria should follow relatively simple patterns. The rules used suggest the relevance of work on the structure of qualitative decision-making which is determined by <b>Nomology,</b> the science of the laws of the mind. Implications are considered for weighting trade-offs between homogeneous clusters of criteria. This should be done as a later ‘bottom up ’ phase. The AHP scoring system is challenged.

40|$|The extant Manasara {{is one of}} the {{authoritative}} treatises of vastusastra, traditional Indian architectural theory. The dissertation addresses the question of the nature of vastusastra, traditional architectural theory, as enunciated in the Manasara, and the relationship of theory to traditional practice. Vastusastra claims itself to be a priori with respect to practice. Two aspects of theory, theology and <b>nomology,</b> constitute the ontological and epistemological foundation and structure for this claim. From this sastraic perspective, practice is understood as mere application of rules. However, a closer hermeneutical reading of the text reveals the dialectical nature of theory itself, in both its theological and nomological aspects. This dialectic obtains in the relationship between theory and practice as a certain reciprocity between them, and in the parallelism between making the temple (the paradigmatic architectural object) and writing the treatise. Thus, a more precise {{understanding of the nature of}} traditional theory and its relationship to traditional practice is arrived at through this exercise. Such a calibrated understanding of vastusastra is indispensable in addressing the issue of the proper role that it may play in contemporary Indian architectural practice which is constituted in the modern scientific and technological mode...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use <b>Nomology,</b> a {{decision}} science approach to structuring qualitative decisions, {{to show that}} Inter-Cultural Trust Development (ICTD) corresponds to a generic structure based on convincing and committing processes. In the structure we relate some typical Chinese constructs to those in English speaking countries in Western Europe. The key issue in the ICTD is shown {{to be that of}} ownership of the process by the decision-maker or organization. Consequently the decisions when to move from one stage of development to the next and by which way to move should be determined ‘subjectively ’ by the decision-maker. Considering the ways of thinking and behaving in China, such as Confucian approach and Wuli-Shili-Renli approach, the comparison the ICTD with other similarly structured systems, suggests that each stage of the ICTD is fitted into the matrix of committing phases and convincing stages. The stages should be best implemented ‘objectively ’ as an adjusting process in which balance should be retained. With the help of our presented ICTD structure, we analyze a case of inter-cultural trust development in information systems. The generic nature of the structure suggests that practitioners could borrow from similar decision processes in other fields, including stages of activities, types of thinking and philosophies in Chinese and Western cultures, to develop inter-cultural trust in information systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{suggested}} for helping actors in organization and society {{to decide how}} to proceed when researching complex issues. Its structure arises from the distinctions that the mind draws when trying to adjust to changing situations. These are based on dichotomous answers to simple questions: What should be done?, Where?, and Which Way or which type of approach should be used? These lead to the creation of four general types of approach and eight particular approaches. This structure can be used to help determine which approach or methodological orientation should be used in a research context. The alternative orientations correspond to those in Brugha's structure of adjustment decision-making within <b>Nomology,</b> to Schwaninger's polarities framework within Integrative Systems Methodology and to Bowen’s Eight Faces of Research. The selection of orientation depends on the answer to three questions regarding the subject being researched. Is it more about Planning, or is it more about Putting plans into effect? Has it more to do with People, or is {{more to do with the}} Place of the decision, i. e. systems and structures? Does it rely more on a Personal approach to problem solving, or do the decision-makers rely more on using their Position, i. e. their power or authority in the situation?

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a decision-maker (DM) centred approach to finding preferences in multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). Its features include being “Direct-Interactive”: i. e. the DM gives scores and weights directly {{and is able}} to confirm or change them at appropriate points in the process. Also it uses “Structured-Criteria”: i. e. the criteria trees are based on naturally formed clusters that are informed by <b>Nomology,</b> the science of the laws of the mind. It reports favourable responses by DMs to tests of the Direct-Interactive Structured-Criteria (DISC) approach. DMs generally prefer to put weights on criteria using a simple system based on sharing of 10 points to pairwise comparison methods or swing weights. Two forms of scoring alternatives were compared, one based on utility scores, the other a ratio (AHP-type) approach, whose scores are synthesised using a power function. DMs generally prefer the utility approach because it is easier to use. The ratio approach took more effort, but was preferred where there were few alternatives, or there was uncertainty about the upper and lower thresholds that determine the intervals within which utilities are scored, such as where some of the criteria are very intangible. The simpler utility approach is recommended as a first phase {{to reduce the number of}} alternatives. If it fails to provide a clear preference the ratio approach is then recommended, but only if there are four or fewer alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{string theory}} {{represents}} the only advanced {{approach to a}} unification of all interactions, including gravity. In spite {{of the more than}} thirty years of its existence it did not make any empirically testable predictions. And it is completely unknown which physically interpretable principles could form the basis of string theory. At the moment, "string theory" is no theory at all, but rather a labyrinthic structure of mathematical procedures and intuitions which get their justification from the fact that they, at least formally, reproduce general relativity and the standard model of elementary particle physics as low energy approximations. However, there are now strong indications that string theory does not only reproduce the dynamics and symmetries of our standard model, but a plethora of different scenarios with different low energy nomologies and symmetries. String theory seems to describe not only our world, but an immense landscape of possible worlds. So far, all attempts to find a selection principle which could be motivated intratheoretically remained without success. So, recently the idea that the low energy <b>nomology</b> of our world, and therefore also the observable phenomenology, could be the result of an anthropic selection from a vast arena of nomologically different scenarios entered string theory. Although multiverse scenarios and anthropic selection are not only motivated by string theory, but lead also to a possible explanation for the fine tuning of the universe, they are concepts which transcend the framework defined by the epistemological and methodological rules which conventionally form the basis of physics as an empirical science.

40|$|This paper uses <b>Nomology,</b> a {{decision}} science approach to structuring qualitative decisions, {{to show that}} conflict decision-making uses a generic framework based on a succession of dichotomies. The first dichotomy is whether the two parties mainly agree or disagree. The second is whether to use direct or indirect action. These combine to form four General Political Adjustment Activities, which have corresponding dilemmas: Collaboration (Integration), Cooperation (Agreement), Confrontation (Persuasion) and Conflict (Escalation). It explores how the generic activities might be perceived in terms of Chinese culture and systems and suggests that the agree/disagree dimension corresponds to being in harmony or not. It suggests that the direct/indirect dimension appears in Chinese culture {{as the use of}} power versus guanxi or relationships through people. One difference with the West is that Chinese culture appears to put more emphasis on Conflict Resolution, i. e. the adapting process of moving in the reverse direction away from Conflict. A second difference appears to be a lack of balance within these dimensions as might have been expected within a culture influenced by Confucious, so conscious of the Yin/Yang balance in everything. There seems to be an over strong emphasis on being in harmony, and on respecting power, especially seniority and authority. This seems evident in the lack of emphasis on Confrontation rather than seeing it as a bridge whereby to pass from Conflict to Cooperation. This contrasts with the United States, which appears both to focus too much on using its power to force other countries to adjust, and to have difficulty with both Confrontation and Cooperation in international politics. It suggests that China may be very well positioned to help contribute to a stable international political order based on international cooperation and harmony-seeking...|$|E

His ideas even partly influenced the founders of a Reformational philosophy in the thirties of the previous century. This investigation is a follow-up on three previous research articles, which discussed Aquinas' basic direction of thought (synthesis philosophy), his idea of law, {{as well as the}} cluster of ideas comprising his ontology or view of reality (God and cosmos). From the present (fourth) contribution in the series it becomes evident how his ontology determined his anthropology, and how his anthropological views in turn influenced his epistemology. Special attention is again given to the role of (what the author indicates as) Aquinas' <b>nomology</b> or view of law (in God, in creation and conceptualised in the human intellect). The essay develops through the following stages: (1) The origin, composition (of soul and body) of mankind is explained. (2) The nature of the intellective soul (a separate, independent, immortal, supra-temporal substance) is investigated. (3) This is followed by Aquinas' distinction between a practical and speculative intellect.

In this way correspondence is reached between what is known outside the mind and its logical duplicate in the human intellect.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) Abstract: Cloud {{computing}} {{with its}} ubiquitous, flexible and on-demand consumption {{model has been}} growing at an exponential rate and represents a major investment for organizations whose business models require constant transformation. However, cloud computing introduces security challenges at all levels, from data to applications, hosts and networks and organizations are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches from outside the organization as well as insider’s intentional or unintentional misbehaviour not in compliance with an organization’s security policies. Insider security threats are the most dangerous as they are the trusted and privilege users of the organizations and their problems are {{the most difficult to}} detect. Investigation of factors affecting employees’ behaviour in protecting their organization’s valuable assets: the information is thus very important in an organization’s defence against harmful insiders’ non-compliant behaviour. Existing literature, however, generally focuses on technical and operational protections and provides little account of human misbehaviour. This study aims to address this gap by investigating influencing factors affecting employees’ protection intention and behaviour in their organizations. This study adopts an integrated theoretical model from Siponen, Mahmood, & Pahnila (2014) that is grounded on Protection Motivation Theory (Rogers, 1983) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Ajzen, 1991) but expands to the full <b>nomology</b> of both theories to enhance the rigor of the research. The theoretical model is then empirically tested with 256 employees from various industries involved in cloud computing in Hong Kong. The research model is found to explain a significant proportion of the variance of Intention to Comply with Cloud/Information Security Policies (52 percent) and Actual Compliance Behaviour (61 percent). The findings suggest that employees’ compliance intention and perceived ease of compliance are the most significant influencers of compliance behaviour. When employees have the right compliance attitude, are positively motivated by their management and peers, have faith in their organizations’ and their own ability to protect their organizations and find the compliance costs tolerable, their intention to comply with their organizations’ cloud/information security policies increases significantly. The results show that employees’ perception of the security threats has a moderate effect on compliance intention but their perception of vulnerability to security breaches and rewards of non-compliance have no impact on their intention to comply with cloud/information security policies. This study reveals a general lack of awareness of cloud/information security threats and the consequences of non-compliance. The results call for continuous Security Education, Training and Awareness (SETA) on cloud/information security policies and awareness programs to be in place to augment employees’ understanding of the cyber security threat, especially {{as a result of the}} open concept of cloud computing, and their organizations’ ability to respond to these threats; to increase employees’ skills and confidence level to defend their organizations (and themselves) from security threats; to promote the right attitude towards conforming to organizations; and to create peer pressure from senior management and co-workers towards compliance behaviour. This study enriches the understanding of the motivational factors underlining information security policies compliance behaviour and will be useful for academia and industry practitioners involved in encouraging cloud/information security policy compliance behaviour.
