40|$|New <b>near-infrared</b> <b>absorbing</b> donor-acceptor chromophores {{have been}} {{investigated}} by varying the electron donating and accepting strength of {{the two halves of}} the molecule within wide limits. The dihydroperimidine, perimidine, Michler's ethylene and 1 -decyl- 2 (1 H) - methyl-benz[c, d]indolium iodide residues were examined as donor residues, and these were coupled to 4 -nitrobenzenediazonium chloride to give monoazo dyes. The λmax values of these gave a qualitative indication of relative electron donor strengths, and the 1 -ethyl- 2 -methylperimidine azo dyes proved to be the most bathochromic, being blue in colour. The dyes were amongst the most bathochromic monoazo dyes yet prepared containing the 4 -nitrophenylazo residue. The N-alkyl- 3 -cyano- 6 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl- 2 -pyridone system was investigated as a potentially powerful electron acceptor system, and the 5 -formyl and 5 -nitroso derivatives were condensed with Michler's ethylene and 1 -decyl- 2 (1 H) -methyl-benz[c, d]indolium iodide to give new donor-acceptor dyes. The aza dyes prepared from the nitroso compounds proved to be the most bathochromic in accord with PMO theory and many were <b>near-infrared</b> <b>absorbing.</b> A series of <b>near-infrared</b> <b>absorbing</b> squarylium <b>dyes</b> with narrow, intense absorption bands at about 800 nm were obtained by reacting squaric acid with 2, 2 -disubstituted dihydroperimidines. The first dyes of this type possessed poor organic solvent solubilities but, through modification of the 2, 2 -substituents of the dihydroperimidines it was possible to obtain squarylium dyes with good organic solvent solubility, this being a much sought after property of infrared dyes. Other squarylium dyes were obtained by the reaction of squaric acid with 1 -ethyl- 2 -methylperimidine, Michler's ethylene and 1 -decyl- 2 (1 H) -methyl-benz[c, djindolium iodide. The latter two <b>dyes</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the infrared region at 809 and 900 nm respectively in toluene. A modified procedure for the synthesis of croconic acid was developed, which enables the acid to be obtained in the anhydrous form readily. Reaction of croconic acid with 3 -hydroxy-N, N-dialkylanilines afforded highly bathochromic dyes (λ max ca. 830 nm). Reaction with 1 - decyl- 2 (1 H) -methyl benz[c, d]indolium iodide gave a croconium <b>dye</b> that <b>absorbed</b> beyond 1000 nm. The reaction of 8 -hydroxyjulolidine with croconic acid was particularly interesting as it occurred readily at room temperature. Thus it was possible to undertake a kinetic study of mechanistic aspects of the condensation reaction between croconic acid and arylamines. The results indicated that the optimum reaction conditions involved using a low proportion of an alcohol in a nonpolar aprotic solvent {{in the presence of a}} weak acid catalyst. Dyes were also obtained from the reaction of various electrophilic chlorine-substituted compounds with electron-donor aromatic residues, thus giving new donor-acceptor dyes, several of which were nearinfrared absorbing with low molecular masses and good organic solvent solubilities. The dyes were, however, strongly coloured due to their broad absorption bands which extended well into the visible region.

40|$|Based on {{the known}} reverse saturable {{absorption}} properties of certain coumarin and long chain polymethine dyes, {{the synthesis of}} new related structures was undertaken {{in order to examine}} the relationships between structure and RSA activity. It was hoped that in this way, more effective RSA chromophores could be synthesised. In addition to RSA activity (at 532 nm) the general light absorption and fluorescence characteristics of the new dye materials were examined. In the first series of dyes, the 7 -diethylaminocoumarin system with extensively conjugated acceptor groups in the 3 -position were examined. Several dyes with absorption maxima in the range 500 - 700 nm were prepared, but none showed RSA properties at 532 nm. The poor photostability properties of these dyes prompted the synthesis of related fused ring systems derived from 4 -chloro- 7 -diethylamino- 3 -formyl-coumarin and in at least one example a marked improvement in photostability was achieved. In an attempt to move the absorption maxima of the coumarin dyes into the near infrared, chromophores with extended chains containing an isophorone bridge were introduced into the 3 -position of the coumarin system. Although this gave greater conjugation and an increase in structural rigidity, Amax values could not be obtained at wavelengths greater than about 570 nm, and photostability properties of the dyes were poor. Condensation of active methylene compounds with 2 -chloro-l-formyl- 3 -hydroxymethylenecyclohexene led to the synthesis of a series of extended donoracceptor chromophores containing a chlorocyclohexene bridge, where the donor was the 1, 3, 3 -trimethylindoline ring system. Absorption maxima of the dyes ranged from 620 - 860 nm. However, none showed RSA properties and their photostability in cellulose acetate film was generally poor. In an attempt to improve photostability the intermediate formed from 2 -methylene-l, 3, 3 -trimethylindoline (Fischer's base) and 2 -chloro-l-formyl- 3 -hydromethylenecyclohexene was condensed with active methylene compounds containing groups capable of intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine atom. Thus under suitably forcing reaction conditions intramolecular cyclisation occurred, giving a series of extended donor-acceptor chromophores containing fused heterocyclic residues, the absorption maxima of these new chromophores ranging from 540 - 730 nm. However, resultant increase in molecular rigidity did not give the expected improvement in photostability. In a further attempt to prepare RSA active chromophores, selected symmetrical polymethine dyes were synthesised and evaluated. All showed a measurable RSA effect at 532 nm but in particular, <b>near-infrared</b> <b>absorbing</b> squarylium <b>dye</b> containing 2, 3 -dihydroperimidine end groups exhibited the greatest degree of RSA thus far observed.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{materials}} chemistry, the 1, 3 -dithiole ring system {{is one of the}} most widely investimated and attractive heterocvcles due to its unique redox properties. A large number of new orazanic materials containing this svstem have been developed. The most important examale is tetra-thiafulvalene (TTF) and related electron donors giving organic conductors or superconductors. 2 -Methylene- 1, 3 -dithiole, which is a component of TTF, is considered to give the corresponding cation radical upon one-electron oxidation. In other words, it can be regarded as a source of cation radical species. Thus, introduction of this unit into an appropriate π-electron system is expected to produce various novel redox systems showing interesting properties and reactivities inherent to the configuration and the number of the 1, 3 -dithiole units as well as to the nature of the π-electron system. Therefore, on the development of novel organic functional materials as well as organic conductors, it is worthwhile to prepare such redox systems and study theirproperties. In this thesis, the author designed several novel 1, 3 -dithiole compounds containing thiophene-related systems and investigated their electrochemical properties, reactivities, and crystal structures. The thiophene derivatives were chosen as spacer units for following reasons. (i) The electron-releasing thiophene ring is expected to enhance the electron-donating ability of the molecules and to stabilize the cationic species formed by oxidation. (ii) The expansion of π-conjugation caused by insertion of the thiophene units may reduce intramolecular Coulombic repulsion. (iii) The structural modification is generally easy. The present thesis consists of the following four chapters. Chapter 1 describes the recent studies related to this research work and the purpose and constitution of the thesis. In Chapter 2, 6, 6 -bis[5 -(1, 4 -dithiafulven- 6 -yl) - 2 -thienyl]- 1, 4 -dithiafulvene and its derivatives have been prepared as novel cross-conjugated tris(1, 3 -dithiole) donors, and their physical and chemical properties are discussed. According to MNDO-PM 3 calculations on a parent compound, the molecule takes a nonplanar conformaation, in which one dithiafulvenyl unit is orthogonal to the plane of the 2, 5 -bis(dithiafulvenyl) thiophene skeleton. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) showed that the donors are oxidized to trication radicals or tetracations. The first oxidation waves correspond to two-electron processes, indicating the reduced on-site Coulombic repulsion in the dication State. The electron-donating ability of the donors is estimated to be comparable to that of TTF. The donors gave iodine complexes which showed electrical conductivities of 10 - 5 - 10 - 2 Scm- 1 as comtressed pellets. A redox active polymer was formed from a certain derivative by electrochemical oxidation. Furthermore, the synthesis and redox aroaerties of a tris(1, 3 -dithiole) donor containing a cyclopentadithiophene moiety were also discussed. Chapter 3 deals with the preparation and properties of bis(1, 3 -dithiole) compounds containins thienylmethylene units affording novel cations by oxidation. Molecules possessing a methylene group adjacent to electron-donating moieties seem to undergo deprotonation by oxidation to give the corresponding methyl cations. In order to prove the generality of this type of reaction and to apply it to the preparation of novel cations, bis(1, 3 -dithiole) compounds containing a dithienylmethane skeleton have been prepared. The CV indicated that redox active products were formed through electrochemical oxidation followed by chemical reactions and the reactions were dependent on the substituents R on the C 6 -carbons of the dithiafulvenyl groups. When R was methyl group, chemical oxidation of the compounds with NOBF 4 gave the corresponding dithienylmethyl cations in moderate yields. They were also obtained by hydride abstraction with Ph 3 CBF 4. The cations were characterized by intense absorptions in the near-infrared region (900 - 980 nm in MeCN). The alkylthio groups on the dithiole rings make the absorptions much red-shifted. The absorption band was blue-shifted to ca. 820 nm in a thin film, indicating that they are interesting as <b>near-infrared</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>dyes.</b> The polymethine cyanine like structure of the cation was revealed by the X-ray analysis. On the other hand, in the case of R=H, a redox active oligomer was formed by oxidation. Furthermore, isolation of the dication salt derived from 2, 5 -bis[5 -(6 -methyl- 1, 4 -dithiafulven- 6 -yl) - 2 -thienylmethyl]thiophene, which has two methylene groups, was also attempted. Although it has been reported that 1, 4 -dithiafulvene derivatives undergo oxidative intermolecular coupling reactions at the 6 -position, the corresponding intramolecular reaction is unknown. Chapter 4 describes the oxidative intramolecular cvclization of 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bis(1, 4 -dithiafulven- 6 -yl) - 3, 32 ̆ 7 -bithienyls. The CVs of the compounds showed that they are irreversibly oxidized to afford redox active aroducts. Chemical oxidation with tris(4 -bromophenyl) aminium hexachloroantimonate gave cyclization products as dication salts in high yields. The X-ray structural analyses of the dication salts revealed that they contain trivalent chloroantimonate ions (Sb 2 Cl 8 2 - and SbCl 5 2 -), suggesting that SbCl 6 - ion acts as an oxidizing agent in the reaction. Chemical reduction of the dication salts with zinc gave the corresponding neutral donors in high yields. According to the X-ray analysis, the molecule adopts a nonplanar structure,with short intramolecular S…S contacts. The CVs of the donors showed reversible one-stage two-electron oxidation waves, and the potentials are fairly low compared with TTF.

The ignition sensitivities of HNS with each of the two optical sensitizers were analysed and compared in terms of: optical power threshold for ignition, ignition delay and full burn delay at various laser powers. The results have shown that both the chemical dye and carbon black optically sensitize the explosive with similar efficiencies. In contrast to the carbon black, the dye provides wavelength specificity and selectivity in the laser ignition process and its solubility in some specific solvents improves the coating of the explosive material. It was therefore concluded that the laser <b>absorbing</b> <b>dye</b> is a better candidate for optical sensitization in laser ignition than the commonly used carbon black.
