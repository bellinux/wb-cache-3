In fact, the show's creators made Sara Sidle while thinking of a future love interest for Grissom, but during the show's first three seasons, Grissom flirted with all the female characters, and when Sara asked him out to dinner, he rejected her, claiming that he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{about what is going}} on between them.|$|E

25|$|When {{large-scale}} excavations of Pompeii were {{undertaken in}} the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. They did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the Secret Museum in Naples, and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted {{with the passage of}} the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.|$|E

Many visitors then used the opportunity to swap their own ring for a Noten ring, leaving a genuine jungle of rings behind. Noten commented he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with these visitors' rings yet but that he would surely find a purpose for them.

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
25|$|Hazumu's parents, {{her father}} , {{and her mother}} , are almost always shown {{together}} throughout the series. When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> After Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter {{in place of a}} son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts to take a bath with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing them anyway. Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new behavior toward her, and finds trying on her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of the cookies for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is not a good thing.|$|E

Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies.|$|E

25|$|At 06:00 the Polish 10th Regiment of Foot under Colonel Filip Hauman {{had left}} its barracks at Ujazdów {{to the south}} of the city centre, and started its march towards the Royal Castle. As an effect of the chaos in Russian ranks, the {{regiment}} reached Nowy Świat Street and Świętokrzyska Streets unopposed by Russian units stationed there, as the Russian commanders did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It was stopped by a Russian force at Krakowskie Przedmieście Street, consisting of no less than 600 men and 5 pieces of artillery, and commanded by General Miłaszewicz. The Russian force was strategically dislocated {{on both sides of the}} street, in both the Kazimierz Palace (now the Warsaw University rectorate) and before Holy Cross Church. Colonel Hauman started lengthy negotiations with the Russian commander asking him to allow the Polish forces to pass. The negotiations were broken and at 08:00 the Polish regiment assaulted the Russian positions. After a skirmish that ensued the Polish unit was partially dispersed and had to retreat. Parts of the unit under Major Stanisław Lipnicki retreated to the Dominican Church, where the fights continued. Other troop under Lieutenant Sypniewski broke through to the Branicki Palace, yet others found their way farther towards the Old Town, outflanking the Russians. Because of that, the Russian infantry under General Miłaszewicz and a small cavalry force under Prince Gagarin, though victorious, found themselves under crossfire and surrounded. In addition, a small yet loud militia force under Jan Kiliński appeared on their rear and all of the Polish units in the area assaulted the Russians from all directions, which resulted in almost complete destruction of the Russian units. General Miłaszewicz was wounded trying to retreat with the remnants of his force towards the Kazimierz Palace, while Prince Gagarin retreated with some cavalrymen towards the Saxon Garden, where they were ambushed by civilians who killed almost all of them. The 10th Regiment then reformed around noon and moved towards the Castle Square, where it took part in the fights against smaller Russian forces in the Old Town.|$|E

Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's attorney general, who informed her that nothing could be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Ledbetter felt that the family had been at their [...] "rope's end" [...] with Wilson, and that they did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to help him. Three years into their relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with Ledbetter.|$|E
500|$|As a franchise-led operation, KFC's success {{depended}} {{on the work of}} the early franchisees, and Harman has been described as the [...] "virtual co-founder" [...] of the chain by Sanders' biographer. Harman trademarked the phrase [...] "It's finger lickin' good", which was eventually adopted as a slogan across the entire chain. In 1957 Harman bundled 14 pieces of chicken, five bread rolls and a pint of gravy into a cardboard bucket, and offered it to families as [...] "a complete meal" [...] for US$3.50 (around US$30 in 2014). He first test-trialled the packaging as a favor to Sanders, who had called on behalf of a Denver franchisee who did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with 500 cardboard buckets he had bought from a traveling salesman.|$|E

Exhausted by illness and {{the stress of}} {{the exhibition}}, when the exhibition was complete he returned to York in very poor health. On 3November 1849 he suffered a serious asthma attack, thought to have been made worse by his neglecting to wear his flannel undershirt the night before. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and by 10November he was bedridden. On Tuesday 13November, watching the sun set over the River Ouse, he was heard to say [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful! This death!" [...] Later that night, Betsy Etty wrote to Joseph Gillott that [...] "Uncle paid the last debt to nature at [...] past Eight [...] tonight.

He confronts Ivan, thinking he made Natasha take the pictures, but he is [...] "gutted" [...] when he learns {{that it was all}} Natasha's idea. Natasha tries to win her father's favour back and she sprays some unpleasant graffiti about herself around the street, before playing the victim. Natasha enjoys the attention she receives, but when Michael realises what she did, he chooses to disown his daughter and tells her that he does not care what she gets up to. Natasha is left shocked by Michael's decision and does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it. Natasha becomes insecure following the photo scandal and Michael's rejection of her and she begins to obsess about improving her appearance.

500|$|Reviewing Artpop for USA Today, Jerry Shriver [...] {{recommended}} [...] "Venus" [...] {{as one of}} {{the tracks}} audiences should download. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the song a rating of 3 stars out of 5, and wrote that Gaga's [...] "space-disco ode to the planet of sex sounds even more like Madonna than you'd expect, especially 'Papa Don't Preach'". Philip Matusavage of MusicOMH called the song an attempt to be [...] "self-consciously epic", but it is a [...] "disjointed mess" [...] instead. Sal Cinquemani wrote in Slant Magazine that the song confirms that the singer knows how to write catchy hooks, but she does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with them." [...] In a separate review, Alexa Camp of the same magazine, called the song a [...] "tongue-in-cheek album filler" [...] with non-sense lyrics, feeling that [...] "it was a solar system away from smashes" [...] like the singer's previous releases [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance". Michael Cragg of The Guardian expressed that [...] "Venus" [...] was not [...] "good enough to support the weight of the clanging metaphors" [...] of the album, describing it as [...] "almost parodical." ...|$|E

500|$|Using {{his native}} English, Dassin wrote the {{screenplay}} to Rififi {{in six days}} {{with the help of}} screenwriter René Wheeler, who subsequently took the material and translated it to French. Dassin hated the novel; he was repelled by the story's racist theme in which the rival gangsters were dark Arabs and North Africans pitted against light-skinned Europeans. As well, the book portrayed disquieting events such as necrophilia—scenes that Dassin {{did not know how to}} bring to the big screen. For the rival gang, the producer suggested making them Americans, assuming Dassin would approve. Dassin was against this idea as he didn't want to be accused of taking oblique revenge on screen. Dassin downplayed the rival gangsters' ethnicity in his screenplay, simply electing the Germanic [...] "Grutter" [...] as surname. The greatest change from the book was the heist scene, which spanned but ten pages of the 250-page novel. Dassin focused his screenplay on it to get past other events he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with. As produced, the scene takes a quarter of the film's running time and is shot with only natural sound, sans spoken words or music.|$|E
500|$|Because the dialogue-integrated {{tutorial}} in {{the first}} game had been well received, it was considered a major point for future games in the series. In the first game, Takumi had Phoenix being guided through his first trial by the judge and Mia, and for the second game, he had Phoenix suffer from amnesia; when writing the third game, Takumi did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> as it would not seem credible if Phoenix had amnesia a second time. Eventually he {{came up with the idea}} of using a flashback to a case where Mia had just become an attorney; he developed this idea further, and ended up using flashbacks as a major theme for the game's story. He decided that he wanted to include a case where Mia faces off against Edgeworth back when he was a rookie prosecutor, but encountered a problem: both characters had previously been established as never having lost a single case. Trying to come up with a way for a case in the past to work with neither of them winning or losing, he came up with the story for Terry Fawles, who dies during the trial. The game's main theme was [...] "not everything is always what it seems on the surface".|$|E

[...] Sammy Fong arrives and quickly penetrates Linda's scheme: Linda, frustrated by the five years she has been seeing Sammy, is determined to marry someone, and if Sammy won't step forward, she will settle for Ta. [...] Sammy quickly strikes back by inviting the Wangs, Mei Li and her father to watch the show at his [...] "Celestial Bar" [...] ("Fan Tan Fannie"). [...] Linda does her striptease, realizing too late who is sitting at the best table. [...] Sammy's special guests storm out, except for Ta, who is so humiliated that he does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] He is led away by childhood friend Helen Chao, a seamstress who fits Linda's costumes for her, and whose love for Ta is unrequited.
