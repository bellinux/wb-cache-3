50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas denticulatus), or rock turbot, {{is a large}} marine fish of the Anarhichadidae family. Other {{common names}} include the bull-headed catfish, blue catfish, broad-headed catfish, jelly wolffish, and the Arctic wolffish. Inuit in the Western Arctic (Bathurst Inlet) do not {{distinguish}} between the <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> and the Bering wolffish (A. orientalis), calling both by the name akoak or akoaksaluk ("old woman fish").|$|E
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> are {{demersal}} fish. In summer, mature females lay up to 30,000 extremely {{large eggs}} in a nest on the sea floor. Adults are observed to make limited movements and are not migratory. The <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> favours open continental-shelf water that is cold, usually between 2 and 5°C, and mainly at depths between 400 and 1000 m. The fish is thought to prefer a rocky or muddy sea floor, but is found over all types of ocean bottoms. Sharp teeth and powerful jaws allow the <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> to capture moving (pelagic) fish, starfish, sea urchins, and crabs. They also include some bottom-dwelling (benthic) organisms in their diets. Their fearsome teeth, however, ensure they have few natural predators. They are not retained by fishermen for food because of their watery and jelly-like flesh.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>{{wolffish}}</b> {{is thick}} and heavyset, {{with a large}} head and teeth {{at the front of}} the jaw that are smaller and sharper than the other two wolffish species found in Atlantic Canada. The shape and size of its mouth and teeth allow it to capture moving (pelagic) prey. It can grow to 145 cm in length and almost 20 kg in weight. The <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> has a more uniform body colour than the other wolffish species, ranging from grey to dark chocolate, sometimes with a light violet sheen.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> can be {{distinguished}} from the spotted wolffish (A. minor) and the Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) by its more uniform body colour and its soft, jelly-like musculature. Its head is also proportionally larger to its body and its upper lip is thick and covered with papillae.|$|E
50|$|In the Canadian Arctic, <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> occur {{primarily}} in Davis Strait, with their northernmost limit in Baffin Bay. A few records report {{them in the}} western Arctic, including as far west as Prince Patrick Island, NWT. In the North Atlantic, they are found {{on both sides of}} the ocean, from southern Newfoundland to the Barents Sea. In Canada, they occur primarily off the northeast Newfoundland/Labrador Shelf and the outer Grand Banks.|$|E
50|$|Azteca {{opened in}} 2011, it {{features}} a 10-meter Ocean Tunnel, which has sea creatures including: bonnethead sharks, lion fish, starry pufferfish, surgeon fish, angle fish, catshark and epaulette shark. The tunnel existed before the 2011 addition, but was redeveloped {{for the arrival of}} new fish. Aside from the Ocean Tunnel, Azteca also has jellyfish, seahorse and <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish.</b> The placement of the area, has resulted in the division of the Our Shoreline area, which is now separated into two areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> is {{protected}} under the Canadian federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). A recovery team for the northern and spotted wolffish has almost completed a recovery strategy and plan for both species. The strategy provides a framework for improving the status of wolffish through an enhanced understanding of their life history, potential sources of harm, and implementing management measures such as live release of captured wolffish. The plan also includes habitat stewardship and educational activities designed to involve stakeholders and inform the public.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{related species}} (Atlantic, {{northern}} and spotted wolffish) {{occur in the}} north Atlantic. The <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> has loose gelatinous flesh, but the other species are esteemed as food, both fresh and preserved. They are marketed in Britain as [...] "Scotch halibut" [...] and [...] "Scarborough woof", or, simply [...] "woof" [...] {{in other areas of}} the northeast coast, and are a popular ingredient in fish and chips. The oil extracted from the liver is said to be equal in quality to the best cod liver oil.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} found {{offshore}} in cold, deep water, usually below [...] and between 50 - 800 m in depth but as shallow as 25 m in Canadian Arctic populations. They prefer a coarse sand and sand/shell hash bottom with rocky areas nearby for shelter and nest-building. Spawning occurs in summer to late fall/early winter. As many as 54,600 large eggs to 6 mm are laid {{in deep water}} in clusters on the sea floor, and are guarded primarily by males. Growth rate is slower for this species than for the Atlantic and <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Barents Sea). Fish become mature at seven {{years of age or}} older and can live to 21 years. The species does not form large schools and migrations are local and limited.|$|E
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{are found}} {{offshore}} {{in cold water}} (below 5°C) at depths ranging between the surface and 1200 m, but most often below 150 m. These fish inhabit {{a wide range of}} bottom types, including silt, rocks, coarse sand, and shell hash. They use large rocks for shelter and nest building. Late in the year, females lay about 46,500 large eggs (up to 8 mm in diameter) which sink to the sea floor, where they are guarded in nests by the males until they hatch. Growth rates are slow, and they mature at five years or older. Their lifespans are at least 12 years. Unlike other wolffishes, northerns have been found off the bottom during both the juvenile and adult stages. The species does not form large schools or undertake long migrations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the early}} 2000 s, {{experimental}} rearing of spotted wolffish, Anarhichas minor, {{was started in}} Iceland. Health surveillance, carried out at regular intervals during the rearing period, revealed persistent and highly prevalent Kudoa infections of fish muscles which caused great financial losses due to post mortem myoliquefaction. In addition, during the traditional process of drying and smoking wild Atlantic lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus, the muscles from some fish almost completely disappear and the fish have to be discarded. To describe the etiological agent responsible for these conditions, spotted wolffish, Atlantic wolffish Anarhichas lupus, <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> Anarhichas denticulatus and Atlantic lumpfish were caught off the Icelandic coast and examined {{for the presence of}} Kudoa. We describe a novel myxosporean, Kudoa islandica n. sp., using morphological and molecular data, and show with histopathology that it causes extensive myoliquefaction in three different wild fish hosts, which all are commercially valuable species in Iceland. Although some spore dimensions varied significantly between fish species, the molecular analyses showed that the same parasite was responsible for infection in all fish. The <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> was not found to be infected. Although robustly placed in the Kudoa clade in phylogenetic analyses, K. islandica was phylogenetically distinct from other kudoids. A single myxosporean, K. islandica, is responsible for the infections in the somatic muscles of lumpfish and wolffish, causing extensive post mortem myoliquefaction. This myxosporean is likely to infect other fish species and it is important to study its life cycle in order to evaluate any threat to salmonid culture via the use of lumpfish as a biocontrol for sea lice...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} 7 995 {{individuals}} of three wolffish species {{distributed in the}} north Atlantic were analyzed: 1 016 of <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas denticulatus), 4 783 of Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) and 2 196 of spotted wolffish (A. minor). The individuals sampled were taken in the NAFO Area Divisions 3 NO in spring in the period 2002 - 2005, Div. 3 L in summer in the period 2003 - 2004, Div. 3 M in summer in the period 1993 - 2005, and in the ICES Area Div. IIb in autumn in the period 2004 - 2005. Feeding intensity was higher in the NAFO Area than in the northeast Atlantic (spring-summer vs. autumn), mainly in spotted wolffish in Div. 3 M. The importance of each prey taxa was evaluated using the weight percentage. Wolffish species diet showed geographical differences. Ontogenic diet changes and prey variation throughout the studied period were observed, mainly in Atlantic and spotted wolffishes. This two species preyed primarily on bottom (echinoderms, gastropods and bivalves) and benthopelagic (northern shrimp and redfish) organisms on Flemish Cap and Grand Bank. However fish and northern shrimp predation were more important on the Flemish Cap, mainly in spotted wolffish, showing periods with higher predation on these prey when the biomass of these prey species increased. This fact {{might have been the}} cause of diet overlap between Atlantic and spotted wolffishes in some periods in Div. 3 M. Less ontogenic, annual and geographical diet variations were found in <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> in NAFO Area, feeding mainly on ctenophores; however in Svalbard area, this species showed to be highly piscivore. Three species showed cannibalism but only in the Div. 3 M...|$|E
40|$|Fish species inhabiting the Barents Sea display great {{seasonal}} and between-year {{variation in}} abundance and distribution. This study describes the assemblages and distributions of fish {{species in the}} south-western part of the Barents Sea which includes the Polar front. The area has an unpredictable environment due to variable inflow of Atlantic water and assemblages and distributions of fish species differ between Arctic and Atlantic water masses. These assemblages can be identified as distinct groups corresponding to the different environments. In the period 1997 – 1999, 57 fish species and shrimp were identified and 32 species/species groups {{were used in the}} statistical analyses. Cluster and Correspondence analyses (CA) showed that the fish community consists of four different assemblages: A Northern, a Southern, a Deep and a Central group. In the Northern assemblage, species composition and spatial distribution varied least. The Central assemblage was the most variable. The Northern group included Polar cod, Atlantic poacher, spotted snake blenny and two species from the sculpin family. The Southern group included haddock and Norway pout. The Deep group included <b>northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> and long rough dab. Temperature explained 22 % of the variation in the species data, and depth 12 % of the variation. The assemblages are coherent with previous zoogeographic studies from the Barents Sea...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and <b>Northern</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and spotted wolffish (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Extending depth range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Acadian redfish and golden redfish appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
