50|$|Camphene is a bicyclic monoterpene. It {{is nearly}} {{insoluble}} in water, but very soluble in common organic solvents. It volatilizes readily {{at room temperature}} and has a pungent smell. It is a minor constituent of many essential oils such as turpentine, cypress oil, camphor <b>oil,</b> citronella <b>oil,</b> <b>neroli,</b> ginger <b>oil,</b> and valerian. It is produced industrially by catalytic isomerization of the more common alpha-pinene. Camphene {{is used in the}} preparation of fragrances and as a food additive for flavoring. Its mid-19th century use as a fuel for lamps was limited by its explosiveness.|$|R
40|$|Current {{studies have}} shown that vapors of {{essential}} <b>oils</b> such as <b>neroli</b> and lavender could help reduce anxiety levels [1]. Inhalation of these essential oils may trigger the limbic system of the brain giving the resulting beneficial effects. However, further investigation of these oils is needed to provide evidence that they relieve anxiety [2]. This study was carried out with gerbils subjected to aromatherapy inhaling neroli. Forced swimming task and locomotor activity were measured to evaluate levels of anxiety [3, 4]. <b>Neroli</b> essential <b>oil</b> used in this study was supplied by Australian Botanical Products Ply Ltd. (Hallam Victoria, Australia). 100 L of neroli was vaporized in a nebulizing diffuser and was inhaled by individual gerbils for 30 min in the behavior box.

5000|$|Nerol is a {{monoterpene}} {{found in}} many essential oils such as lemongrass and hops. It was originally isolated from <b>neroli</b> <b>oil,</b> hence its name. This colourless liquid is used in perfumery. Like geraniol, nerol has a sweet rose odor but it {{is considered to be}} fresher.|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used floral oils in perfumery. It is a nontoxic, nonirritant, nonsensitizing, nonphototoxic substance, but does contain known allergens. It blends well with any citrus oil, various floral absolutes, and most of the {{synthetic}} components available on the market. <b>Neroli</b> <b>oil</b> is a classic element in fragrance design and one of the most commonly used in the industry.|$|E
50|$|Absolutes {{are usually}} more {{concentrated}} than essential oils. Also, {{the efficiency and}} low temperature of the extraction process helps prevent damage to the fragrant compounds. With {{a good understanding of}} the solvent they are using, extractors can produce absolutes with aromas closer to the original plant product than is possible with essential oils produced through distillation. Examples of this are rose otto (steam-distilled rose oil), as opposed to rose absolute, and <b>neroli</b> (steam-distilled <b>oil</b> from the blossom of the bitter orange tree), as opposed to orange blossom absolute. Also, some raw materials are either too delicate or too inert to be steam-distilled and can only yield their aroma through other methods, such as solvent extraction or lipid absorption. Examples of these are jasmine, tuberose, mimosa, and beeswax.|$|R
50|$|The {{fragrance}} of ylang-ylang is rich and deep with notes of rubber and custard, and bright with hints of jasmine and <b>neroli.</b> The essential <b>oil</b> {{of the flower}} is obtained through steam distillation of the flowers and separated into different grades (extra, 1, 2, or 3) according to when the distillates are obtained. The main aromatic components of ylang-ylang oil are benzyl acetate, linalool, p-cresyl methyl ether, and methyl benzoate, responsible for its characteristic odor.|$|R
25|$|Plants {{have long}} been used in {{perfumery}} {{as a source of}} essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually secondary metabolites produced by plants as protection against herbivores, infections, as well as to attract pollinators. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of coriander have remarkably different odors from each other. Orange leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of petitgrain, <b>neroli,</b> and orange <b>oils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Citrus × aurantium subsp. amara is a spiny {{evergreen}} tree {{native to}} southern Vietnam, but widely cultivated. It {{is used as}} grafting stock for citrus trees, in marmalade, and in liqueur such as triple sec, Grand Marnier and Curaçao. It is also cultivated for the essential oil expressed from the fruit, and for <b>neroli</b> <b>oil</b> and orange flower water, which are distilled from the flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Bitter Seville oranges grow {{on trees}} lining the city streets. Formerly, large {{quantities}} were collected and exported to Britain {{to be used}} in marmalade. [...] Today the fruit is used predominantly as compost locally, rather than as a foodstuff. According to legend, the Arabs brought the bitter orange to Seville from East Asia via Iraq around the 10th century to beautify and perfume their patios and gardens, as well as to provide shade. The flowers of the tree are a source of <b>neroli</b> <b>oil,</b> commonly used in perfumery and in skin lotions for massage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neroli</b> <b>oil</b> is an {{essential}} oil produced from the blossom of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium subsp. amara or Bigaradia). Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets. Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. Orange blossom {{can be described as}} smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred to with different names, {{is a result of the}} process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of enfleurage.|$|E

5000|$|Perfume oils {{are often}} diluted with a solvent, {{though this is}} not always the case, and its {{necessity}} is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. Perfume has a mixture of about 10-20% perfume oils mixed with alcohol (acting as a diffusing agent delivering the fragrant odor) and a trace of water. Colognes have about 3-5% perfume oil mixed with 80-90% alcohol with about 5 to 15 percent water in the mix. Originally, eau de cologne was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons, oranges, tangerines, limes, and grapefruits. These were combined with such substances as lavender and <b>neroli</b> (orange-flower <b>oil).</b> Toilet water has the least amount of perfume oil mixture among the three main liquid [...] "perfumery" [...] categories. It has only about 2 to 8 percent of some type of perfume oil and 60-80% alcohol dispersent with water making up the difference. Toilet waters are a less concentrated form of these above types of alcohol-based perfumes. Traditionally cologne is usually made of citrus oils and fragrances, while toilet waters are not limited to this specification.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of inhalation of the essential oil of Citrus aurantium L. var. amara (<b>neroli</b> <b>oil)</b> on menopausal symptoms, stress, and estrogen in postmenopausal women. Sixty-three healthy postmenopausal women were randomized to inhale 0. 1 % or 0. 5 % <b>neroli</b> <b>oil</b> or almond oil (control) for 5 minutes twice daily for 5 days. Menopause-related symptoms, {{as determined by the}} Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL); sexual desire visual analog scale (VAS); serum cortisol and estrogen concentrations, blood pressure, pulse, and stress VAS, were measured before and after inhalation. Compared with the control group, the two <b>neroli</b> <b>oil</b> groups showed significant improvements in the physical domain score of the MENQOL and in sexual desire. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the group inhaling 0. 5 % <b>neroli</b> <b>oil</b> than in the control group. Compared with the control group, the two <b>neroli</b> <b>oil</b> groups showed significantly lower diastolic blood pressure and tended to improve pulse rate and serum cortisol and estrogen concentrations. These findings indicate that inhalation of <b>neroli</b> <b>oil</b> helps relieve menopausal symptoms, increase sexual desire, and reduce blood pressure in postmenopausal women. <b>Neroli</b> <b>oil</b> may have potential as an effective intervention to reduce stress and improve the endocrine system...|$|E
40|$|Neroli {{essential}} oil is {{extracted from the}} fragant blossoms of the bitter orange tree. It {{is one of the}} most widely used floral oils in perfumery. In this study chemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of <b>neroli</b> <b>oil</b> are investigated. The {{essential oil}} of fresh Citrus aurantium L. Flowers (<b>Neroli</b> <b>oil)</b> cultivated in North East of Tunisia (Nabeul) were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. About 33 compounds were identified, representing 99 % of the total oil. Limonene (27, 5 %) was the main component followed by (E) -nerolidol (17, 5 %), α-terpinyl acetate (11, 5 %) and (E,E) -farnesol (8 %).

Furthermore, it was reportedly effective {{for the care of}} several diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and depressive illness. To investigate the pharmacological effects of {{essential oils}}, we developed an in vitro assay system using immortalized hypothalamic neuronal cells (GT 1 – 7 cells). In this study, we evaluated the effects of essential oils on neuronal death induced by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), aluminum, zinc, or the antagonist of estrogen receptor (tamoxifen). Among tests of various essential oils, we found that H 2 O 2 -induced neuronal death was attenuated by the essential oils of damask rose, eucalyptus, fennel, geranium, ginger, kabosu, mandarin, myrrh, and <b>neroli.</b> Damask rose <b>oil</b> had protective effects against aluminum-induced neurotoxicity, while geranium and rosemary oil showed protective activity against zinc-induced neurotoxicity.
