40|$|The monthly advective {{supply of}} {{nutrients}} and nutrient pool sizes in the Kattegat and the Belt Sea are estimated {{for the period}} 1989 – 1996 {{from a combination of}} time-dependent hydrodynamic model results and concentration measurements of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), phosphate (DIP) and total nitrogen and phosphorous (TN and TP). The <b>net</b> <b>supply</b> of nutrients to these seas is computed as the sum of advection and nutrient loads from atmosphere and land to the Kattegat and the Belt Sea. The average <b>net</b> <b>supplies</b> are 5000 t N per month and 500 t P per month in both areas, corresponding to approximately 10 % of the amounts required for the annual primary production in the area. The <b>net</b> <b>supply</b> of N displays a small seasonal variation, while the <b>net</b> <b>supply</b> of P exhibits both a spring maximum and a winter minimum. The seasonal nutrient turnover cycle is estimated from the residual of the <b>net</b> <b>supply</b> and the seasonal variation in nutrient pools. Net release of DIP from the sediment takes place during late summer and winter, while net release of DIN occurs mainly during winter. Thus, the net release from the sediment adds to the pool of nutrients available for the spring bloom in the Baltic entrance the following year. Both advection and the autumn–winter release of P exceed the land load of P. Thus, on a short time-scale, reductions in P load cannot be expected to significantly change the availability of P for biogeochemical processes. However, the monthly N load from land and atmosphere exceeds the advective supply. Reductions in N load thu...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypotheses}} that overall wage compression and low female supply relative to demand reduce a country's gender pay gap. Using micro-data for 22 countries over the 1985 - 94 period, {{we find that}} more compressed male wage structures and lower female <b>net</b> <b>supply</b> are both associated with a lower gender pay gap. Since {{it is likely that}} labor market institutions are responsible for an important portion of international differences in wage inequality, the inverse relationship between the gender pay gap and male wage inequality suggests that wage-setting mechanisms, such as encompassing collective bargaining agreements, that provide for relatively high wage floors raise the relative pay of women, who tend to be {{at the bottom of the}} wage distribution. Consistent with this view, we find that the extent of collective bargaining coverage in each country is significantly negatively associated with its gender pay gap. Moreover, the effect of pay structures on the gender pay gap is quantitatively very important: a large part of the difference in the gender differential between high gap and low gap countries is explained by the differences across these countries in overall wage structure, with another potentially important segment due to differences in female <b>net</b> <b>supply.</b> ...|$|R
