Title of diploma thesis: Antiproliferative {{effect of}} Chinese {{bayberry}} oil Bayberry, Myrica rubra, is a fruit tree growing especially in China. It {{is also used}} in traditional medicine. There are many studies confirming its biological activities. Lately, Myrica rubra essential oil (MRO) was isolated from its leaves and its anticancer properties were tested in several intestinal cancer cell lines. In this study, the anticancer effect of MRO was verified by performing a <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>test</b> in cell lines SW 480, SW 620, HT 29 and in non-cancerous human fibroblast cell line GF 6 for comparison. HT 29 was the most sensitive cell line, contrary to GF 6, which was not affected by MRO. We also tested a possible mechanism of action, a production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The essential oil significantly elevated the generation of ROS and this effect was concentration dependent. We also searched for the active substances in MRO. We conducted the tests with four sesquiterpenes - α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene-oxide and trans-nerolidol. The <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>test</b> showed [...] ...|$|E

The current work aimed to test cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of quercetol on HepG 2 cells. Quercetol was isolated from Ocimum sanctum and characterized by gas chromatography–tandom mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Quercetol (50 – 600 µg/mL) was examined for cytotoxic activity by tetrazolium salt and <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>tests</b> and comet assay for genotoxicity, using HepG 2 cells, over 24 hours. Data from 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide and <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated quercetol-induced cytotoxicity in HepG 2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. With 4 &# 39;, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole staining, a significant induction of chromosomal condensation was observed at 300 µg/mL of quercetol. DNA fragmentation analysis showed that quercetol produced cell death in HepG 2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, our study suggests that an environmentally relevant concentration of quercetol, which was a chemically standardized extract from O. sanctum, induced cell death and DNA damage in HepG 2 cells.

The mechanism of action is based on inhibition of microtubule polymerization by binding of ABZ to the β-subunit of tubulin in parasites.

40|$|Although the {{sesquiterpene}} lactone thapsigargin {{has been}} shown to possess hyperplastic and tumor-promoting activities when applied topically to mouse skin in vivo, the cellular mechanism(s) which underlie these effects are unclear. We show here that thapsigargin treatment of primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes increased intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration (Cai) in a concentration-dependent manner. Thapsigargin induced a rapid, transient elevation in keratinocyte Cai, in part due to the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. This response was followed by a sustained elevation in Ca 2 +, resulting entirely from calcium influx. Thapsigargin elicited a biphasic effect on keratinocyte DNA synthesis: a rapid inhibitory effect (50 – 60 % inhibition at 4 – 8 h), followed by a very marked and sustained elevation. Prolonged treatment of keratinocytes with thapsigargin at relatively high concentrations resulted in cytotoxicity (inhibition of <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake).</b> The rapid antiproliferative effect of thapsigargin was not associated with cytotoxicity, as determined by either <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> or by trypan blue exclusion, and was not blocked by pretreatment with Ro 31 – 7549, a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C. The rapid antiproliferative effect of thapsigargin was associated with rapid, transient activation of keratinocyte c-fos expression and rapid inhibition of total protein synthesis. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that the hyperplastic and tumor-promoting activities of thapsigargin on epidermis in vivo result from direct keratinocyte growth stimulation as a consequence of a prolonged elevation in levels of Cai...|$|R

40|$|Cell-to-cell fusion {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infections. An assay to measure the antifusion activity of serum has been developed by using the fusion event that occurs between H 9 cells chronically infected with HIV- 1 (H 9 IIIB) and fusion-susceptible MT- 2 cells. The endpoint is determined by measuring <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> in cells after syncytium formation is allowed to occur in the presence of various serum dilutions. The assessment of antifusion activity in serum by <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> has been shown to correlate with syncytium reduction as determined by direct counting. The optimal number and ratio of cells in the suspension for efficiency and speed of the assay have been determined. With this assay it was shown that 50 % of 36 serum specimens capable of neutralizing cell-free virions failed to inhibit syncytium formation. The assay can thus measure a distinct activity in HIV- 1 -immune human sera which is a subset of neutralization activity. Because of the potential role of this activity in the rate of disease progression and protective immune responses, the antifusion assay will be an important tool for the investigation of disease pathogenesis and for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome vaccine development. The assay can also be applied to the investigation of the pathogenesis of the fusion event at the cellular level. The ability to use absorbance measurements rather than syncytium counts as the endpoint facilitates direct computer-assisted data analysis, which expedites the performance of the assay...|$|R

On the basis of their cytotoxic activity the compounds investigated were grader as follows: Fe 2 (TAMEN) Cl 6 > Fe 2 (BAMP) Cl 4 > Fe 2 (BAMP) Cl 6, Tested independently, both ligands were no or very low toxic at the concentrations examined...|$|R
40|$|This work {{studies the}} effects of suramin on the growth and {{morphology}} of cell strain U 285, obtained from human prostate hypertrophic tissue and cultured in vitro. The FRAME cytotoxicity test was performed to evaluate the inhibition of growth induced by suramin. Cells were exposed to suramin {{at the time of}} seeding and 24 hours later; <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> was added with and without suramin. An optical microscope connected to a computer-aided system and a scanning electron microscope were used to study morphological changes induced by suramin. Growth inhibition depends on drug concentration and exposure period. Moreover, the effect of suramin on <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> is reversible. Suramin 1, 000 mu M causes the cells to become spheroid, and they fail to form a monolayer. Our data indicate that the addition of suramin during the lag phase decreases the rate of cell proliferation...|$|R
