5|$|Chuck and Sarah turn to Jack to {{help them}} {{continue}} Daphne's con and capture the Zephyr. They manage to lead the Klügs away from the reception and incapacitate them, {{only to find that}} <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> has the Zephyr. Jack realizes that the Klügs have been performing a shell game: the government has been pursuing them for the Zephyr when <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> ever had it; their father (Timothy V. Murphy) had it all along. Meanwhile, the bride's father realizes he is being conned and leads Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) away at gunpoint. When Chuck and Sarah confront him, Klüg uses Morgan as a human shield, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) takes aim at his head. However, Jack manages to talk Klüg down {{for the sake of the}} bride's happiness.|$|E

5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds).

The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E

Slave Labor Graphics also distributes the comic digitally.|$|E
