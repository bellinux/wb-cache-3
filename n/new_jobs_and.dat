Long-term health problems/disability is associated with significantly worse outcomes on all three measures.

To achieve that goal, he created the public-private Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), became chairman of its board, and ordered it to “act {{at the speed of}} business, not the speed of government,” to attract new jobs. During its first year, the IEDC closed more transactions than similar efforts had during the previous two years combined. Between 2005 and 2008, 485 businesses committed to creating more than 60,000 <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> invest $14.5 billion into the Indiana economy.

When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged {{his family and friends}} to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about £5/5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find <b>new</b> <b>jobs,</b> <b>and</b> persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan.

His economic development program, which led to construction or expansion of 749 industries, 57,000 <b>new</b> <b>jobs,</b> <b>and</b> more than $1billion in new plant investment, was recognized as the nation's best by the Society of Industrial Investors in 1964 and generated an additional $100million in state revenue. The pro-administration majority in the legislature was expanded in the 1965 elections, and Waterfield, Breathitt's sometimes hostile lieutenant governor, was stripped of much of his authority. Former governor Lawrence Wetherby was selected president pro tempore of the senate, providing effective leadership in that house of the General Assembly. Wetherby introduced a budget which was 27 percent larger than the previous one and contained appropriations {{for most of the}} state's political districts.
