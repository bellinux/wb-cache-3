To {{describe}} the <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> marketed in Brazil {{during the period}} 2000 – 2004, compare the description to the country’s burden of disease, and suggest initiatives capable of addressing the situation {{from the perspective of}} a developing country.

The <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> were categorized by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification, indication, and innovation, and compared with the needs of the country’s burden of disease. Data on the morbidity and mortality rates of selected diseases (diabetes, Hansen’s disease, hypertension, tuberculosis) were retrieved from official documents and the literature. Results. During the period investigated, 109 <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> were launched. Most were general anti-infectives for systemic use (19), followed by antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (16).

40|$|Background: Many {{analyses}} of HIV treatment decisions assume a fixed formulary of HIV <b>drugs.</b> However, <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> are approved nearly twice a year, {{and the rate}} of availability of <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> may affect treatment decisions, particularly when to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART). Objectives: To determine the impact of considering the availability of <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> on the optimal initiation criteria for ART and outcomes in patients with HIV/AIDS. Methods: We enhanced a previously described simulation model of the optimal time to initiate ART to incorporate the rate of availability of <b>new</b> antiviral <b>drugs.</b> We assumed that the future rate of availability of <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> would be similar to the past rate of availability of <b>new</b> <b>drugs,</b> and we estimated the past rate by fitting a statistical model to actual HIV drug approval data from 1982 – 2010.

5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a <b>new</b> <b>drug,</b> sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E

5|$|He {{writes that}} these {{positive}} results are achieved {{in a number}} of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the <b>new</b> <b>drug</b> to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have no idea what the effects are of the drugs they prescribe.|$|E

Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers.

40|$|In recent years, a {{substantial}} amount of technological progress in medicine has taken the form of pharmaceutical innovation. This paper uses the launch of a series of <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> designed for treating type 2 diabetic patients as an example to investigate the determinants that affect the diffusion of new medical technology. Based on prescription-level data that are obtained from the national health insurance program in Taiwan, we find that the probability of prescribing <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> declines as more competing products enter the pharmaceutical market. Meanwhile, physicians are less likely to prescribe <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> to treat their patients as the provider market becomes less concentrated. These results suggest that the providers' incentives for cost reduction dominate incentives for quality improvement as markets become more competitive and hence an increase in market competition is associated with a decrease in the diffusion of <b>new</b> <b>drugs.</b> As a result, access to <b>new</b> <b>drugs</b> is not uniform among patients in a country with universal coverage for prescription drugs.

5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease.

Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, <b>new</b> <b>drug</b> treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) under a <b>new</b> <b>drug</b> development partnership between Glaxo and Icos {{that began in}} August1991.

Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues.

5|$|Although Allied {{casualties}} {{during the}} battle had been light, {{in the wake of}} the battle, Milne Bay suffered an epidemic of malaria that posed a threat to the base as great as that from the Japanese attack. Over one-sixth of Milne Force, including Clowes, came down with the disease. The incidence of malaria soared to 33 per thousand per week in September (equivalent to 1,716 per thousand per annum), and to 82 per thousand per week in December (equivalent to 4,294 per thousand per annum). At this rate, the whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months. It placed enormous strain on the medical units and the supplies of anti-malarial drugs. The Chief Pathologist of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford went to see Blamey, who was now in personal command of New Guinea Force, and told him that 1,000 men and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies were urgently required at Milne Bay to avert a disaster. Blamey took a personal interest in the matter. He expedited supply shipments, and made the required personnel available. The arrival of quantities of the <b>new</b> <b>drug</b> atabrine allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine. The incidence of malaria dropped dramatically after December, the month in which atabrine became the official Australian prophylactic drug, and by March 1943 the crisis had passed.
