40|$|We {{report an}} {{immunohistochemical}} method for mapping {{the distribution of}} neuroepithelial bodies (<b>NEBs)</b> in whole-mount preparations of the intrapulmonary airways. The lungs of 8 - and 50 -day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed with ethanol-acetic acid by intratracheal instillation. The major axial airway path of the infracardiac lobe was exposed and isolated by microdissection. <b>NEBs</b> were identified by calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity and their distribution mapped by generation and branch-point number. A distinct pattern was noted with greater prevalence of <b>NEBs</b> in proximal airway generations compared with more distal airways. No significant difference was noted in the distribution pattern or absolute number of <b>NEBs</b> between neonates and adults when compared by airway generation. <b>NEBs</b> were found more frequently on the ridges of the bifurcation than in {{other regions of the}} bifurcating airway wall. The ease of identification of total numbers of <b>NEBs</b> and their specific location by airway generation in whole-mount preparations of the bronchial tree completely removes the necessity of examining multiple sections and performing extensive morphometric procedures. Whole-mount airway preparations allow for the analysis and comparison of larger sample sizes per experimental group without labor-intensive approaches.

40|$|The {{pulmonary}} neuroepithelial bodies (<b>NEBs)</b> constitute polymodal airway chemosensors {{for monitoring}} and signaling ambient gas concentrations (pO 2, pCO 2 /H +) via complex innervation {{to the brain}} stem controlling breathing. <b>NEBs</b> produce the bioactive amine, serotonin (5 -HT), {{and a variety of}} peptides with multiple effects on lung physiology and other organ systems. <b>NEBs</b> in mammals appear prominent and numerous during fetal and neonatal periods, and decline in the post-natal period suggesting an important role during perinatal adaptation. The naked mole-rat (NMR), Heterocephalus glaber, has adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of living in subterranean burrows in large colonies (up to 300 colony mates). The crowded, unventilated burrows are environments of severe hypoxia and hypercapnia. However, NMRs adjust readily to above ground conditions. The chemosensory <b>NEBs</b> of this species were characterized and compared to those of the conventional Wistar rat (WR) to identify similarities and differences that could explain the NMR’s adaptability to environments. A multilabel immunohistochemical analysis combined with confocal microscopy revealed that the expression patterns of amine, peptide, neuroendocrine, innervation markers and chemosensor component proteins in <b>NEBs</b> of NMR were similar to that of WR. However, we found the following differences: 1) <b>NEBs</b> in both neonatal and adult NMR lungs were significantly larger and more numerous as compared to WR; 2) <b>NEBs</b> in NMR had a more variable compact cel...|$|R
40|$|Whole-mount airway {{preparations}} {{isolated from}} the lungs of mice treated by intraperitoneal injection of naphthalene and allowed to recover for 5 days were examined for the distribution and abundance of solitary pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and neuroepithelial bodies (<b>NEBs)</b> along the main axial pathway of the right middle lobe. Sham mice treated with corn oil vehicle were examined in a similar manner. An antibody to calcitonin gene-related peptide, a neuroendocrine cell marker, was used to identify the location, size, and number of PNECs and <b>NEBs</b> in the airways. After naphthalene treatment and epithelial repair, <b>NEBs</b> were significantly increased along {{the walls of the}} airways as well as on branch point ridges. The surface area covered by <b>NEBs</b> composed of 20 or fewer PNECs was significantly enlarged after naphthalene treatment compared with control <b>NEBs</b> of an equivalent cell number.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis focused on neural precursors derived from mouse ES cells (also called neural embryoid bodies, <b>NEBs)</b> in particular attempting to direct their differentiation towards specific telencephalic precursors, {{with a view to}} providing an alternative donor cell source to primary foetal tissue for the generation of DARPP- 32 positive medium spiny neurons (MSNs) for neural transplantation in Huntington's disease. Neural induction of mouse ES cells was addressed, with further directed differentiation by addition of factors known to be important in the neural tube for development of specific telencephalic precursors. Subsequent neuronal differentiation of precursors was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. Chapter 3 characterised the neural and forebrain features of <b>NEBs</b> up to day 8 in neural induction medium, using a reporter cell line, in which LacZ was tagged to the early forebrain marker, Foxgl. Addition of FGF 2 but not the Wnt inhibitor DKK- 1, increased the forebrain population within the overall cell population. Day 8 <b>NEBs,</b> subjected to neuronal differentiation conditions, yielded p-III-tubulin positive neurons but no DARPP- 32 expression. In Chapter 4, <b>NEBs</b> cultured for either 8 or 16 days were compared for expression of neural markers and then transplanted into the QA lesioned rat striatum to assess their potential to generate mature phenotypes in vivo. Day 8 <b>NEBs</b> generated teratomas by 2 weeks post transplantation. At 6 weeks post-transplantation, day 16 <b>NEBs</b> generated heterogeneous grafts with graft-derived neurons and glia, but no graft-derived DARPP- 32 expression. Expression of dorso-ventral telencephalon markers in <b>NEBs</b> was investigated in Chapter 5, drawing comparisons to expression in the mouse (El 4) developing telencephalon. The effects of the SHH agonist, purmorphamine, and the SHH antagonist, cyclopamine, were used in an attempt to enrich the forebrain precursors generated in Chapter 3 for ventral telencephalic-like precursors. Although gene expression changes were demonstrated, no distinct dorso-ventral patterns were shown. In vitro neuronal differentiation of day 16 <b>NEBs</b> was analysed in Chapter 6, in particular looking for expression of the MSN marker DARPP- 32. Cultures of cells from the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) (the origin of MSNs) were used to determine if certain factors could increase the yield of DARPP- 32 positive neurons. Addition of BDNF yielded the highest proportion of DARPP- 32 from LGE. However, when this condition was applied to neuronal differentiation cultures of day 16 <b>NEBs</b> there was no effect on the expression of GAB A, DARPP- 32 or FoxPl, all markers of MSNs. In Chapter 7, day 16 <b>NEBs,</b> with and without addition of purmorphamine, were transplanted into the QA lesioned mouse striatum. All resulting grafts were small, but analysis revealed densities of neuronal and striatal markers in day 16 NEB-derived grafts to be similar to E 14 -derived grafts.

They won their first game against in-state rival Vanderbilt 5-4, but lost to host Louisville in their second game 3-2 and were eliminated by Vanderbilt 6-0 in game three. In 2010, outfielder Bryce Brentz was selected in the supplemental first round with the 36th overall pick by the Boston Red Sox, becoming the second highest Blue Raider picked in the MLB First-Year Player Draft. The highest was pitcher Dewon Brazelton who was selected third overall by the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2001 MLB First-Year Player Draft. In the summer of 2012, Steve Peterson decided to retire. Peterson and John Stanford, the previous coach before him, had been the only two coaches in the past 38 years. Peterson retires with an all-time career record of 791-637-3.
