The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> were of limited consequence economically.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his <b>notice,</b> <b>and</b> {{some of his}} actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians {{that he was an}} incompetent commander.|$|E

5|$|Originally Aristotle divided {{all living}} things between plants, which {{generally}} do not move fast enough for humans to <b>notice,</b> <b>and</b> animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, {{it has become clear}} that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.|$|E

As substantive due process arises from the liberty clause, a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E

5|$|Robert Kurrle (February 2, 1890 – October 27, 1932), {{also known}} as Robert B. Kurrle, was an American cinematographer during the silent and early talking film eras. Prior to {{entering}} the film industry, he was already experimenting with aerial photography. Considered a very prominent cinematographer, even his early work received <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> praise from both critics and other industry professionals. The advent of sound film did not abate his continued rise, and he became the top director of photography at Warner Brothers by 1932.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach's {{government}} also responded with legislation entitled the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Bill 46), which would split the EUB into two parts: the Alberta Utilities Commission (responsible for regulating utilities) and the Energy Resources Conservation Board (responsible for regulating oil and gas). The legislation was controversial, as {{elements of the}} EUB's governing legislation that provided for public <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> consultation {{in the event of}} energy construction projects were left out. Opposition parties and advocacy groups charged that this was an assault on both landowners' rights and the environment.

5|$|The {{film was}} made {{as an attempt}} to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo's live {{performances}} on film, and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects, and to serve as a transition between the group's former cabaret style and a new wave-based style. Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been perceived as being offensive, the film was screened as a midnight movie, received positive <b>notice,</b> <b>and</b> developed a cult following. In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD, and in 2008, the film was colorized.|$|E

5|$|Alternative rock {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term {{consisting of}} music that differs greatly {{in terms of its}} sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and alternative hip hop. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.|$|E
5|$|Born {{near the}} New South Wales country town of Bathurst, Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and {{played in the}} grade cricket {{competition}} while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for the New South Wales cricket team and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring Englishmen in 195455. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> had to be called from work {{on the morning of}} the match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season to train and with the Australian field hockey team for the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 195758, he held down a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 195960 Australian Second XI tour to New Zealand.|$|E
