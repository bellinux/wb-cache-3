50|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of Yemen's economy, generating more than 20 {{percent of gross domestic}} product (GDP) since 1990 (20.4 percent in 2005 according to the Central Bank of Yemen) and employing more than half (54.2 percent in 2003) of the working population. However, a U.S. government estimate suggests that the sector accounted for only 13.5 percent of GDP in 2005. Numerous environmental problems hamper growth in this sector—soil erosion, sand dune encroachment, and deforestation—but the greatest problem by far is the scarcity of water. As a result of low levels of rainfall, agriculture in Yemen relies heavily on the extraction of groundwater, a resource that is being depleted. Yemen's water tables are falling by approximately two meters a year, and it is estimated that Sanaa's groundwater supplies could be exhausted by 2008. The use of irrigation has made fruit and vegetables Yemen's primary cash crops. With the rise in the output of irrigated crops, the production of traditional rain-fed crops such as cereals has declined. According to the Central Bank of Yemen, in 2005 the production of khat, a mildly narcotic and heavily cultivated plant that produces <b>natural</b> <b>stimulants</b> when its leaves are chewed, rose 6.7 percent and accounted for 5.8 percent of GDP; its usage in Yemen is widespread. According to the World Bank and other economists, cultivation of this plant plays a dominant role in Yemen's agricultural economy, constituting 10 percent of GDP and employing an estimated 150,000 persons while consuming an estimated 30 percent of irrigation water and displacing land areas that could otherwise be used for exportable coffee, fruits, and vegetables.|$|E

In a tumor cell line of the mouse anterior pituitary (AtT- 20 /D 16 - 16) consisting of a homogeneous population of corticotrophs, CRF is known to increase adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activities {{as well as to}} release ACTH. To determine whether activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is essential for CRF to evoke the secretion of ACTH, an inhibitor (PKI) of this kinase was inserted into AtT- 20 cells. This was accomplished by first encapsulating PKI into liposomes and then covalently coupling them to protein A for binding to antibodies directed against an AtT- 20 cell surface antigen, N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule). The binding of the liposomes to the anti-N-CAM antibodies led to the internalization of the PKI into the tumor cells. The PKI treatment greatly attenuated CRF-stimulated ACTH release as well as the secretory response to beta-adrenergic agonists. However, ACTH release in response to caerulein, an agonist of cholecystokinin 8 receptors, was not altered by the PKI treatment. CRF treatment also increased the levels of mRNA for proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor for ACTH in AtT- 20 cells. Application of liposomes containing PKI to AtT- 20 cells blocked the ability of CRF and 8 -bromo-cAMP, but not phorbol ester, to increase POMC mRNA levels. The results revealed an essential role for cAMP in mediating the effect of CRF on ACTH release and POMC gene expression...|$|R
40|$|When females mate promiscuously, sperm from rival males compete {{within the}} female {{reproductive}} tract to fertilize ova. Sperm competition {{is a powerful}} selective force that has shaped sexual behavior, sperm production, and sperm morphology. However, nothing {{is known about the}} influence of sperm competition on fertilization-related processes, because it has been assumed that sperm competition only involves a race to reach the site of fertilization. We compared four closely related rodent species with different levels of sperm competition to examine whether there are differences in the proportion of spermatozoa that become ready to interact with the ovum (“capacitated”) and in the proportion of spermatozoa that experience the acrosome reaction in response to a <b>natural</b> <b>stimulant.</b> Our results show that differences between species in levels of sperm competition were associated with the proportion of spermatozoa that undergo capacitation and with the proportion of spermatozoa that respond to progesterone, an ovum-associated signal. Sperm competition thus favors a larger population of spermatozoa that are competent to fertilize, and spermatozoa that are more sensitive to the signals emitted by the ovum and that may penetrate the ova vestments more rapidly. These results suggest that, contrary to previous assumptions, competition between spermatozoa from rival males continues at the site of fertilization. These findings may have further evolutionary implications because the enhanced competitiveness of spermatozoa during fertilization may increase the risk of polyspermy to females. This could lead to antagonistic coevolution between the sexes and may contribute to the explanation of the rapid divergence observed in fertilization-related traits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In Low and Middle Income Countries, {{mental health}} {{services}} are often poorly developed {{due to the lack}} of resources and trained personnel. In order to overcome these challenges, new ways of care have been suggested such as a focus on community-based services. In Somalia, the consumption of the <b>natural</b> <b>stimulant</b> khat is highly prevalent, aggravating mental illness. At the same time, mental health care is largely unavailable to the vast majority of the population. In a pilot project, we tested possibilities for effective measures in community-based out-patient mental health care. Methods Thirty-five male patients with chronic psychotic disorders and their carers were involved in a 10 -months follow-up study. All of them abused khat. Seventeen outpatients experiencing acute psychotic episodes were recruited from the community and received an intensive six week home-based treatment package. Additionally eighteen patients with chronic psychotic disorders in remission were recruited either following hospital discharge or from the community. In a second phase of the study, both groups received community-based relapse prevention that differed in the degree of the family’s responsibility for the treatment. The treatment package was comprised of psycho-education, low-dose neuroleptic treatment, monthly home visits and counseling. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was applied three times. Additionally, we assessed functioning, khat use and other outcomes. Results Of the 35 patients enrolled in the study, 33 participated in the 10 -month follow-up. Outpatients improved significantly in the first six weeks of treatment and did not differ from remitted patients at the start of the second treatment phase. In the preventive treatment phase, we find heterogeneous outcomes that diverge between symptom and functioning domains. With the exception of depressive symptoms, symptoms in all patients tended to worsen. The outpatient group had higher BPRS positive and negative symptom scores compared to the remitted group. Levels of functioning in 20 out of 33 patients significantly improved, with small differences between groups. Most patients experienced improvements in basic functioning, such as communication, self-care etc. Khat use could only be reduced in the group of outpatients. Conclusions Community-based out-patient mental health treatment for chronic psychotic disorders has demonstrated positive effects in Somalia and is both feasible and practical, despite facing formidable challenges, e. g. controlling khat intake. </p...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have been}} used in {{treatment}} and prevention of diseases for thousands of years. In modern medicine there is a trend towards isolation and identification of bioactive molecules, whereas plant preparations continue to be used in traditional medicinal systems. However, combinations of drugs are usually administered in treatment of complex diseases like cancer and HIV, in order to target multiple deregulated cellular pathways simultaneously. Khat (Catha edulis Forsk.) has been cultivated for centuries primarily due to its use as a <b>natural</b> <b>stimulant.</b> The stimulating potential of khat is mainly caused by its content of cathinone, an alkaloid with structure and pharmacological profile similar to amphetamine. Cathinone is a labile precursor for the less bioactive derivatives cathine and norephedrine. An organic extract of khat was previously reported to induce programmed cell death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, while being less toxic to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this study, cellular and molecular effects of an extract of khat were further elucidated in AML cell lines and compared with the cancer therapeutics camptothecin. Early effects of khat and the khat amphetamines on intracellular signaling responses in normal peripheral leukocytes were investigated, in addition to cytotoxic effects. The khat extract was fractionated and analysed for cytotoxicity in AML cell lines, and the fractions analysed by mass spectrometry. The khat extract was shown to induce cell death in a subset of genetically diverse AML cell lines, indicating involvement of specific mechanisms. In contrast to camptothecin, khat caused structural damage to mitochondria and mediated impaired mitochondrial respiration. In addition, khat was observed to induce formation of autophagosomes, indicating activation of autophagy. The survival protein Bcl- 2 protected against camptothecin, and partial protection was obtained against khat-induced cell death. Procaspase- 8 of the receptormediated cell death pathway was activated by khat, while levels of the death antagonists Mcl- 1 and c-FLIPL were reduced. The stress sensor and tumour suppressor protein p 53 was induced and modulated in khat-mediated death, but not by sub-lethal dilutions of the khat extract or in khat-resistant cells. Experiments using p 53 knock-down and knock-out cells demonstrated that khat-mediated cell death was independent of p 53. The p 53 protein was suggested to primarily act as a stress sensor in AML cells that were susceptible to khatinduced cell death. Fractionation of the khat extract and bio-guided screening in AML cell lines resulted in identification of three separate cytotoxic fractions. The khat fractions were analysed by mass spectrometry, which led to the partial characterization of a phenylpropanoid glycoside suggested to represent the major cytotoxic constituent in the khat extract. In contrast to khat, the khat amphetamines were observed to be relatively non-toxic to AML cell lines. Khat and the khat amphetamines were shown to mediate early and generally opposite effects on signaling mediators in normal immune cells. Whereas khat activated stress sensors, like p 38 and p 53, and demonstrated cytotoxic effects, the khat amphetamines attenuated activating modifications of several signaling proteins, including p 53, and appeared to have a stimulating effect on lymphocyte proliferation...|$|R

There are two coffee tree species, which are cultivated worldwide, i. e. Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora var. Robusta. Coffee, which is a favoured <b>natural</b> <b>stimulant,</b> has a substantial contingent on the intake of antioxidants in the population, which provides protection against food associated diseases. Studies, which determine the influence of storing on several components, the antioxidative potential and sensory properties of coffee, are rarely available. Therefore, it was highly interesting to research within the framework of this existing diploma thesis, whether there is a change on certain parameters during a storage period of coffee. The selected ingredients like caffeine, chlorogenic acid and theobromin of two coffee species, Arabica coffee from Ethiopia (growing area: Limu) as well as Robusta coffee from Vietnam were analysed by a reverse-phase HPLC/UV detector method. Furthermore, the Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) was determined photometrically using the ABTS-method. Both were freshly roasted in March 2009, packed in commercially available packages and were instantly brewed monthly throughout a period of storage (9 months). In addition, the sensory attributes from the two coffees (Arabica and Robusta) were analysed by Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) immediately after roasting in March 2009 and at th end of the storing in December 2009. The chemical analyses, which were carried out {{in the course of this}} diploma thesis, demonstrated a substantial change of the coffee ingredients over a period of 9 months. These alterations of the constituents had a remarkable influence on the sensory properties of the reviewed coffees. The developed product profiles of the freshly roasted sorts of coffee opposed to the 9 month duration of storage showed a clear increase respectively decrease in the intensity of positive as well as negative attributes, which are responsible for the sensory quality of coffee.

Measures Self-reports of methamphetamine, crack cocaine and powder cocaine use were assessed at 6 -month intervals over a 2 -year period. Generalized estimating equations were performed to account for correlations between the repeated measurements. Findings Compared to whites, African Americans {{were much more likely}} to use crack cocaine, equally likely to use powder cocaine and much less likely to use methamphetamine. Both whites and African Americans reduced their consumption of methamphetamine and both forms of cocaine over 2 years.

However, due to the loss in chitinase activities, the mutant (Î 9 ̆ 4 Thnag::hph) displays loss of saprotrophic competitiveness and reduced fitness as a biocontrol agent. We set out to investigate how we can use genetic manipulation to improve strain GD 12 in the context of biological control and plant growth promotion. We approached this by firstly sequencing the whole genome of GD 12 and then using the information available from this to produce a targeted deletion mutant in the GD 12 background disrupting one of the most down regulated proteins in the Î 9 ̆ 4 Thnag::hph, a branched chain amino acid transaminase (bcat), implicated in the production of secondary metabolites. Secondly, we aimed to engineer hyper-secretion and enhanced PGP activities in GD 12 without impairing biocontrol activity. Over-expression of the S. cerevisiae gene dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase (dpm 1) in T. reesei leads to altered cell wall architecture and increased secretory potential. Using the constitutive promoter ToxA, we over-expressed the dpm 1 gene in T. hamatum GD 12 and assessed its effects on the biocontrol and PGP activities of the fungus. The data presented herein, shows, that bcat deletion in T. hamatum GD 12 results in a detrimental effect of germination of lettuce seedlings grown in the presence of â 8 ̆ 88 ̆ 6 Thbcat::hph. We show that single copy insertions of ToxA-dpm 1 leads to improved PGP activities, while biocontrol fitness is unaffected. However, while multiple copy insertions similarly lead to enhanced PGP, such strains display impaired biocontrol of soil-borne pathogens such as the plurivorous damping-off pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This work demonstrates that while significant improvements in crop productivity can be achieved through genetic modification of the beneficial rhizosphere fungus T. hamatum GD 12, it can have important consequences for other aspects of its biology and ecology and competence as a soil-borne microorganism.
