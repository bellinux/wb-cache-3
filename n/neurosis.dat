25|$|In retrospect, Rivers' {{particular}} {{method of}} treating the war <b>neuroses</b> and {{his theory of}} the origin of neuroses—while pioneering in their day—have failed to leave a huge mark on the history of psychology.

25|$|Horney {{looked at}} <b>neurosis</b> in a {{different}} light from other psychoanalysts of the time. Her expansive interest in the subject led her to compile a detailed theory of <b>neurosis,</b> with data from her patients. Horney believed <b>neurosis</b> to be a continuous process—with neuroses commonly occurring sporadically in one's lifetime. This was in contrast to the opinions of her contemporaries who believed <b>neurosis</b> was, like more severe mental conditions, a negative malfunction of the mind in response to external stimuli, such as bereavement, divorce or negative experiences during childhood and adolescence.|$|E
25|$|When {{this process}} works, {{this type of}} <b>neurosis</b> may be {{considered}} a life-guiding gift from the unconscious, even though the personal journey forced upon the individual sometimes takes decades. This may seem absurd to someone looking at a <b>neurosis</b> from the attitude that it is always an illness that {{should not have to}} happen, expects the doctor to have a quick cure, and that fantasies are unreliable subjective experiences.|$|E

25|$|Janov {{states that}} <b>neurosis</b> {{is the result}} of {{suppressed}} pain, which {{is the result of}} trauma, usually trauma of childhood origin. According to Janov, the only way to reverse <b>neurosis</b> is for the neurotic to recall their trauma in a therapeutic setting. Janov contends that the neurotic can thereby re-experience their feelings in response to the original traumatic incidents but can now express the emotions that at that time were repressed, thereby resolving the trauma.|$|E
25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} <b>neurosis</b> {{is based on}} the premise of a {{self-regulating}} psyche composed of tensions between opposing attitudes of the ego and the unconscious. A <b>neurosis</b> is a significant unresolved tension between these contending attitudes. Each <b>neurosis</b> is unique, and different things work in different cases, so no therapeutic method can be arbitrarily applied. Nevertheless, there is a set of cases that Jung especially addressed. Although adjusted well enough to everyday life, the individual has lost a fulfilling sense of meaning and purpose, and has no living religious belief to which to turn. There seems to be no readily apparent way to set matters right. In these cases, Jung turned to ongoing symbolic communication from the unconscious in the form of dreams and visions.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{aspect of}} Jung's theory of <b>neurosis</b> is how symptoms can vary by psychological type. The hierarchy of discriminating psychological functions gives each individual a dominant sensation, intuition, feeling, or thinking function preference with either an extroverted or introverted attitude. The dominant is quite {{under the control}} of the ego. But the inferior function remains a gateway for unconscious contents. This creates typical manifestations of inferior insight and behavior when extreme function one-sidedness accompanies the <b>neurosis.</b>|$|E

25|$|For Jung, a <b>neurosis</b> is not {{completely}} negative, despite, and even because of, its debilitating aspects. Interpreted positively, it has fundamental purpose for some people.|$|E
25|$|He {{is thought}} to have coined the term, Sunday <b>neurosis.</b> The term refers to a form of anxiety {{resulting}} from an awareness in some people of the emptiness of their lives once the working week is over. Some complain of a void and a vague discontent. This arises from an existential vacuum, or feeling of meaninglessness, which is a common phenomenon and is characterised by the subjective state of boredom, apathy, and emptiness. One feels cynical, lacks direction, and questions the point of most of life's activities. (see noogenic <b>neurosis).</b>|$|E

25|$|On {{the basis}} of his early {{clinical}} work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional <b>neurosis),</b> a formulation now known as Freud's seduction theory. In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every <b>neurosis</b> {{can be traced back to}} the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.|$|E
25|$|Janov {{believes}} {{that there is only}} one source of mental illness (besides genetic defects): imprinted pain. He argues that this unitary source of <b>neurosis</b> implies that there can be only one effective cure: re-experiencing.|$|E
50|$|According to psychoanalytic theory, <b>neuroses</b> may {{be rooted}} in ego defense mechanisms, but the two {{concepts}} are not synonymous. Defense mechanisms are a normal way of developing and maintaining a consistent sense of self (i.e., an ego).
