40|$|The Belgian {{pharmaceutical}} sector has been accorded {{a leading role}} in the attainment of the R&D investment targets which the EU Member States set themselves as part of the Lisbon strategy. To gain a better insight into that sector 2 ̆ 019 s research activities, the NBB conducted an ad hoc survey in 2005, covering pharmaceutical companies active in Belgium in the field of research, production and distribution of drugs for human use. The analysis of the information obtained from that survey makes up the main body of this working paper. The survey results do not only confirm the importance of the research activities conducted by Belgian establishments, but also indicate the frequent cooperation with other research centres and the crucial importance of expertise as a factor influencing the location of such activities in Belgium. The breakdown of the survey results by kind of establishment on the basis of the type of activities conducted in Belgium reveals further clear differences of emphasis in the nature of the R&D activities pursued in Belgium and divergences in the scale of the resources used. The paper also comprises a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>annexes</b> giving additional information on the sector.

40|$|Deliverable 2. 1 – The Integrated Roadmap – summarises {{the first}} 18 months of {{requirements}} gathering and {{analysis in the}} TENCompetence project. The document consists of a summary description and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>annexes</b> with detailed results. The methodology chosen by the project is the Unified Process, supplemented with scenario-based software development techniques. On the basis of initial scenario’s and specific use cases, six high-level use cases were identified that summarise the future functionality of the TENCompetence integrated system. These high-level use cases build on the domain model that is also included. The four main components of the TENCompetence project, i. e. (a) the high-level use cases, (b) the domain model, (c) the project objectives and (d) the experimental setup of the pilots were then critically analysed {{in order to identify}} possible gaps between them. On the basis of this gap analysis, some recommendations were formulated for the next development cycles. On the basis of all the work in the four components and the gap analysis, detailed extended use cases with activity diagrams and a data model were developed and formulated, which again {{serve as the basis for}} the first version of the integrated system, the Personal Competence Manager.

40|$|The {{identification}} of sources {{is one of}} the prerequisites for the implementation of the Air Quality Directive (AQD). It provides scientific support to the development and periodic revision of air quality plans and short term action plans and to the quantification of categories with special status like long range transport, natural sources and winter road salting and sanding. The suitability of receptor models (RM) for the apportionment of pollutant sources in the implementa-tion of the AQD is testified by the amount of published studies in 2005 and 2010 in correspondence with the entry into force of new provisions for PM 10 and PM 2, 5, respectively. In recent years, Member States were requested to provide official estimations of source contribution to the Commission like the quantification of natural sources in 2006 and PM 10 time extension reports in 2009 (Fragkou et al., 2011). These experiences have shown that al-though this kind of methodology is used by about 60 % of the European experts involved in source apportion-ment there is a considerable variability in the methodo-logical approaches and adopted tools. Furthermore, there are critical steps that require strict quality assurance standards and skilled practitioners (e. g. {{identification of}} the appropriate number of sources). In order to foster harmonization in this field, the JRC has promoted a number of interconnected initiatives linked to FAIRMODE. One of those was to set up a group of experts with skills in different areas to assess RM methodologies and propose common criteria and procedures for source apportionment studies. The infor-mation collected was summarized in a document which is intended to serve as a basis for a common Receptor Model Technical Protocol (RMTP). The RMTP is addressed to different kinds of us-ers: Policy makers and managers interested in the output of RMs for development of mitigation measures, air quality experts and scientists unfamiliar with these tech-niques, and RM practitioners involved in the model ex-ecution and interpretation of results. In order to address such heterogeneous readership the document was designed to be accessible at different levels. The RMTP is organized in three sections : an introduction to present the methodology to the unskilled reader, illustrating its capabilities and recom-mending when and how to use it; a core section concerning the most common RM methodologies for source apportionment with in-depth analysis boxes for more experienced readers. The section is structured in 13 chapters following, as a check list, the logical steps to accomplish a source apportionment study. The first chapters deal with preliminary activities like the evaluation of the study area, collection of exist-ing information and experimental design. In the follow-ing chapters data collection and data treatment are dis-cussed. The section includes also chapters regarding spe-cific aspects of widely used methodologies like CMB, Factor Analysis, and PMF. The evaluation of test per-formance and reporting are discussed in the last part of this section; the third section of the document was conceived to give an insight on the capabilities and the possible future trends in RM methodology. It consists of four chapters dealing with advanced, innovative techniques for which ready- to-use tools are already available or under development : trajectory analysis combined with RM, constrained and expanded models, AMS data processing, and the aethalometer model.
