25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
500|$|The {{team made}} two minor {{changes to the}} design: they removed Davros' {{microphone}} and completely redesigned Davros' headpiece. The team felt that the microphone was redundant because Davros did not [...] "speak in a whisper and <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> make him more audible", and originally intended to leave Bleach's voice unaltered in post-production: the decision to treat the voice was not made until late May 2008; and Gorton thought the original headpiece [...] "always seemed particularly weak" [...] for [...] "such a powerful character". After he was informed that the production designer for Genesis of the Daleks wanted the headpiece to resemble a medical brace, Gorton redesigned it to appear to be [...] "screwed directly into [...] head".|$|E
500|$|... "Black & Blue" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. John Bergstrom of PopMatters described it as [...] "smooth, winning blue-eyed soul", and Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that its breathy vocals, piano chords and synth backing made it a [...] "successful blend of melancholy and dancefloor-ready rhythms". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian deemed the falsetto vocals and synths [...] "naggingly infectious", citing it as the band's strong point: [...] "the trio may be faceless, but they write a good tune". Sputnikmusic's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the [...] "techno swirl" [...] of the song [...] "nail the juxtaposition between Wyatt's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Black & Blue" [...] four stars out of five and recommended it for when [...] "you just <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> lift the spirits a bit, without someone shouting something stupid in your ear". He continued, [...] "It basically wants to rub your shoulders {{at the end of}} a long hard day, and whisper something funny in your ear while your shoulders untie." [...] Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy, it [...] "swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow". Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy McAloon's breathy vocal style on [...] "Black & Blue", but without the [...] "lyrical wit". He rated the song three stars out of five and called it [...] "decent", finding the remixes available on the release more interesting. A more critical review came from Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan, who wrote that it [...] "promisingly... splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole".|$|E

5000|$|In August 2014, the Guildhall had a logo {{change to}} a more minimalist modern style. It was changed due to the school {{thinking}} that it <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> reflect its types of teachings.|$|R

6000|$|... "After that," [...] she sighed, [...] "I {{am going}} to {{telephone}} to Captain Baring. He, at any rate, {{is in love with}} me, and I <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> restore my self-respect." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bonnie Arnold {{declared}} Mintz-Plasse's voice {{made them}} immediately think of Fishlegs, as the character's big frame <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> contrast, and the actor's [...] "squeaky, small voice" [...] was perfect to complement a [...] "dragon nerd".|$|R
5000|$|So, {{by the end}} of {{the month}} the 'Dukes' were in 6th place in the league, but had three or four matches in hand on most of the teams above them. It just <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> click! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah, dear Rose," [...] said Septimius, [...] "I {{have not}} the kind and sweet impulses that you speak of.

I need you, dear Rose, who are all kindness of heart and mercy." ...|$|E
60|$|However, {{everybody}} is all right, now, except Yortzburg, {{and he is}} mending--that is, he is being mended. I knocked off, during these stirring times, and don't intend {{to go to work}} again till we go away for the Summer, 3 or 6 weeks hence. So I am writing to you not because I have anything to say, but because you don't have to answer and I <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do this afternoon.....|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm only thirty-five, and I {{could give}} you all any {{sensible}} woman wants," [...] he said. [...] "Let's make a real American home. Have you thought at all about that, Carley? Something is wrong today. Men are not marrying. Wives are not having children. Of all the friends I have, not one has a real American home. Why, it is a terrible fact! But, Carley, {{you are not a}} sentimentalist, or a melancholiac. Nor are you a waster. You have fine qualities. You <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do, some one to care for." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Something must be {{done about}} that child, father, for she is getting entirely beyond my control. If I attempt to make her study she writes poetry instead of her exercises, draws caricatures instead of {{sketching}} properly, and bewilders her music teacher by asking questions about Beethoven and Mendelssohn, {{as if they were}} personal friends of his. If I beg her to take exercise, she rides like an Amazon all over the Island, grubs in the garden as if for her living, or goes paddling about the bay till I'm distracted lest the tide should carry her out to sea. She is so wanting in moderation she gets ill, and when I give her proper medicines she flings them out of the window, and threatens to send that worthy, Dr. Baum, after them. Yet she must <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> set her right, for she is either overflowing with unnatural spirits or melancholy enough to break one's heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|She really <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat {{and yet she}} {{was puzzled}} {{to know what to}} ask for. At last, in the belief that she was asking for the {{simplest}} possible thing, she smiled sweetly and said, [...] "I should like a glass of milk." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And it {{is exactly}} that point of wickedness I have arrived at," [...] the doctor said, again {{dropping}} into the brogue. [...] "In the first place, sha'n't we <b>need</b> <b>something,</b> <b>to</b> kape us from dying entirely of nothing to do at all, at all, in this wearisome old place? We are fresh to it, {{and we are not}} tired, yet, of the oranges and the wine and the cigars, and the quare people you see in the streets; but the regiments that have been here some time are just sick of their lives. Then, in the second place, how am I going to learn my profession, {{if we are going to}} stop here, quiet and peaceful, for years? Didn't I come into the army to study gunshot wounds and, barring duels, divil a wound have I seen since I joined. It's getting rusty I am, entirely; and there is the elegant case of instruments my aunt gave me, that have never been opened. By the same token, I will have them out and oil them, in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{perfectly}} right, lad. It {{will cut}} short your stay here but a week, {{and it would}} be madness to refuse the opportunity of getting to know him and his family better. The Countess died three years ago, I hear, and he has shown no disposition to take another wife, as he might well do, seeing he is but a year or two past forty, and has as pleasant a face and manner as I have ever seen. He is not the sort of man to promise what he will not perform, Cyril, and more than ever do I think that it was a fortunate thing for you that John Wilkes fetched you to that fire in the Savoy. And now, lad, you have no time to lose. You must come with me at once to Master Woods, the tailor, in Eastcheap, who makes clothes not only for the citizens but for many of the nobles and gallants of the Court. In the first place, you will need a fitting dress for the King's levée; then you will need at least one more suit similar to that you now wear, and three for on board ship and for ordinary occasions, made of stout cloth, but in the fashion; then you must have helmet, and breast- and back-pieces for the fighting, and for these we will go to Master Lawrence, the armourer, in Cheapside. All these we will order to-day in my name, and put them down in your account to me. As to arms, you have your sword, and there is but a brace of pistols to be bought. You will want a few things such as thick cloaks for sea service; for though I suppose that Volunteers do not keep their watch, you may meet with rains and heavy weather, and you will <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> keep you dry." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hank {{has spoken}} about human dreams of success. On the topic, Hank has stated, [...] "There are {{problems}} with the institutions of dreams, but I am in favor of them. We <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> push us to work 16-hour days sometimes. We <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> drive us to be better, and weirder, and different, but I think if we let that one thing drive us, it's a failure of imagination, and we miss opportunities." [...] Hank would add, [...] "In the end, it's not about finding success, it's about building the number of things you're capable of, because then you could do more interesting things, and we need people to do interesting things in the world." ...|$|E
