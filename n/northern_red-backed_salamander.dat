50|$|The red-backed (or redback) {{salamander}} (Plethodon cinereus) is a small, hardy woodland salamander. It inhabits wooded slopes {{in eastern}} North America, west to Missouri, south to North Carolina, and north from southern Quebec and the Maritime Provinces in Canada to Minnesota. It {{is also known}} as the eastern red-backed salamander or the <b>northern</b> <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> to distinguish it from the southern red-backed salamander (Plethodon serratus). It is one of 55 species in the genus Plethodon.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> (Plethodon serratus) is {{a species}} of salamander native to the United States. It is found in four widely disjunct populations: one in central Louisiana; one in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma; one in central Missouri; and one from southeastern Tennessee, to southwestern North Carolina, western Georgia, and eastern Alabama. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Georgia <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> or the Ouachita <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander.</b> It was once considered a subspecies of the <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander,</b> Plethodon cinereus.|$|R

We used displacement experiments and analyses of genetic population structure {{to examine the effects of}} first-order and second-order streams on the dispersal of terrestrial <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818). We marked <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> from near the edges of one first-order stream and one second-order stream, and experimentally displaced them either across the stream or an equal distance farther into the forest. A comparison of return rates indicated that both streams were partial barriers to salamander movement, reducing return rates by approximately 50 %. Analysis of six microsatellite loci from paired plots on the same side and on opposite sides of the second-order stream suggested that the stream did contribute to genetic differentiation of salamander populations. Collectively, our results imply that low-order streams do influence patterns of movement and gene flow in <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders.</b> We suggest that given the high density of first-order and second-order streams in most landscapes, these features may have important effects on species that, like <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> have limited dispersal and large geographic ranges...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> {{is a small}} (5.7 to 10.0 cm) {{terrestrial}} salamander {{which usually}} lives in forested areas under rocks, logs, bark, and other debris. [...] It {{is one of the}} most numerous salamanders throughout its range. The <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> exhibits color polymorphism and two color variations are common: the 'red-backed' or 'red-stripe' variety has a red dorsal stripe that tapers towards the tail, and the darker variety, known as the 'lead-backed' (or simply 'lead') phase, lacks most or all of the red pigmentation. The red-backed phase is not always red, but may actually be various other colors (e.g., yellow-backed, orange-backed, white-backed, or a rare erythristic morph in which the body is completely red). Both morphs have speckled black and white bellies. The skin of <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> was found to contain Lysobacter gummosus, an epibiotic bacterium which produces the chemical 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and inhibits the growth of certain pathogenic fungi.|$|R
50|$|For many species, {{interspecific}} {{competition is}} an important limiting factor of population size, biomass, species richness, and home range sizes.

40|$|Chemical cues {{released}} from injured prey {{are thought to}} indicate the proximity of a preda-tor or predation event, and therefore, an area of elevated predation risk. Prey often avoid chemical cues {{released from}} injured heterospecics, {{but there is little}} evidence to determine whether this is due to homologous cues among phylogeneticallyrelated species, or avoidance of injured syntopic species that experience predation from the same predators. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the response of terrestrial <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus) to chemical cues from non-injuredand injuredmembers of their prey guild that vary in their relatedness to P. cinereus. In the laboratory, P. cinereus avoided chemical cues from injured conspeci cs, injured and non-injured slimy salamanders (P. glutinosus), and injured confamilial dusky <b>salamanders</b> (Desmognathus ochrophaeus). <b>Red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> did not avoid rinses from non-injured conspeci cs and dusky salamanders, or cues from injured and non-injured earthworms (Lumbricus sp.), a more distantly related prey guild member. These results cannot be fully explained by either phylogenetic relatedness (among plethod-ontid salamanders) or prey guild membership alone. We suggest that a combination of these factors, and perhaps others, likely in uenced the evolution of heterospecic alarm cue avoid-ance in the <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander.</b> 2) Corresponding author’...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystems {{provide a}} vast array of {{services}} for human societies, but understanding how various organisms contribute to the functions that maintain these services remains an important ecological challenge. Predators can affect ecosystem functions through a combination of top-down trophic cascades and bottom-up effects on nutrient dynamics. As the most abundant vertebrate predator in many eastern US forests, woodland salamanders (Plethodon spp.) likely affect ecosystems functions. We examined the effects of <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus) on a variety of forest ecosystem functions using a combined approach of large-scale salamander removals (314 -m 2 plots) and small-scale enclosures (2 m 2) where we explicitly manipulated salamander density (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4 m 22). In these experiments, we measured the rates of litter and wood decomposition, potential nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, acorn germination, and foliar insect damage on red oak seedlings. Across both experimental venues, we found no significant effect of <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> on any of the ecosystem functions. We also found no effect of salamanders on intraguild predator abundance (carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders). Our study adds to the already conflicting evidence on effects of <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> and other amphibians on terrestrial ecosystem functions. It appears likely that the impact of terrestrial amphibians on ecosystem functions is context dependent. Future research would benefit from explicitly examining terrestrial amphibian effects on ecosystem functions under a variety of environmental conditions and in different forest types...|$|R

40|$|Managing for stand {{structural}} {{complexity in}} northern hardwood forests {{has been proposed}} as a method for promoting microhabitat characteristics important to eastern <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus). We evaluated the effects of alternate, structure-based silvicultural systems on <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> populations at two research sites in northwestern Vermont. Treatments included two uneven-aged approaches (single-tree selection and group-selection) and one unconventional approach, termed ‘‘structural complexity enhancement’’ (SCE), that promotes development of late-successional structure, including elevated levels of coarse woody debris (CWD). Treatments were applied to 2 ha units and were replicated two to four times depending on treatment. We surveyed <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> with a natural cover search method of transects nested within vegetation plots 1 year after logging. Abundance estimates corrected for detection probability were calculated from survey data with a binomial mixture model. Abundance estimates differed between study areas and were influenced by forest structural characteristics. Model selection was conducted using Akaike Information Criteria, corrected for over-dispersed data and small sample size (QAICc). We found no difference in abundance {{as a response to}} treatment as a whole, suggesting that all of the uneven-aged silvicultural systems evaluated can maintain salamander populations after harvest. However, abundance was tied to specific structural habitat attributes associated with study plots within treatments. The most parsimonious model of habitat covariates included site, relative density of overstory trees, and density of more-decayed and less-decayed downed CWD. Abundance responded positively to the density of downed, well-decayed CWD and negatively to the density of poorly decayed CWD and to overstory relative density.
