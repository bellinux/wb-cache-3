He became president of the body and was influential in shaping the <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution, which outlawed slavery but excluded African-Americans from settling in the <b>new</b> <b>state.</b> Deady successfully advocated for provisions in the document to set six-year terms for judges, four-year terms for state officers, and biennial sessions for the legislature. He also led the southern party, which opposed state education in all forms. During the debates Deady also advocated for discrimination towards Chinese immigrants and Blacks, as well as in favor for slavery in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|The <b>new</b> <b>state</b> {{legislature}} {{had also}} appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city to be the <b>new</b> <b>state</b> capital.

Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed {{more than anything else}} to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E

To prevent the route from changing numbers as it crossed I-5, the southern portion was renumbered SR 133 in 1996, with the remainder becoming an extended SR 241. The Eastern Transportation Corridor, which includes SR 133 north of I-5, was completed on October 15, 1998, opening a new shortcut from Orange County to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Adams' popularity, however, was declining, and {{he decided}} not to run for reelection in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, and in that year's election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 {{out of a total of}} 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury {{accompanied}} by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony.

5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. At issue was the <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution, which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
5|$|After these changes, the {{legislature}} of the <b>new</b> <b>state</b> began to organize counties. Three 320-acre sites in Kiowa, Caddo and Comanche counties {{were selected for}} county seats, with Lawton designated as the Comanche County seat. The town was named for Major General Henry W. Lawton, a quartermaster at Fort Sill, who had taken part in the pursuit and capture of Geronimo. The city was opened to settlement through an auction of town lots beginning on August 6, 1901, which was completed 60 days later. By September 25, 1901, the Rock Island Railroad expanded to Lawton and was soon joined by the Frisco Line. The first city elections were held October 24, 1901.|$|E
