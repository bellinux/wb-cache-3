When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved.|$|E

500|$|Competitive players <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> tablebases {{ignore the}} fifty-move rule. According to that rule, if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move, either player may claim a draw. [...] FIDE {{changed the rules}} several times, {{starting}} in 1974, to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win. In 1988, FIDE allowed seventy-five moves for KBBKN, KNNKP, KQKBB, KQKNN, KRBKR, and KQPKQ with the pawn on the seventh rank, because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win. In 1992, FIDE canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty-move rule to its original standing. Thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost, when {{it is in fact}} drawn by the fifty-move rule. In 2013, ICCF changed the rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014; a player may claim a win or draw based on six-man tablebases. In this case the fifty-move rule is not applied, and the number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration.|$|E

60|$|Now, ghost-worship {{and dead}} ancestor-worship are {{impossible}} before the ancestor {{is dead and}} is a ghost. But the essential idea of Mungan-ngaur, and Baiame, {{and most of the}} high gods of Australia, and of other low races, is that they never died at all. They belong to the period before death came into the world, like Qat among the Melanesians. They arise in an age that knew not death, and had not reflected on phantasms nor evolved ghosts. They could have been conceived of, {{in the nature of the}} case, by a race of immortals who never dreamed of such a thing as a ghost. For these gods, the ghost-theory is not required, and is superfluous, even contradictory. The early thinkers who developed these beings did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> men die (though, of course, they did know it in practice), still less did they need to have conceived by abstract speculation the hypothesis of ghosts.

The method is based on an initial projective reconstruction, which is upgraded to a Euclidean one. The number of images needed increases with the complexity of the constraints, but the number of points needed is only the number <b>needed</b> in order <b>to</b> obtain a projective reconstruction. The theoretical results are exemplified in a number of experiments.
