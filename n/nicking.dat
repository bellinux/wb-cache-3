25|$|English {{hopes of}} a win were high, and 20,000 people were locked out of the stadium in {{addition}} to the 23,000 capacity crowd. Australia started the day needing 399 more runs from 98 overs if they were to claim an unlikely victory. The day started poorly for them with Langer falling for 14 on the seventh ball of the day, <b>nicking</b> a ball delivered by Matthew Hoggard behind to Geraint Jones. Ponting narrowly survived being run out early on and this proved crucial {{in the context of the}} match as the momentum gradually swung in Australia's direction. At one point Australia racked up runs at such a rate that a win became a real possibility. Despite losing Clarke and Jason Gillespie in quick succession to send the team to 264 for 7, Ponting battled on before eventually succumbing to Harmison after seven hours on the crease to record the first Australian century of the series with a score of 156. This was good enough to earn Man of the Match honours.|$|E
500|$|After {{the stages}} of resection, strand {{invasion}} and DNA synthesis, the DSBR and SDSA pathways become distinct. [...] The DSBR pathway is unique in that the second 3' overhang (which {{was not involved in}} strand invasion) also forms a Holliday junction with the homologous chromosome. [...] The double Holliday junctions are then converted into recombination products by <b>nicking</b> endonucleases, a type of restriction endonuclease which cuts only one DNA strand. The DSBR pathway commonly results in crossover, though it can sometimes result in non-crossover products; the ability of a broken DNA molecule to collect sequences from separated donor loci was shown in mitotic budding yeast using plasmids or endonuclease induction of chromosomal events. Because of this tendency for chromosomal crossover, the DSBR pathway is a likely model of how crossover homologous recombination occurs during meiosis.|$|E

They rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process.

500|$|Six out {{of eight}} areas in Knowle West are ranked as being {{economically}} deprived. The {{closure of the}} Imperial Tobacco factory at nearby Hartcliffe in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A House of Commons report noted that this had a seriously {{negative effect on the}} area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for [...] "manual and semi-skilled employment". The Independent in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems. In 2006, BBC News said [...] "Knowle West has {{more than its share of}} social problems. [...] The highest number of kids in care of any council ward in Bristol. [...] The lowest number of young people with any qualifications (under half). [...] A major petty crime problem, drug addiction, and add to that people are fed up with bad housing." [...] Shawnie, a 2006 novel by social worker Ed Trewavas, written from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl living in Knowle West, documents some of the deprivation he encountered in his work. One of the novel's characters [...] "describes Knowle West ... as a 'shit hole' populated by 'yokels, cider-heads, junkies, dole-scammers, slappers and failed wide boys, all interbreeding and <b>nicking</b> their cruddy possessions off of each other in some giant, dismal rota.'" ...|$|E

[...] At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards, Breeds was nominated for [...] "Best Daytime Star". Holy Soap recall Ruby's most memorable moment as being: [...] "Trying to cope with her Dad's illness, Ruby started talking to someone on Skype, {{only to find out}} it was Matthew playing a trick. She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and <b>nicking</b> his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a clue that a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so embarrassed for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E

2500|$|The book {{received}} {{praise from}} many critics, garnering near-unanimous acclaim.

[...] Kevin Cowherd {{said that in the}} book, Rakoff [...] "makes a strong bid for the title of Most Neurotic Man on the Planet, and the results are absolutely hilarious – when they're not achingly revealing and tinged with sadness." [...] Max Magee called the collection a [...] "meta-article in which he talks about the particulars and relative merits of his assignment as he embarks on that assignment" [...] and that [...] "the reader feels invited in for a behind the scenes look at {{what it is like to}} be a disaffected, overly-qualified, under-ambitious journalist as he takes on his fluffy assignments."

2500|$|Paradise Lost was {{the first}} to form in 1988 in Halifax, England. Their debut album Lost Paradise was {{released}} in 1990 and [...] "helped define the rules of doom/death metal: grinding, de-tuned anthems of woe topped with death metal-style guttural vocals" [...] while demonstrating that the band was [...] "already reaching for realms unknown to their then-amateurish abilities and latent promise". The band was [...] "evolving at a fast clip" [...] and in the following year, their second [...] "aptly titled album" [...] Gothic came as [...] "something of a departure for the band's earliest fans". With a [...] "less deliberate, more energetic arrangements", the album featured a [...] "slightly cleaner approach to guitar crunch" [...] and [...] "cautious use of keyboards and even female vocals, which together added atmospheric nuances to the group's ultra-depressive power chords". Gothic was a chart success across Europe, particularly in Germany, and has since been acclaimed as [...] "one of the most influential albums" [...] in heavy metal music for creating the gothic metal genre. Their 1992 album Shades of God continued the transition while the follow-up 1993 album Icon represented [...] "a turning point" [...] for the band with the experimental use of synthesized strings, timpani, piano and angelic female vocals. By the time of 1995's Draconian Times album, Paradise Lost's music firmly stood [...] "between stark, oppressive goth rock and crunching heavy metal". With these five albums, the band had created [...] "a bold collection of songs that sounded like Black-era Metallica played by a group who loved the Sisters Of Mercy". They have since been recognized as the band that [...] "originally laid the gothic seed that other bands have been <b>nicking</b> and reaping in recent years".|$|E
