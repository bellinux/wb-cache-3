5|$|Clare {{maintained}} {{roughly the}} same intensity as its track became more southerly. At 1600 UTC on 9 January the storm made landfall at Pilbara {{to the west of}} Dampier. Heading ashore, the storm began to quickly deteriorate, and both the JTWC and the BoM declared it dissipated on 10 January as it continued southward. Throughout the storm's course, the JTWC's intensity estimates were below that of the BoM. Also, it is reported that the cyclone's presentation on satellite was <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> its actual intensity.|$|E
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The {{definition}} is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{both the}} highest and lowest judges' scores are omitted to cancel out any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario is only an example and <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5. While a lower score for style puts an athlete at the risk of being less competitive, this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance.|$|E

5|$|The 1952 Kern County {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} July 21 {{in the southern}} San Joaquin Valley and measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. The main shock occurred at 4:52 am Pacific Daylight Time (11:52 UTC), killed 12 people and injured hundreds, and caused an estimated $60 million in property damage. A small sector of damage near Bealville corresponded to a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme), though this intensity rating was <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the majority of damage. The earthquake occurred on the White Wolf Fault near the community of Wheeler Ridge and was the strongest to occur in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The first British Isles side (now {{known as}} the British and Irish Lions) toured New Zealand and Australia in 1888. The side was privately organised, without the {{sanction}} or prohibition of England's Rugby Football Union, and toured New Zealand in April and May that year where they played against a number of provincial sides. Although the team was <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the best British and Irish players, it did include three internationals with the rest predominantly county representatives. Warbrick was in the Wellington team that faced the tourists on 13 May. The match was ill-tempered, with each side accusing the other of rough play, and eventually finished as a 3–3 draw.|$|E
5|$|This {{study has}} been criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E

5|$|On May28, the NHC {{once again}} {{initiated}} outlooks {{on the system}} as convection quickly redeveloped. Around 1500UTC, they designated the system as Tropical Depression One while it was located about 310mi (500km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. Upon being classified, the depression exhibited deep convective activity, with the center of circulation situated on the northwestern edge. The redevelopment of the system {{was the result of}} low wind shear and warm waters, up to , from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, convection began to diminish as the depression tracked into an area of progressively higher shear and cooler waters. By this time, the system was embedded within the westerlies between a subtropical ridge to the southeast and a trough to the northwest. Around 2330UTC, a QuickSCAT satellite pass over the depression found tropical storm-force winds; however, the winds were determined to have been affected by rain and therefore <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the depression's actual intensity. Following the satellite pass, the center of circulation became partially exposed to the northwest and the area of convection associated with the depression diminished in area.|$|E
5|$|On September19 and 20, Georges {{underwent}} {{a period of}} rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45mph (85km/h) in a 24-hour span. At {{the end of this}} phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.68inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time of peak intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level winds up to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175mph (280km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time of peak intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35mi (55km) in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{transmitted}} in early 1999, when Parliament were discussing LGBT equality; the series première aired {{on the day}} the House of Lords was discussing the Sexual Offences Bill 1999, which eventually reduced the age of consent for homosexual couples to 16. The première was controversial, in particular because it depicted the character Nathan, aged 15, in sexual intercourse with an older man; the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom received 136 complaints and the series received criticism from Hunnam's parents and from activist Mary Whitehouse. The controversy was amplified when the sponsor Beck's withdrew after several episodes and homosexual activists complained that the series was <b>not</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> gay culture. Nevertheless, the show garnered 3.5million viewers per episode and a generally positive reaction from fans, and was renewed for a two-episode special due for the following year.|$|E
