Strategies such as the e-learning, has been used for training human resources. This study aimed to compare the knowledge acquired among groups of nurses who used e-learning and those who undergone a traditional classroom training. The true-experimental design was used followed by a quantitative analysis. This study was performed at the Hospital and Maternity São Luiz. The study population was composed by 60 nurses, randomly assigned to two groups, named A and B. Group A received the traditional classroom training and group B received the computer-assisted training. In the data collection, participants filled in a questionnaire before and after the training to evaluate their knowledge and to characterize the population. Results showed there was an equal acquisition of knowledge in both groups; confirming the efficacy of both methods.

50|$|Medical {{informatics}} {{has expanded}} rapidly {{over the past}} couple of years. After decades of development of information systems designed primarily for physicians and other healthcare managers and professionals, there is an increasing interest in reaching consumers and patients directly through computers and telecommunications systems. Consumer health informatics is the branch of medical informatics that analyses consumers' needs for information; studies and implements methods of making information accessible to consumers; and models and integrates consumers' preferences into medical information systems. Consumer informatics stands at the crossroads of other disciplines, such as <b>nursing</b> <b>informatics,</b> public health, health promotion, health education, library science, and communication science, and is perhaps the most challenging and rapidly expanding field in medical informatics; it is paving the way for health care in the information age.|$|E

What remains unclear, however, is how this emerging discipline should relate to the myriad of previously existing sub specializations within the broad umbrella of health informatics - including clinical informatics (which itself includes sub areas such as oncology informatics), bioinformatics and healthcare management informatics - particularly in light of the proposed [...] "fundamental theorem" [...] of biomedical informatics posed by Friedman in early 2009.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Across Queensland {{midwives}} collect birth related data via the perinatal {{data collection}} form {{in either a}} paper or online format. This data is then transferred to the perinatal data collection unit of Queensland Health who purport that “the quality of information produced from the perinatal data collection depends on the accurate, consistent and timely completion of the forms (QHealth Perinatal Data Unit, 2010 : 201). The version submitted often differs from the medical record {{which means that the}} many and varied services that the perinatal data collection provides information for, funding, resource planning, research, education, are compromised. This research will develop a substantive grounded theory after an in-depth analysis of the processes used by midwives to record birth related data. The objectives of the research are to examine issues that contribute to midwives data entry. This research will contribute to knowledge by understanding the factors that influence the practice of midwives in the process of birth related data entry. Specifically, an examination of processes used by midwives to enter data onto paper charts and into the online perinatal data form will be undertaken. Research outcomes will assist nursing management, <b>nurses</b> in <b>informatics</b> and information managers to understand current practice. This knowledge can then be used to provide education and contribute to improved design in information systems that are used to collect data in obstetrics. With the impending move to increase eHealth technologies used in health care, it is necessary to understand the processes midwives use to enter data using eHealth so the move away from manual paper data entry can be done while maintaining data integrity...|$|R
