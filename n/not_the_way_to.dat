500|$|Brown opposes a {{proposed}} multibillion-dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation. Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, {{said that he}} is [...] "opposed to higher taxes, especially {{in the midst of a}} severe recession". He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and ATM fees. In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, stating: [...] "Banks making lending decisions with government funds is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get our economy moving again." ...|$|E

500|$|These critiques {{were not}} taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed {{so far off}} the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense {{knowledge}} seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle [...] "they misunderstand, and should be ignored." [...] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers [...] "dared not be seen having lunch with me." [...] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish.

2500|$|Jones {{moved to}} London and {{enrolled}} at William Shipley's drawing school in November 1761. Despite attending the life class at St Martin's Lane Academy, he remained unconfident {{of his ability}} to draw figures convincingly, and in 1763 he persuaded the leading landscape painter of the day (and fellow Welshman) Richard Wilson to take him on as a pupil. A high-spirited youth, Jones recorded in his journal that he and two rowdy fellow pupils were once rebuked by their master with the words, [...] "Gentlemen, this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> rival Claude".|$|E
2500|$|Heller opposed President Donald Trump's 2017 {{executive}} order {{to impose a}} temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying: [...] "I agree that better vetting and border protection measures are necessary to our current immigration system. That’s why I support the thorough vetting of individuals entering our country. However, I am deeply troubled {{by the appearance of}} a religious ban. The use of an overly broad {{executive order}} is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> strengthen national security.

But remember that others, who trusted in us, are not. This is a day for relief, perhaps; but for sorrow also; for shame, not for revelling.

2500|$|Schumer, {{speaking}} at an Orthodox Union event in Washington D.C, in June 2010, made comments regarding Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip that were later criticized. He called on Israel to [...] "strangle them economically until they see that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go". He {{explained that the}} current Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is justified {{not only because it}} keeps weapons out of the Palestinian territory, but also because it shows the Palestinians living there that [...] "when there's some moderation and cooperation, they can have an economic advancement." [...] He also said, [...] "The Palestinian people still don't believe in a Jewish state, in a two state solution... They don't believe in the Torah. They don't believe in King David. So, they don't think it's our land..." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Zohar, Rabbi Abba {{was once}} going toward Lod {{when he met}} Rabbi Zeira, the son of Rav. [...] Quoting [...] "And he {{believed}} in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness," [...] Rabbi Zeira asked whether it means that God counted it to Abraham, or that Abraham counted it to God. [...] Rabbi Zeira {{reported that he had}} heard that it means that God counted it to Abraham, but that interpretation did not satisfy him. [...] Rabbi Abba replied that it is indeed not so. [...] Noting that [...] says, [...] "and he reckoned her" [...] ( [...] , vayahsh'veha)" [...] and not [...] "and he reckoned to him ( [...] , vayahshov lo)," [...] Rabbi Abba taught that this means that Abraham counted it to God. [...] For [...] says, [...] "And he brought him forth abroad," [...] meaning that God told Abraham, in effect, to give up his astrological speculations; that was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> acquire knowledge of God’s Name. [...] Abram, it was true, would not beget children, but Abraham would beget children. [...] says, [...] "So ( [...] , Koh) shall your seed be." [...] The word , Koh, expresses the tenth sacred Crown of the King by which God’s Name may be known; it is the Crown through which judgments are set in motion. [...] Upon hearing God’s promise in [...] Abraham became filled with joy, and [...] "Abraham reckoned Her" [...] — that is, the Crown — [...] "for righteousness"; that is, he reckoned Her as if She were Compassion, because She had told him that he would father Isaac.|$|E
