From there, the game uses a <b>numbered</b> <b>paragraph</b> system to direct the player from event to event based on the player's decisions at various encounters.|$|E
50|$|Some {{slightly}} unusual {{practices have}} arisen {{in relation to}} the drafting of trust instruments which, again, are rigidly adhered to by professionals in many common-law countries (although not the U.S.A.). For example, trust deeds will generally avoid all punctuation (including full stops) - to avoid confusion, all new sentences commence with a new, <b>numbered,</b> <b>paragraph.</b> Dates, including years, are conventionally spelled out in words rather than using figures.|$|E

However, there is only a 7 % drop in the <b>number</b> of <b>paragraphs</b> from scenario 2 to scenario 3, although the drop would have been more significant if it was measured in terms of the number of words, as in scenario 3, we are discarding all paragraphs having 200 words or more.|$|R
50|$|Coetzee {{has stated}} that the 'brief sequences' that narrate the novel are {{fundamentally}} influenced by filmic and photographic modes of representation.

5000|$|To {{defend against}} pirated {{copies of the}} game, Dragon Wars a {{collection}} of <b>numbered</b> <b>paragraphs</b> within their manual. Players would receive an in-game message (i.e. [...] "Read paragraph 23"), and have to refer back to the printed material. The game {{is very difficult to}} play without references to the paragraphs, and many parts become meaningless. This archaic form of security was widely used at the time.|$|R

Gamebooks are an early example of hypertext fiction.|$|R

50|$|The {{text of the}} Kitáb-i-Aqdas {{consists}} of several hundred verses, which have been grouped in 189 <b>numbered</b> <b>paragraphs</b> in the English translation {{most of which are}} just a few sentences. The style combines elements of both poetry (shi'r) and rhymed prose (saj) and the text contains instances of literary devices like alliteration, assonance, repetition, onomatopoeia, juxtaposition and antithesis, metaphors, alternation of person and personification. Many of these can be only imperfectly reproduced in English.|$|R
