Altogether, 1, 033 randomly selected Finnish men, aged from 47 to 75 years filled in a FFQ and their EMFA composition was analyzed. Marine polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake correlated positively with erythro-cyte eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (rs = 0. 415 and rs = 0. 340, respectively, P 0. 001) and inversely with all n- 6 PUFA analyzed (P 0. 001).

We therefore analyzed lipid molecules in lipoaspirates and serum obtained from LE patients, and compared them to lipoaspirates from cosmetic surgery patients and healthy control cohort serum. LE patient serum analysis demonstrated that triglycerides, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol and lipid transport molecules remained within the normal range, with no alterations in individual fatty acids. The lipidomic analysis also identified 275 lipid-based molecules, including triacylglycerides, diacylglycerides, fatty acids and phospholipids in AT oil and fat. Although the majority of lipid molecules were present in a similar abundance in LE and non-LE samples, there were several small changes: increased C 20 : 5 -containing triacylglycerides, reduced C 10 : 0 caprinic and C 24 : 1 <b>nervonic</b> <b>acids.</b> LE AT oil also contained a signature of increased cyclopropane-type fatty acids and inflammatory mediators arachidonic acid and ceramides.

Our study included adolescents between 12 and 16 years of age, divided in two groups: Control Group (n = 31) and MS Group (n = 44). Waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol were determined. Erythrocytes’ fatty acids methyl esthers were quantified using gas chromatography with ionized flame detector. We identified 16 fatty acids (FA) with chain lengths from C 12 to C 24, with emphasis in four trans FA (TFA) isomers: vaccenic (C 18 : 1 n 7 t), elaidic (C 18 : 1 n 9 t), linoelaidic (C 18 : 2 n 6 t), and conjugated linoelaidic acids (C 18 : 2 n 7 t). MS Group had a less proportion of: myristic (C 14), palmitoleic (C 16 : 1), C 18 : 1 n 7 t, and linoleic acids (C 18 : 2); and a higher one of C 18 : 1 n 9 t, C 18 : 2 n 7 t, and <b>nervonic</b> <b>acids</b> (C 24 : 1) when compared to the control group. C 24 : 1 and C 18 : 1 n 9 t had a significant positive association with MS (OR = 14. 17 and OR = 12. 94, respectively); whereas C 14 (OR = 0. 14), C 18 : 1 n 7 t (OR = 0. 14), and C 18 : 2 (OR = 0. 22) appear to have a protective effect against the disease. The proportion of specific FAs in erythrocytes’ membranes differs between adolescents with MS and healthy controls; these FA not only showed a strong association with MS, but also correlated with most of its individual components. Interestingly, TFA displayed an antagonic behavior; while C 18 : 1 n 9 t had a strong association with MS, apparently C 18 : 1 n 7 t confers a protective effect; these results suggest that analyzing each TFA separately will constitute a more accurate approach to determine the role of TFAs in the pathogenesis of MS or other related metabolic disorders. </p...|$|R

First, the associations between dietary patterns defined by Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean dietary patterns (MED) and the risk of having a high level of CRP were examined. This study showed that a healthy dietary pattern score was associated with CRP levels; a higher score reflecting the ideal DASH diet and MED diet was associated with a 26 % and 27 % reduction in the risk of having high CRP levels respectively. This association appeared stronger among overweight and obese individuals. Second, the association between erythrocyte membrane fatty acids (EMFAs) and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was examined. Those that had high EMFAs composition of palmitoleic <b>acid</b> and <b>nervonic</b> <b>acids,</b> both monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and dihomo-y-linolenic acid (DGLA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA- 6), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), had an increased risk of having CRP elevation. In contrast, risk of CRP elevation was reduced in those that have highest levels of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) of margaric acid, stearic acid, and arachidic acid. These associations were generally observed to be stronger among women compared to men. Lastly, the study examined whether AD-related genes identified in previous genome-wide association studies are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory CRP. Results revealed a strong association between APOE-epsilon genotypes and CRP levels. Results also showed an association between major alleles of APOE rs 439401, TOMM 40 rs 157580, and minor alleles MMP 8 rs 1892886, CR 1 rs 6656401, CR 1 rs 3818361, and CR 1 rs 4844609 that were associated with a risk of elevation of CRP. These associations were stronger among men compared to women. Reduction in the prevalence of AD could have tremendous importance; the results of this dissertation may help identify factors important to AD etiology and, in turn, provide valuable targets for prevention...|$|R

40|$|Very long chain {{fatty acids}} (VLCFAs) with chain lengths of 20 carbons and longer provide {{feedstocks}} for various applications; therefore, improvement of VLCFA contents in seeds {{has become an}} important goal for oilseed enhancement. VLCFA biosynthesis is controlled by a multi-enzyme protein complex referred to as fatty acid elongase, which is composed of β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KCR), β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (HCD) and enoyl reductase (ECR).

40|$|Abstract. Microsporidia {{constitute}} {{a large group}} of obligate intracellular protozoan parasites that inject themselves into host cells via the extrusion apparatus of the infective spore stage. Although the injection process is poorly understood, its energy source is thought to reside in the posterior vacuole that swells significantly during spore firing. Here we report the presence and localisation of the key peroxisomal enzymes catalase and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) within the posterior vacuole of Spraguea lophii (Doflein, 1898) spores. Western blot analyses show that these enzymes discharge out of the spore and end up in the me-dium external to the extruded sporoplasms. The presence of a catalase enzyme system in the Microsporidia was first made evi-dent by the detection of significant levels of molecular oxygen in the medium containing discharging spores in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Catalase was visualised in inactive, activated, and discharged spores using alkaline diaminobenzidine (DAB) on glutaraldehyde-fixed cells. The position of these enzymes within the extrusion apparatus before and during spore discharge support the Lom and Vávra model that postulates discharge occurs by an eversion process. In addition to these enzymes, spores of S. lophii contain another characteristic peroxisomal component, the very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid.</b> A size-able decrease in <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid</b> levels occurs during and after spore discharge. These data indicate that <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid</b> is discharged from the spore into the external medium during firing along with the catalase and ACOX enzymes.

40|$|White matter (WM) {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} implicated in schizophrenia, yet the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are not fully understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) {{play a role in}} myelination, and there is substantial evidence documenting decreased PUFA concentrations in schizophrenia. We therefore hypothesized that lower membrane PUFA concentrations may be related to reduced WM integrity in schizophrenia and related disorders. In 30 male patients with a recent-onset psychotic disorder, erythrocyte membrane PUFA concentrations were assessed and diffusion tensor imaging was performed with voxelwise analysis. Lower total PUFA concentration was associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) throughout the corpus callosum and bilateral parietal, occipital, temporal and frontal WM (P <. 05, corrected). Of the individual PUFAs, lower arachidonic acid concentration, and to a lesser extent, lower <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid,</b> linoleic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid concentration were significantly associated with lower FA. PUFA concentrations were inversely associated with radial diffusivity but showed little association with axial diffusivity. Greater severity of negative symptoms was associated with lower <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and lower FA values.

At the time of this study no formula milks analysed contained long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Results In this study, we performed sequence analysis of the 18 S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of an algal strain designated HSO- 3 - 1, and found that it was closely related to the Mychonastes afer strain CCAP 260 / 6. Morphology and cellular structure observation also supported the identification of strain HSO- 3 - 1 as M. afer. We also investigated the effects of nitrogen on the growth and lipid accumulation of the naturally occurring M. afer HSO- 3 - 1, and its potential for biodiesel production. In total, 17 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified in M. afer HSO- 3 - 1, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between baseline erythrocyte membrane FA levels, measured by gas chromatography, and scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) after controlling for age, sex, smoking and cannabis use. Subjects were divided into three groups according to the predominance of positive or negative symptoms based on PANSS subscale scores; membrane FA levels in the three groups were then compared. More severe negative symptoms measured by PANSS were negatively correlated with two saturated FAs (myristic and margaric acids), one ω- 9 monounsaturated FA (MUFA; <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid),</b> and one ω- 3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; docosapentaenoic acid), and were positively correlated with two ω- 9 MUFAs (eicosenoic and erucic acids) and two ω- 6 PUFAs (γ-linolenic and docosadienoic acids). More severe positive symptoms measured by PANSS were correlated only with <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid.</b> No associations were observed between FAs and MADRS scores. In subjects with predominant negative symptoms, the sum of the ω- 9 MUFAs and the ω- 6 :ω- 3 FA ratio were both significantly higher than in those with predominant positive symptoms, whereas the sum of ω- 3 PUFAs was significantly lower.

40|$|Disruption of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox 1) gene in {{the mouse}} {{results in the}} {{development}} of severe microvesicular hepatic steatosis and sustained activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha). These mice manifest spontaneous massive peroxisome proliferation in regenerating hepatocytes and eventually develop hepatocellular carcinomas. Human ACOX 1, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway, has two isoforms including ACOX 1 a and ACOX 1 b, transcribed from a single gene. As ACOX 1 a shows reduced activity toward palmitoyl-CoA as compared with ACOX 1 b, we used adenovirally driven ACOX 1 a and ACOX 1 b to investigate their efficacy in the reversal of hepatic phenotype in Acox 1 (-/-) mice. In this study, we show that human ACOX 1 b is markedly effective in reversing the ACOX 1 null phenotype in the mouse. In addition, expression of human ACOX 1 b was found to restore the production of nervonic (24 : 1) acid and had a negative impact on the recruitment of coactivators to the PPARalpha-response unit, which suggests that <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid</b> might well be an endogenous PPARalpha antagonist, with nervonoyl-CoA probably being the active form of <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid.</b> In contrast, restoration of docosahexaenoic (22 : 6) acid level, a retinoid-X-receptor (RXRalpha) agonist, was dependent on the concomitant hepatic expression of both ACOX 1 a and ACOX 1 b isoforms. This is accompanied by a specific recruitment of RXRalpha and coactivators to the PPARalpha-response unit. The human ACOX 1 b isoform is more effective than the ACOX 1 a isoform in reversing the Acox 1 null phenotype in the mouse. Substrate utilization differences between the two ACOX 1 isoforms may explain the reason why ACOX 1 b is more effective in metabolizing PPARalpha ligand...|$|E

CONCLUSION: The presence of octadecenoic and hexadecanoic acids as major components, with the presence of a high-value component, <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid,</b> renders M. afer HSO- 3 - 1 biomass an economic feedstock for biodiesel production. Background: Biodiesel {{is considered}} to be a promising future substitute for fossil fuels, and microalgae are one source of biodiesel. The ratios of lipid, carbohydrates and proteins are different in different microalgal species, and finding a good strain for oil production remains a difficult prospect. Strains producing valuable co-products would improve the viability of biofuel production...|$|E
40|$|Myelination is {{important}} perinatally and {{highly dependent on}} long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, nowadays often supplemented, inhibit oleic acid synthesis. Using data from a premature cohort, we studied if nervonic, lignoceric and oleic acids correlated to growth and early development up to 18 months corrected age. Small for gestational age infants had lower concentrations than infants appropriate for gestational age. Only oleic acid was negatively correlated to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oleic and lignoceric acids correlated to social interaction at one month, and <b>nervonic</b> <b>acid</b> to mental, psychomotor and behavioral development at 6, 10 and 18 months, also when adjusted for several confounders. Negative association between oleic acid and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids suggests inhibition of delta- 9 desaturase, and nervonic acid´s divergent correlation to lignoceric and oleic acids suggests different metabolism in neonatal period. Our results may have implications for the supplementation of premature infants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: FAME and RAPD {{profiles}} {{were used}} to examine biochemical and genetic relationships between 10 selected sea buckthorn genotypes found {{in the same area}} of Eastern Anatolia. Fatty acid composition of sea buckthorn berries was determined using gas chromatography. Fatty acid results showed that there were differences between genotypes in both the percent and presence of fatty acids in the berries. Myristic acid was detected only in berries of the ESB 8 and ESB 9 genotypes. <b>Nervonic</b> <b>acid</b> was detected only in the ESB 5 genotype and linoleic acid was detected only in the ESB 4 genotype. RAPD data also showed that the ESB 4 genotype was in a group distinct from the others. According to these results, it can be concluded that both the absence of linoleic acid and the use of RAPD data could be useful indicators for the characterization and grouping of sea buckthorn genotypes...|$|E
