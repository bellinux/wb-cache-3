40|$|Abstract Background Many {{trials of}} <b>nebulized</b> therapy have used <b>nebulized</b> saline as a "placebo". However, <b>nebulized</b> {{isotonic}} saline is sometimes used to assist sputum expectoration and relieve breathlessness in COPD patients. We designed {{this study to}} establish if <b>nebulized</b> saline had a placebo effect or a clinical effect. Methods 40 patients were studied following hospital admission for exacerbated COPD (mean FEV 1 30 % predicted). Patients were randomised to single-blind administration of either 4 mls of <b>nebulized</b> isotonic saline using an efficient nebulizer (active group n = 20) or an inefficient nebulizer (placebo group n = 20). Spirometry and subjective breathlessness scores (Modified Likert Scale) were measured before <b>nebulized</b> treatment and 10 minutes after treatment. Results There was no significant change in FEV 1 after active or placebo <b>nebulized</b> saline treatment. Patients reported a 4 % improvement in mean breathlessness score following placebo (Wilcoxon test; p = 0. 37) compared with 23 % improvement following active <b>nebulized</b> saline (p = 0. 0001). 65 % of patients given active <b>nebulized</b> saline but only 5 % of the placebo group reported that mucus expectoration was easier after the treatment. Conclusions This study lends support to the current use of <b>nebulized</b> saline to relieve breathlessness (possibly by facilitating sputum clearance) in COPD patients. Lung function was not affected. <b>Nebulized</b> saline can therefore {{be used as a}} placebo in bronchodilator studies involving COPD patients but it cannot be used as a placebo in trials assessing symptom relief. </p...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} the production of micro-particles of polysaccharides. The method includes preparing a feeding solution and a gelifying liquid to collect <b>nebulized</b> jets of the feeding solution. The feeding solution contains at least one polymer capable of forming micro-particle structures and at least one biologically active substance.

50|$|Oxygen {{and other}} {{compressed}} gasses {{are used in}} conjunction with a nebulizer to allow the delivery of medications to the upper and/or lower airways. Nebulizers use compressed gas to propel liquid medication into an aerosol, with specific therapeutically sized droplets, for deposition in the appropriate, desired portion of the airway. A typical compressed gas flow rate of 8-10 L/min is used to <b>nebulize</b> medications, saline, sterile water, or a mixture of the preceding into a therapeutic aerosol for inhalation. In the clinical setting room air (ambient mix of several gasses), molecular oxygen, and Heliox are the most common gases used to <b>nebulize</b> a bolus or a continuous volume of therapeutic aerosols.|$|E

50|$|In {{electrospray}} ionization, {{a liquid}} is pushed {{through a very}} small, charged and usually metal, capillary. This liquid contains the substance to be studied, the analyte, dissolved in {{a large amount of}} solvent, which is usually much more volatile than the analyte. Volatile acids, bases or buffers are often added to this solution too. The analyte exists as an ion in solution either in its anion or cation form. Because like charges repel, the liquid pushes itself out of the capillary and forms an aerosol, a mist of small droplets about 10 &mu;m across. The aerosol is at least partially produced by a process involving the formation of a Taylor cone and a jet from the tip of this cone. An uncharged carrier gas such as nitrogen is sometimes used to help <b>nebulize</b> the liquid and to help evaporate the neutral solvent in the droplets. As the solvent evaporates, the analyte molecules are forced closer together, repel each other and break up the droplets. This process is called Coulombic fission because it is driven by repulsive Coulombic forces between charged molecules. The process repeats until the analyte is free of solvent and is a bare ion. The ions observed are created by the addition of a proton (a hydrogen ion) and denoted {M}+H+, or of another cation such as sodium ion, {M}+Na+, or the removal of a proton, {M}-H^-. Multiply charged ions such as {M}+2H^2+ are often observed. For large macromolecules, there can be many charge states, occurring with different frequencies; the charge can be as great as {M}+25H^{25+}, for example.|$|E

But the role of <b>nebulized</b> steroids in acute exacerbation of COPD is not much studied in the literature. In this clinical review we have evaluated the role of <b>nebulized</b> corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Through Medline, Pubmed and Embase we analyzed the various studies that has been done to study the role of <b>nebulized</b> corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbation of COPD.

30|$|As {{colistin}} is {{the most}} frequently <b>nebulized</b> antibiotic in ICUs, there is some information in regard to clinical bedside safety and efficacy as well as large retrospective databases. However, {{only a small number}} of prospective controlled studies have evaluated <b>nebulized</b> colistin in mechanically ventilated patients implementing optimized technique. High-dose <b>nebulized</b> CMS (5 MIU/ 8  h with strict optimized technique) has been evaluated in patients with VAP caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii [6]. Patients with VAP caused by sensitive strains and treated with standard intravenous antibiotics served as controls. The clinical cure rate was 66 % in the sensitive strain group and 67 % in MDR strain group. By testing a nearly exclusively <b>nebulized</b> therapy strategy (a minority of patients received an intravenous aminoglycoside complement), this study very much indicates that nebulization of high-dose CMS may be effective to treat MDR bacterial VAP. Conversely, in patients suffering from VAP primarily due to sensitive bacteria, a randomized trial testing <b>nebulized</b> colistin as an adjunctive therapy to intravenous antibiotics appeared to yield negative results [53]. A recent randomized trial evaluated high doses of <b>nebulized</b> colistin using an optimized technique either as adjunct to intravenous antibiotics for VAP due to sensitive bacteria or as an exclusively <b>nebulized</b> therapy in case of MDR bacteria. Patients in the <b>nebulized</b> group had a significantly lower incidence of acute renal failure, a higher level of oxygenation and a shortened time to bacterial eradication than those in the control group receiving intravenous colistin [54], although the overall clinical cure rate was not significantly different. The fact that patients infected with MDR bacteria and treated exclusively with <b>nebulized</b> colistin had similar outcomes as patients infected with sensitive bacteria who were treated with intravenous antibiotics in addition to <b>nebulized</b> colistin can be considered to be an encouraging result [54].|$|R

None of them have allowed a definitive conclusion to be reached in regard to possible benefits. As a result, a recent review recommended that use of <b>nebulized</b> antibiotics should be avoided in clinical practice, due to a low level of evidence for their efficacy and the risks of adverse events [80]. Despite this low-quality evidence, recent VAP management guidelines recommend adjunctive <b>nebulized</b> antibiotic therapy for bacteria that are only susceptible to antibiotics when there is evidence for limited efficacy of the intravenous route, i.e., aminoglycosides and colistin.

Conversely, genetically modified flies presenting a wing-specific reduction in chemosensory cells show severe defects in both wing taste signaling and the exploratory guidance associated with chemodetection. In Drosophila, the chemodetection machinery includes mechanical grooming, which facilitates the contact between tastants and wing chemoreceptors, and the vibrations of flapping wings that <b>nebulize</b> volatile molecules as carboxylic acids.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decades, <b>nebulized</b> heparin has been safely {{administered}} {{in a number}} of pulmonary conditions [33 – 35]. Studies in healthy volunteers showed <b>nebulized</b> heparin to reach the lower respiratory tract [36], distribute uniformly in the lungs [36], and exert local anticoagulant effects [35]. In line herewith, <b>nebulized</b> heparin attenuated pulmonary coagulopathy in critically ill patients with acute lung injury [37]. Intrapulmonary administered heparin crosses the alveolar membrane into the circulation, being absorbed rapidly and released gradually into the blood [38]. Indeed, there is evidence of a dose-dependent effect of heparin nebulization on plasma levels of aPTT [35, 39], with a threshold dose of 150, 000  IU of heparin resulting in a measurable increase in aPTT [35]. This effect on systemic coagulation does not seem to potentiate the risk of bleedings [39 – 41], suggesting heparin nebulizations to be safe. Nevertheless, data on the feasibility and safety of heparin nebulizations in ventilated patients are scarce [19], and there are very limited data on the use of <b>nebulized</b> anticoagulants in ventilated patients.

A subsequent international survey that specifically investigated the use of nebulized antibiotics in ICUs highlighted very heterogeneous indications ranging from prophylactic or empirical therapy to documented lung infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, for VAT and VAP [70]. The use of jet nebulizers appears to be predominant, and practical implementations were far from the optimized efficacy conditions described above.

Performance was measured at different rates of nebulization and under changing conditions of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), inspiratory flow rate, inspiratory time and minute volume. The volume of saline nebulized was unchanged by variations in positive end expiratory pressure from 0 to 5 cm to 10 cm H 2 O, in minute ventilation and in inspiratory flow rate. An increase in the inspiratory time resulted in an increase in the volume of saline nebulized and this volume was greater as the power setting of the nebulizer was increased.

Total outputs of the drug from both nebulizers were measured using a sinus flow pump to create simulated breathing conditions. Paediatric and adult breathing patterns were used, with drug output measured after 5 and 10 min nebulization. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of budesonide using the BimboNeb (4. 5 microm) was significantly greater than that from the Nebula (3. 4 microm) (P< 0. 01).

For the paediatric breathing pattern, total outputs were very similar for both nebulizers. In all cases, nebulizing for 10 min produced greater drug outputs compared with those after 5 min, particularly for the paediatric breathing pattern. The amount of aerosolized drug available for inhalation needs to be assessed for each nebuliser used and the effect of the patient's breathing pattern should also be taken into account. 1558...|$|E

Recent findings The Magnesium <b>Nebulized</b> Trial In Children (MAGNETIC) trial has shown little benefit to routine use of <b>nebulized</b> MgSO 4 in children with acute asthma, but there may be a benefit in those with severe exacerbations and a shorter duration of symptoms. The 3 Mg trial has shown no role for <b>nebulized</b> MgSO 4 in adults and, at best a limited role for i. v. MgSO 4 in only the most severe exacerbations. This is the only study with direct comparison of <b>nebulized</b> and i. v. MgSO 4. Summary MgSO 4 has a role in severe exacerbations of acute asthma and {{there is no evidence of}} benefit outside this clinical situation. Both <b>nebulized</b> and i. v. treatments are well tolerated and inexpensive. In adults, the most effective route of administration is i. v. There are no direct comparison studies in children. Further research should focus on more severe exacerbations...|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: In a porcine {{model of}} AF-resistant P.aeruginosa pneumonia, {{the use of}} <b>nebulized</b> AF, {{associated}} with systemic meropenem, achieves higher bactericidal efficacy than <b>nebulized</b> or systemic antibiotics alone. This does not result in statistically significant improvement in pulmonary function after the first 2  days of treatment.|$|R
40|$|Data from interventional {{trials of}} {{systemic}} anticoagulation for sepsis inconsistently suggest beneficial effects {{in case of}} acute lung injury (ALI). Severe systemic bleeding due to anticoagulation may have offset the possible positive effects. Nebulization of anticoagulants may allow for improved local biological availability and as such may improve efficacy in the lungs and {{lower the risk of}} systemic bleeding complications. We performed a systematic review of preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of <b>nebulized</b> anticoagulants in the setting of lung injury in animals and ALI in humans. The efficacy of <b>nebulized</b> activated protein C, antithrombin, heparin and danaparoid has been tested in diverse animal models of direct (for example, pneumonia-, intra-pulmonary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -, and smoke inhalation-induced lung injury) and indirect lung injury (for example, intravenous LPS- and trauma-induced lung injury). <b>Nebulized</b> anticoagulants were found to have the potential to attenuate pulmonary coagulopathy and frequently also inflammation. Notably, <b>nebulized</b> danaparoid and heparin but not activated protein C and antithrombin, were found to have an effect on systemic coagulation. Clinical trials of <b>nebulized</b> anticoagulants are very limited. <b>Nebulized</b> heparin was found to improve survival of patients with smoke inhalation-induced ALI. In a trial of critically ill patients who needed mechanical ventilation for longer than two days, <b>nebulized</b> heparin was associated with a higher number of ventilator-free days. In line with results from preclinical studies, nebulization of heparin was found to have an effect on systemic coagulation, but without causing systemic bleedings. Local anticoagulant therapy through nebulization of anticoagulants attenuates pulmonary coagulopathy and frequently also inflammation in preclinical studies of lung injury. Recent human trials suggest <b>nebulized</b> heparin for ALI to be beneficial and safe, but data are very limite...|$|R
