Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in <b>no</b> <b>uncertain</b> terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E

5|$|Returning to naval service {{some months}} after the action, Harvey was given the 80-gun HMS Tonnant as his first flagship, in which he {{remained}} until 1809. Serving under Lord Gambier in the Channel Fleet, Harvey was outraged not to be given command of the British ships in action at the Battle of Basque Roads. Harvey expressed his disgust that command {{had been given to}} the more junior Lord Cochrane in <b>no</b> <b>uncertain</b> terms to Gambier, and was dismissed from the admiral's council as a result. When the operation was initially successful, Gambier refused to support Cochrane and as a result an opportunity to annihilate the French Atlantic Fleet was lost. The ensuing dispute lasted years and involved a court martial that eventually acquitted Gambier, and only ended with Cochrane's dismissal from the service five years later.|$|E
5|$|Turner had his {{own reasons}} for wanting Alderson gone, {{following}} the Battle of St-Eloi in April 1916. After British troops had taken a large crater near {{the ruins of the}} Belgian town of St Eloi, a brigade of Turner's division was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks. Due to dreadful management of the Canadian forces by Turner and Brigadier-General Huntly Ketchen, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army who had overall responsibility for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, Alderson sought his dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear in <b>no</b> <b>uncertain</b> terms to Commander in Chief Sir Douglas Haig that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support.|$|E

40|$|Objectives/BackgroundTo {{examine the}} {{additional}} diagnostic value of {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) after administration of a weak albumin binding contrast agent in post-endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) patients with aneurysm growth with <b>no</b> or <b>uncertain</b> endoleak after computed tomography angiography (CTA). MethodsThis was a prospective diagnostic cross sectional study carried out between April 2011 and August 2013. MRI was performed in all patients with aneurysm growth≥ 5  mm after EVAR implantation and <b>no</b> or <b>uncertain</b> endoleak on CTA, or the inability, on CTA, to identify {{the source of a}} visible endoleak. All MRI scans were performed on a 1. 5  T clinical MRI scanner after administration of a weak albumin binding contrast agent. The presence of endoleaks was assessed by visually comparing pre- and post-contrast T 1 -weighted images with fat suppression. Post-contrast images were acquired 5 and 15 minutes after contrast administration. ResultsTwenty-nine patients (26 men; 90 %) with a median age of 74 years (interquartile range [IQR] 67 – 76) were included. The median interval between EVAR and MRI was 39 months (IQR 20 – 50). The median increase in maximum aneurysm diameter during total follow up after EVAR was 11  mm (IQR 6 – 17). At CTA, 16 patients (55 %) had no detectable endoleak, five patients (17 %) had suspected but uncertain endoleak, and eight patients had a definite endoleak (28 %). On the post-contrast MRI images, endoleak was observed in 24 patients (83 %). In all patients with uncertain endoleak on CTA, endoleak was detected with MRI. For type II endoleaks, feeding vessels were detected in 22 / 23 patients (96 %) and these were all, except one, lumbar arteries. ConclusionIn patients with enlarging aneurysms of unknown origin after EVAR, MRI with a weak albumin binding contrast agent has additional value for both the detection and determination of the origin of the endoleak...|$|R
