5|$|The Comet's thin metal {{skin was}} {{composed}} of advanced <b>new</b> <b>alloys</b> and was both riveted and chemically bonded, which saved weight and reduced the risk of fatigue cracks spreading from the rivets.

5|$|Scales {{like the}} Kibble balance also permit more {{flexibility}} in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards {{would be the same}} as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these <b>new</b> <b>alloys.</b>|$|E
5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the <b>new</b> <b>alloys,</b> and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E

25|$|The archaeological {{record in}} Egypt, Peru and the Caucasus {{suggests}} that arsenical bronze was produced {{for a time}} alongside tin bronze. At Tepe Yahya its use continued into the Iron Age for the manufacture of trinkets and decorative objects, thus demonstrating {{that there was not}} a simple succession of alloys over time, with superior <b>new</b> <b>alloys</b> replacing older ones. There are few real advantages metallurgically for the superiority of tin bronze, and early authors suggested that arsenical bronze was phased out due to its health effects. It is more likely that it was phased out in general use because alloying with tin gave castings which had similar strength to arsenical bronze but did not require further work-hardening to achieve useful strength. It is also probable that more certain results could be achieved with the use of tin, because it could be added directly to the copper in specific amounts, whereas the precise amount of arsenic being added was much harder to gauge due to the manufacturing process.|$|E

2500|$|The stent {{platform}} {{itself is}} an expandable framework, generally with an elaborate mesh-like design to allow expansion, flexibility, {{and in some}} cases the ability to make/enlarge side openings for side vessels. [...] The first DES were stainless steel alloys composed of iron, nickel, and chromium and were based on existing bare metal stents. [...] These stents were hard to visualize with medical imaging, posed a risk of causing allergic responses, and were difficult to deliver, and subsequent <b>new</b> <b>alloys</b> were brought to bear, namely cobalt-chrome and platinum chrome, with improved performance. [...] Subsequently, bioresorbable stents have been developed in which the stent itself dissolves over time. [...] As of 2009, materials that had been explored included magnesium, polylactic acid, polycarbonate poylmers, and salicylic acid polymers. [...] Resorbable stents have held the promise of providing an acute treatment that would eventually allow the vessel to function normally, without leaving a permanent device behind.|$|E

This <b>new</b> <b>alloy</b> shows lower susceptibility to SCC than conventional alloys as it does not undergo environmentally-induced embrittlement in NaCl solutions and in 1 M NaCl + 0. 3 % H 2 O 2 in which the 7075 and 8090 alloys, respectively, undergo environmentally-induced fracture.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{additional}} solute magnesium (Mg) on mechanical and high-cycle-fatigue properties of 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy is investigated in detail. By adding 0. 5 % and 0. 8 % Mg to the 6061 -T 6 alloy {{with a normal}} stoichiometric Mg 2 Si composition (base alloy), the alloy exhibits eminent strain-aging characteristics demonstrated {{by the emergence of}} serrated flow, the negative strain-rate-sensitivity and relatively weakened temperature dependency of flow stress. The Mg-added <b>new</b> <b>alloy</b> also shows higher work-hardening rate than the base alloy particularly at initial flow regime and at lower strain rate. The S-N curve of the <b>new</b> <b>alloy</b> shows a clear fatigue limit which is absent in the base alloy. The fatigue limit of the <b>new</b> <b>alloy</b> is shown to be controlled by the threshold against small crack growth. Moreover, the <b>new</b> <b>alloy</b> clearly exhibits a coaxing phenomenon (time-dependent strengthening) which is absent in the base alloy. The coaxing effect is attributed to the existence of a small quasi-non-propagating crack whose growth resistance gradually increases during stress amplitude step-ups.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a <b>new</b> <b>alloying</b> method for solders by using a metal organic {{modified}} flux in solder pastes. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the impact of six metal organic compounds (Co, Fe, Al; stearate, oxalate, citrate) on the melting and solidification behaviour in comparison to the revealed microstructure. Findings - It could be shown that Co and Al influence the supercooling whereas Fe exhibits no effect. Co reduces the supercooling of the cast of about 10 K and affects the nucleation. Al retards the solidification up to 185 degrees C. Doping of the solder by flux containing metal organic compounds is successful and the alloying elements Co and Fe are found in the microstructure. Research limitations/implications This paper provides a starting-point for the <b>new</b> <b>alloying</b> method so far only fluxes for solder pastes have been investigated.
