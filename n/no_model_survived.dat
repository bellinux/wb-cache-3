2500|$|<b>No</b> Dinky Toys <b>models</b> {{were made}} between 1941 and 1945. The French Meccano factory was {{occupied}} by the Germans, some of whom worked for Märklin, and the British factory was on war work but every Christmas a few models would be sold from pre-war stocks. Thus {{during and after the}} war a few 'pre-war' <b>models</b> <b>survived</b> and were sold in 1945 (Harvey 1974, p.1997-1998) (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). The first new models released after the war were U.S. military jeeps ref.153a in April 1946 in England and ref. 24M in France, it was the first Dinky Toy made at the scale of 1/43.|$|R

50|$|Because these cars, unlike front-engined sister models, {{were not}} widely used, and also not {{suitable}} for conversion to wood gas generator, they were not confiscated by the Wehrmacht. Therefore, an above-average number of <b>models</b> <b>survived</b> in private hands without damage due to the war, but most were used to exhaustion in the early post-war years. Today, these cars remain among the rarest and most sought-after Mercedes-Benz models.|$|R
40|$|The {{measurements}} of WMAP on the relic density {{of dark matter}} strongly constrain supersymmetric models.

50|$|However, the Australian GM J Car based Holden Camira (JB series) fared {{so badly}} due to quality {{problems}} in New Zealand that local GM bosses decided {{to replace it}} with the GM J car based Isuzu Aska (or JJ) from Japan.

The Isuzu-based <b>model</b> <b>survived</b> until Holden introduced the ultimate Camira, the JE, which made it across the Tasman Sea in 1987.|$|R
50|$|When Traube came to Berlin, he {{was already}} ill, {{probably}} from diabetes and coronary ischaemia. Here his two sons were employed at the university. He worked tirelessly even {{in the last year}} of his life. His death attracted great attention. He was laid to rest in the cemetery in Gudrunstrasse, Berlin-Lichtenberg.
