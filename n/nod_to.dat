5|$|The W427's name is {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of factors. W is to honour the founder of HSV, Tom Walkinshaw. The 427 is simply the engine capacity in cubic inches, but it is also a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> the HRT 427C, which won the 2002 and 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour motor races.|$|E

5|$|Hans Rønning's {{assignment}} to officiate {{the game was}} viewed by other on-ice officials as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> organizers from Lillehammer, Norway, who had just {{won the right to}} host the 1994 Winter Olympics and were observing the game. At age 38, Rønning expected the 1987 tournament to be among his last international assignments. Rønning never officiated another international game, though he did referee two more seasons in Norway before retiring.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, Beyoncé {{signed a}} deal to launch an activewear line of {{clothing}} with British fashion retailer Topshop. The 50–50 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand's name is a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> Beyoncé's daughter Blue Ivy and her favourite number four (IV in roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E

5|$|Townsend {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the band's first album {{at the same}} time he was working on SYL, spending half the week on one and half on the other. The album was engineered and mixed by Townsend and Shaun Thingvold, who has worked on many of Townsend's and Strapping Young Lad's albums. It had the working title Relationships, but was renamed Accelerated Evolution, a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> the frantic pace of putting a new band together in under a year.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, Marvel {{announced}} the Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, named as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe. Each guidebook is compiled by Mike O'Sullivan and the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe team, with cover art from Mike Del Mundo and Pascal Campion, and features {{facts about the}} MCU films, film-to-comic comparisons, and production stills. Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Iron Man, Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Incredible Hulk / Marvel's Iron Man 2, Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Thor, and Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger released each month from October 2015 to January 2016, respectively.|$|E

Recurring guest voice actors Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, voice actor Ralph Garman, and writer John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Recurring cast members Adam West, and Patrick Warburton also appeared in the episode, portraying the characters of Adam West and Joe Swanson, respectively. Bob Gunton's voicing of the warden is probably a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> his most famous role, that of the warden in the film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E

5|$|The Chrysler Building is {{considered}} a leading example of Art Deco architecture. The exterior of the building has about fifty total ornaments protruding from the building's corners at five different floors in a way similar to the gargoyles of Gothic cathedrals. The corners of the 61st floor are graced with eagles, (a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States), while the 31st-floor contains gargoyles and replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps at its corners. The building is constructed of masonry with a steel frame, as well as metal cladding, and currently contains a total of 3,862 windows on its facades.|$|E
5|$|The {{freeway and}} {{expressway}} sections of M-53 are officially {{known as the}} Christopher Columbus Freeway as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> Macomb County's large Italian American population. This designation {{was approved by the}} Michigan Legislature in 1978. The remainder has been named Van Dyke Avenue or Van Dyke Road. That name honors James A. Van Dyke, a prominent attorney in Detroit in the 19th century. Van Dyke was the prosecutor for Wayne County, as well as both city attorney and mayor of Detroit. The street through Detroit was named in his honor, and as the highway was extended northward, the name was carried with it.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Thunder was {{released}} in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2008, three months after its release and {{a week after the}} end of its theatrical run in the U.S. and Canada. The film {{was released}} on home video on January 26, 2009 in the United Kingdom. Special features include an unrated director's cut of the film, audio commentaries (including one featuring Stiller, Downey, and Black, with Downey providing his commentary as Lincoln Osiris, a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> a joke in the film that Lazarus never breaks character until he completes the DVD commentary), several featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and the Rain of Madness mockumentary.|$|E

5|$|A remastered and {{extended}} {{cut of the}} film, named the Signature Edition, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015. The edition is approximately two minutes longer than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean and the sequence of the Giant's dream. Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film but never finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed for this new version, they were available as deleted storyboards on the 2004 DVD bonus features. They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film. The film's Signature Edition was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016. An official Blu-ray release was available on September 6, 2016. Along with the additional scene, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> Disney via a Tomorrowland commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a joke regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.|$|E
5|$|Love Kraft is {{the seventh}} studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, {{released}} on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The album {{was recorded in}} Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and {{was something of a}} departure for the band, with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point. In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a conscious effort was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible. The album's name was taken from a sex shop, Love Craft, near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries' management team and is also a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. One advertisement claimed, likely in error, that this film {{was based on the}} play The Man of the Hour. Written by George Broadhurst, the play focused on political corruption in the form of graft, but the play itself was apparently inspired by politicians of New York. The plot of the film includes a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> the Women's suffrage movement, {{but it would be a}} decade before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. The character, Congressman Casey, would later be seen again in Orator, Knight and Cow Charmer. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. There are no known credits for the cast, but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910. Credits may have included Anna Rosemond, one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era. Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying two characters.|$|E
