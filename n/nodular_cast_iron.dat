40|$|There is a {{continuous}} demand for low-cost <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> with improved mechanical properties, this being an industrial requirement both for pearlitic {{as well as}} for ferritic grades. Developments in pearlitic nodular irons should lead to alloys with higher and higher strength while retaining some ductility in the as-cast state so as to respond to demands related to castings for high power automotive engines in competition with steel castings and ADI. According to these aims, several alloying elements have been selected and added separately or combined to standard commercial <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> In all cases, only low-level additions were made and their effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties at room temperature have been characterized and are discussed.

The damaged zone ahead of the crack tip is studied by SEM observations on the pre-polished surface of a CT 25 specimen, before and after ductile tearing. It is shown that the damaged zone is very large in the GGG 40 <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> (through almost the whole ligament ahead of the crack), so the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics is not valid in <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> for small specimens. The force versus crack opening displacement curves calculated in 2 D for plane strain and plane stress conditions give respectively an upper and a lower limit as compared with the experimental curve. Only 3 D calculations lead to a good fît with the experimental curve. This result shows that the stress state ahead of the crack tip of a <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is intermediate between plane stress and plane strain conditions, due to the high density of voids inside the damaged material...|$|E

Production of castings from standard kinds of <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is quite good managed, but manufacturing of mark GJS 400 - 18 LT with excellent strength and plastic properties by minus temperatures is complicated, because it reacts very sensitively on the changing of melting conditions and metallurgical treatment.

In this study, effect of chill formation {{on the surface of}} grey and nodular cast irons is investigated on the wear behavior, hardness, impact toughness and microstructure of grey and nodular cast irons. For this purpose, four types cam shaft made of grey cast iron with and without chill on the surfaces and <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with and without chill on the surfaces, were casted.
