5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, the capacity of the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E

Typically, this leaves a large open wound, which often requires skin grafting, though necrosis of internal (thoracic and abdominal) viscera such as intestinal tissue is also possible.

25|$|Researchers {{suggest that}} common {{ostriches}} also employ a ‘selective brain warming’ mechanism {{in response to}} cooler surrounding temperatures in the evenings. The brain was found to maintain a warmer temperature when compared to carotid arterial blood supply. Researchers hypothesize three mechanisms for this finding.

They also speculate that there is an overall decrease in cerebral blood flow to the brain. Finally, they suggest that warm venous blood perfusion at the ophthalmic rete facilitates warming of cerebral blood that supplies the hypothalamus. Further research will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to find how this occurs.|$|E

25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{are not able to}} proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E

500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{previous}} films, Starfleet's {{range of}} capital ships had been predominantly {{represented by the}} Constitution class Enterprise and just five other ship classes: the Miranda class from [...] (represented by the USS Reliant), the Excelsior and the Oberth class Grissom from , and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from The Next Generation. ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First Contacts space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship configurations. [...] "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before", he reasoned. [...] "And since we figured {{a lot of the}} background action in the space battle would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with computer-generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway, I realized there was no reason not to do some new designs." [...] Alex Jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships. Paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles. Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star Trek ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs. The Akira class featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double hull; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager; the Saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section; and the Steamrunner class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear. Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital wire-frame model for use in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Disagreement {{persists}} {{over who}} originated {{the metaphor of}} a [...] "stab in the back" [...] as an explanation for losing the First World War. [...] What emerges clearly from Thaer's observations is {{that the idea of}} off-loading responsibility for military defeat away from the military leadership originated in the Supreme Army Command. [...] Even though Hindenburg and Ludendorff tried to shift the blame for the threatened defeat [...] - and therefore the failure of their own predications to come true - during the later years of the war, away from the army, there was not at this point any talk of a planned or treacherous conspiracy. [...] But there was talk of the forces having been let down by shortcomings on the homefront, whereby inadequate soldiers and insufficient war resources had been supplied by the civilain authorities. [...] Thaer quotes Ludendorff on 1 October 1918: [...] "Right now we have no chancellor. [...] Whoever gets appointed, there are things that <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> [...] But I have asked His Majesty to bring into government those whom we have to thank that we have come to the present position. [...] We will now see these gentlemen taking over the ministries. [...] They must now conclude the peace that must be concluded. [...] Let them now take the gruel that they have been delivering to us!" [...] This argument can really only be interpreted as a form of retreat-ideology, and in that sense the first phase {{in the development of the}} [...] Dolchstoß legend.

6000|$|And, {{on these}} terms, Voltaire {{gets out of}} the business; glad to close the {{intolerable}} rumor, at some cost of money. For all tongues were wagging; and, in defect of a TIMES Newspaper, it appears, there had Pamphlets come out; printed Satires, bound or in broadside;--sapid, exhilarative, for a season, and interesting to the idle mind. Of which, TANTALE EN PROCES may still, for the sake of that PREFACE to it, be considered to have an obscure existence. And such, reduced to its authenticities, was the Adventure of the Steuer-Notes. A very bad Adventure indeed; unspeakably the worst that Voltaire ever tried, who had such talent in the finance line.
