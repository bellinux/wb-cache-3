25|$|Nonoxynol-9 is {{sometimes}} included in shaving creams for its properties as a <b>nonionic</b> surfactant; it helps break down skin oils that normally protect hair from moisture, {{so that they}} become wet and, hence, softer and easier to shave. Gillette formerly used nonoxynol-9 for this purpose in its Foamy products, but has discontinued the practice.|$|E
25|$|The major uses of phenol, {{consuming}} {{two thirds}} of its production, involve its conversion to precursors for plastics. Condensation with acetone gives bisphenol-A, a key precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide resins. Condensation of phenol, alkylphenols, or diphenols with formaldehyde gives phenolic resins, a famous example of which is Bakelite. Partial hydrogenation of phenol gives cyclohexanone, a precursor to nylon. <b>Nonionic</b> detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., nonylphenol, which are then subjected to ethoxylation.|$|E
2500|$|Nonoxynol-9, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as N-9, is {{an organic}} compound {{that is used}} as a surfactant. [...] It {{is a member of the}} [...] nonoxynol family of <b>nonionic</b> surfactants. [...] N-9 and related compounds are ingredients in various cleaning and cosmetic products. [...] It is widely used in contraceptives for its spermicidal properties.|$|E
2500|$|The SAW chemosensor [...] is <b>nonionic</b> and nonspecific. It {{directly}} {{measures the}} total mass of each chemical compound as it exits the gas chromatography column and condenses on the crystal surface, thus causing {{a change in}} the fundamental acoustic frequency of the crystal. Odor concentration is directly measured with this integrating type of detector. Column flux is obtained from a microprocessor that continuously calculates the derivative of the SAW frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{separating}} the proteins by mass, {{they are treated}} with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) along with other reagents (SDS-PAGE in 1-D). [...] This denatures the proteins (that is, it unfolds them into long, straight molecules) and binds a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's length. [...] Because a protein's length (when unfolded) is roughly proportional to its mass, this is equivalent to saying that it attaches a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's mass. [...] Since the SDS molecules are negatively charged, {{the result of this}} is that all of the proteins will have approximately the same mass-to-charge ratio as each other. [...] In addition, proteins will not migrate when they have no charge (a result of the isoelectric focusing step) therefore the coating of the protein in SDS (negatively charged) allows migration of the proteins in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE, it [...] is not compatible for use in the first dimension as it is charged and a <b>nonionic</b> or zwitterionic detergent needs to be used).|$|E

50|$|Anionic, <b>nonionic,</b> and {{cationic}} surfactants have been used, although anionic surfactants {{are by far}} most prevalent. Surfactants with a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) are favored; the polymerization rate shows a dramatic increase when the surfactant level is above the CMC, and minimization of the surfactant is preferred for economic reasons and the (usually) adverse effect of surfactant on the physical properties of the resulting polymer. Mixtures of surfactants are often used, including mixtures of anionic with <b>nonionic</b> surfactants. Mixtures of cationic and anionic surfactants form insoluble salts and are not useful.|$|E
