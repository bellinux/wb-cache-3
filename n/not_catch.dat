5|$|Asomtavruli is used intensively in iconography, murals, and {{exterior}} design, especially in stone engravings. Georgian linguist Akaki Shanidze made an attempt in the 1950s to introduce Asomtavruli into the Mkhedruli script as capital letters to begin sentences, {{as in the}} Latin script, but it did <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> on. Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are officially used by the Georgian Orthodox Church alongside Mkhedruli. Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia called on people to use all three Georgian scripts.|$|E
5|$|Brown bats do {{not claim}} feeding areas like a territory, however {{individuals}} frequently {{return to the}} same feeding sites where they have previously made successful catches. When hunting swarms, brown bats usually select {{no more than two}} species. They feed on more species when they are scattered. If they do <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> any food, they will enter a torpor similar to hibernation that day, awakening at night to hunt again.|$|E

Cutscenes were edited to {{remove some of}} the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film. Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows, though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.|$|E

5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Washington {{preferred}} to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks {{followed by a}} retreat so that the larger British army could <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|Jean and Reiss left The Simpsons {{after its}} fourth season {{in order to}} create The Critic, an {{animated}} show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. The Critic was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since The Simpsons also aired on that network, Brooks was able to create a crossover between it and The Critic.|$|E

5|$|Jean {{was offered}} {{a job as a}} writer on the {{animated}} sitcom The Simpsons in 1989, alongside Reiss, and together they became the first members of the original writing staff of the show. They served as showrunners during the show's third (1991) and fourth (1992) seasons, though they left The Simpsons after season four to create The Critic, an animated show about film critic Jay Sherman. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 (then aired its second season on Fox in March 1995) and was well received by critics, but did <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> on with viewers and only lasted for two seasons.|$|E
5|$|Marion J. Shelton, {{an early}} Mormon missionary, {{proposed}} {{the addition of}} a new glyph to represent the schwa, a simple vertical line of the same height as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the Turkish dotless i (ı). The addition of this glyph did <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it. Shelton used the new glyph in an 1860 letter to Brigham Young reporting on a recently completed mission to the Paiute people.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, the Italian {{invasion}} of Egypt began. Much to Pattle's distaste, the squadron was {{heavily involved in}} close air support operations and ordered specifically to avoid air-to-air combat unless attacked. On occasion, he chanced upon Italian aircraft, but the Gladiator's limited speed denied Pattle further success. Pattle succeeded in damaging a Savoia-Marchetti S.79 bomber which emitted black smoke but dived away and Pattle could <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> it. The speed of the Savoia-Marchetti S.79 enabled it to escape the RAF fighters on a consistent basis. The unit withdrew to Habbaniyah to re-equip with Mark II machines, but was then ordered to Greece after the Italian attack.|$|E
50|$|The fielder must {{catch the}} ball with his hand or glove. If the fielder uses his cap, protector, pocket or {{any other part of}} his uniform in getting possession, it is <b>not</b> a <b>catch.</b> Therefore, a foul ball which {{directly}} becomes lodged in the equipment of the catcher (other than his or her glove) is <b>not</b> considered a <b>catch</b> and hence <b>not</b> a foul tip.|$|R

5|$|Heading {{into the}} final race of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher had already won the season's Drivers' Championship, having {{clinched}} the title at the previous race, the Japanese Grand Prix. Schumacher led the championship with 98 points; McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen was second on 86 points. A maximum of 10 points were available for the remaining race, which meant Häkkinen could <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> Schumacher. Behind Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen in the Drivers' Championship, David Coulthard was third on 67 points, ahead of Rubens Barrichello in fourth on 58 points. Barrichello {{was still able to}} clinch third place if he took victory in the race and Coulthard finished outside of the top six. Although the Drivers' Championship was decided, the Constructors' Championship was not. Ferrari were leading on 156 points, and McLaren were second on 143 points, with a maximum of 16 points available.|$|E
5|$|In April and May 1941, Fusō and Yamashiro were {{attached}} to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet, but the two ships {{spent most of the}} war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, the division sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. On 18 April 1942, they pursued but did <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
5|$|The stacks {{belonged to}} Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing {{the way the}} light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for {{overcast}} conditions. But Monet soon found he could <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled {{the scene of the}} moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.|$|E

5|$|On 30 September MacLachlan flew in defence of London {{as a large}} raid {{sought to}} attack the city. The RAF fighters {{performed}} well but 73 Squadron did not encounter the enemy. As September ended the Luftwaffe began sending fighter-bombers (Jabos)—bomb carrying Bf 109s—over England. The following day MacLachlan was promoted to flight lieutenant in view of his experience. On 7 October he intercepted one such raid and engaged in air-to-air combat {{for the first time}} as a fighter pilot. At 09:50 the unit was scrambled to defend Chelmsford. Flying with No. 257 Squadron they overflew the Thames Estuary. No contact was made. At 12:30 they were scrambled again. This time MacLachlan spotted two Bf 109s at 20,000 feet. Six more attacked the squadron and MacLachlan managed to fire a burst which hit one and it dove away emitting smoke and gained a probable victory. On 12 October 1940 MacLachlan pursued a Heinkel He 111 over Castle Camps but could <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> the enemy machine which was too far away at high altitude. It proved to be his last encounter with the enemy during the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the mountain was the highest point in the region, the succession of the authorities that held control over it took an interest in its name and changed it periodically for symbolic reasons. In 1896, as part of Austria-Hungary, the highest peak of the Carpathians received its first government-sponsored name − after the contemporary head of state Emperor Francis Joseph I. Guidebooks sometimes did <b>not</b> <b>catch</b> up on these name changes. After the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, the mountain continued to be known simply as Gerlachovský štít because it belonged to the village of Gerlachov. The Polish government, claiming the territory of the High Tatras for Poland, simultaneously called the mountain Szczyt Polski (Polish Peak), but never gained control over it. The new Czechoslovak government changed the name to Štít legionárov (Legionnaires Peak) in honor of the Czechoslovak Legions in 1923, but the name was dropped in favor of the earlier Gerlachovský štít in 1932. As a result of the Communist coup d'état in 1948, the mountain was renamed once more − to Stalinov štít (Stalin Peak) in 1949. Its traditional name Gerlachovský štít was restored yet again a decade later and has remained unchanged through the present.|$|E
