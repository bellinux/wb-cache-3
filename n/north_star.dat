5|$|A {{native of}} Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Zahorchak {{received}} a bachelor's degree master in 1980 from Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, {{and a master}} of education degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1986. In 1994, Zahorchak received his doctorate in education from Pennsylvania State University, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on state policy-making. Zahorchak began his educational career in 1980 at the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, where he spent two years an elementary school teacher. In 1985, he became a middle school reading and language arts in the <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> School District in Somerset County, where he also coached varsity high school football. Zahorchak taught at <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> until 1989, when he started working at the Shanksville-Stonycreek School District, also in Somerset County. During his {{three years in the}} district, he worked as an elementary and secondary principal, as well as a federal programs director. In 1992, he returned to the <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> School District as a principal and strategic planning coordinator. Zahorchak also previously served as an elected member of the Greater Johnstown School Board, and was a Johnstown city councilman, the Johnston deputy major and president of the Johnstown Rotary in 2003.|$|E

5|$|As {{industry}} and railroads left the Mississippi riverfront, people gradually {{became aware that}} the riverfront could be a destination for living, working, and shopping. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board acquired land along the river banks, including much of Nicollet Island, all of Boom Island, and the West River Parkway corridor. These properties were developed with trails and parkways, and this spurred the development of private land adjacent to the riverfront, creating the new Mill District neighborhood. The Stone Arch Bridge was opened to pedestrian traffic in 1994, creating a link in the trail system and providing spectacular views of Saint Anthony Falls. Some of the old commercial buildings were adapted to new uses. The Whitney Hotel was built {{in what used to}} be the Standard Mill, while the <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Lofts was a new use for the former <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Woolen Mills building. Other projects, such as Saint Anthony Main and a number of condominium and townhouse projects, provide residents with the opportunity to live within view of Saint Anthony Falls.|$|E

In 2009 and 2010 the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> met the Adelaide Adrenaline in the AIHL finals. In 2009 the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> were defeated by the Adrenaline in overtime in the Goodall Cup final, 3–2 in Overtime. In 2010 the Adrenaline knocked out the Proski <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> in the semi-final holding off a third period comeback by the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> 6–5.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, new {{versions}} of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the Avro Tudor, military transport aircraft such as the Avro York, and the Canadair <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> which performed in both roles. These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.|$|E

5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E
50|$|The 1977-78 Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> {{season was}} the 11th {{season for the}} <b>North</b> <b>Stars.</b> The <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> were in {{financial}} trouble, and at season's end had the worst record in the league at 18-53-9. In June 1978, with both the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> and the Cleveland Barons {{on the verge of}} folding, the league approved an arrangement in which the two teams were permitted to merge under the ownership of Barons owner George Gund III. The merged franchise continued as the Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars,</b> but assumed the Barons' old place in the Adams Division.|$|R

5|$|Several hundred {{homes were}} {{inundated}} by the flood in Fairbanks, Salcha, unincorporated Fairbanks <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Borough, Nenana, and smaller villages, {{but due to}} early warnings from the National Weather Service, volunteer fire departments, and the borough's emergency contact system, no one was injured. The area affected by the flood was declared a state disaster area, making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid. The long-term effects of the flood, including {{its effect on the}} salmon spawning season, are as yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Fairbanks economy, which briefly boomed in {{the period}} between the {{discovery}} of oil and the legal challenge, stagnated as legal challenges dragged on. The challenges were ended by approval of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act in late 1973. When pipeline work began in early 1974, it sparked a boom in Fairbanks unlike anything since the years immediately after the city's founding. Alyeska Pipeline Service Company alone spent an estimated $800,000 a day in Fairbanks, which housed the construction headquarters on Fort Wainwright. Tens of thousands of workers poured into the city, straining the economy, infrastructure, and public works. The population of the Fairbanks <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Borough increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 1976. The number of businesses in the area doubled during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The notice {{specified}} that only women {{were invited to}} the first day's meetings on July 19, but {{both women and men}} could attend on the second day to hear Lucretia Mott speak, among others. On July 11, the announcement first appeared, giving readers just eight days' notice until the first day of convention. Other papers such as Douglass's <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> picked up the notice, printing it on July 14. The meeting place was to be the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Seneca Falls. Built by a congregation of abolitionists and financed in part by Richard Hunt, the chapel had been the scene of many reform lectures, and was considered the only large building in the area that would open its doors to a women's rights convention.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1978, the NHL {{allowed the}} financially {{struggling}} Cleveland Barons and Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> to merge under the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> banner. The <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> {{were allowed to}} keep {{some of the players}} from each team, and the remaining players went into the 1978 NHL Dispersal Draft.|$|R

50|$|The 1979-80 Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> {{season was}} the 13th season in <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> history. The {{previous}} year's merger with the Cleveland Barons began {{to pay off}} as the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> finished with a winning record {{for the first time}} in seven years, and finished in third place in the Adams Division with 88 points. Former Baron Al MacAdam led the team in scoring with 93 points and captured the Bill Masterton Trophy. In the playoffs, the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> shocked the hockey world by eliminating the 4-time Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens in seven games. The upset earned the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> a trip to the semi-finals.|$|R
5|$|Help at Any Cost: How the Troubled-Teen Industry Cons Parents and Hurts Kids is a non-fiction book by Maia Szalavitz {{analyzing}} {{the controversy surrounding}} the tough love behavior modification industry. The book was published February 16, 2006, by Riverhead Books. Szalavitz focuses on four programs: Straight, Incorporated, {{a copy of the}} Straight Inc. program called KIDS, <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> wilderness boot camp, and the World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools. She discusses the background, history and methodology of the troubled-teen industry, including techniques drawn from attack therapy and Synanon. She uses first-person accounts and court testimony in her research, and states that no evidence exists proving that these programs are effective. The book also includes advice for parents and an appendix with additional resources on how to get responsible help for teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E
5|$|In America, documentaries were {{produced}} in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro. Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British {{family on the}} home front; Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and The <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards {{the end of the}} war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal Diary (film) (1943), Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).|$|E
50|$|During the 1988-89 season, the Flames traded Churla to the Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars.</b> He {{was one of}} {{the players}} {{selected}} from the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> by the San Jose Sharks in the 1991 NHL Dispersal Draft; however, he was traded back to the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> only days later for Kelly Kisio.|$|R
50|$|Selected by the Minnesota <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft, Giles had two tours {{with the}} <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> (1979-86 and 1987-91).

5|$|The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as {{a nonprofit}} {{corporation}} in October 1994, citing {{a desire to}} give back to the community as {{one of the reasons for}} its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, The <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with the program and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.|$|E
5|$|The Duke's train had {{run more}} slowly through {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and <b>North</b> <b>Star,</b> had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for almost an hour, and the water stop at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterházy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E
5|$|The University of Alaska also grew {{during this}} period. In 1946, Congress {{appropriated}} money {{for construction of}} a Geophysical Institute to study Arctic phenomena such as the aurora borealis. The institute was established in 1949 and spurred the university's growth as the GI Bill simultaneously boosted the student population. Elementary education also developed as the Fairbanks Independent School District (the precursor to today's Fairbanks <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Borough School District) was established in 1947 to collect school taxes from areas outside city limits that were sending students to Fairbanks' school. The Golden Valley Electric Association, an electrical cooperative, was founded in the 1940s to provide electricity to areas outside Fairbanks city limits. In 1953, it bought the FE Co. power plant that served Fairbanks and provided electricity to customers as varied as Fairbanks' second radio station, KFRB, and the town's largest farm, Creamer's Dairy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> {{entered the}} AIHL in the 2002 expansion, when the league swelled from three teams to six. 2002 {{was a year}} of harsh lessons for the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> who upset the {{eventual}} champions the Sydney Bears twice, but suffered several harsh defeats. Top scorer for the <b>North</b> <b>Stars</b> in 2002 was imported Canadian Brett Hillier (Estevan Bruins).|$|R

5|$|This {{rescue mission}} {{was the first}} {{official}} United States military expedition to the Arctic; previous expeditions, including that of the Polaris itself, had been led by civilians. The Tigress sailed from New York on July14, 1873, traveling first to St. John's, Newfoundland and then to Godhavn and Upernavik in Greenland before following the coast further north. The crew searched <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> Bay, Northumberland Island, and Hartstene Bay before discovering {{the first sign of}} the Polaris crew: a camp on Littleton Island where they had wintered, now occupied by Inuit. The missing men, the rescuers were told, had constructed makeshift boats salvaged from their destroyed ship and traveled south. Acting on this clue, the Tigress searched the Baffin Island coast to Cumberland Sound, and then the Greenland coast from Ivigtut to Fiskenæsset and the Davis Strait, before returning to St. John's for fuel. Once there, they learned that the Polaris survivors had been rescued by a British ship and that their search was over. After returning to New York the Tigress was transferred back to civilian use.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the <b>North</b> <b>Star.</b> Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Douglass {{founded and}} edited the {{abolitionist}} newspaper the <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> from 1847 to 1851. He merged the <b>North</b> <b>Star</b> with another paper {{to create the}} Frederick Douglass' Paper.|$|E
