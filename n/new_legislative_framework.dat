25|$|In 2003, {{under the}} <b>new</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> of the Species At Risk Act , COSEWIC placed the Newfoundland and Labrador {{fisheries}} cod on {{the endangered species}} list and Fisheries Minister Robert Thibault announced an indefinite closure in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off Newfoundland's northeast coast. In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed the Barents Sea cod fishery appeared to be healthy, but that the situation may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high quotas. In 2005, the WWF—Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on the Grand Banks, in the form of bycatch. WWF also claimed poor enforcement by NAFO, an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific fishery advice and management in the northwestern Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|Public {{discourse}} around changes {{introduced as}} part of a drive to tackle spending on welfare, reflect a less than tolerant attitude towards welfare generally, but more specifically towards parents who require state involvement to care safely for their children. The introduction of a deadline of 26 weeks for the completion of care proceedings, together with a clear steer to resolve disputes wherever possible prior to making an application to court has introduced further instrumental approaches to working with parents. In this paper we explore practitioner experiences and understandings of working within the <b>new</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks</b> and consider the dominant cultural narratives they are working within. However, in some cases professionals felt able to challenge the economic narrative of the pre-proceedings protocol, and they experienced the legal and policy changes as an opportunity to engage in a helping alliance with families with the provision of support that otherwise they {{would not have been able}} to offer...|$|R

This secondary data analysis of national prescribing data investigated the prescribing behaviours of community-based nurses and general practitioners (GPs), using constipation {{as a case}} study. Currently, 37 683 registered nurses, midwives and health visitors are qualified to independently prescribe in the UK; however, only 16. 6 % of nurses prescribed items for constipation. Prescribing practices differed between nurses employed by primary care trusts (PCTs) and general practice, between nurses and GPs, and across regions. PCT-employed nurses undertook 83 % of nurse prescribing although activity increased steadily among general practice-employed nurses. Pharmacological treatment choices differed between nurses and GPs. Over 60 % of all nurses predominantly prescribed from one class of laxative compared with a wider range prescribed by GPs. The extent, impact and outcomes of medical prescribing need further study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>New</b> Zealand’s <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> {{for environmental}} management and biodiversity protection at a landscape level under the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA). The description includes the administrative framework for environmental management, {{the role of}} policy development and planning, {{and the application of}} management tools. The paper then critically evaluates the application of the RMA in practice, {{and the extent to which}} it has delivered effective biodiversity protection through a landscape-level response. This evaluation is illustrated by two short case studies. The first is of the management of the Waitakere Ranges, a rapidly urbanizing area of rich biodiversity on the fringes of the Auckland metropolitan area. The second is the management of the Far North district, a largely rural and economically depressed area which includes important habitat for the threatened North Island brown kiwi. The paper concludes with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the RMA approach, ways in which the legislation could be improved, and its potential applicability to other countries in the Australia Pacific region. ...|$|R

The aim of the paper is to identify and differentiate the role of historical and objective meta-structure factors versus the role of subjective factors in the establishment of a <b>new</b> institutional and <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> in Romania since 1990. The conclusion is that such historical and objective factors are fundamental in understanding what happened in the past 25 years and also for conceiving any feasible strategy for improving the current conditions and characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Building {{envelope}} {{has always}} been considered a key element to provide an ade-quate comfort level within buildings and to assure an optimal energy performance. Recently, its importance and centrality for the energy efficiency of buildings was even more strengthened by the growing {{awareness of the need}} to reduce the production of greenhouse gases (especially CO 2) and to significantly limit the consumption of fossil fuels. In particular, the <b>new</b> European <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> (2010 / 31 /EU Energy Per-formance Buildings Directive - EPBD recast) sets the ambitious objective that, within 2020 all the new buildings (2018 for public buildings) will have to satisfy the "Nearly Zero Energy Building" (nZEB) target. The way towards the innovation of the building envelope, that today appears far more promising, consists in passing from the concept of "insulation" to that of "integra-tion and multifunctionality". This requires the transition from a "passive" or resistive component (recurring to the well-known electric analogy for the heat transfer) to an "ac-tive" component, where the networks become resistive and capacitive and are integrated with generation/conversion systems, as for example, the technologies for the on-site conversion of solar radiatio...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure from political circles and citizens’ groups {{to ensure the}} production of urban built forms that can address both social and economic needs while respecting long-term environmental goals. This has resulted in <b>new</b> <b>legislative</b> and policy <b>frameworks</b> aimed at encouraging the adoption of sustainable development practices. This paper analyzes how professionals investing finance capital in commercial real estate properties in France are responding to such pressure. It raises the theoretical question of how sustainability goals may be internalized by investors {{in a context of}} financialization of urban production. Based on a qualitative analysis, the paper questions how property investors engage with the sustainability agenda and how this affects their organizational charts, business strategies, investment processes and day-to-day management of commercial real estate. The results show that FCIs have to internalize potentially contradictory objectives, i. e., countering the capital depreciation arising from new legislation by upgrading their portfolios and, at the same time, limiting their investments to maintain their profit margins. To achieve this, they both encourage their tenants to reduce energy consumption and adopt spatially selective ‘green’ investments that favor a limited number of ‘established’ markets at both intra and inter-urban levels...|$|R
