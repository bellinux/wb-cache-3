Lupus Ratio assays are integrated tests for lupus anticoagulants {{that may be}} based on APTT, RVVT or dPT clotting times. If a patient is being treated with unfractionated heparin, however, the heparin prolong clotting times and the diagnosis of lupus anticoagulant is invalidated. Commercial assays may have heparin neutralising agents added to their reagents. However, the type and efficacy of the heparin neutralisation is often not documented. We wanted to test the influence and efficacy of heparin <b>neutralisers</b> in the Lupus Ratio assay. Methods Several heparin <b>neutralisers</b> were tested, and polybrene was chosen for further testing. Unfractionated heparin and/or polybrene were added to normal plasma and to plasma from patients with or without lupus anticoagulant and clotting times compared {{before and after the}} additions. Lupus anticoagulant-positive patients were given 5000 IU i. v. of unfractionated heparin and plasma was collected just before and five minutes after the injection. Lupus Ratios were calculated after polybrene was added to the postinjection samples. Results The Lupus Ratio became slightly lower when polybrene was added to plasma without heparin. Plasma heparinised in vitro and plasma from patients that had received heparin, both had Lupus Ratios nearly identical to the Lupus Ratios calculated before any additions. Conclusion By addition of polybrene to a final concentration of 7. 9 μg/ml in test plasma, Lupus Ratio may be determined in lupus anticoagulant-negative as well as positive plasmas irrespective of the presence of heparin 0. 0 – 1. 3 U/ml. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In the <b>neutraliser</b> of the ITER Neutral Beam Injector, {{a beam of}} {{negative}} ions (D-) of about 1 MeV passes through a structure filled with deuterium gas, where negative ions are mainly converted into fast atoms. The ionisation of the deuterium buffer gas filling the <b>neutraliser</b> induced by the D- beam creates a rarefied and low temperature plasma which screens the electrostatic well of the D- beam and affects {{the properties of the}} extracted beam and the energy transport to the <b>neutraliser</b> walls. Moreover, the plasma can eventually escape from the <b>neutraliser</b> and move back in the accelerator, toward the accelerating grids and the negative ion source. The OBI- 2 (Orsay Beam Injector 2 dimensional) code was developed to simulate the beam propagation and plasma formation. Particle-particle and particle-wall collisions are treated using the Monte Carlo collision approach and the plasma is treated via Particle-in-Cell. The <b>neutraliser</b> geometry has been chosen as cylindrical with volume to surface aspect ratio representative of real technical devices designed for ITER neutral beam heating. Simulations show that the secondary plasma effectively screens the beam space charge preventing beam radial expansion induced by the Coulomb repulsion between beam ions. Plasma ions created in the <b>neutraliser</b> form an upstream current impinging the accelerator grid. On the other hand, the presence of these plasma ions between the accelerator grids and the <b>neutraliser</b> entrance enhances the beam focusing. 1...|$|E

It is shown that in general a de-tuned rather than a tuned vibration <b>neutraliser</b> is required at most frequencies, offering a stiffness-like or a mass-like impedance to the structure.

Computational fluid dynamics modelling of the neutral gas flow in the JET <b>neutraliser</b> has been undertaken, motivated by the shortfall in neutralisation efficiency and apparent loss of gas target observed in the JET <b>neutraliser</b> system. This has presented a challenging modelling endeavour due to the interaction of beam, background plasma and rarefied neutral gas.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{flexural}} wave motion in beam-like structures is of considerable interest in engineering practice. One simple method to control {{this type of}} wave is to attach a discontinuity or an auxiliary system consisting of a mass-spring-damper system called a vibration <b>neutraliser.</b> However, using such a device will only completely suppress a flexural wave at a single excitation frequency.

Experiments show that the commonly assumed n⋅t product rule fails to predict equilibrium behaviour in aerosol neutralisers under these conditions, as it does not capture the influence of total {{particle concentration}} and particle size. The aim of this work is to provide an equilibrium indicator that identifies situations where equilibrium is not reached in the <b>neutraliser</b> as a function of residence time, ion generation rate, total particle concentration, and particle size. Bipolar diffusion charging equations are solved numerically in a one-dimensional model first, and a non-dimensional analysis of the results is carried out in order to map equilibrium behaviour as a function of two non-dimensional groups, the non-dimensional ion concentration, and the non-dimensional <b>neutraliser</b> residence time. Solving the three-dimensional form of the charging equations in the geometry of the <b>neutraliser</b> then enables one to find good agreement in terms of equilibrium behaviour between experiments and predictions from the non-dimensional model.

40|$|Summary: Excellent Education: A {{critical}} {{intervention in}} the current (Flemisch) debate about equal educational opportunities Goele Cornelissen, Laboratorium voor Educatie en SamenlevingSupervisor: Prof. Dr. Jan Masschelein___________________________________________________________________________This study intervenes in the current (Flemish) debate on equal educational opportunities. This debate takes place at different levels and is mainly driven by recent developments in educational sciences and (positive and neuro-) psychology. The starting point of this debate is the observation {{that there is still}} a correlation between socio-cultural background of pupils and their educational performances. In other words, our educational system fails {{to make the best of}} each talent. It fails to bring each pupil at the proper place, which is the place that matches his or her talent and interests. Advocates of equal educational opportunities, hence, call upon school, teachers and others who are involved in education, to reform the (Flemish) educational system and to develop all kinds of instruments and practices that allow to innovate and to maximally develop each talent. Although the current debate clearly expresses a concern for the improvement of equal educational opportunities in and through the school, the starting point of this dissertation is that this way of speaking about education, just like the instruments and practices that are developed in its wake, occupies (privatizes) its intellectual objects, that is, what presents itself in the context of education, in a certain way. Stated differently, it constitutes a proper connection between what we see, what we can say and think about it, and what it allows us to do (chapter 1). This study aims to make the intellectual objects that are occupied by the current debate public, that is, free for common use. This implies that we want to abolish the self-evidence of what presents itself in the context of education today and open the possibility to say, think and act in an improper way. Or, to formulate it in another way, we want to disturb the distribution of the sensible that determines what is sayable, thinkable and doable in the educational present. More in particular we will do that by staging certain elements of the current debate on equal educational opportunities. The assumption thereby is after all that making something (an intellectual object) public always requires an certain artificial operation on this present (chapter 2) Moreover we will point out that this operation is a pre-eminently pedagogical operation. For this conception of pedagogical research as the operation that intervenes by staging, we draw on the work of the French philosopher Jacques Rancière and have been mainly inspired by one of his most famous works: the ignorant Schoolmaster. Rancière intervenes The ignorant schoolmaster in the French debate on educational equality in the middle of the 1980 s (chapter 3). Starting from the current debate on equal educational opportunities, and inspired by the work of Rancière, this dissertation presents two interventions. More in particular it presents a fable (chapter 4) and a video-essay (chapter 5). These interventions each stage certain elements of the current debate on equal educational opportunities with the intention to sense at the same time its familiarity and its strangeness, its contemporary a-temporality. They want to make that what appears on their scene into an object of thinking and make it in that sense appear real. Both interventions are preceded by a written introduction. This introduction is not meant to determine what the reader of the viewer has to think or to say about what is presented in respectively the fable and the video-essay, but wants to give a view of the type of analysis that preceded the construction of their scenes on the one hand and wants to throw a light on the pedagogical meaning of these interventions.

The RFPT excites an atomic or molecular gas into a plasma using an external RF antenna. This plasma is contained by a cylindrical dielectric source tube which is open at one end. An axial magnetic field is applied to the plasma using one or more solenoids or a permanent magnet source. The magnetic field is usually applied such that it is constant throughout the length of the source tube, after which the field diverges. The plasma couples with the imposed magnetic field, generating internal field structures, which can be used to regulate both the power coupling and {{the rate at which the}} plasma diffuses out of the source tube. In this study, the thruster performance is measured directly, thus providing missions designers with accurate performance data which can be used to assess applicability of the technology to future missions. A re-configurable lab prototype thruster was constructed and a pendulum type thrust balance was developed in order to make direct measurements of the thrust produced by the Surrey Space Centre (SSC) RFPT. The balance has been developed to allow mounting of the thruster together with the necessary RF and DC electrical feeds as well as the propellant feeds and incorporates sensors which allow measurements to be made in an RF plasma environment. A low magnetic field mode of RFPT operation was investigated in order to assess whether this mode of operation may be able to provide performance increases at reduced imposed magnetic fields (< 20 mT), which could enable the serious consideration of this technology for future flight opportunities. The lowered magnetic fields used here may reduce the risk of interference with spacecraft subsystems and perturbation to the spacecraft orbit, when compared to many of the proposed plasma thrusters which use fields in excess of 40 mT. Direct thrust measurements of an RFPT operating in a low field mode are presented as a function of the propellant flow, RF power and for two source tube lengths. The thrust is shown to peak at a field strength, B_ 0, which is demonstrated to vary with RF power and propellant flow. The peaks are also shown to correspond generally to peaks in the source plasma density, plasma potential and in some cases to exhaust ion beam current. Ion energy distribution function measurements show that strong beams are not present in thruster configurations which use a 170 mm length source tube but are shown to increase in strength when using a shorter 85 mm length tube. The low field mode is shown to generally provide performance increases over the non-magnetised case by a factor of 4. Low field mode thrust measurements using the shorter 85 mm source tube and matching double saddle antenna revealed enhanced peak performance gains over the 170 mm length case, resulting in an increase of the thrust efficiency by up to a factor of 15. The performance of the RFPT operating in this configuration is shown to produce enhanced or equivalent performance, when compared to similar state of the art configurations but at generally lower imposed magnetic fields. This particular optimisation may make possible a first flight opportunity for the RFPT as weak magnetic fields may be supplied easily by electromagnets. Electromagnets can be easily deactivated or field reversed to avoid interference with spacecraft subsystems and orbital parameters unlike permanent magnets which may be required to generate higher magnetic fields. Operation of the RFPT in the low field mode with an 85 mm source has also revealed new low field mode behaviour compared to the 170 mm case, producing sudden, large reductions in the performance of the thruster for imposed fields beyond B_ 0 which are shown to correspond to drops in source plasma density, plasma resistance and exhaust beam current...|$|R

Two categories of brittle flaking co-deposits were identified: (i) smooth stratified layers of a thickness of up to 50 mum and a fuel content of up to 16 at. %. (ii) granular and columnar structures reaching 1 mm in thickness and containing around 0. 5 at. % of fuel species. They were formed on the blades of the toroidal belt pump limiter (similar to 15000 s of plasma operation) and on the <b>neutraliser</b> plates of this limiter (similar to 90000 s), respectively.

40|$|The present ITER NB system {{includes}} two design features: short beamline design and vacuum insulated beam source (ion source and accelerator) which sustain 1 MV high voltage under radiation environment. The short beamline design {{is achieved by}} subdividing interior of the <b>neutraliser</b> into narrow channels to reduce gas conductance, and hence, the gas fl ow rate to ensure target thickness required for neutralisation. Optimizing the beam transmission and reionisa-tion loss of neutral beams, the axial length of the ITER NB injector was shortened to be 23. 4 m with a reasonably high injection effi ciency. Three-dimensional neutron transport analyses clarifi ed possible excess power dissipation due to radiation-induced conductivity, if the high voltage is insulated by conventional gas such as SF 6. Thus, design of vacuum insulated beam source has been established for the present ITER NB system. Keywords: fusion, ITER, neutral beam, accelerator, negative ion, H–, beamline, neutralise...|$|E

This model is used to identify the hereby called equivalent complex cross section flexural stiffness (ECFS) of the beam element {{which is part of the}} whole test sample.

These data are important parameters for the design of overhead power transmission lines and other cable structures. A cost function is defined and used in the identification of the ECFS.

40|$|Histones {{are basic}} nuclear {{proteins}} that bind to genomic DNA. There are five subclasses: core histones H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3 and H 4, and linker histone H 1. Release of extracellular histones {{has been shown}} in a range of critical illness animal models and human patients including sepsis and acute pancreatitis. Extracellular histones act as damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) on parenchymal epithelial and endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes) and platelets to activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs; TLR 2 and TLR 4) and/or NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLPR 3) inflammasome as well as induce calcium influx, proinflammatory cytokine production, thrombin generation and cell death. Anti-histone strategies such as anti-histone antibodies or pharmacological <b>neutralisers</b> alleviate histone-induced toxicity. To progress the translational relevance of histones in circulation, this thesis explores the development of xMAP technology based assay for measuring relevant toxic histones and also the significance of histone determination in animal models and patients with acute pancreatitis. Truncated histones were generated by recombinant DNA technology and the purity was 75. 6 - 95. 1 %, except for histone H 2 A C-terminal (35. 5 %). Anti-histone single chain variable fragment (ahscFv) was also generated (purity > 95 %) and shown to bind to histone subclasses by Western blot and IAsys resonant biosensor. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -full length and FITC-truncated histones (H 1. 1 C-, H 2 A N-, H 3. 1 N-terminal) bound to the cell membrane and induced calcium influx in EA. hy 926 cells, while other truncated histones did not. ahscFv significantly prevented histone-induced cell death. To measure all toxic histones in one assay, Luminex xMAP multiplex technology was developed. Standard curves of both singleplex and multiplex assays were developed and used to measure the levels of circulating histones in plasma of patients with severe trauma, sepsis and pancreatitis. However, the recovery ratio in spiked plasma was low and the assay failed to detect histones in patient plasma which were detectable by Western blot. Release of circulating histones were investigated in mice with acute pancreatitis induced by either 4 or 12 injection of caerulein (50 µg/kg/h; CER-AP) or by infusion of pancreatic duct with sodium taurocholate (3. 5 %, 1 ml/kg; NaTC-AP). Four and 12 injections of caerulein resulted in oedematous and necrotising CER-AP, respectively, with marked systemic inflammation and multiple organ injury observed in the necrotising CER-AP. NaTC-AP caused more diffuse pancreatic necrosis, systemic inflammation and multiple organ injury. Circulating histones, as measured by Western blots, were elevated early with further increases in necrotising CER-AP (peak > 100 µg/ml) and NaTC-AP (peak > 140 µg/ml) as disease progressed but not in oedematous CER-AP which were comparable to saline controls. The levels of circulating histones were significantly associated with pancreatic necrosis and multiple organ injury parameters. Circulating histones were then measured from healthy volunteers and a consecutive cohort of acute pancreatitis patients admitted to Royal Liverpool University Hospital (RLUH) within 48 h of disease onset. The predictive values of circulating histones for persistent organ failure (POF), major infection and mortality were compared with biochemical markers and clinical scores. A total of 236 patients (mild 156, moderate 57, severe 23 as per Revised Atlanta Classification) and 47 heathy volunteers were included. The median histone level in severe acute pancreatitis was 18. 8 µg/ml (interquartile range: 5. 9 - 33. 8), significantly higher than mild 1. 1 µg/ml (0. 6 - 2. 1) or moderate 1. 3 µg/ml (0. 5 - 2. 8) category which was comparable with heathy volunteers 1. 0 µg/ml (0. 5 - 1. 6). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) curve of histones for predicting POF and mortality was 0. 92 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 85 - 0. 99) and 0. 96 (0. 92 - 1. 00) respectively, which was as or more accurate than tested biomarkers or clinical scores. For infected pancreatic necrosis and/or sepsis, the AUC of histones was 0. 78 (0. 62 - 0. 94). Histones did not predict or correlate with local pancreatic complications and transient organ failure, but negatively correlated with leucocyte cell viability (r = - 0. 511, P 48 h (blood sampling 48 h). Circulating histones were significantly correlated with tested proinflammatory cytokines, clinical severity scores and individual organ injury parameters. Circulating histones were significantly more elevated in Group 3 compared to Group 2 but both were higher than in Group 1 or healthy volunteers. Multivariable analyses revealed that it was POF, but not pancreatic necrosis or other variables that most significantly associated with elevated circulating histones (odds ratio: 98. 1, 95 % CI: 14. 4 - 669. 0, P < 0. 001) ...|$|R

40|$|High power neutral beams {{currently}} play {{an important}} role in heating, fuelling and diagnosing magnetically confined thermonuclear fusion plasmas. At the Joint European Torus (JET) in Oxfordshire, England, the formation of such a beam involves passing a positive ion beam through a neutral gas target wherein beam electron-capture collisions result in a neutral beam component. The subsequent beam injection into the fusion plasma requires the sole use of this neutral component, since the charged component cannot penetrate through the large magnetic confinement fields of the tokamak. The observed failure to achieve near maximum theoretical neutralisation efficiency, has given motivation to those concerned to endeavour to understand the reason thereof. This neutralisation efficiency deficit is almost certainly due to gas target depletion, while the general consensus is that indirect heating of the <b>neutraliser</b> gas by the beam is its main cause. Paméla proposed a simplified analytical model of beam indirect gas heating over twenty years ago. The aim of this endeavour was to gain a more thorough understanding of the interaction between the beam and the <b>neutraliser</b> gas (beam plasma), via electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) computer simulations incorporating Monte Carlo collisions (MCC). Results under varying beam & gas parameters include the calculation of plasma parameters and the resultant gas heating. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results from the Langmuir probe investigation of Crowley et al. (which includes spectroscopic measurements to estimate the gas temperature, and invokes the gas heating model developed by Paméla), while they predict the existence of four significant gas heating pathways not accounted for in the Paméla model i. e. direct kinetic energy transfer by H 3 + ions, H 2 + ions, H atoms (formed via H 3 + formation) and electrons. However, the gas heating results do not account for the extent of the observed neutralisation inefficiency. In agreement with Surrey, results from a similar simulation investigation of future (ITER) negative ion neutralisers predict insignificant gas heating effects. Beam composition simulations predict the existence of a specific gas line density pertaining to maximum neutralisation efficiency, as opposed to the generally assumed increasing asymptotic behaviour, while an experiment is proposed to verify this prediction...|$|E
