25|$|The {{brachial plexus}} is {{formed by the}} ventral rami of C5-C6-C7-C8-T1, {{occasionally}} with small contributions by C4 and T2. There are multiple approaches to blockade of the brachial plexus, beginning proximally with the interscalene block and continuing distally with the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. The concept behind all of these approaches to the brachial plexus is {{the existence of a}} sheath encompassing the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle</b> extending from the deep cervical fascia to slightly beyond the borders of the axilla.|$|E
500|$|The {{axillary}} arch is an arch-shaped anatomical {{variant of}} the latissimus dorsi muscle of the human back. Its shape varies, but its defining characteristics are its origin from the latissimus dorsi muscle, its insertion close to or on the upper [...] part of the humerus, and that it crosses the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle</b> associated with the axillary nerve from dorsomedial to ventrolateral. Its size may vary from [...] in length and [...] in width. The axillary arch may be seen when the arm is abducted and the palms put {{on the back of}} the head. An impression can be seen on the medial side of the axilla.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{neurovascular}} bundles: superficial <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> and deep <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles.</b> As arteries do not travel within the superficial fascia (loose connective tissue under the skin), superficial <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> differ from deep <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> in both composition and function.|$|R

500|$|The pudendal nerve is {{difficult}} to visualize on routine CT or MR imaging, however under CT guidance, a needle may be placed adjacent to the pudendal <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle.</b> [...] The ischial spine, an easily identifiable structure on CT, is used {{as the level of}} injection. [...] A spinal needle is advanced via the gluteal muscles and advanced within several millimeters of the ischial spine. [...] Contrast (X-ray dye) is then injected, highlighting the nerve in the canal and allowing for confirmation of correct needle placement. [...] The nerve may then be injected with cortisone and local anesthetic to confirm and also treat chronic pain of the external genitalia (known as vulvodynia in females), pelvic and anorectal pain.|$|E
50|$|Comprehensive insight in {{the anatomy}} of the {{intercostal}} spaces is mandatory for everyone who practices medicine. One particular concept is that the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle</b> has a strict order: V-A-N, or vein-artery-nerve, {{from top to bottom}} (as illustrated). This <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle</b> runs high in the intercostal space, and the collateral <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle</b> runs just superior to the inferior rib of the space (in the order N-A-V from superior to inferior). Invasive procedures such as thoracentesis are thus performed with oblique entry of the instrument, directly above the upper margin of the relevant rib.|$|E

50|$|The {{application}} of preserving both <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> during nerve-sparing (NS) radical prostatectomy improves urinary continence and erectile function. Consequently, NS is recommended in elderly men {{and those with}} pre-existing erectile dysfunction, whom many surgeons would previously have only offered non-NS surgery. It was also found that during surgeries in which <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> are preserved, the frequency of positive margins were only 5.8 percent.|$|R

50|$|The main deep <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle</b> at risk is the {{posterior}} tibial.

50|$|At {{the level}} of the mid-proximal phalanx or mid-metacarpal, the distal {{component}} is transferred to the proximal component.

40|$|Although oncologic {{efficacy}} is {{the primary}} goal of radical prostatectomy, preserving potency and continence is also important, given the indolent clinical course of most prostate cancers. In order to preserve and recover postoperative potency and continence after radical prostatectomy, a detailed understanding of the pelvic anatomy is necessary to recognize the optimal nerve-sparing plane and to minimize injury to the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles.</b> Therefore, we reviewed the most recent findings from neuroanatomic studies of the prostate and adjacent tissues, some of which are contrary to the established consensus on pelvic anatomy. We also described the functional outcomes of radical prostatectomies following improved anatomical understanding and development of surgical techniques for preserving the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles...</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{third factor}} which is determinative for the {{seriousness}} of the injury is the volume. A larger quantity of the injected fluid causes a higher pressure in the tissues and therefore a larger risk on compression of the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> and tissue ischemia.|$|R
5000|$|... == Surgical {{technique}} == The rhomboid muscles, trapezius, levator scapulae and {{latissimus dorsi}} are transected. The <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle</b> {{consisting of the}} axillary artery, axillary vein and brachial plexus is ligated and cut. The area of the chest left exposed is then normally covered with a split-thickness skin graft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{axillary}} sheath is a fibrous sheath that encloses the {{axillary artery}} and the axillary vein {{and the three}} cords of the brachial plexus to form the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle,</b> surrounded by the axillary fat [...] It {{is an extension of}} the prevertebral fascia of the deep cervical fascia.|$|E
5000|$|A {{superficial}} <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundle,</b> without arteries in it, {{is mostly}} {{made up of}} capillaries running through different body tissues. Because capillaries function as the sites for material exchange between interstitial fluid and blood, {{they tend to have}} large surface area and short diffusion path. Normally, capillaries consist of a central lumen lined with an endothelium, a single layer of smooth epithelial cells.|$|E
30|$|Firstly, the {{pressure}} {{plays an important}} role. In the literature it varies from 40 to 800  bar [10, 16]. A pressure of 7  bar is already sufficient to penetrate the skin. At higher pressures, {{direct contact with the}} skin is not necessary to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissues [13]. The injected fluid spreads along the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> through places with the lowest resistance [17]. This causes a traumatic dissection of the finger and compression of the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> with vascular spasms, tissue ischemia and thrombosis as a consequence. If the distension of the tissues, caused by the fluid itself and by swelling and oedema, creates a pressure build-up exceeding hydrostatic pressure, tissue perfusion will be limited similar to that of compartment syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to review the {{literature}} of how to identify the mental foramen, mandibular incisive canal and associated <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> during implant surgery and how to detect and avoid the damage of these vital structures during implant therapy. Material and Methods: Literature was selected through a search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane electronic databases. The keywords used for search were mandibular incisive canal, mental foramen, mental nerve, anterior mental loop. The search was restricted to English language articles, published from 1979 to November 2009. Additionally, a manual search in the major anatomy, dental implant, and periodontal journals and books was performed. Results: In total, 47 literature sources were obtained and reviewed. The morphology and variations of the mandibular incisive canal, mental foramen and associated <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> were presented as two entities. It suggested that clinicians should carefully assess these vital structures to avoid nerve/artery damage. Conclusions: The mandibular incisive canal, mental foramen and associated <b>neurovascular</b> <b>bundles</b> exist in different locations and possess many variations. Individual, gender, age, race, assessing technique used and degree of edentulous alveolar bone atrophy largely influence these variations. It suggests that the clinicians should carefully identify these anatomical landmarks, by analyzing all influencing factors, prior to their implant surgical operation...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{one method}} {{employed}} {{prior to the}} insertion of a chest drain following a pneumothorax.
