5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Caracalla's death, Adventus was selected to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age. The army then chose Macrinus; they had no feelings of 'love or esteem' towards him, but there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> competing for the position. The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla, and named him Augustus.|$|E

5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> in the country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to be a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E
5|$|POV (point of view) {{shots were}} done with the Tiger Moth biplane. During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> but them were responsible for the death, the production team did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E

5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began {{the day with a}} walk in the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had a walk in the sixth, and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> was").|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his trap-shooting career, Bain {{developed}} an appreciation for nature. He bought an ownership share of the Portage Country Club, on the Delta Marsh near the south shore of Lake Manitoba, and later donated the land to Ducks Unlimited. Bain built the Mallard Lodge as a personal retreat on land adjacent to the club. He strictly enforced his privacy, even building a road to his lodge that he allowed <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> to use; members of the Portage Country Club were required to take a different route. Bain intended to donate his lodge to the government of Manitoba for preservation, though he died before he could do so. The lodge passed into the control of the government regardless, and was donated to the University of Manitoba as a research facility in 1966 that remains active today. Bain was {{also a member of the}} Manitoba Game and Fish Association and the Winnipeg Humane Society.|$|E

50|$|In psychology, {{ownership}} {{is the feeling}} that something is yours. Psychological {{ownership is}} distinct from legal ownership: one may feel that one's cubicle at work is theirs and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else’s</b> (i.e. psychological ownership), but legal ownership of the cubicle is actually conferred to the organization.|$|R
5|$|If {{the player}} plays as the Kid, Sara is trapped in LeMU instead of Coco; the Kid {{frequently}} has visions of Coco, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> sees her. The group manages {{to contact the}} surface, and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the water around, allowing them to escape. After having played the game as both Takeshi and the Kid, the player accesses the final route, {{in which it is}} revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017, those the Kid experienced were a recreation, and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034. The You of 2017, whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana, had artificially impregnated herself and given birth to Yubiseiakikana, who took the role of You during the recreation. Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017, carrying with it the disk with Sora's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF. Sara and the Kid are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi's children, and the Kid's real name turns out to be Hokuto. The Kid of 2017, whose name is Ryogo Kaburaki, played the role of Takeshi during the recreation, having stopped aging due to the Cure virus.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} {{of paint and}} iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> could see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the falling tide meant that {{she was out of}} reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E

5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E
5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E
