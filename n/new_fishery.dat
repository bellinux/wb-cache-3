In this case, when things have permanently adjusted themselves, the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end, while a new insertion will {{have been made in the}} scale at some point higher up; and the worst mine or fishery in use—the one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commodity—will be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated.|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 1860s many more boats left Fremantle and the {{pearling}} industry at Torres Strait, Queensland for the <b>new</b> <b>fishery</b> at Nickol Bay with its port of Tien Tsin Harbour (later known as Cossack). Thus new technology, {{in the form}} of small boats, large containers ({{in the form of}} bags and sacks) and then larger vessels operating independently, or as 'mother boats' to a number of dinghies, were the first major advances that the Europeans applied to the pearling industry. Walter Padbury, the noted Perth-based merchant, pastoralist and ship owner, then sent a large boat north up to the early pastoralist John Withnell in partnership with others. They also proved successful, as did many others, including (to name but a few) Charles Harper, who built his own boat, the Amateur; Charles Broadhurst a noted entrepreneur and at least two sons of Government Resident RJ Sholl.|$|E
50|$|A few Japanese trading {{companies}} established businesses at Chuuk and Pohnpei in the 1890s, and Koben Mori acted as its resident agent, helping to facilitate {{trade with the}} islanders. The early Japanese businessmen traded on alcoholic products, explosives and Chinaware. Contraband products like alcohol and weapons were also illegally traded, and the Spanish administration made futile attempts to suppress these activities. The Japanese traders were expelled from Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1900 when the Germans purchased the islands from Spain, but Japanese traders returned to Chuuk in 1907 {{and set up a}} trading firm dealing with copra production. After the Japanese annexed Micronesia from Germany in 1914, they gained a monopoly over the shipping routes in all of the mandated islands. The rate of copra production reached twelve thousand tons per year by the 1920s, and had an export value of two million yen. In the late 1920s, an Okinawan fisherman, Tamashiro established a tuna production factory at Wonei. The Japanese government provided incentives for fishermen to open <b>new</b> <b>fishery</b> production factories, and in 1937 there were at least 1500 Okinawans and Japanese who were employed in the fishery industry. Japanese settlers introduced commercial agriculture in Pohnpei and to a smaller extent in Chuuk and Yap. A few Japanese businessmen also set up firms to oversee the plantation of cash crops, including copra, rice and pineapples. They constituted the main exports in the central and eastern Carolines.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{fisheries}} on marine ecosystems, and {{their capacity to}} drive shifts in ecosystem states, have been widely documented. Less well appreciated is that some commercially valuable species respond positively to fishing-induced ecosystem change and can become important fisheries resources in modified ecosystems. Thus, the ecological effects of one fishery can unintentionally increase the abundance and productivity of other fished species (i. e., cultivate). We reviewed examples of this effect in the peer-reviewed literature. We found 2 underlying ecosystem drivers of the effect: trophic release of prey species when predators are overfished and habitat change. Key ecological, social, and economic conditions required for one fishery to unintentionally cultivate another include strong top-down control of prey by predators, {{the value of the}} <b>new</b> <b>fishery,</b> and the capacity of fishers to adapt to a <b>new</b> <b>fishery.</b> These unintended cultivation effects imply strong trade-offs between short-term fishery success and conservation efforts to restore ecosystems toward baseline conditions because goals for fisheries and conservation may be incompatible. Conflicts are likely to be exacerbated if fisheries baselines shift relative to conservation baselines and there is investment in the <b>new</b> <b>fishery.</b> However, in the long-term, restoration toward ecosystem baselines may often benefit both fishery and conservation goals. Unintended cultivation can be identified and predicted using a combination of time-series data, dietary studies, models of food webs, and socioeconomic data. Identifying unintended cultivation is necessary for management to set compatible goals for fisheries and conservation...|$|E

40|$|Pelagic pair {{trawling}} for tuna, Thunnus spp., and swordfish, Xiphias gladius, {{was introduced in}} U. S. Northwest Atlantic waters in 1991.

In late 1991, revised regulations restricted swordfish to bycatch in this fishery resulting in pelagic pair trawl vessels targeting tuna throughout 1992. Analyses of 1992 data indicate that albacore, T. alalunga, was the predominant species caught, although yellowfin tuna, T. albaeares, and bigeye tuna, T. obesus, were the preferred target species.
