500|$|Kristine Sutherland {{appears as}} Joyce Summers, Buffy's mother. Whedon enjoyed {{that she got}} [...] "to play just {{completely}} sexy , because when you play the mom on a show you're sort of relegated to momhood, so it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that side of her." ...|$|E
500|$|Maris Kreizman of New York {{called the}} episode [...] "not all that {{surprising}} {{and a little}} sentimental, but charming nonetheless." [...] She also complimented the development of Alex's character commenting that it [...] "was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a bit of real character development for Alex.".|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post {{praised the}} scene in which Yang broke down to Meredith, noting the {{exceptional}} chemistry between them. Pascua was positive of the storyline between Torres, Carlos, and Robbins, writing that it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{an emphasis on the}} gay storyline. Adam Bryant of TV Guide wrote that Baker's character [...] "seems like the only decent guy in the bunch", though PopSugar asserted that Williams' character [...] "proves to be most likable of the new doctors".|$|E
60|$|We {{were not}} sorry for this. It {{would be so}} much <b>nicer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> our dear home again when there was nobody there but ourselves. In-doors we rushed. Our absence had been like rain on a garden. Everything now seemed fresher and {{brighter}} and more delightful. We went from room to room, and seemed to appreciate better than ever what a charming home we had.|$|R

5000|$|Alter Echo {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from video game critics. Jeff Gerstmann, writing for GameSpot, commented: [...] "It {{would have been}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> some more variety in the environments, and the instances of backtracking through areas you've already visited are disappointing. But the game's exciting, free-form combat makes up for those deficiencies." ...|$|R
500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard said Usher's [...] "star {{power is}} clearly rubbing {{off on the}} 16-year-old", commenting that Bieber [...] "shows off his smoothest moves yet [...] " [...] and [...] "tackles his toughest choreography." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News commented, [...] "While Bieber had {{previously}} teased his dancing skills in the [...] "Baby" [...] video, he really channeled Usher's smooth moves in this newest clip." [...] Tamar Antai also of MTV said, [...] "Usher {{does most of the}} heavy lifting where dancing is concerned, and Justin Bieber, who's more of a singer than a dancer, is in no danger of upstaging Usher on the dance floor." [...] Antai compared Bieber's moves to Usher in his [...] "Caught Up" [...] video, commenting [...] "it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Justin expanding the scope of talents to include pelvic thrusts, Matrix-style slo-mo leans" [...] and, [...] "it's also <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Justin looking a little more mature and sophisticated in a hoodie and leather jacket....and his videos are growing up with him, as this is his flashiest, most grandiose video yet. Antai also commented on the appeal of the video, commending Meyers, [...] "who put that classic early '00s-style big-money polish on the piece – for employing fire, shirtless dudes, white ninjas..." ...|$|E
500|$|Balls {{described}} the video as [...] "a little racier than we'd expect from Keisha and Co", but acknowledged that [...] "it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the girls letting their hair {{down for a}} change". He compared it to the music video for Kylie Minogue's 2003 single [...] "Slow". [...] VV Brown, the co-writer of [...] "No Can Do", stated {{that she did not}} expect the video to be racy: [...] "Being very honest, I didn't see in that way. I saw the song as more fun and cheeky, rather than sassy and glossy like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared to [...] "Colonel Homer", Lurleen's {{comeback}} episode [...] "Papa Don't Leech" [...] received rather negative {{reviews from}} television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad expressed dislike for the episode, stating {{that he hopes}} the show will reconsider {{the next time they}} decide to give a [...] "solo opportunity" [...] to a one-off character [...] "many people don't remember". Robert Canning of IGN said, [...] "there were too few laugh-out-loud moments in this lackluster episode. Overall, it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lurleen again, but she'd probably get more laughs in future cameos than in carrying an entire episode." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 21 November 2013, {{the first}} {{passenger}} train travelled the railway towards Mountsorrel hauling the project volunteers. Project leader Steve Cramp {{said on the}} day that “It’s been an emotional time for us all, everybody has worked so hard over the last six years to bring this vision to reality and it’s so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>see</b> a steam train get back up to Mountsorrel." ...|$|R
5000|$|Booth said on his blog: We {{wanted to}} show an {{interesting}} character whose homosexuality is part of him, not something that’s hidden. Sure there are gay people who you wouldn’t know are gay right off the bat, {{but there are others}} who are a more flamboyant, and {{we thought it would be}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>see</b> them portrayed in comics. Did we go over the top, I don’t think so.|$|R

500|$|... "Circle the Drain" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Katy Perry, {{from her}} third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). It was written by Perry, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Monte Neuble. Lyrically, [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] candidly focuses on a former lover's drug-addiction and the strains it put on both of them. Following its release, several media outlets {{reported}} it to {{have been inspired by}} her former relationship with Travie McCoy. Critics were divided on the track, with some finding Perry to be in a hypocritical position, given the album's other material. Other reviewers found it <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a different side to the singer.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Lynn {{directed}} Grint in Wild Target, a 2010 comedy thriller film, {{which he}} starred in alongside Emily Blunt and Bill Nighy. A {{remake of the}} 1993 French film Cible Emouvante, Wild Target was made on a relatively small production budget of US$8million. However, it was a commercial failure, only earning back US$3.4million. It also garnered mostly negative reviews in the media, which criticised it for dishonouring the original film and wasting the comedic potential of its cast, but Grint also attracted some positive notice: [...] "It’s <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Rupert Grint perform well in a role other than that of Ron Weasley, and it’s clear that he’s got a career ahead of him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Fire" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea wrote that [...] "The Fire" [...] was [...] "another good episode." [...] Sciannamea {{went on to}} write that [...] "show has definitely improved and it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the other characters emerge". [...] "Miss Alli" [...] of Television Without Pity graded the episode with a [...] "B+". Dwight's reinterpretation of [...] "We Didn't Start the Fire" [...] inspired fans of the office {{to make their own}} song parodies. One version, aptly titled [...] "Ryan Started the Fire", lists several events from The Office, much like the original. After posting the song, Margaret Lyons from Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "Yay for the Internet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The nursery {{screen that}} you bought {{yesterday}} by my advice was decorated by Jessie and Kate Seaward, so I {{thought it would}} be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> let you <b>see</b> for yourself how sweet and `deserving' are the poor people whom you have befriended!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Erik Childress of The Playlist {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review writing: [...] "It's James Franco's best performance since his Oscar-nominated turn in 127 Hours {{and as a}} director it is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>see</b> him embrace the comfort zone of comedy with enough cameos to rival Robert Altman's The Player." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety also gave the film a positive review writing: [...] "A genuine capacity to delight, {{whether or not the}} audiences in question have seen The Room." ...|$|R
500|$|Issue #7 {{received}} an average score of 6.3/10 based on 15 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Schedeen {{gave it a}} 7.8 saying, [...] "Issue #7 is easily one of the stronger chapters of Civil War II. That doesn't say a great deal at this point, {{but it is still}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bendis focusing on a smaller, more intimate cast here." [...] Pepose gave it a 6 and said, [...] "With only one issue left to go, Civil War II remains a disappointing chapter for the House of Ideas. Even this series' biggest moments feel calculated rather than organic, trying to goose sales with a handful of character deaths without really digging in too deeply about the underlying issues underneath." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff were}} {{concerned}} over the animation of the characters' {{eyes in the}} episode, as the pupils were larger than normal, making the characters look [...] "stoned", and the eyeballs were [...] "too round" [...] and large. The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, {{where much of the}} animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in [...] "strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-Simpsons like." [...] Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Marge in a [...] "younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2010, after sister Lauren was recast to Jossa, Jossa {{stated that}} she enjoys working with Fitzgerald, adding {{the two have}} a lot in common. Jossa, in 2012, wanted Lauren and Abi to bond more. She commented: [...] "I think realistically they would when they're going through a family problem like this. It would bring the family a little bit closer. I think they are quite close already and {{they have a lot of}} family banter! They may not like each other as people, but they love each other as family". In December 2012, Fitzgerald {{conducted}} her first magazine interview and spoke of a storyline where Abi comforts Lauren over a relationship break up, saying [...] "It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the little [...] taking care of the bigger one." ...|$|E

The people are very traditional and the village itself is located in a beautiful wooded area between the mountains. To get here, you can walk along the river at the stopping point between the two tunnels on the main highway to Gevgelija that lead into the canyon. Alpinists train along this path and it is also a <b>nice</b> climb <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the canyon beyond from the top of the rocks.|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{first single}} off my last album, 'AM to PM', {{was more of}} a kiddie kind of thing, very pop. This new single is more R&B, kind of a club/party kind of vibe. And I'm excited about it 'cause it's a new me. I'm 22 now and there's been some maturity, and it's <b>nice</b> for people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this change." [...] Milian on her growth between albums.|$|R
500|$|The New Directions' {{rendition}} of [...] "Born This Way" [...] was strongly approved by Lady Gaga. On her Twitter account, she wrote, [...] "I really loved Glee Born This Way episode. I admire {{the show for}} being brave+fighting for such modern social messaging. Never back down." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance a [...] "B+", and commented that it wasn't her favorite group number, mostly because she felt the song [...] "wasn't [...] best effort". Berk was less kind about the song, and called it a [...] "crappy but thematically admirable Gaga tune", though he gave it three stars out of five. Slezak gave it an [...] "A−" [...] and approved of the rendition: [...] "it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and hear Tina, Mercedes and Kurt on lead vocals—instead of, say, Blaine, Rachel, and Mr. Schue." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Owen, {{television}} {{editor of}} the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said that the documentary provided an interesting, entertaining and detailed look {{behind the scenes of}} the show. Owen said that this was [...] "rare, because TV doesn't usually reveal details about itself. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> PBS pulling back the curtain on its competition, and I wish it happened more often." [...] Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News praised it, calling it [...] "a documentary as rare to public TV as Homicide is to commercial television", but said that it [...] "falls short of being definitive" [...] because it cannot address all elements of the series due to its brief running time. Several commentators praised the humorous scene in the documentary in which Yoshimura goes line-by-line through his script and replaces curse words based on orders from NBC censors.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West praised Fischer's [...] "masterful" [...] performance, {{writing that}} it [...] "really is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Pam coming into her own... And I love that she didn't inhibit herself when Jim walked in — she just ran right up and hugged him." [...] West also highlighted Carell and Helms, explaining {{that with the}} former, [...] "Michael is never completely loathsome — because Steve Carell imbues him with such vulnerability." [...] AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea also enjoyed Helms' performance, believing that [...] "the competition between Andy and Dwight will surely make for some classic moments." [...] Sciannamea concluded his review, [...] "What makes this show so great is that the supporting players {{have a chance to}} shine at the right moments. I thought Stanley's reactions to the whole situation were hysterical, and Creed is just great. He deserves some more airtime." ...|$|E
5000|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{gave the}} episode a great review: [...] "Tonight's Once proved yet {{again that the}} show is at its strongest when it's {{propelled}} by its primary cast instead of the current 'theme.' Regina, Rumple, and Belle all had beautiful scenes that were well performed, {{and it was a}} <b>nice</b> twist <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Belle stand up for herself and go to the extreme of banishing Rumple. That alone makes for an interesting back half of the season; let's keep our fingers crossed and hope the Queens of Darkness don't screw things up." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 8.8 rating out of 10.|$|R
6000|$|TUESDAY. - I {{have been}} <b>to</b> <b>Nice</b> to-day <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dr. Bennet; {{he agrees with}} Clark {{that there is no}} disease; but I {{finished}} up my day with a lamentable exhibition of weakness. I could not remember French, or at least I was afraid to go into any place lest I should not be able to remember it, and so could not tell when the train went. At last I crawled up to the station {{and sat down on the}} steps, and just steeped myself there in the sunshine until the evening began to fall and the air to grow chilly. This long rest put me all right; and I came home here triumphantly and ate dinner well. [...] There is the full, true, and particular account of the worst day I have had since I left London.

30|$|George Schaller {{has made}} twenty-six {{trips to the}} Chang Tang, as well as {{numerous}} trips in eastern Tibet, {{and it would have}} been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> a large, foldout map of his combined journeys on the Tibetan Plateau, like those that were often included in the books by 19 th century explorers of Tibet. But that is only a minor critique of a very informative account of three decades of observing wildlife and wild landscapes on the Tibetan Plateau. In conclusion, Tibet Wild is a fascinating book of a little known part of the world. It should be read by anyone interested in the Tibetan Plateau. Field biologists, range ecologists, pastoral development specialists, tourists and even Tibetan monks will all find something of interest in Schaller’s evocative writing.|$|R
500|$|Musical {{performances}} received mixed reviews. Flandez {{deemed the}} cover of [...] "Keep Holding On" [...] an [...] "emotionally satisfying showstopper", however was critical of Quinn's cover of [...] "You Keep Me Hangin On", which he called [...] "thin and jarring". Mitchell enjoyed the [...] "No Air" [...] duet, however felt it would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> characters besides Finn and Rachel take the lead on the majority of songs. Reviewing musical performances in the series so far on October 21, 2009, Denise Martin for the Los Angeles Times rated [...] "Hate On Me" [...] the fourth best performance to date, writing that Riley: [...] "blew [...] away." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide also named the rendition one of Glee best performances, describing it as [...] "a real Beyoncé moment". Aly Semigran of MTV observed that Quinn spontaneously bursting into song brought Glee [...] "dangerously close to High School Musical territory".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attracted}} near universal acclaim. The Spooks producers regard [...] "Nuclear Strike" [...] as one {{of their}} favourites in the series. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian reacted positively to the episode, stating [...] "it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> MI5 locking horns with the Russians again. Maybe the Spooks people just got bored with Islamic terrorism, so they did what they had to do: they restarted the cold war. A bold move, but an admirable one." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph placed the episode as a [...] "critic's choice," [...] calling it a [...] "superb season closer," [...] and [...] "all terrifically exciting." [...] O'Donovan also said of the episode's settings; [...] "the streets and Underground tunnels of London have rarely been used to such climactic effect – with great performances from everyone involved." [...] He also complimented it for setting up a [...] "great cliffhanger ending that will leave fans absolutely gagging for the next series." ...|$|E
500|$|Melora Hardin's return {{garnered}} critical attention. Forcella {{wrote that}} [...] "Jan {{was definitely a}} welcome appearance". Furthermore, he praised her [...] "all-around meanness" [...] and the [...] "hilarity of her singing". Houx wrote that [...] "the return of Jan Levinson and the final solution to get her business was pretty good." [...] Adams, on the other hand, was critical of the return of Hardin, noting that [...] "there's little reason to justify Melora Hardin's presence in 'The Whale other than [...] "an obligation [...] The Offices final-season victory lap." [...] White noted that it [...] "was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Melora Hardin in the role one last time", but wrote that [...] "it's a shame that the show is sticking with the crazy version of the character rather than mellowing her out a bit". Melora Hardin's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an [...] "Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series" [...] Emmy consideration.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Garner from TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 4.3/5 {{saying that it}} was a good finale, giving answers to many {{questions}} that some were around since the [...] "Pilot" [...] but also leaving us with many ones to ponder. [...] "When all was said and done, only the Irisa question really struck me as a cliffhanger. We've been dealing with that damn medallion and [...] "what’s in the mine" [...] for the entire season, so it would have been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> her in control of it or something at the end. But, that aside, it was a good finale. I’m happy with how the episode moved, and I adored Nolan for wanting to do the right thing by having Amanda fire him instead of trying to fight the propaganda fight Datak was staging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very <b>nice</b> {{and pretty}} <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> but I don't {{know what people}} will say when she goes into society {{with the rest of}} us.

6000|$|The {{argument}} of excited expectation and consequent hallucination {{does not apply}} to Mr. Hamilton Aïdé and M. Alphonse Karr, neither of whom was a man of science.

Karr and Mr. Aïdé were two of a party in a spacious brilliantly lighted salon, where Home received them. A large heavy table, remote from their group, moved towards them. M. Karr then got under a table which rose in air, and carefully examined the space beneath, while Mr. Aïdé observed it from above. Neither of them could discover any explanation of the phenomenon, and they walked away together, disgusted, disappointed, and reviling Home.[7] ...|$|R
