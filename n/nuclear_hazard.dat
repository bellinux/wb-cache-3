We have been developing a powered exoskeleton {{that is supposed}} to be used in case of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>hazard.</b> Conventional powered exoskeletons typically use electromyographs (EMG), force switches, or force sensors on the wear's feet. Unfortunately, the former suffers from the decline in measuring accuracy or slips of EMG sensor by sweating. The force-switch-based assist control method has a difficulty in speedy assist control of walk because it needs a few steps of a walk for the recognition. The force-sensorbased assist control method realizes a rapid assist control but the assistive motion is defined beforehand in general. We propose a new approach for power assist controller based on user motion prediction using 9 axis motion sensor. The motion sensor detects the angle and angular velocity of the wear's limb and estimates the appropriate angle of the powered attachment according to the estimated motion. This report conducts experiments with one degree of freedom powered arm to evaluate the proposed method by EMG sensors and a force sensor...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{proliferation}} of cyber-physical systems, ranging from autonomous cars to <b>nuclear</b> <b>hazard</b> inspection robots, has exposed several challenging research problems on automated fault detection and recovery. This paper considers how recently developed formal synthesis and model verification techniques {{may be used}} to automatically generate information-seeking trajectories for anomaly detection. In particular, we consider the problem of how a robot could select its actions so as to maximally disambiguate between different model hypotheses that govern the environment it operates in or its interaction with other agents whose prime motivation is a priori unknown. The identification problem is posed as selection of the most likely model from a set of candidates, where each candidate is an adversarial Markov decision process (MDP) together with a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula that constrains robot-environment interaction. An adversarial MDP is an MDP in which transitions depend on both a (controlled) robot action and an (uncontrolled) adversary action. States are labeled, thus allowing interpretation of satisfaction of LTL formulae, which have a special form admitting satisfaction decisions in bounded time. An example where a robotic car must discern whether neighboring vehicles are following its trajectory for a surveillance operation is used to demonstrate our approach...|$|E

However, it is not known whether these efforts to inform and prepare the proximal residents for a general emergency have been effective or not. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the level of knowledge of and preparedness for an emergency exhibited by residents of Ward 23. Data was collected through the distribution of semi-structured questionnaires to 204 residents at the study site to ascertain their views on the provision and accessibility of emergency information and to find out whether they utilised this information to prepare themselves. The results revealed that the majority of interviewed residents had very poor knowledge concerning emergency procedures, and few had made any effort to prepare themselves. The majority of better-informed and prepared residents tended to reside closer to KNPS. The poor levels of knowledge and preparedness are attributed to residents’ lack of awareness concerning the availability of information, misconceptions regarding a <b>nuclear</b> <b>hazard</b> and a general emergency event or a lack of incentive to inform themselves due to a perceived high sense of security and the improbability of such an event occurring.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} Nordic {{embassies}} in Tokyo and the different ways in which theym chose to respond to the nuclear crisis following the massive earthquake and tsunami off the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan, on March 11, 2011. Although the embassies technically were subject to the same level of threat, their individual crisis responses have exhibited varying levels of precaution. For example, while the Swedish and Danish embassies remained fully operational in Tokyo, the Norwegian and Finnish embassies relocated most or all of their staff to provisional operations further away from the <b>nuclear</b> <b>hazard.</b> As a researcher in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), the wide display of responses raises an interesting question concerning the basic circumstances of nuclear risk, for how can the same circumstances generate such different scientific assessments and management strategies? What underlying considerations particular to the individual embassy can explain the Nordic variation in crisis responses? In accordance with the teachings of Dorothy Nelkin, the uncertain nature of nuclear radiation compounds the difficulties of risk assessment and leaves considerable scope for subjective factors to enter both scientific interpretations and public perceptions. With regard to the Nordic crisis responses, it becomes clear that various political, reputational, and economic interests have influenced the different outcomes. Yet, as it turns out, even coinciding interests may produce differing risk evaluations. By way of a methodical application of Cultural Theory (c. f. Mary Douglas et al.), this study shows how embassy diplomats with few personal ties to their Japanese communities have been more prone to opt for a higher degree of precaution, i. e. embassy relocation, than those more integrated in Japanese society. The interesting angle of a Nordic-specific comparison (as opposed to, say, a comparison between the Norwegian and Japanese crisis responses) {{is the fact that it}} becomes hard to argue “Culture” as the main explanatory factor behind the differences. As the thesis demonstrates, concerns about risk may depend less on culture at large than on social, contextual, or political biases...|$|E

40|$|In a paper {{presented}} to the Twenty-Second Actuarial Research Conference, held in 1987 at the University of Toronto, a notation and mathematical model were developed to explore the impact of <b>nuclear</b> holocaust <b>hazard</b> on actuarial mathematics. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to consider this hazard in relation to long-term income maintenance systems such as Social Security and retirement plans. The paper begins with a brief recollection of the notations used in the Toronto paper. It then highlights the actuarial projections of the 1988 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of U. S. Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds. This is a very large system with current annual outgo $ 220 billion, and rapidly growing assets. Under the less optimistic of two intermediate projections, the combined trust funds are estimated to reach a level of $ 12 trillion by the end of 2030. Thereafter, the funds are projected to decline rapidly to exhaustion by 2050. A simple difference equation, in the notation of the Toronto paper, is examined as a possible means of controlling the upward and downward changes in the trust funds if Congress periodically adjusts OASDI financing to satisfy the equation. Next sections of the paper consider what recognition of <b>nuclear</b> holocaust <b>hazard</b> would mean for pension mathematics. The easiest situation to discuss is in regard to reserves for retired members and beneficiaries. A second matter is the calculation of optional retirement annuities, and could entail much numerical work. The funding for active members will bring up many questions, in particular, in regard to the actuarial assumptions. In concluding sections, the paper attempts to measure the scientific worth of recognizing <b>nuclear</b> holocaust <b>hazard</b> in our actuarial mathematics, and the consequences thereof. One keeps coming back to the idea that the only practical way to recognize such hazard is by a specific component of the interest rate. Thereby, long-term financial transactions can proceed quite logically even {{in the presence of the}} hazard. But one essential step for world progress is to minimize <b>nuclear</b> holocaust <b>hazard.</b> To aid this process, actuarial science should seek its truths, and communicate them widely...|$|R
