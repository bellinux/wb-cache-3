5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E
5|$|Other Russian {{forces were}} more {{successful}} {{to the north}} of the town, where they managed to capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially driven off. However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to that point, and had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After the barrage ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a bayonet charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> the Russians fled.|$|E

Captain Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> hoisted the Romanian flag and then allowed the ship to enter the inner harbor. Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that the Potemkins Kingston valves be opened so Potemkin would sink to the bottom.|$|E

5|$|The defences of Saborsko {{were first}} {{breached}} at <b>noon,</b> <b>and</b> the attacking force reached {{the centre of}} the village at 3:30p.m. According to SAO Krajina sources, resistance was light, with the defending force estimated to consist of only 150 armed troops. The village was secured by 5p.m. with tanks attached to the attacking force withdrawn by 6p.m. The assault resulted in the death of 50 Croatian troops, while the attacking forces suffered only four wounded. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} fighting to control Saborsko, the village was looted and many houses were torched.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, <b>noon,</b> <b>and</b> evening) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting the <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor}} who {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E

5|$|Further west, {{supporting}} {{attacks were}} to be launched by the 13th Division, with the 15th Infantry Regiment (IR) assaulting across the Ancre towards the front line held by the 106th Brigade between Dernancourt and Buire-sur-l'Ancre and then exploiting success by driving west towards the village of Ribemont-sur-Ancre, and the 13th IR attacking the 104th Brigade at Marrett Wood. The German artillery preparation was to start at 05:15 on 28 March, with the assault to begin at 06:00. During the night of 27/28 March, {{the commander of the}} German 2nd Army apparently came to the same conclusion as the regimental commanders of the 50th Reserve Division, as at 03:00 he ordered the attack to be delayed until <b>noon,</b> <b>and</b> later further postponed it, but the orders did not reach the divisions in time.|$|E
5|$|In Evansville, Indiana, Mission Broadcasting {{acquired}} then-independent station WTVW (now a CW affiliate) in 2011 {{with its}} former owner Nexstar Broadcasting retaining operational duties under an SSA. WTVW consolidated news operations with ABC affiliate WEHT, for which Nexstar traded WTVW to Mission {{in exchange for}} acquiring WEHT from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation, and had its newscast output reduced through the reductions of its weekday morning newscast from four hours to two and its 6:00p.m. newscast – except on Sundays, where it remained one hour – from one hour to 30 minutes (leaving only a two-hour morning newscast, half-hour <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> 6:30p.m. newscasts and an hour-long newscast at 9:00p.m.).

5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for {{blood levels of}} the hormone cortisol—which is used to {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at <b>noon</b> <b>and</b> in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E
