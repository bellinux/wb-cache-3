5000|$|Neighbourhoods {{have been}} the site of service {{delivery}} or [...] "service interventions" [...] in part as efforts to provide local, quality services, and to increase the degree of local control and ownership. Alfred Kahn, {{as early as the}} mid-1970s, described the [...] "experience, theory and fads" [...] of <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>service</b> delivery over the prior decade, including discussion of income transfers and poverty. Neighbourhoods, as a core aspect of community, also are the site of services for youth, including children with disabilities and coordinated approaches to low-income populations. While the term neighbourhood organisation is not as common in 2015, these organisations often are non-profit, sometimes grassroots or even core funded community development centres or branches.|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{significance}} of age-friendly environments towards quality of life among older adults have been limited. This study aimed to examine the association between age-friendly environments {{and quality of life}} among Thai older adults. Cross-sectional interview survey data were collected from 4183 older adults (≥ 60 years) using multistage stratified systematic sampling from all four regions in Thailand. The outcome variable was the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) scale, while independent variables included sociodemographic factors, having a health problem, and neighbourhood age-friendly environment variables. In multivariable logistic regression, significant age-friendly environments predictors of quality of life included walkable neighbourhood, neighbourhood aesthetics, <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>service</b> accessibility, neighbourhood criminal safety, neighbourhood social trust, neighbourhood social support, and neighbourhood social cohesion. The present study confirms the important role of age-friendly neighbourhoods in terms of physical and social environments towards {{the quality of life of}} older adults...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the neighbourhood built environment on trajectories of depression symptom episodes in adults from the general Canadian population. We used 10 years of data collection (2000 / 01 - 2010 / 11) from the Canadian National Population Health Study (n = 7114). Episodes of depression symptoms were identified using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form. We assessed the presence of local parks, healthy food stores, fast food restaurants, health services and cultural services using geospatial data. We used latent class growth modelling to identify different trajectories of depression symptom episodes in the sample and tested for the effect of neighbourhood variables on the trajectories over time. We uncovered three distinct trajectories of depression symptom episodes: low prevalence (76. 2 % of the sample), moderate prevalence (19. 2 %) and high prevalence of depression symptom episodes (2. 8 %). The presence of any <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>service</b> (healthy food store, fast-food restaurant, health service, except for cultural service) was significantly associated with a lower probability of a depression symptom episode for those following a trajectory of low prevalence of depression symptom episodes. The presence of a local park was also a significant protective factor in trajectory groups with both low and moderate prevalence of depression symptom episodes. Neighbourhood characteristics did not significantly affect the trajectory of high prevalence of depression symptom episodes. For individuals following a trajectory of low and moderate prevalence of depression symptom episodes, the neighbourhood built environment was associated with a shift in the trajectory of depression symptom episodes. Future intervention studies are recommended to make policy recommendations...|$|E

The importance of built environment attributes for walking is known, but few studies of older adults have examined neighbourhood destinations and none have investigated access to specific, objectively-measured commercial destinations and walking. Methods We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the Western Australian state government’s health surveillance survey for those aged 65 – 84 years and living in the Perth metropolitan region from 2003 – 2009 (n[*]=[*] 2, 918). Individual-level road network service areas were generated at 400 m and 800 m distances, and {{the presence or absence}} of six commercial destination types within the <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>service</b> areas identified (food retail, general retail, medical care services, financial services, general services, and social infrastructure). Adjusted logistic regression models examined access to and mix of commercial destination types within neighbourhoods for associations with self-reported walking behaviour. Results On average, the sample was aged 72. 9 years (SD[*]=[*] 5. 4), and was predominantly female (55. 9 %) and married (62. 0 %). Overall, 66. 2 % reported some weekly walking and 30. 8 % reported sufficient walking (≥ 150 min/week). Older adults with access to general services within 400 m (OR[*]=[*] 1. 33, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 07 - 1. 66) and 800 m (OR[*]=[*] 1. 20, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 02 - 1. 42), and social infrastructure within 800 m (OR[*]=[*] 1. 19, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 01 - 1. 40) were more likely to engage in some weekly walking. Access to medical care services within 400 m (OR[*]=[*] 0. 77, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 63 - 0. 93) and 800 m (OR[*]=[*] 0. 83, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 70 - 0. 99) reduced the odds of sufficient walking. Access to food retail, general retail, financial services, and the mix of commercial destination types within the neighbourhood were all unrelated to walking. Conclusions The types of neighbourhood commercial destinations that encourage older adults to walk appear to differ slightly from those reported for adult samples. Destinations that facilitate more social interaction, for example eating at a restaurant or church involvement, or provide opportunities for some incidental social contact, for example visiting the pharmacy or hairdresser, were the strongest predictors for walking among seniors in this study.

5000|$|The 'Association for Public Service Excellence' (Apse) {{published}} a report claiming largescale funding cuts {{and differences between}} authorities were “changing {{the very nature of}} local government.” Universal services which are core functions of Local Authorities were being dismantled. “These services need defending in their own right as part of wider defence of local government as a whole.” Deprived areas experienced the greatest fall in spending, 'food and water safety inspection, road safety and school crossings, community centres and services aimed at cutting crime - such as CCTV - and support for local bus services' were among areas cut. <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>services</b> have been cut against a framework of unparalleled cuts in local government spending as a proportion of the economy. In 2010-11, it amounted to 8.4% of the economy, but fell to 6.7% by 2015-16. By 2020-21, it is projected to be down to 5.7%, a 60-year low. Cuts to social care received more attention but the <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>services,</b> including highways and transport, cultural services, environmental services and planning, has been cut far more severely according to the report. Paul O'Brien of Apse said: “In eight years, local government spending will have dropped from two thirds of that of central government's to half. There is a slow but very harmful dismantling of <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>services</b> that marks a profound change in what local public services our communities can expect to receive. From emptying bins to running swimming pools to providing high quality local parks, spending on these services which communities really value has been cut harder and faster than any other area of public service spend. Centrally driven austerity has fallen hardest on local shoulders.” ...|$|R
