50|$|Germany has the world's oldest <b>national</b> social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system, with origins {{dating back}} to Otto von Bismarck's Sickness Insurance Law of 1883. In Britain, the National Insurance Act 1911 {{included}} <b>national</b> social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> for primary care (not specialist or hospital care), initially for about {{one third of the}} population—employed working class wage earners, but not their dependents. This system of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> continued in force until the creation of the <b>National</b> <b>Health</b> Service in 1948 which created a universal service, funded out of general taxation rather than on an insurance basis, and providing health services to all legal residents.|$|R
5|$|In February 1971, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of Medicaid for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long.

Diefenbaker promised to expand the <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The <b>National</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
