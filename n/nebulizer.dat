40|$|For over a century, <b>nebulizers</b> {{have been}} {{commonly}} used to deliver aerosolized medications {{in the treatment of}} patients with pulmonary diseases. They are the aerosol device of choice when patients can not coordinate inhalation and actuation needed {{for the use of the}} pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) or are not able to provide the necessary inspiratory flow required by the dry powder inhaler (DPI) for effective aerosol drug delivery. Three types of <b>nebulizers</b> exist: (1) jet <b>nebulizers,</b> (2) ultrasonic <b>nebulizers,</b> and (3) mesh <b>nebulizers.</b> The purpose of this paper is to explain the types of <b>nebulizers</b> available on the market and to evaluate their efficiencies in aerosol drug delivery while suggesting strategies for the optimal treatment of patients with pulmonary diseases...|$|R

25|$|Salbutamol (albuterol), a β2-selective catecholamine, is {{administered}} by <b>nebulizer</b> (e.g. 10–20mg). This medication also lowers blood levels of K+ by promoting its movement into cells.|$|E
25|$|Fog (usually {{from water}} particles) is created with an {{ultrasonic}} piezoelectric <b>nebulizer.</b> The fog is transported inside the wind tunnel (preferably of the closed circuit and closed test section type). An electrically heated grid is inserted before the test section, which evaporates the water particles at its vicinity, thus forming fog sheets. The fog sheets function as streamlines over the test model when illuminated by a light sheet.|$|E
25|$|Salbutamol, {{also known}} as albuterol and marketed as Ventolin among other names, is a {{medication}} that opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs. It is used to treat asthma including asthma attacks, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). It may also be used to treat high blood potassium levels. Salbutamol is usually used with an inhaler or <b>nebulizer</b> but is also available as a pill and intravenous solution. Onset of action of the inhaled version is typically within 15 minutes and lasts for two to six hours.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundContaminated <b>nebulizers</b> are a {{potential}} source of bacterial infection but no single method is universally accepted for disinfection. We hypothesized that baby-bottle steam sterilizers effectively disinfect home <b>nebulizers.</b> MethodsHome <b>nebulizers</b> were inoculated with the common CF respiratory pathogens methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, mucoid and non mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The <b>nebulizers</b> were swabbed for bacterial growth, treated with either the AVENT (Philips), the NUK Quick & Ready (Gerber) or DRY-POD (Camera Baby) baby bottle steam sterilizer and reswabbed for bacterial growth. ResultsAll steam sterilizers were effective at disinfecting all home <b>nebulizers.</b> Viable bacteria were not recovered from any inoculated site after steam treatment, under any conditions tested. ConclusionsSteam treatment is an effective disinfection method. Additional {{studies are needed to}} confirm whether these results are applicable to the clinical setting...|$|R

25|$|There {{are some}} ESI methods that require {{little to no}} sample preparation. One such method is a method termed {{extractive}} electrospray ionization (EESI). This method involves having an electrospray of solvent directed at an angle against a different spray of the sample solution, produced by a separate <b>nebulizer.</b> This method requires no sample preparation in that the electrospray of solvent extracts the sample from the complex mixture, effectively removing any background contaminants. Another particularly powerful variation on ESI is desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which involves directing an electrospray at a surface with the sample deposited on top of it. The sample is ionized in the electrospray as it splashes off the surface, then traveling to the mass spectrometer. This method is important {{because of the fact}} that no sample preparation is needed for this method. A sample simply needs to be deposited on a surface, such as paper. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is similar to ESI in that the sample is nebulized in droplets that are then evaporated, leaving behind a charged ion to be analyzed. APCI experiences few of the negative matrix effects experienced by ESI due to the fact that ionization occurs in the gas phase in this method rather than the within the liquid droplets as in ESI and the fact that in APCI there is an overabundance of reaction gas, thus minimizing the effect of the matrix on the ionization process.|$|E
25|$|Morphine can {{be taken}} orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally or epidurally and inhaled via a <b>nebulizer.</b> As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of normorphine, codeine, and hydromorphone. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E
2500|$|The direct liquid {{introduction}} (DLI) interface {{was developed}} in 1980. This interface was thought {{as a solution to}} the evaporation of liquid inside the capillary inlet interface. In DLI, a <b>nebulizer</b> was used to disintegrate part of the effluent coming from the column. A small diaphragm was used to form a liquid jet composed of small droplets that were subsequently dried in a desolvation chamber. A microbore capillary column was used to transfer the nebulized liquid product to the MS ion source. The analytes were ionized using a solvent assisted chemical ionization source, where the LC solvents acted as reagent gases.To use this interface, it was necessary to split the flow coming out of the LC column because {{only a small portion of}} the effluent (10 to 50 μl/min out of 1 ml/min) could be [...] analyzed on-line without breaking the MS vacuum. One of the main operational problems of the DLI interface was the frequent clogging of the diaphragm orifices. The DLI interface was used between 1982 and 1985 for the analysis of pesticides, corticosteroids, metabolites in equine urine, erythromycin, and vitamin B12. However, this interface was replaced by the thermospray interface, which removed the flow rate limitations and the issues with the clogging diaphragms.|$|E

40|$|Forteen commercially {{available}} jet and ultrasonic <b>nebulizers</b> were investigated {{with the aim}} to select the most suitable type of apparatus for the inhalation of a 10 % tobramycin solution. Two different techniques for measurement of particle size distribution were evaluated: laser diffraction and cascade impactor analysis. The final selection of the <b>nebulizers</b> is based on particle size distribution, output and stable performance during nebulization. All 14 <b>nebulizers</b> (eight jet and six ultrasonic) were filled with a solution of 10 % m/v tobramycin (as sulphate) in water. The volume in the tested devices ranged from 4. 5 to 10 ml (= 450 - 1000 mg tobramycin) {{in accordance with the}} prescribed usage by the suppliers. The <b>nebulizers</b> were connected with a special designed adapter to a laser diffraction analyser in order to measure particle size distribution of the aerosol. Inhalation was simulated with a static flow of 40 l/min. The particle size distribution (expressed as X- 10, X- 50, and X- 90) was determined after 10 s, 1. 5, 3, 4. 5, 6, 9 and 12 min of nebulization. Furthermore, the tobramycin solutions were assayed for tobramycin content before and after nebulization. For all <b>nebulizers,</b> the mean particle size distribution, depicted as X- 50, was within the range of 1 - 5 mm. There were no relevant differences between the <b>nebulizers</b> in concentration or particle size distribution during nebulization. The output of the <b>nebulizers</b> is a result of both nebulization and evaporation. The output, expressed as volume of tobramycin solution, ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 50 ml/min. The output of tobramycin ranged from 1. 2 to 39. 5 mg/min. For clinical practice 300 - 600 mg have to be nebulized within 20 - 30 min. Lt was concluded that only three jet <b>nebulizers</b> [Porta-Neb Sidestream (PNS), Porta-Neb Ventstream (PNV) and Pariboy Pari LC + (PLC) ] have a reasonable output and an acceptable particle size distribution for the administration of a 10 % tobramycin solution in the therapeutic dosage range.
