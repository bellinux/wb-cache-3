5|$|Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a {{significant}} political battle in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral {{rights and the}} associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, and not the British crown, had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered mining rights, but the BSAC had stopped administering <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory {{had a right to}} the royalties, and petitioned the governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.|$|E
5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia.</b> Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E
5|$|The Copperbelt {{strike of}} May 1935 was a strike by African mineworkers in the Copperbelt Province of <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> (now Zambia) on 29 May 1935 to protest taxes levied by the British colonial administration. The strike {{involved}} {{three of the}} province's four major copper mines: those in Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. Near the latter, six protesters were killed by police and the strike ended. Although it failed, the strike was the first organized industrial agitation in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and is viewed by some as the first overt action against colonial rule. It {{caught the attention of}} a number of African townsmen, leading to the creation of trade unions and African nationalist politics, and is seen as the birth of African nationalism.|$|E
50|$|The Mines African Staff Association (MASA) was a Northern Rhodesian {{trade union}} which existed between 1953 and 1967. It {{represented}} black African salaried employees in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> mining industry.|$|R
25|$|In June 1961, Chona {{was elected}} National Secretary of UNIP and he {{remained}} in that post for eight years. He was instrumental in securing the short-lived coalition between UNIP and the ANC in January 1963. In January 1964, Kaunda formed <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> first Black cabinet, and gave Chona the post of Minister of Justice in UNIP's pre-independence government.|$|R
50|$|In June 1956, <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> Governor, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote {{a highly}} {{confidential}} letter heavily criticising the federation in general (and {{the new constitution}} planned for it) and Federal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky, in particular. Nearly two years later, Huggins (now Lord Malvern) somehow obtained {{a copy of it}} and disclosed its contents to Welensky.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of World War I (also known as the First World War or the Great War), Southern Rhodesia was {{administered}} by the British South Africa Company, which had controlled it and <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The white population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government, which would make Southern Rhodesia a self-governing colony within the British Empire. Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910. Following {{the intervention of the}} war, the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Southern Rhodesia {{entered into}} a federal union with <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Upon union, a blue ensign with a unified badge was adopted to replace the {{respective}} previous flags. Southern Rhodesia was represented in the federation's flag by a red lion {{that had previously been}} on their old flag.|$|E
5|$|After Congo-LÃ©opoldville gained {{independence}} in 1960, it collapsed {{into a state}} of anarchy within a fortnight. The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the federation. Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia,</b> where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E
50|$|In June 1961, Chona {{was elected}} National Secretary of UNIP and he {{remained}} in that post for eight years. He was instrumental in securing the short-lived coalition between UNIP and the ANC in January 1963.

50|$|The NRR {{fought in}} World War II in Somaliland, Madagascar, the Middle East and Burma. Between 1953 and 1963, during the Federation with Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, it made {{up part of}} the Federal armed forces. On <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> {{independence}} as Zambia in 1964, the NRR was renamed the Zambia Regiment and integrated into the new Zambian Defence Force.|$|R
50|$|A {{two-stage}} election held in October and December 1962 {{resulted in}} an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties. The council passed resolutions calling for <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new National Assembly based on a broader, more democratic franchise.|$|R
5|$|During {{the meeting}} in Kolwezi, Tshombe had ordered all {{remaining}} Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate {{what remained of the}} Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1953, in {{the face}} of African opposition, Britain {{consolidated}} the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland (Malawi) in the ill-fated Central African Federation, which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing African nationalism and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland, however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} affairs {{the most dramatic}} event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Douglas-Home, clearly moved, broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
50|$|In Ndola {{incumbent}} member Kennedy Harris, a businessman, {{was challenged}} by Herbert Walsh, a trade unionist. In the two-member Livingstone and Western constituency, incumbents Leopold Moore (owner of <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> only newspaper, The Livingstone Mail) and F H Lowe (an accountant and mayor of Livingstone) were challenged by former Livingstone mayor C S Knight and Deputy mayor F D Law.|$|R
50|$|Shiwa Ngandu's {{remoteness}} {{and isolation}} from white settler society in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> southern half and in Southern Rhodesia gave Gore-Browne {{a perspective on}} black Africans which led him to believe the country should develop in a more collaborative direction than the settler-ruled and segregationist Southern Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa. He involved himself in politics as detailed in his biographical article.|$|R
5|$|The {{first few}} years of the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|R
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded {{as something of}} a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> gained independence as Zambia). After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped into recession {{with the end of the}} federation).|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Welensky found {{employment}} with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman, while putting his physical strength to work as a boxer. He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive engine driver and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia.</b> In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.|$|E
25|$|Cecil Rhodes {{got over}} any {{disappointment}} at losing the scramble for Katanga by {{doing what he}} did best â he invested in mineral prospecting and mining in Katanga. When the British in the Rhodesian territories realised in the 1920s the extent of Katanga's mineral wealth, which {{was more than the}} equal of <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> own Copperbelt, the most polite epithet for Captain Stairs was 'mercenary', and some regarded him as a traitor to the British Empire.|$|R
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> first {{commemorative}} stamps were {{a set of}} five on 30 May 1953, {{marking the}} birth centennial of Cecil Rhodes, along with another stamp issued {{on the same day}} for the Rhodes Centenary Exhibition. As Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom was already on the throne, the stamps included her profile, even though the official coronation stamp did not come out until 2 June. This was followed in September by a definitive series using the same design as before, with the monarch's profile updated once again.|$|R
5000|$|Gore-Browne's {{political}} career began in 1935, {{when he was}} elected to <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> legislative council. Gore-Browne represented one of seven constituencies of voters. He disagreed with British colonial âtrusteeship' and, instead, looked to a future 'partnership'. He thought settlers ought to have a larger share in government, but also argued for the interdependence of [...] "white and black" [...] prosperity. Unlike other white politicians, such as his friend Roy Welensky, a trade union leader, Gore-Browne felt no threat from African social and educational advance, and the consequent addition of qualified voters to the electoral roll.|$|R
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895â96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans {{had been doing}} the same with Labour. A British general {{election}} was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best {{to the idea of}} federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only {{with the support of the}} Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E
5|$|Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner {{mother and}} a Lithuanian Jewish father, he moved to <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia,</b> became {{involved}} with the trade unions, and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under white self-government, the former under the colonial office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded {{in the formation of}} the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to apartheid South Africa.|$|E

5000|$|In 1937 Clark {{became the}} curator of <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia's</b> Rhodes-Livingstone Museum (now known as the Livingstone Memorial Museum). A year later he married Betty Cable nee Baume, who would {{accompany}} him {{on a number of}} expeditions throughout his life. Clark served in the military during World War II with the East Africa Command forces in Somalia and Ethiopia, being subsequently attached to the British Military Administration, when he managed to find time to carry out archaeological fieldwork in the Horn of Africa. Following the war, he returned to Cambridge, completing his Ph.D. in 1947. In 1948 he founded the Northern Rhodesian National Monuments Commission.|$|R
5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would {{foot the bill for}} the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916âthe Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Officeârecruitment began in May.|$|E
5|$|Copperbelt was a {{province}} in <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> which was rich in deposits of the mineral. Cecil John Rhodes, a British capitalist and empire builder, {{was the leading}} light of British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and how to improve river navigation in the region; during this trek, Burnham discovered large copper deposits along the Kafue River. Rhodes brought British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs through questionable treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 by the United Kingdom and Portugal, fixed the boundary between territories administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) in North-Eastern Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique. It also fixed {{the boundary between the}} BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia) and Portuguese Angola, although the boundary with Angola was not marked on the ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North-Eastern Rhodesia and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed in an 1890 Anglo-German treaty which also fixed the (very short) boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by an 1894 treaty, although minor adjustments were made until the 1930s. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern Rhodesia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and the boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia became the Zambezi River in 1898. <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> was under BSAC control until 1924, when it became part of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947âhe {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside <b>Northern</b> <b>Rhodesia</b> and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
