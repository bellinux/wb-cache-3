It is said to have 13,000 hydrophones, many times the <b>number</b> <b>fitted</b> in previous Royal Navy systems and more than any other submarine sonar in the world. A key development is the use of high performance and easily upgradeable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processing systems, allowing the introduction of much more sophisticated algorithms compared to earlier sonars. The processing power of the system is said to be equivalent to 60,000 home PCs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{deals with}} the {{compound}} nonlinear congruential method for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers, which has been introduced recently. Equidistribution properties of the generated sequences over parts of the period are studied, based on the discrepancy of the corresponding point sets. Upper and lower bounds for the average value of these discrepancies are established, which are essentially best possible. These {{results show that the}} average equidistribution behavior of compound nonlinear congruential pseudorandom <b>numbers</b> <b>fits</b> well the equidistribution properties of true random numbers. The method of proof relies heavily on estimates of the average value of incomplete exponential sums. 1...|$|R
