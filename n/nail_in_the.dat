5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century.

30|$|From the outset, we {{supported}} {{the idea of}} early intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures. In our series, 97 % of the patients were treated with reamed femoral <b>nails</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 24 Â h [33]. The use of titanium nails was preferred, from the modulus of elasticity being closer to bone and, fatigue, yield and tensile strength higher than other implants.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this article}} was to {{determine}} the effects of minimally invasive percutaneous plates versus interlocking intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of tibial shaft fractures in adults. METHOD: Literature searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Literature database, the CNKI database, Wanfang Data, and the Weipu Journal database were performed up to August 2013. Only randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the use of percutaneous plates and interlocking intramedullary nails for tibial shaft fractures were included. Data collection and extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were performed according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: Eleven trials were included. Compared with interlocking intramedullary nailing, minimally invasive percutaneous plates shortened fracture healing time and resulted in lower rates of postoperative delayed union and pain. There was no significant difference between the two methods with regard to the rates of excellent and good Johner-Wruh scoring, the rate of reoperation, and other complications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, insufficient evidence exists regarding the effects of minimally invasive percutaneous plates versus interlocking intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of tibial shaft fractures in adults. Low-quality evidence suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous plates could shorten fracture healing time, decrease the rate of postoperative delayed union, and decrease pain levels compared with interlocking intramedullary nailing. There is no significant difference between <b>the</b> two groups <b>in</b> terms of functional recovery scores, reoperation, and other complications. Further research that includes high-quality randomized controlled, multicenter trials is required to compare the effects of minimally invasive percutaneous plates versus interlocking intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of tibial shaft fractures in adults...|$|R

25|$|The {{remaining}} {{provinces of}} Mali freed themselves {{one by one}} giving rise to 5 small kingdoms.

By 1600 the Denianke controlled all the area from the Sahel to Futa Jallon and over the upper Senegal.

25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the {{shear forces}} {{applied to the}} building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.|$|E

25|$|PiÅsudski's {{seizure of}} Vilnius in October 1920 (known as Å»eligowski's Mutiny) was a <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffin of the already poor PolishâLithuanian {{relations}} {{that had been}} strained by the PolishâLithuanian War of 1919â20; both states would remain hostile to one another {{for the remainder of}} the interwar period. PiÅsudski's planned Intermarium (an East European federation of states inspired by the tradition of the multiethnic PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth that would include a hypothetical multinational successor state to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and thus became incompatible with his assumption of Polish domination and encroachment on neighboring peoples' lands and aspirations at the time of rising national movements. It soon ceased to be a feature of Poland's politics. A larger federated structure was also opposed by Dmowski's National Democrats. Their representative at the Peace of Riga talks, StanisÅaw Grabski, opted for leaving Minsk, Berdychiv, Kamianets-Podilskyi and the surrounding areas on the Soviet side of the border, since the National Democrats did not want to permit population shifts that they considered politically undesirable, especially if the transfers would result in a reduced proportion of citizens who were ethnically Polish.|$|E
25|$|After the {{foundation}} of BogotÃ¡ and {{the installation of the}} new dependency of the Spanish Crown, several strategies were important to the Spanish conquerors. The rich mineral resources of the Altiplano had to be extracted, the agriculture was quickly reformed, a system of encomiendas was installed and a main concern of the Spanish was the evangelisation of the Muisca. On October 9, 1549, Carlos V sent a royal letter to the New Kingdom directed at the priests about the necessity of population reduction of the Muisca. The indigenous people were working in the encomiendas which limited their religious conversion. To speed up the process of submittance to the Spanish reign, the mobility of the indigenous people was prohibited and the people gathered in resguardos. The formerly celebrated festivities in their religion disappeared. Specific times for the catechesis were controlled by laws, as executed in royal dictates in 1537, 1538 and 1551. The first bishop of SantafÃ©, Juan de los Barrios, ordered to destroy the temples of the Muisca and replace them with catholic churches. The last public religious ceremony of the Muisca religion was held in Ubaque on December 27, 1563. The second bishop of SantafÃ©, Luis Zapata de CÃ¡rdenas, intensified the aggressive policies against the Muisca religion and the burnings of their sacred sites. This formed the final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffin of the former polytheistic society.|$|E

METHODS: Radiographs of patients with pertrochanteric fracture of the femur treated with cephalomedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lateral position and traction table were retrospectively evaluated. For the evaluation we used the anteroposterior radiographic view of the pelvis and the lateral view of the affected side.
