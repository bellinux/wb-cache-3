40|$|UnrestrictedThe current {{designs of}} Phase I trials are {{comprehensively}} reviewed and classified by algorithm (assumption and dose-toxicity relationship) as rule based designs vs model based designs or by <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stages as one stage designs vs two stage designs. Standard 3 + 3 designs are {{most widely used}} for their practical simplicity. Through simulation study, the expected toxicity levels (ETL) at maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) are originally found to decrease monotonically from about 30 % to 0 % as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> levels increase from 3 to infinity, which solves the previously unexamined issue <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> levels that are planned in a study. We conclude that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> specified <b>dose</b> levels {{is an important factor}} affecting substantially the ETL at MTD and recommend that fewer than 20 dose levels be designated. In Standard 3 + 3 designs, target toxicity level (TTL) can not be pre-specified and toxicity response is treated as a binary indicator <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> limiting toxicity (DLT), discarding lots of valuable toxicity information. Therefore, a novel toxicity score system is proposed to measure quantitatively the overall severity of multiple toxicities of each patient, and then coupled with Isotonic Regression (IR) to create an extended isotonic design (EID) which allow pre-specification of TTL, treat toxicity response as a quasi-continuous variable, and fully utilize all toxicity information. Simulation studies and applications of EID to two real Phase I trials demonstrate that EID can always estimate an more accurate MTD with less sample size according to the exact toxicity profile while designs treating toxicity response as a binary variable can’t accomplish that. Our EID is practical, objective, model free, simple to use, and more accurate in MTD estimation so that it is of great practical value and will help to begin a new era in which toxicity response is really treated as a quasi-continuous variable...|$|R

40|$|Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease is {{associated}} with adverse cardiovascular and clinical outcomes and a reduced quality of life. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have improved anemia management and two agents are available in Canada, epoetin alfa (Eprex®) and darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®). Darbepoetin requires less frequent administration due to a longer half-life. Epoetin and darbepoetin {{are considered to be}} equally effective in achieving target hemoglobin in dialysis patients {{but it is not clear}} if there is a cost difference. There have been few head-to-head comparisons of the two ESAs; most published data is from observational switch studies. [...] An open label randomized controlled trial of intravenous darbepoetin alfa versus epoetin alfa was conducted in hemodialysis patients. Fifty patients were enrolled in the study. A dose stabilization run-in phase was followed by a 12 month active phase. ESAs and iron were dosed using a study algorithm to maintain hemoglobin within 100 - 120 g/L. The primary outcome was the cost per patient of ESA over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included deviation from target ranges in anemia indices, iron dose and cost, time and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> changes required for <b>dose</b> stabilization, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> changes in the active phase and the dose conversion ratio. [...] The median cost for epoetin over 12 months was $ 4179 (IQR $ 2416 - 5955) and for darbepoetin was $ 2303 (IQR $ 1178 - 4219) with a difference of $ 1876 (p= 0. 017). There was no significant difference in the <b>dose</b> or cost <b>of</b> iron. The median weekly iron dose was 40. 4 mg for epoetin and 41. 7 mg for darbepoetin (p= 0. 992). There were no significant differences in the anemia care targets including hemoglobin: 108. 0 g/L epoetin and 109. 8 g/L darbepoetin (p= 0. 336); serum ferritin: 848 μg/L epoetin and 726 μg/L darbepoetin (p= 0. 202); TSAT: 26. 7 % epoetin and 28. 6 % darbepoetin (p= 0. 472). [...] The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> changes and the time required to attain hemoglobin stability in the run-in phase and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> changes in the active phase were similar for both groups. The dose conversion ratio was 280 : 1 (95 % CI 197 - 362 : 1) at the end of the run-in phase, 360 : 1 (95 % CI 262 - 457 : I) at the 3 month point of the active phase and 382 : 1 (95 % CI 235 - 529 : 1) at the 6 month point of the active phase.
