Middle-sized and spare, his eyes alert in a long, Roman-nosed countenance, X walked on his neat little feet, with short steps, {{and looked at}} my collection intelligently.

Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of <b>nutbrown</b> tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders--a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the overt and covert discourses in two contemporary policy documents in England and Wales, The <b>Nutbrown</b> Review: Foundations for Quality ([DfE] Department for Education Department for Education. 2012. ‘The <b>Nutbrown</b> Review: Foundations for Quality: The Independent Review of Early Education and Childcare Qualifications. ' DFE- 00068 2012. [URL] and More Great Childcare (MGC) ([DfE] Department for Education. 2013. ‘More Great Childcare: Raising Quality and Giving Parents More Choice. ' DFE- 00002 - 2013. [URL] which advocated {{a number of}} significant changes to Early Years provision. It employs Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to ask questions about relationships between language and society, specifically how these are managed in policy documents. Drawing on Foucauldian analysis on the power behind the words and utilising [Fairclough, N. 2010. Critical Discourse Analysis: The Critical Study of Language. Harlow: Pearson Education Ltd. ] CDA, indications of underlying values and assumptions, overt and covert agendas were explored. Findings suggest a significant shift in concepts of quality, professionalism and childcare that positions the child as an investment in the future as a strong feature of the discourse within MGC as well as an increase in top-down frameworks. Both documents assert that quality and professionalism will only occur with top-down regulation and inspection. They propose a consumer market based model of practice that has implications for professionalism of the workforce and quality of children's experiences...|$|E
30|$|A {{practical}} {{reaction to}} the emphasis on home literacy practices has been the development of family literacy programmes. In such programmes, children’s caregivers are brought together {{to work on their}} own literacy, sometimes separately from their children and sometimes together with them (<b>Nutbrown</b> et al. [2005]; Timmons [2008]). Whether the children are present or not during programme sessions, the emphasis is on equipping caregivers to prepare their children for school tasks; thus they participate more in their children’s education. There is some concern that such programmes may be imposing the practices of a hegemonic social group on those that are marginalized (Dudley-Marling [2009]); but practitioners have found that provided they are sensitive to participant families’ practices and values, they can successfully bridge cultural and social barriers and the participants themselves recognize the benefits of the practices that the programmes advocate (DeBruin-Parecki [2009]; Timmons [2008]).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} concept of the {{productive}} system to identify some of the tensions between the stages of professional development of early years practitioners and the relationships between the various actors within the system of professional formation in England. In the context of the recommendations of the <b>Nutbrown</b> Review a series of challenges facing early years professionalism and the design and delivery of continuous professional development (CPD) are discussed. These include issues that relate to the predominance of external influence on the nature of early years professional knowledge, the significance of the early years setting in supporting practitioner learning and influences on workplace learning processes. Some strategies for strengthening practitioner influence over the productive system are briefly outlined, which relate specifically to how practitioners engage with the challenge of how CPD is organised and located as part of an early years professional identity...|$|E
30|$|The early EPPSE evidence, {{which has}} been {{repeatedly}} reinforced by international evidence (Melhuish et al. 2015) influenced the universal provision of a free part-time ECEC place for children from their third birthday, and this has affected {{the lives of millions}} of children. It also influenced, together with NESS evidence, the establishment of children’s centres. As EPPSE evidence accumulated further policy influence occurred (Taggart et al. 2008). The early child matters from 2003, and the 10  year childcare strategy in 2004 and 2009, contain references to EPPSE evidence that clearly influenced the proposals in these documents, as well as the <b>Nutbrown</b> (2012) review for the government on education and training for the early years workforce. Amongst the government policies influenced by EPPSE was the government’s efforts to increase the qualification levels of ECEC staff (e.g., children’s workforce strategy, 2005; early years Professional qualification, 2006) as EPPSE had shown that quality of provision was related to staff qualifications (Sylva et al. 1999, 2004).|$|E
