5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated.

5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> better sexual function; for example, people with {{injuries}} in the sacral region {{are less likely to}} be able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
40|$|Questions about biinterpretability Abstract. We {{say that}} two {{structures}} are biinterpretable if they interpret {{each other and}} the composition of these interpretabilities is the identity. Biinterpretability was especially studied by Oleg Belegradek. Interpretability of two structures each other does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> biin-terpretabilty. For example Z and UT 3 (Z) are not biinterpretable. In a recent joint with Scanlon and Aschenbrenner, we have proved that a commutative finitely generated infinite integral do-main is biinterpretable with the first order arithmetic. More generally the non biinterpretability can be proved by an analysis of automorphisms of models. If we have time we will present the link with classifying toposes for geometric theories and sketches for infinitary logic. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{single-stage}} multiple-comparison procedure for comparing parameters of independent systems, where the parameters are <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> or steady-state means. We assume that for each system, the parameter has an estimation process that satisfies a {{central limit theorem}} (CLT) {{and that we have}} a consistent variance-estimation process for the variance parameter appearing in the CLT. The procedure allows for unequal run lengths or sample sizes across systems, and also allows for unequal and unknown variance parameters across systems. The procedure is asymptotically valid as the run lengths or sample sizes of all system grow large. One setting the framework encompasses is comparing quantiles of independent populations. It also covers comparing means or other moments of independent populations, functions of means, and steady-state means of stochastic processes. ...|$|R

5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that there was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E

30|$|In literature, a {{substantial}} number of large-scale path loss models have been reported. They can be categorized into four groups: empirical models, deterministic models, semi-deterministic models, and hybrid models.

50|$|In general, expansionism {{consists}} of policies of governments and states that involve territorial or economic expansion.

5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> they browsed on items there, and the short neck of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E
5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E
5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> {{that there would be a}} large gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to stop the rampant suburbanization, which {{countries}} experienced after World War II, a 'new town' policy was enrolled. As a major objective, and related to its origins, new towns were effective in attracting low and medium income households. Nowadays, cities and municipalities experience an increased accountability in which incentives are provided by 'naming and shaming'. This paper focuses on an issue where both historical and local policy come together: early school leaving. Using an iterative matching analysis, it suggests how to account for differences in population and regional characteristics. In other words, how to compare and interpret early school leaving in new towns in a more `fair' way. The results point out that (statistically) mitigating historical differences is necessary, even though this does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> that 'naming' is replaced by 'shaming'.

40|$|The {{decentralization}} {{process in}} Mexico has shown significant progress {{by trying to}} empower local and state governments. However, the Mexican case makes clear that the transfer of greater powers to subnational governments does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> an increase in their institutional capacities. Thus, {{due to the lack}} of institutional capacities at the subnational level, the prevailing arrangement of fiscal federalism in Mexico has generated vertical imbalances that result in “structural traps”. As a consequence, the current framework fails to guarantee the three basic premises that should be fulfilled by today’s intergovernmental fiscal arrangements: fiscal responsibility, compensatory duties and accountability. This article (1) explores the current state of fiscal federalism in Mexico, (2) makes a comparison with OECD countries to show how levels of government interact in both, federal and unitary regimes and (3) makes an assessment of the institutional capacities of subnational governments in Mexico...|$|R
5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|The single known living specimen, a {{young adult}} male, was {{collected}} at 80m (260ft) altitude in the Andaladomo forest (part of the Mikea Forest) in 2003. The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation {{from the rest of}} the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar. The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry deciduous forest amid land cleared for maize cultivation. The trap was set at the foot of a tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants. Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include the bastard big-footed mouse, the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus), several species of tenrecs, and the shrew Suncus madagascariensis. Although only a single individual of Petter's big-footed mouse was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100trap-nights, they argue that this does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season. Nothing is known of its behavior, but the animal's morphology suggests it lives on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Fibrous {{composites}} are now gradually replacing traditional {{steel and}} alloys in lightweight structural designs {{because of their}} unique weight/performance ratio and vast choice of mechanical properties. However, these composites may have no plastic deformation phase that is typical for metals, and therefore buckling load does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> ultimate load that stiffened composite panels can bear. Allowing stiffened composite panels to enter post-buckling state can significantly reduce weight of aircraft or other lightweight structures in the near future. This requires accurate and fast calculation methods for structural sizing and design optimization. The aim of current study is to benchmark commercially available non-linear finite element (FE) software capabilities for post-buckling analysis of stiffened composite panels. Thus several models have been created using ANSYS, ABAQUS and LS-DYNA FE packages and the analysis results have been experimentally validated. Evaluation of these modeling issues has been performed comparing accordance to experimental data, computational time and applicability for further optimization procedure with response surface method and design of computer experiments...|$|R
