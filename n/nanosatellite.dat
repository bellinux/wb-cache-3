25|$|The University <b>Nano{{satellite}}</b> Program, {{a satellite}} design and fabrication competition for universities jointly {{administered by the}} American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), AFOSR, AFRL, and the Space Development and Test Wing, is also managed by the Space Vehicles Directorate's Spacecraft Technology division. The fourth iteration of the competition was completed in March 2007 with the selection of Cornell University's CUSat as the winner. Previous winners of the competition were University of Texas at Austin's Formation Autonomy Spacecraft with Thrust, Relnav, Attitude, and Crosslink (FASTRAC) for Nanosat-3 and the joint 3 Corner Satellite (3CS) project by the University of Colorado at Boulder, Arizona State University and New Mexico State University for Nanosat-2. , only the 3CS spacecraft has launched, however FASTRAC has a launch tentatively scheduled for December 2009.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{provides}} a historical {{look at the}} past four years of <b>nanosatellites</b> launch activity. In this period, there were recorded 55 <b>nanosatellites</b> launches, 16 of them were lost in 26 th July 2006, as the launcher Dnepr- 1 has exploded 86 seconds after launch. This paper presents an analysis of the <b>nanosatellites</b> launches in the period 2004 - 2007, based on the following criteria: the owner country of the payload, mass and mission category, type of orbit, type of launcher, spaceport, mission status and type of activit...|$|R

40|$|The {{photometric}} precision {{needed to}} measure a transit of small planets cannot {{be achieved by}} taking observations from the ground, so observations must be made from space. Mid-sized <b>nanosatellites</b> can provide a low-cost option for building an optical system to take these observations. The potential of using <b>nanosatellites</b> of varying sizes to perform transit measurements was evaluated using a theoretical noise budget, simulated exoplanet-transit data, and case studies to determine the expected results of a radial velocity followup mission and transit survey mission. Optical systems on larger mid-sized <b>nanosatellites</b> (such as ESPA satellites) have greater potential than smaller mid-sized <b>nanosatellites</b> (such as CubeSats) to detect smaller planets, detect planets around dimmer stars, and discover more transits in RV followup missions. by Rachel Bowens-Rubin.
