5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid did {{as a man who}} had been happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E

25|$|Until this point, {{he can be}} seen as a loyal {{supporter}} of the House of Lancaster. However, at some time during the next two years, his allegiance began to shift. He was a member of the council of Richard, Duke of York, during Henry VI's second period of madness. Although he was with the Lancastrian nobility at the First Battle of St Albans (1455), he was appointed by York to be joint Constable of Windsor Castle after the battle.

25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of the Sanhedrin in 358 CE, there has been no universally recognized authority within Halakha. Maimonides (1135–1204) {{was one of the greatest}} scholars of the Middle Ages, and is arguably one of the most widely accepted scholars among the Jewish people since the closing of the Talmud in 500. Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a <b>natural</b> (<b>as</b> opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, Maimonides proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the same authority it had in former years. There have been several attempts to implement Maimonides' recommendations, the latest being in modern times.|$|E
25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} done better acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E

500|$|With {{the rise}} of feminist {{literary}} criticism in the 1970s, Mary Shelley's works, particularly Frankenstein, began to attract much more attention from scholars. Feminist and psychoanalytic critics were {{largely responsible for the}} recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer. Ellen Moers {{was one of the first}} to claim that Shelley's loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein. She argues that the novel is a [...] "birth myth" [...] in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother's death as well as for failing as a parent. Shelley scholar Anne K. Mellor suggests that, from a feminist viewpoint, it is a story [...] "about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman... is profoundly concerned with <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction". Victor Frankenstein's failure as a [...] "parent" [...] in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy, giving birth, and particularly maternity.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look as real as possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparation was extensive: first Grohl had {{his usual}} start-off by {{developing}} demos with drummer Taylor Hawkins, {{but for the}} first time Grohl tried to input vocals and lyrics in this early composition stage. After rounding up composition with guitarist Chris Shiflett and bassist Nate Mendel, Grohl spent two weeks with Norton discussing [...] "arrangements, harmony and melody" [...] and reducing the song ideas, and then the band spent four weeks rehearsing, playing [...] "a song a day, from noon to midnight". Hawkins stated that [...] "we basically played each of these songs 100 different times, trying every little thing every different way" [...] and that it was the first time since The Colour and the Shape [...] "that Dave had to deal with someone in the room questioning all his ideas", given the more laid-back approach of previous producer Nick Raskulinecz. Grohl claimed the choices were for the [...] "most powerful, dramatic songs", and that there was an effort to [...] "make everything sound as <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> possible – just like on the albums we grew up listening to", citing 1970s artists such as Neil Young and Wings as a major influence. Shiflett added that for the first time he played lead guitar in some tracks while Grohl [...] "usually works out all the bits" [...] of composition.|$|E

500|$|The Tempest, Hazlitt claims, {{is one of}} Shakespeare's [...] "most {{original}} and perfect" [...] plays, {{similar in some ways}} to A Midsummer Night's Dream but finer as a play, if not as rich in poetic passages. The Tempest demonstrates the author to be a master of both comedy and tragedy, with a full command over [...] "all the resources of passion, of wit, of thought, of observation". Yet again, Hazlitt here devotes considerable space to not just the characters in the play, but the character of the play as a whole. The world of the play seems to be created out of nothing; yet, though dream-like, in large part a product of the imagination, its setting resembles that of a painting we may have seen—"Prospero's enchanted island [...] airy music, the tempest-tost vessel, the turbulent waves, all have the effect of the landscape background of some fine picture"—its poetry having a music that conjures up meaning in the listener's mind—"the songs [...] without conveying any distinct images, seem to recall all the feelings connected with them, like snatches of half-forgotten music heard indistinctly and at intervals"—and its characters, many of whom, like Ariel, we know could not really exist, are drawn so as to seem [...] "as true and <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> [...] real characters". All is so artfully unified that [...] "that part which is only the fantastic creation of his mind, has the same palpable texture, and coheres 'semblably' with the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|Enhanced by the {{considerable}} influence of Leicester's Commonwealth, the rumours about Amy Robsart's death {{developed into a}} tradition of embellished folklore. As early as 1608, a domestic tragedy named A Yorkshire Tragedy alluded to her fall {{from a pair of}} stairs as an easy {{way to get rid of}} one's wife: [...] "A politician did it." [...] In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best-selling novel, Kenilworth, by Walter Scott. The novel's arch-villain is again called Varney. The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish diplomatic correspondence (and with it of poison rumours) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude. Generally convinced of Leicester's wretchedness, he concluded in 1863: [...] "she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne; and Dudley himself … used private means … to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far." [...] There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with The Murder of Amy Robsart in 1885: here she was first poisoned and then, that method failing, killed by violent means. Rye's main sources were Cecil's talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley's death and, again, Leicester's Commonwealth. Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard, Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester, which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation. By 1910, A.F. Pollard was convinced that the fact that Amy Robsart's death caused suspicion was [...] "as <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> it was incredible … But a meaner intelligence than Elizabeth's or even Dudley's would have perceived that murder would make the marriage impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|Usher {{possesses}} a leggiero tenor vocal range of 3 octaves and 2 notes, {{and is considered}} to be [...] "one of the most soothing in R". At the age of 13, he set the record for the longest note ever held by a child on Star Search, with 12 seconds. Usher's vocal coach since [...] My Way, Jan Smith, cites him as [...] "the single most gifted singer I’ve ever worked with in 26 years". On the dynamic 8701, Rolling Stone's Kathryn McGuire describes his vocals as [...] "velvety" [...] and [...] "impressively adaptable" [...] as it won him his first two Grammys as Best Male R Vocal Performance. With Confessions, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker notes him as [...] "long on control and short on texture". He received another Grammy Award nomination in 2006 through a cover of Luther Vandross's [...] "Superstar" [...] he performed on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005. Here I Stand displayed his vocals as [...] "agile" [...] and [...] "balletic", as well as his ability to [...] "easily drift from wavering tenor to fine-tuned falsetto" [...] that create emotions of urgency and burning according to Clover Hope of The Village Voice. Looking For Myself exemplified his craft and earned him positive acclaim as Gawker's Rick Juzwiak says [...] "his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one" [...] with emphasis on his falsetto being [...] "something that sounds as <b>natural</b> <b>as</b> a speaking voice...he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths [...] His emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other". Regarding [...] "Climax", his performance was lauded as [...] "blistering" [...] by Maura Johnston, and [...] "terrific" [...] by Jody Rosen, as he won Best R Performance in 2013. [...] "There Goes My Baby" [...] and [...] "Dive" [...] are also commended as showcase standouts of his [...] "superior R vocal range" [...] by Consequence of Sound's Ryan Hadfield, and MadameNoire's Brande Victorian. For Hard II Love, Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented [...] "a genuinely expressive voice that encompasses an ardent croon, a melting falsetto and quick, singsong declamation".|$|E
