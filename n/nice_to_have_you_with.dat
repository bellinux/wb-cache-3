What a dream I had. All about Jackie 2 ̆ 6 the fellow {{she was married to}} {{and the rest of the}} models. There was so much {{confusion}} about getting to that wedding. Jackie really looked lovely she was so happy. It was a queer wedding though—Jackie was so nonchant [sicsic] 2 ̆ 6 laughing. That’s something I don’t think I’ll do. Golly, honey, I kept wishing you were there. Wonder what our wedding will be like, hon. Golly, March seems so far away. It’s awful. March is so far or have I said that a few thousand times. It seems even farther because there isn’t any definite date—I can’t count the weeks or day—just months. Tonight the fellow’s going to take the pictures again. Hope they’re better this time. Golly, honey, it seems as though everyone should know by now that we’re getting engaged. Corinne is saying how wonderful Dick is. She thinks he’s a perfect husband 2 ̆ 6 I think you’ll be much better than he. We have long discussions on how good a husband our various friend[s] would be. You’ll be better than any of them. I hope that I’ll be home when you call tonight. It’s going to be very confusing because I’m not sure what time he’ll be through taking those pictures. Well, honey, please call me Friday if you get home, don’t forget. That would be wonderful. Well, honey, time out for lunch now. I’ll write more when I get home—I mean back here from lunch—I love you…. Hi, honey, well, I’m back from lunch. What an hour that was. Just after I had finished my shopping 2 ̆ 6 was going back to work I passed some perfume in Macy’s that mother loves. Well, I got her a large bottle of the stuff, personally I think it’s awful but she likes it. Just as I was leaving the counter the bag broke or something and the bottle of perfume crashed to the floor. I thought that maybe it hadn’t broken but when I picked it up, it poured out of the box. What a mess. Anyway, I couldn’t find any wastebasket to throw it in so it got all over my clothes 2 ̆ 6 umbrella and my boots 2 ̆ 6 hands. Now I can still smell the stuff 2 ̆ 6 it’s awful.

But, hon, I’d like to get married as soon as you get home—a few hours later—if it’s possible at all—so that we wouldn’t waste any of that time.

It will be the first Christmas that I’ve ever been away from home. Besides, it’s the last Christmas that I’ll be unmarried—(Thank heavens!) but I’d be miserable all day away from you, honey.

I just didn’t want to stay home all weekend but I <b>have</b> sense enough <b>to</b> {{know what to do about}} my ankle. Honey, I’ll write more later—I love you. Darling time just flew today and it’s almost ten o’clock now. I’m sorry that I didn’t get much of a chance to write <b>you,</b> honey. I <b>had</b> planned <b>to</b> write <b>you</b> a real long letter today but golly, honey, I don’t know where today went. I hope that the rest of the week goes this fast darling. Honey, if we go home on the train, that will mean that we won’t have the car won’t it? What are we going to do this weekend, hon? We should do something real exciting to make up for last weekend 2 ̆ 6 not being able to do anything (I mean go out any place). We did quite a bit. Darling every minute I’m away from you seems years.
