40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design of an {{instrument}} that can measure the content of magnetite in a slurry, in particular the dense medium which is fed into coal processing plant dense medium cyclones. In this application the instrument should avoid contact with the slurry which is abrasive and agglomerative, and the instrument should be undisturbed {{by the presence of}} a core of air within the slurry. Magnetometry is investigated to choose a suitable design, and the design is investigated by use of a simulation program. The instrument is constructed and tested on a dense medium cyclone at a coal preparation plant where a real time application of a model of the dense medium cyclone is being tested concurrently. The instrument readings and the model predictions are compared to demonstrate that the instrument readings are an analogue of the density of the medium. It is also shown that the instrument sometimes disagrees with the model because the cyclone is <b>not</b> <b>operating</b> <b>correctly,</b> or the cyclone has been disturbed by a change of feed mineral, or a drift which has as yet not been traced to a physical cause disturbs the instrument reading...|$|E
40|$|Wet {{compression}} cooling {{has become}} an extremely important gas cooling method for land based power generation installations. The {{reason for this is}} that many power stations are augmenting their standard power generation units with turbines. These turbines are generally used to help supply electricity during peak power occurrences, particularly during the summer months in many geographic areas. One of the main reasons for cooling this air is to increase the density as well to facilitate a cooler combustor inlet temperature. The increase in compressor air inlet density increases the overall compressor efficiency. An increase in combustor efficiency will also occur due to the lower combustor inlet air temperature. The general method for this inlet air-cooling is to use finely atomized drops in the air inlet duct leading to the turbine compressor. If the drops are of the appropriate size and atmospheric conditions are favorable (i. e. wet bulb temperature), the water will begin to evaporate prior to reaching the first compressor stage. In some instances the evaporation may be allowed to continue into the compressor itself. This can create some difficulties if the atomizers are <b>not</b> <b>operating</b> <b>correctly.</b> Large drops can impact the rotor blades of the compressor and can wear the compressor blades through erosion over time. It is also optimal to maintain a fairly tight drop size distribution from the atomizer. This facilitates a mor...|$|E
40|$|Self-healing {{systems have}} {{attracted}} vast attention {{by the research}} community. Self-healing Web services {{have the ability to}} perceive that they are <b>not</b> <b>operating</b> <b>correctly</b> and, without human intervention, make the necessary adjustments to restore itself to normal operation. Information quality is a fundamental aspect of Web services since wrong or out-of-date information can cause the failure of the service. Measuring and improving information quality is a complex task. Several methodologies have been developed in the last years to provide a support for the design and implementation of assessment and improvement techniques in order to guarantee high data quality level. The existing approaches focus on the system design phases in which enterprise context is analyzed, quality dimensions are selected, assessment and improvement techniques and tools are modelled. In this paper, a methodology is instead proposed to be a support to self-healing environments and to solve run-time data quality problems. The analysis of the business processes and context in the design phase allows identifying critical points in the business tasks in which information quality might be worsened. In these points, information quality blocks have to be inserted in order to continuously monitor the information flows. Through suitable checks, failures due to information quality problems can be detected. Furthermore, failures and warnings in service execution may depend {{on a wide variety of}} causes. Along the causes, the methodology also produces a list of the suitable recovery actions for a timely intervention and quality improvement. In particular, the focus of the paper is on data quality problems introduced by a shared use of data in different processes or by periodically synchronized data sources in process based systems using Web services. The methodology is explained by means of a running example. Key Words: Information quality, Self-healing Web service, Warning Management. 1...|$|E

The approach used is kunatitatif approach that leads to the observation or measurement data expressed in numbers to get a picture of the problems faced by PT. This sample includes 30 countries and 30 private universities from 30 provinces in Indonesia. Please note, there are currently 83 government-run public universities, private universities and 2598 are managed by the private sector. With stratified random sampling method. PT PT grouped by type, then from each PT group took some samples to represent the 30 provinces. In qualitative data analysis techniques, namely descriptive measures argumentative with data description, data analysis, and conclusions. Study results showed that the majority of PT has conducted data collection and processing on a regular basis every year. Documenting all this walking is still dominated by the instrument of data collection via questionnaires, either by the Directorate General of Higher Education and Ministry of Education Research and Development Center for Education Statistics. There are two main causes of delay in data collection, the first coming from the government (Directorate General of Higher Education Department of Education and Research and Development PSP), and the second coming of PT 2 ̆ 7 s own institution. Not to mention, there were respondents who felt not received a census questionnaire.

Pendekatan yang dilakukan adalah pendekatan kuantitatif melalui observasi atau pengukuran data untuk mendapatkan gambaran permasalahan yang dihadapi PT. Sampel studi terdiri atas 30 PTN dan 30 PTS dari 30 provinsi di Indonesia yang dipilih secara stratified random sampling. Teknik analisis data dilakukan secara kualitatif, yakni secara deskriptif argumentatif dengan langkah-langkah pendeskripsian data, analisis data, dan penyimpulan.
