25|$|Played by Jackie Gleason—a {{bus driver}} for the fictional Gotham Bus Company based in New York City. He <b>never</b> <b>is</b> seen driving a bus (except in {{publicity}} photos), but sometimes is {{shown at the}} bus depot. Ralph is frustrated by his lack of success, and often develops get-rich-quick schemes. He is very short tempered, frequently resorting to bellowing, insults, and making hollow threats. Well hidden beneath the many layers of bluster, however, is a soft-hearted man who loves his wife and is devoted to his best pal, Ed Norton. Ralph enjoys—and is proficient at—bowling and playing pool, and is an enthusiastic member of the fictitious Loyal Order of Raccoons (although in several episodes a blackboard at the lodge lists his dues as being in arrears). The Ralph character was given honorary membership in the union for real New York City bus drivers (Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union) during {{the run of the}} show, and a Brooklyn bus depot was named in Gleason's honor after his death. Ralph Kramden is the inspiration for the animated character Fred Flintstone.|$|E
25|$|Otto Grunf is a {{naturalized}} German-born inventor. He is {{a former}} Luftstreitkräfte mechanic who fought in the First World War, and he defected from the German army after his mechanical incompetence caused the airplane of the Red Baron to crash. He moved to America and changed his last name from Grunt to Grunf to avoid detection, and is mentioned to also serve in Second World War. He serves as the inventor, fabricator and the mechanic of the TNT group. Running gag in the series is his incompetence: he usually designs various Rube Goldberg machines that end up in failure, fails to properly service or change the vehicles or weaponry (driving a 1910s era car that usually explodes while attempting to start it or brandishing an 1880s revolver), or invents things that already exist (he claims to have invented the skateboard, which he named Skate-Grunf). Despite his heroic-like behavior and staunch belief in bravery (as seen by quotes stamped on his T-shirts), {{he is a very}} cowardly man, constantly running from danger. He usually dresses in a World War I-era flying ace uniform with goggles. He is very loyal and devoted to Number One and <b>never</b> <b>is</b> on his odds. His job is usually to drive Number One around New York (in other words, push his wheelchair around).|$|E
500|$|Suffolk Punches {{generally}} stand , weigh , and {{are always}} chestnut in colour. The traditional spelling, still {{used by the}} Suffolk Horse Society, is [...] "" [...] (with no [...] "t" [...] {{in the middle of}} the word). Horses of the breed come in many different shades of chestnut, ranging from dark to red to light. Suffolk horse breeders in the UK use several different colour terms specific to the breed, including dark liver, dull dark, red and bright. White markings are rare and generally limited to small areas on the face and lower legs. Equestrian author Marguerite Henry described the breed by saying, [...] "His color is bright chestnut [...] like a tongue of fire against black field furrows, against green corn blades, against yellow wheat, against blue horizons. <b>Never</b> <b>is</b> he any other color." ...|$|E

500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe called Apt Pupil [...] "most {{compelling}} for its moral dimension", enjoying the [...] "duet between Renfro's smooth-cheeked latter-day Faust and McKellen's reawakened Mephistopheles". While Carr found the film's framework to be realistic, {{he noted the}} change of pace, [...] "Perhaps sensing a narrative slackening and a smothering claustrophobia... 'Apt Pupil' veers into melodramatic devices that yank the film out of its disquieting amorality {{and turn it into}} something much more ordinary and mundane." [...] The critic concluded, [...] "It maintains a bleak integrity by not pretending to arrive at remorse. <b>Never</b> <b>is</b> there any discussion." [...] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune described Apt Pupil as [...] "a good shocker that misses the ultimate horror", finding the film's weakness to be the [...] "contrived" [...] bond between Dussander and Bowden. [...] Wilmington called the plot [...] "overly slick", asking, [...] "How can Todd not only conveniently find a Nazi war criminal in his hometown but also instantly coerce and control him?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{designers}} included role-playing {{elements in}} the game. Similar to Ultima Underworld, another Looking Glass Studios project, the environment in System Shock 2 is persistent and constantly changes without the player's presence. Paper-and-pencil role-playing games were influential; the character customization system was based on Travellers methodology and was implemented in the fictional military branches which, by allowing multiple character paths, the player could receive a more open-ended gameplay experience. Horror was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was deemed primary, {{which resulted in the}} player having little physical contact with other sentient beings. Secondly, a vulnerability was created by focusing on a fragile character. Last were the inclusion of moody sound effects and [...] "the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows". The game's lead designer, Ken Levine, oversaw the return of System Shock villain SHODAN. Part of Levine's design was to ally the player with her, as he believed that game characters were too trusting, stating [...] "good guys are good, bad guys are bad. What you see and perceive is real". Levine sought to challenge this notion by having SHODAN betray the player: [...] "Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the player <b>never</b> <b>is.</b> I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that they, and not [...] the character, were led on and deceived". This design choice was controversial with the development team.|$|E
500|$|Part One of the book, titled [...] "Encounter," [...] {{opens with}} Irene {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} Clare Kendry, causing her to recall a chance encounter she had had with her, at the roof restaurant of the Drayton Hotel in Chicago, during a brief stay in the city. The women grew up together but lost touch when Clare's white father died and she was taken {{to live with her}} two paternal white aunts. Irene learns that Clare [...] "passes" [...] for white, living primarily in Europe with her unsuspecting, rich, white husband and their daughter. Although Irene tries to avoid further engagement with Clare, she <b>never</b> <b>is</b> able to fully exclude her from her life as she later visits Clare for tea along with another childhood friend, Gertrude Martin. Toward the end of the visit, Clare's white husband John (Jack) Bellew arrives. Unaware that all three women are black, Jack expresses some very racist views and makes the women uneasy. However, the women play along in an effort to maintain Clare's secret identity. Afterward, Irene and Gertrude decide that Clare's situation is too dangerous for them to continue associating with her and are uncomfortable around Clare and her husband [...] Irene receives a letter of apology from Clare but destroys it and in her quest to try and forget about Clare and get her out of her life. Instead Irene wants to focus on her life [...] with her husband, Brian, and her two sons, Theodore and Brian Jr..|$|E

500|$|In 1943, at {{the behest}} of the Ministry of Information, Olivier began working on Henry V. Originally he had no {{intention}} of taking the directorial duties, but ended up directing and producing, in addition to taking the title role. He was assisted by an Italian internee, Filippo Del Giudice, who had been released to produce propaganda for the Allied cause. The decision was made to film the battle scenes in neutral Eire, where it was easier to find the 650 extras. John Betjeman, the press attaché at the British embassy in Dublin, played a key liaison role with the Irish government in making suitable arrangements. The film was released in November 1944. Brooke, writing for the BFI, considers that it [...] "came too late in the Second World War to be a call to arms as such, but formed a powerful reminder of what Britain was defending." [...] The music for the film was written by William Walton, [...] "a score that ranks with the best in film music", according to the music critic Michael Kennedy. Walton also provided the music for Olivier's next two Shakespearean adaptations, Hamlet (1948) and Richard III (1955). Henry V was warmly received by critics. The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian wrote that the film combined [...] "new art hand-in-hand with old genius, and both superbly of one mind", in a film that worked [...] "triumphantly". The critic for The Times considered that Olivier [...] "plays Henry on a high, heroic note and <b>never</b> <b>is</b> there danger of a crack", in a film described as [...] "a triumph of film craft". There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and Olivier was instead presented with a [...] "Special Award". He was unimpressed, and later commented that [...] "this was my first absolute fob-off, and I regarded it as such." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the lack of {{explanation}} about the marriage, not much is revealed of the characters' back-stories. It is known that Basil served in the British Army and saw action in the Korean War, possibly as part of his National Service. (John Cleese himself was only 13 when the Korean War ended, making the character of Basil at least five or six years older than he.) Basil exaggerates this period of his life, proclaiming to strangers, [...] "I killed four men." [...] To this Sybil jokes that [...] "He was in the Catering Corps. He used to poison them." [...] Basil often is seen wearing regimental and old boy ties, no doubt spuriously. He also claims to have sustained a shrapnel injury to his leg; it tends to flare up at suspiciously convenient times. The only person Basil consistently exhibits tolerance and good manners towards is the old and senile Major Gowen, a veteran {{of one of the world}} wars (which one <b>never</b> <b>is</b> specified, though he once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir that he was in France in 1918) who permanently resides at the hotel. When interacting with Manuel, Basil displays a rudimentary ability with Spanish (Basil states that he [...] "learned classical Spanish, not the strange dialect he [...] seems to have picked up"); this ability also is ridiculed, as in the first episode in which a guest, whom Basil has immediately dismissed as working-class, communicates fluently with Manuel in Spanish after Basil is unable to do so.|$|E
