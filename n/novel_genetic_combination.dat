40|$|Recent methodological {{advances}} have uncovered tremendous microbial diversity cohabiting {{in the same}} host plant, {{and many of these}} microbes cause disease. In this review we highlight how the presence of other pathogen species, or other pathogen genotypes, within a plant can affect key components of host-pathogen interactions: (i) within-plant virulence and pathogen accumulation, through direct and host-mediated mechanisms; (ii) evolutionary trajectories of pathogen populations, through virulence evolution, generation of <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations,</b> and maintenance of genetic diversity; and (iii) disease dynamics, with multiple infection likely to render epidemics more devastating.

Such approach {{has been applied to}} duplicate Glu- 1 locus coding for the high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS). These endosperm proteins {{play an important role in}} the end-use quality of wheat flour which is a complex character influenced by both genetic factors and plant growth conditions. Duplication of the Glu-A 1 and Glu-D 1 loci have been obtained in the hexaploid wheat cv. Courtot through translocations between the long arm of both chromosomes 1 A and 1 D using the ph 1 b mutation. Amongst all the translocated lines produced, two lines duplicated respectively for the Dx 2 +Dy 12 genes (Glu-D 1) and Ax 2 * gene (Glu-A 1) have been characterized at the proteomic, rheological and technological levels. The cumulative and interaction effects on gluten strength and mixing properties of dough associated with duplication of Glu- 1 loci were assessed.

40|$|The {{reduction}} in genetic diversity in polyploid lineages, formed from whole-genome duplication {{of a few}} individuals, can affect their long-term evolutionary potential. Because most polyploids originate multiple times, secondary contact and gene exchange among independently formed polyploids can create <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations</b> and reduce the severity of genetic bottlenecks. However, independently originated polyploids may be reproductively isolated from each other due to genetic and chromosomal differences predating the polyploidisation event, or evolving subsequently in the dynamic genomes of young polyploid populations. Here we conducted experimental crosses to investigate the phenotype and interfertility between two independently originated populations of the allopolyploid Mimulus peregrinus (Phrymaceae). We found that individuals from the two populations are phenotypically distinct, but that inter- and intrapopulation crosses are not statistically different. Interpopulation crosses produce viable and fertile offspring, although our results suggest the existence of partial reproductive barriers {{in the form of}} reduced pollen viability. We found no difference in pollen viability between F 1 and F 2 generations. In contrast, we detected a {{reduction in}} floral and vegetative size, and in the proportion of plants that flowered, between F 1 and F 2 generations for both intra- and interpopulation crosses. Together, our results indicate that populations of independent origin can partially exchange genes, producing variable offspring, and that the phenotype of M. peregrinus may be unstable in the early generations. Natural selection on genetically-based variation may be required for the evolution of more stable and fertile individuals of this nascent allopolyploid...|$|R
40|$|Hybridization is {{particularly}} important for evolutionary and speciation processes. It promotes evolutionary divergence between lineages by reinforcing reproductive isolation mechanisms to avoid {{the erosion of the}} spatial genetic structure and the production of unfit hybrids. Additionally, hybridization creates novel taxa by the fusion of interacting lineages. However, introgressive hybridization leads to conservation problems when introgression happens between threatened lineages and non-native or domesticated lineages. In such cases, introgressive hybridization may lead to the genetic swamping of one lineage and to the loss of the entire taxon. Hybrids often harbour <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations</b> and <b>novel</b> adaptations that provide them a higher potential to adapt to environmental changes and colonize new ecological niches. In the future, conservation of hybrids might provide additional genetic diversity for species to cope with alterations in their environment. In my thesis, I investigated hybridization and introgression between European pond turtle subspecies (Emys orbicularis) by combining nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial cytochrome b gene: I reported that introgressive hybridization between pond turtle subspecies occured in natural and human-mediated contact zones. Outcomes of introgressive hybridization between European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) subspecies indicated that E. o. orbicularis and E. o. hellenica subspecies and hybrids may have better fitness than E. o. galloitalica subspecies and hybrids under Swiss environmental conditions. Furthermore, I developed an eDNA-based methodology to detect the presence of pond turtles and investigated the efficiency of two water sampling methods. Finally, results of this thesis provided scientific knowledge to the Swiss national conservation programme of the European pond turtle...|$|R
40|$|Genetic exchanges among prokaryotes, {{formerly}} considered only {{a marginal}} phenomenon, increasingly are being viewed as profoundly affecting evolution. Indeed, some researchers argue for utterly revamping our concept of microbial speciation and phylogeny by replacing the traditional ''tree'' with a newer ''net'' {{to account for}} these horizontal transfers of genes. This conceptual ferment is occurring while molecular biologists reveal how horizontal gene transfers occur even as microbes protect the integrity of their genomes. Other studies reveal the number and diversity and abundance of genetic elements that mediate horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) or facilitate genome rearrangements, deletions, and insertions. Taken together, this information suggests that microbial communities collectively possess a dynamic gene pool, where <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations</b> act as a driving force in genomic innovation, compensating individual microbial species for their inability to reproduce sexually. These microbial genomic dynamics can present both environmental threats and promise to humans. One major threat, for example, comes from the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among pathogenic microbes. Another less-documented issue involves transgenic plants and animals, whose uses are being restricted because of concerns that genes may be transferred to untargeted organisms where they might cause harm. A possible benefit from HGT comes from its potential to enhance the functional diversity of microbial communities and to improve their performance in changing or extreme environments. Such changes might be exploited, for example, as part of efforts to manage environmental pollution and might be achieved by spreading genes into resident microbes to confer specific biochemical activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hybrid zones {{represent}} valuable {{opportunities to}} observe evolution in {{systems that are}} unusually dynamic and where {{the potential for the}} origin of novelty and rapid adaptation co-occur with the potential for dysfunction. Recently initiated hybrid zones are particularly exciting evolutionary experiments because ongoing natural selection on <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations</b> can be studied in ecological time. Moreover, when hybrid zones involve native and introduced species, complex genetic patterns present important challenges for conservation policy. To assess variation of admixture dynamics, we scored a large panel of markers in five wild hybrid populations formed when Barred Tiger Salamanders were introduced into the range of California Tiger Salamanders. Results At three of 64 markers, introduced alleles have largely displaced native alleles within the hybrid populations. Another marker (GNAT 1) showed consistent heterozygote deficits in the wild, and this marker was associated with embryonic mortality in laboratory F 2 's. Other deviations from equilibrium expectations were idiosyncratic among breeding ponds, consistent with highly stochastic demographic effects. Conclusion While most markers retain native and introduced alleles in expected proportions, strong selection appears to be eliminating native alleles at a smaller set of loci. Such rapid fixation of alleles is detectable only in recently formed hybrid zones, though it might be representative of dynamics that frequently occur in nature. These results underscore the variable and mosaic nature of hybrid genomes and illustrate the potency of recombination and selection in promoting variable, and often unpredictable genetic outcomes. Introgression of a few, strongly selected introduced alleles should not necessarily affect the conservation status of California Tiger Salamanders, but suggests that genetically pure populations of this endangered species will be difficult to maintain. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOngoing global climatic {{changes and}} growing {{demographic}} pressure have {{increased demand for}} agronomic resources and affected the agroecosystem by provoking a number of abiotic stresses that, added to biotic ones, result in physiological and metabolic disorders. Such stresses ultimately impact yield when it most needs to be improved, and understanding and resolving them is a major scientific and agronomic challenge of this century. However, many species are difficult to breed for stress resistance and improved yield {{for a number of}} reasons, ranging from a long life cycle (woody species), a reduced genetic background (most self-fertile, cleistogamous legumes) or conversely extensive heterozygosity resulting from an outbreeding nature, and also due to the mainly multigenic origin of such resistances. Biotechnology-based breeding would be an efficient alternative but, for recalcitrant crops, many attempts at in vitro regeneration met with varying degrees of success and often limited to a few genotypes, hampering exploitation of biotechnology approaches. To reduce the risk of undirected somaclonal variations amongst regenerants and transformants, it is better to produce them through somatic embryogenesis that recognises a single-cell origin but whose feasibility is also limited amongst species. There is also a need to fix the resulting genome once a novelty is obtained to ensure efficient heritability of improved traits acquired, which takes several generations in conventional breeding. Acceleration of generations through flowering and fruit set in vitro has been developed in various species including legumes. Haplo-diploidisation in vitro also offers a unique alternative to conventional methods, as it yields <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations</b> following doubling of haplotypes and regeneration of fertile plants having gained homozygosity within a single generation. This review will examine the relationships between embryogenesis, stress and its impact on in vitro development of novel genotypes more apt for a sustainable agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Dinoflagellates of {{the genus}} Symbiodinium form {{essential}} symbioses with reef building corals, underpinning the entire ecological foundation of coral reefs. Corals rely on photosynthate produced by Symbiodinium for their growth and calcification, which in turn forms the reef framework. Increased sea surface temperature due to climate change triggers the loss of Symbiodinium from corals (coral bleaching), which can result in coral death. Different genetic variants of Symbiodinium exhibit diverse thermal tolerances that influence the thermal bleaching thresholds of their coral host. However, despite decades of research into Symbiodinium biology, determinants of Symbiodinium thermal tolerance are still largely unresolved. Therefore, I aimed to unlock the basis of Symbiodinium thermal tolerance using a comparative physiology-genomics approach, and subsequently using this new knowledge, aimed to develop novel strategies that promote genetic manipulation of Symbiodinium. In this thesis, I discovered that thermal tolerance of type C 1 Symbiodinium is driven by up-regulation of genes and functional gene groups responsible for sexual reproduction, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and protein folding that maintain photosynthetic ability and limit reactive oxygen species production under heat stress. I also uncovered the first entire genome of a Symbiodinium virus along with hundreds of transcripts from viruses that infect Symbiodinium, whose transcriptional regulation under heat stress may contribute to Symbiodinium thermal sensitivity. Next, I successfully removed cell walls from live Symbiodinium to create the first Symbiodinium protoplasts and achieved Symbiodinium protoplast fusion, a key step in creating hybrid Symbiodinium cells with <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations</b> for ideal traits. Finally, using these discoveries, I developed a theoretical framework for Symbiodinium genetic engineering that incorporates Symbiodinium genetic elements, viral genetic elements, and Symbiodinium protoplasts, along with original genomic analyses {{of the potential for}} CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing in Symbiodinium. Together, the studies presented in this thesis unveil factors that govern, as well as strategies that may genetically enhance, Symbiodinium thermal tolerance...|$|R

Portugal has a potentially promising common bean germplasm, resulting from more than five centuries of natural adaptation and farmers' selection. Nevertheless, limited characterization of this resource hampers its exploitation by breeding programs. To support a more efficient conservation of the national bean germplasm and promote its use in crop improvement, we performed, for the first time, a simultaneous molecular marker (21 microsatellites and a DNA marker for phaseolin-type diversity analysis) and seed and plant morphological characterization (14 traits) of 175 accessions from Portuguese mainland and islands traditional bean-growing regions. A total of 188 different alleles were identified and an average pairwise Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards' chord genetic distance of 0. 193 was estimated among accessions. To relate the Portuguese germplasm with the global common bean diversity, 17 wild relatives and representative accessions from the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools were evaluated at the molecular level. No correlation was detected between the variability found and the geographic origin of accessions. Structure analysis divided the collection into three main clusters. Most of the Portuguese accessions grouped with the race representatives and wild relatives from the Andean region. One third of the national germplasm had admixed genetic origin and might represent putative hybrids among gene pools from the two original centers of domestication in the Andes and Mesoamerica. The molecular marker-based classification was largely congruent with the three most frequent phaseolin haplotype patterns observed in the accessions analyzed. Seed and plant morphological characterization of 150 Portuguese common bean accessions revealed a clear separation among genetic structure and phaseolin haplotype groups of accessions, with seed size and shape and the number of locules per pod the most discriminant traits. Additionally, we used molecular and morphological data to develop a series of smaller core collections that, by maximizing the genetic and morphological diversity of the original collection, represents the Portuguese common bean germplasm with minimum repetitiveness. A core collection with 37 accessions contained 100 % of the genetic variation found in the entire collection. This core collection is appropriate for a more detailed characterization and should be explored, as a priority, in national and international common bean breeding efforts. Furthermore, the identified intermediate accessions (with admixed genetic origin) may have <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>combinations</b> useful in future bean breeding...|$|R

40|$|Background; Epilepsy {{is one of}} the commonest {{neurological}} illnesses. There {{is considerable}} evidence that, in many cases, epilepsy is partly or completely genetic in aetiology. However, in spite of progress in certain Mendelian epilepsy syndromes, the genetic cause of epilepsy within families often remains unclear. With the advent of techniques such as whole exome sequencing, it may now be possible to identify the <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> variations underlying epilepsy in affected families. The aim {{of this study is to}} use whole exome sequencing to identify <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> abnormalities associated with epilepsy in affected Irish families. These <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> abnormalities will act as candidate causal variants for further study. Methods; We sought to identify Irish families with strong histories of epilepsy. Familes were considered for inclusion if the index case, one of their first degree relatives and one other individual in the family were affected by epilepsy. In each family identified, we clinically phenotyped individuals who were affected and unaffected by epilepsy syndromes. From each participant, we obtained a tissue sample (blood or saliva) for DNA analysis. In a number o f selected families, we performed genetic analysis using whole exome sequencing looking for <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> variations which could be the cause of epilepsy in these families. Results; We identified 96 families who met the criteria for inclusion on initial assessment, of whom 11 were recruited, representing a total of 110 individuals. There was considerable variability of phenotypes within the families identified. Affected individuals from four families had whole exome sequencing, with one other family having candidate gene analysis based on the results of previous screening of a family member. We identified <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> variations which could be candidates for further study as a possible cause for the epilepsy syndromes seen in three of the five families analysed. In one family, we identified a novel variation in a known epilepsy gene (A 348 Y in the SLC 2 A 1 gene).

METHODS Participants were 517 European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) twin pairs (mean age: 14. 6 +/- 3. 0) at visit 1 and 422 EA and AA twin pairs at follow-up 4. 1 years later. Echocardiograms were obtained on both visits. Data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling software Mx. RESULTS Body mass index (BMI) was a strong predictor for all LV measures at both visits 1 and 2, accounting for 3. 5 - 24. 2 % of the total variance. Hemodynamics explained up to 4. 5 % additional LV measures variance. After adjusting for BMI, LV measures showed substantial heritability (range: 21 - 71 %). Best-fitting longitudinal models revealed considerable <b>novel</b> <b>genetic</b> effects on the interventricular septum, posterior wall-, and relative wall thickness (RWT) (but not LV internal diameter), accounting for 32 - 41 % of the phenotypic variance at visit 2, with no significant gender and ethnic effects.
