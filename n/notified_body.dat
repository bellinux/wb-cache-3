2500|$|A <b>notified</b> <b>body,</b> in the European Union, is {{an entity}} {{that has been}} {{accredited}} by a Member State to assess whether a product {{to be placed on}} the market meets certain preordained standards. Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it. [...] For example, a <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not).|$|E

However, this decision and a similar case in Germany has created questions about how much liability should be applied to notified bodies for patient devices found to be dangerous despite previous <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> assessment. The German case against TÜV was dismissed initially and on appeal in district and regional courts, and an appeal to a German federal court resulted in referral of {{the case to the}} Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for clarification [...] "on three issues on the interpretation of the Medical Devices Directive." [...] Additionally, the original restitution decision by French courts was appealed and overturned on July 2, 2015, forcing affected patients to return their interim compensation, leaving many patients without recourse.|$|E

2500|$|Discussion {{of further}} {{expanding}} coordination groups of notified bodies for different product areas, improving marketing surveillance, and making participation in standardization and coordination activities mandatory began within E.U. member states. However, more criticism would arise {{out of the}} Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) scandal in early 2010, when media revealed that the French manufacturer of silicone gel breast implants had been using unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of medical-grade silicone {{for most of its}} implants. Investigators also brought criticism down on <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> TÜV Rheinland for issuing a certificate of quality for a production process that didn't include the in-house industrial-grade silicone. However, TÜV stated [...] "its remit was to check the production process, not the content of the silicone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states {{to take a hard look}} at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E

The conformity of Medical Devices and In-vitro Diagnostic Medical Device according to European Union Directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EEC must be assessed before sale is permitted. One of the major requirements to prove conformity is the implementation of the Quality Management System according ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 and ISO 14971. Although the European Union Directives do not mandate certification to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 the preferred method to prove compliance to such standards is to seek its official certification which is issued by certifying organizations known as [...] "Registrars". Several registrars also act as <b>Notified</b> <b>Body.</b> For those medical devices requiring the pre-market involvement of a <b>Notified</b> <b>Body,</b> the result of a positive assessment from the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> is the certificate of conformity allowing the CE mark and the permission to sell the medical device in the European Union.A very careful assessment of the company Quality Management System by the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body,</b> together with the review of the required Technical Documentation, is a major element which the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> takes into account to issue the certificate of conformity to the company product(s).|$|E
