5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The later {{history of}} Kent shows clear {{evidence}} {{of a system of}} joint kingship, with the kingdom being divided into east Kent and west Kent, although it appears that there generally was a dominant king. This evidence is less clear for the earlier period, but there are early charters, known to be forged, which nevertheless imply that Æthelberht ruled as joint king with his son, Eadbald. It may be that Æthelberht was king of east Kent and Eadbald became king of west Kent; the east Kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in Kentish history. Whether or not Eadbald became a joint king with Æthelberht, there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Æthelberht had authority throughout the kingdom.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No!' shouted Alaric, {{walking across}} the room till he closely confronted the captain. 'No--no--I will answer <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> may be asked in your hearing. But that your wife's {{presence}} protects you, I would kick you down your own stairs before me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ask <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> {{may lead}} to {{deceitful}} answers," [...] sullenly returned the squatter; [...] "I have dealings of my own with that trapper, {{that it may not}} befit an officer of the States to meddle with. Go, while your road is open." ...|$|R
50|$|Ideally, <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> are to {{be asked}} while {{conducting}} the test; rather, the subject is simply provided with the probable events/scenarios {{in the aftermath of}} which, the results are analyzed to verify if the brain produces any experiential knowledge, which is essentially the recognition of events disclosed. This way, all fundamental rights are protected, as neither there are <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> are being asked or any answers reciprocated.|$|R
5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group {{had a very}} {{successful}} deployment. The talented and dedicated Sailors of this group demonstrated tremendous operational flexibility and performed {{at the highest levels}} of excellence across the warfare spectrum and core capabilities of the Maritime Strategy. They were warriors, ambassadors, partners and humanitarians. They represent all that is good in our country and I'm profoundly honored to sail with this impressive strike group.|$|E
25|$|In {{the debates}} {{on the need}} for an {{increased}} effort to rearm British forces, Amery tended to focus on army affairs, with Churchill speaking more about air defence and Roger Keyes talking about naval affairs. Austen Chamberlain was, until his death, a member of the group as well. While there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Churchill was the most prominent and effective, Amery's work was still significant. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Army League, a pressure group designed to keep the needs of the British Army before the public.|$|E

25|$|As {{the inquiry}} unfolded, home videos of {{initiation}} rites in the CAR's French-speaking commando {{found their way}} into the media. The new Minister of National Defence David Collenette argued that the videos were disgusting, demeaning and racist. With the continued accumulation of such politically damaging visibility, the Minister of National Defence advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to disband the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995. It has been suggested that this move was as much driven by budget cuts to the Canadian Forces as by the Somalia Affair, but there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the affair gave the minister the public support needed to make his request for disbandment.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered an {{opportunity}} to do so. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand's alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun's advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi's hostility, which is why he was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E

25|$|Her {{father was}} Sir Bache Cunard, an {{heir to the}} Cunard Line {{shipping}} businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she {{spent a good deal}} of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and though this has been largely dismissed, there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> he played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E

500|$|Madison {{remained}} {{active in}} {{the progress of the}} amendments throughout the legislative process. Historian Gordon S. Wood writes that [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> it was Madison's personal prestige and his dogged persistence that saw the amendments through the Congress. There might have been a federal Constitution without Madison but certainly no Bill of Rights." ...|$|E

500|$|The McCormack–Dickstein Committee said of Butler's {{testimony}} {{in its final}} report. [...] "In {{the last few weeks}} of the committee's official life it received evidence showing that certain persons had made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country...There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient." ...|$|E
500|$|The trial {{commenced}} on 20 April 2015 at Lüneburg Regional Court (Landgericht). In {{an opening}} statement, Gröning asked for forgiveness for his mainly clerical role at Auschwitz {{in the summer}} of 1944, by saying: [...] "For me there's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> I share moral guilt," [...] the 93-year-old told the judges, acknowledging that he knew about the gassing of Jews and other prisoners. [...] "I ask for forgiveness. I share morally in the guilt but whether I am guilty under criminal law, you will have to decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{had a high}} {{reputation}} {{among his}} peers and received considerable praise from the film industry. After his death, Dore Schary, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said, [...] "There can be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the best}} and most protean actor of our screen." [...] Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, James Cagney, John Ford, Garson Kanin and Katharine Hepburn also called Tracy the greatest actor of his generation. Richard Widmark, who idolized Tracy, said: [...] "He's the greatest movie actor there ever was ... I've learned more about acting from watching Tracy than in any other way." ...|$|E

500|$|Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources {{gave the}} issue 3 stars out of 5 saying, the issue [...] "doesn't {{do much to}} advance the agenda or tighten up the plotlines of [...] "Trinity War", but there is {{absolutely}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the developments in this issue {{are going to have}} lasting ramifications for the Phantom Stranger and his quest for redemption." [...] Newsarama's Richard Gray gave it an 8 out 10 saying [...] "Some will pick up this issue for the links to the current “Trinity War” arc, but all should be transfixed by the way J.M. DeMatteis views the afterlife." ...|$|E
500|$|Wark {{was not a}} [...] "supremely talented" [...] player, but, {{according}} to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, they played as an entity {{greater than the sum}} of its parts." [...] He has been described as [...] "a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record".|$|E
500|$|The filmmaker Steven Soderbergh {{writes that}} [...] "For me there's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> cinematically On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{is the best}} Bond film {{and the only one}} worth {{watching}} repeatedly for reasons other than pure entertainment... Shot to shot, this movie is beautiful in a way none of the other Bond films are" [...] The director Christopher Nolan also saw On Her Majesty's Secret Service as his favourite Bond film; in describing its influence on his own film, Inception, Nolan said, [...] "What I liked about it that we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion." ...|$|E
