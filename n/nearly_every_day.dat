25|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, marine life helps determine {{the very nature}} of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially food fish), medicines, and raw materials.

Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's climate. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.|$|E
