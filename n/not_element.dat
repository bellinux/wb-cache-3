40|$|Since this is {{the first}} {{rapporteur}} talk on cosmic ray isotopes in thirteen Cosmic Ray Conferences, I will begin by briefly summarizing our interest in isotopic composition as follows: a) Isotopes, <b>not</b> <b>elements,</b> are the result of various nucleosynthesis processes. Thus, we must know the isotopic composition of cosmic rays in order to adequately exploit the relationship of cosmic rays and stellar processes. b) Isotopes, <b>not</b> <b>elements,</b> are the result of secondary fragmentation processes, either in cosmic ray source regions or in the interstellar medium. Thus, we must know the isotopic composition in order to completely unravel source composition from secondary composition. c) Isotopes, <b>not</b> <b>elements,</b> are radioactive. Thus, we must know the isotopic composition in order {{to take full advantage of}} various radioactive nuclei as cosmic ray clocks which can be used to determine the age of cosmic rays.

Particularly, we draw on other studies that collectively show that INEX assessors are identifying relevant passages (not elements), they agree on where in a document those passages lie, that there already exists suitable metrics in the XML-retrieval community for evaluating passage retrieval algorithms, and that the tasks make more sense as passage retrieval tasks. Finally we show that future tasks of XML-retrieval also fit well with passage retrieval...|$|E

To improve these technologies it is necessary to obtain an atomic level understanding of the electrochemical process occurring at the solid-gas and solid-liquid interfaces under reaction conditions. A host of techniques has been used to obtain such understanding. However, these powerful techniques are <b>not</b> <b>element</b> specific in contrast to X-ray based techniques which provide unambiguous assignment of chemical species. X-ray techniques provide insights into the electronic structure, in particular photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) : XPS, x-ray emission (XES) and x-ray absorption (XAS).

These techniques require high vacuum environments, and therefore are hardly compatible with liquids environments, including water and non-aqueous battery electrolytes.

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach for selenium speciation using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with ultra-violet (UV) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was developed. The {{separation of the}} investigated selenium species, selenites, selenates, selenomethionine, selenocystine, selenocystamine and dimethyldiselenide was accomplished in less than 6 min on a BIO Wide Pore RP- 18 column using sodium salt of n-octanesulfonic acid as ion-pairing modifier. The on-line detection of the separated selenium species was performed using UV spectrometry at the optimum wavelength of 192 nm, obtained by the UV spectra of the investigated individual selenium species. ICP-AES was also used as element specific on-line detector, after its coupling with the chromatographic system. The UV and ICP-AES detectors were compared for their suitability, including sensitivity and detection limits, for the on-line quantification of the six selenium species. The developed LC-UV as well as LC-ICP-AES techniques were successfully applied to a selenized yeast candidate reference material, after its enzymatic extraction with protease XIV It {{was found that the}} described LC-UV technique is suitable for the determination of selenomethionine, the main selenium compound in the yeast, with an accuracy of 5 %, although the UV detector is <b>not</b> <b>element</b> specific and it is rarely used for selenium speciation. This finding can prove valuable for routine laboratories to perform selenium speciation in such materials. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|NASA s Constellation Program {{employs a}} {{strategic}} analysis methodology in providing an integrated analysis capability of Lunar exploration scenarios {{and to support}} strategic decision-making regarding those scenarios. The strategic analysis methodology integrates {{the assessment of the}} major contributors to strategic objective satisfaction performance, affordability, and risk and captures the linkages and feedbacks between all three components. Strategic analysis supports strategic decision making by senior management through comparable analysis of alternative strategies, provision of a consistent set of high level value metrics, and the enabling of cost-benefit analysis. The tools developed to implement the strategic analysis methodology are <b>not</b> <b>element</b> design and sizing tools. Rather, these models evaluate strategic performance using predefined elements, imported into a library from expert-driven design/sizing tools or expert analysis. Specific components of the strategic analysis tool set include scenario definition, requirements generation, mission manifesting, scenario lifecycle costing, crew time analysis, objective satisfaction benefit, risk analysis, and probabilistic evaluation. Results from all components of strategic analysis are evaluated a set of pre-defined figures of merit (FOMs). These FOMs capture the high-level strategic characteristics of all scenarios and facilitate direct comparison of options. The strategic analysis methodology that is described in this paper has previously been applied to the Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs and is now being used to support the development of the baseline Constellation Program lunar architecture. This paper will present an overview of the strategic analysis methodology and will present sample results from the application of the strategic analysis methodology to the Constellation Program lunar architecture...|$|E

40|$|The thesis unveils how judges decide {{sentences}} in Cyprus {{and how they}} employ mercy to contour their judgments by determining {{at the same time}} whether these decisions are reached within or {{on the basis of a}} consistent legitimising framework founded in or derived from moral legal theory. The study professes a degree of originality in that it deals with the academically unexplored ground of the Cypriot sentencing reality and investigates the role of mercy not only as a component (or <b>not)</b> <b>element</b> of justice but, additionally, as a purposive ingredient of judicial discretion in the determination of sentence. It emphasises positive rather than normative analysis. It concentrates on how Cypriot judges sentence, and not on how they should or ought to sentence, by depicting and explaining the judges’ method of reaching their sentencing decisions in substance and in form (or their punishtecture as it will be characterised), including the demonstration on their part of mercy to certain defendants at the sentencing stage (or mercying as it will similarly be referred to). Following a discussion of relevant conceptual and empirical literature the thesis present and analyses a substantial body of data generated from a series of tête-à-tête semi-structured interviews conducted by the researcher with the majority of the Cypriot judiciary between 2007 and 2008. The research yields the judges’ views on the nature of the sentencing process and the conceptions, design, structuring, and utterance of their resultant judgments within the criminal justice context in which they find themselves acting. It presents what they have said about the choice of punishment and mercy and reconstructs what they may be taken to have meant by saying it; their aims and purposes in sentencing; the constraints under which they operate; the way they exercise their penal choices; and the use (or dismissal) of mercy as an etiological foundation of sentencing rationales...|$|E
40|$|A {{microwave}} discharge {{ion source}} (MIDAS) {{has been designed}} {{in order to obtain}} high efficiencies for positive ionization of the recoils which will be produced with the EXCYT facility at LNS and some experience has been gained from tests with the prototype. In the mid of 1998 the source has been redesigned: the microwave power at a frequency of 2. 45 GHz (2 kW continuous wave) is supplied to the plasma by a microwave line that incorporates a four step binomial matching transformer. The extraction system has also been modified to a three electrode system. The advantage of such a source with respect to other sources for radioactive beams consists of a ionization process which is <b>not</b> <b>element</b> dependent, thus obtaining quite high efficiencies for light and heavy ions (2 % to 50 % depending on the base pressure conditions) and of a short delay time (some tens of ms are estimated). Hereinafter the result of the efficiency tests are reported. 1 THE SOURCE DESIGN The MIDAS ion source is a compact microwave discharge source which exploits the principle of the off-resonance discharge to generate an overdense-low-temperature plasma which is an effective tool to generate 1 + ion beams with high efficiency, short delay time and low energy spread. The prototype of the MIDAS source was tested in 1997 - 98 [1] but the results were not acceptable with respect to the efficiency request, mainly because of the low RF power coupled to the plasma. Some modifications have been introduced with respect to the prototype: • the injection of the microwaves is performed by means of a waveguide with an adequate matching system instead of an antenna; • the static longitudinal magnetic field is generated by two movable coils instead of one; • the extraction system is designed to sustain voltages up to 60 kV as demanded by the mass separator design and it is built with three electrodes in place of two; Figure 1 and 2 show respectively the layout of the microwave line and the drawing of the MIDAS source...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that exchange bias (EB) implies {{the presence of}} pinned uncompen- sated moments pin-UCS in the antiferromagnet (AF) layer that are coupled to the ferromagnet (F) layer. An obstacle to understanding the EB e�ect is that only {{a subset of the}} UCS (those pinned and coupled to the F) are responsible for the EB-e�ect. The materials used, but also the experimental method and preparation may a�ect these subsets of UCS in distinct ways [19], and an interpretation of UCS measurements must take this into account. Moreover, the materials morphology, texture, defect density and nature of grain boundaries in uence the density and spatial distribution of the pin-UCS. Experimental methods that measure the pin-UCS density distribution with spatial resolution comparable to the materials' grain size are needed. Here we study F/AF heterostructure-samples by VSM and quantitative, high resolution MFM. MFM works in magnetic �elds (up to several T) but is <b>not</b> <b>element</b> speci�c. Analyzing data acquired with the F-layer in the saturated state and with di�erent magnetization states of the tip allows the separation of the di�erent sources of MFM contrast. Using quantitative MFM we measure the local areal density of pinned uncompensated moments (pin-UCS) in the antifer- romagnetic (AF) CoO layer and correlate the F-domain structure in a perpendicular anisotropy CoPt multilayer with the pin-UCS density [15]. Larger applied �elds drive the receding domains to areas of proportionally higher pin-UCS aligned antiparallel to F-moments. This con�rms our prior results [19] that these antiparallel pin-UCS are responsible for the EB-e�ect, while parallel UCS coexist. The data con�rm that the evolution of the F-domains is determined by the pin-UCS in the AF-layer, and also present examples of frustration in the system. This frus- tration and the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the pin-UCS also have a major e�ect on the coercivity of the EB-systems that has not yet been acounted for. Moreover, grain-boundary engineering can be used to decouple the AF grains leading to a stronger EB-e�ect but a smaller coercivity. New approaches with rare-earth-ferrimagnet/ferromagnet bilayers to increase unidirectional anisotropy provided by the EB-e�ect will be discussed...|$|E
