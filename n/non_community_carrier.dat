40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{developments}} in molecular genetics {{have made it}} possible to identify carriers of the cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation, regardless of family history, before they have an affected child. Using these techniques, population or 'community' carrier screening can offer informed reproductive choice to individuals and couples who would not otherwise know of their risk of having a CF child. AIM: This study set out to assess the views of general practitioners (GPs) on <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening for CF and to consider the factors that influence their willingness to offer it themselves. METHOD: A self-administered questionnaires was sent to all 616 GPs in four areas of North Thames (West) Region. RESULTS: Two-thirds of respondents indicated that identifying carrier couples to offer genetic counselling before conception was a very important benefit of <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening. Two-thirds felt that general practice was the most appropriate place in which to offer it, and similar proportions that the most appropriate times to do so were when a close relative was diagnosed and when seeking family planning. About half wanted to offer <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening themselves; this was related to experience with CF patients and CF carrier testing, and estimates of the numbers of CF carriers in the practice. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable support among GPs for <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening for CF in general practice, particularly in the context of family planning services. Knowledge and experience of CF increase GPs' willingness to offer it themselves...|$|R

40|$|The term air {{cabotage}} {{refers to the}} carriage of air traffic between two points within {{the territory of the}} same state. This carriage is generally reserved to the aircraft of the territorial state and is thus inaccessible to foreign carriers. This thesis gives a brief account of the origins of the concept of cabotage in maritime law and of its introduction in the early international air law conventions. The thesis then proceeds to focus on the problem of {{air cabotage}} in the North-American context and particularly on the current bilateral negotiations between the USA and Canada at which cabotage rights in the USA are being sought by Canada. It further projects on the EEC context, where air transport liberalization measures toward the completion of a single integrated market will eventually (perhaps very soon) lead to the availability for <b>Community</b> <b>carriers</b> of cabotage rights within any EEC Member State. The creation of a "Community cabotage area" where only <b>Community</b> <b>carriers</b> would be able to carry Community traffic is also analyzed. Finally, the consequences of these developments are examined as far as EEC Member States' obligations under the Chicago Convention and relations with third states are concerned.

40|$|A {{large sample}} of homosexually active men was {{recruited}} through the mail-out, self complete questionnaire procedure.

The resultant data {{based on this}} diverse sample of homosexually active men drawn {{from every corner of}} Australia complement those findings from periodic surveys conducted in principal gay communities. The overall method is both efficient and cost effective. Hence, serious consideration should be given to repeating the survey in 2004 as part of the four-year cycle and as a way of obtaining reliable data on homosexually active men, particularly <b>non</b> gay <b>community</b> attached men who are rarely recruited into other studies...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} the table above, both UK and Germany will benefit {{to a large extent}} from the {{interpretation}} (of Article 3 d) that allowances will be auctioned according to the emissions share of the administered airlines. This could be justified by the fact that both countries administer most large network carriers, particularly those from non-EU countries, and will have to bear a relatively high administrative burden. However, given that air transport markets are widely liberalised and at least for intra-European flights of <b>Community</b> <b>carriers</b> the nationality does not matter any more, such an interpretation seems to be problematic from an equity point of view. Therefore a very thorough interpretation of Article 3 d is highly recommendable.|$|R

The narrow reading of the term ‘nationality’ in Article 12 EC limiting it to the nationalities of the Member States for the purposes of Community law seems to be impermissible given the growing number of third country nationals falling within the scope of Community law to whom the article should potentially apply. Given that Directive 2003 / 109 /EC does not outlaw nationality discrimination the non-application of Article 12 EC to <b>non</b> <b>community</b> nationalities looks particularly unjust.

40|$|We first {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the background and characteristics of international air transport agreements. In a second part of the lecture we then look at the efficiency of new horizontal air service agreements (ASAs) signed by the European Union with several countries. These agreements were signed in order to bring existing bilateral ASAs into legal conformity with the 2002 ECJ judgment on “nationality clauses” and to increase competition. Based on OAG data analyses, literature reviews and stakeholder interviews, we find that market access is hardly facilitated and hence traffic hardly stimulated in cases in which bilateral frequency limitations or other restrictions are still in place. Also, horizontal agreements have not resolved day-to-day problems EU carriers face on the operational level in countries such as Azerbaijan, Armenia or Ukraine. On voluminous short-haul open sky markets, however, especially low cost carriers (LCC) make significant use of <b>Community</b> <b>carrier</b> designation...|$|R
