5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled after those of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>at</b> Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his natural father were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>at</b> losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E

25|$|He {{is known}} for {{introducing}} in 1874 a new, more aggressive form of obstructionism in the British House of Commons. This new form was directed <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>at</b> the Government but at the institution of parliament itself, and lacked the previous traditional restraint exercised by oppositions who realised that they could expect like treatment when they attained government. This involved giving long speeches to delay passage (also known as filibustering) of Irish coercion acts and to generally obstruct {{the business of the}} House to force the Liberals and Conservatives to negotiate with Irish nationalists. Obstruction was opposed by Home Rule Party leader Isaac Butt but approved of by most Irish nationalists.|$|E
25|$|Conservation efforts need to {{be based}} on {{protecting}} species over their entire host range and habitat, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>at</b> particular sites or with particular species. Studies have shown that even in many different soil types and locations EcM fungal richness is relatively conserved, but that the community makeup of sites can still be quite different. Trees are often dominated by a few fungal strains, but these fungi are not the same on all trees in nearby areas, and show considerable spatial variation. This leads to the conclusion that conservation efforts should be aimed even at atypical sites, such as abiotically stressful locales, in order to conserve the full gamut of EcM fungal partners and plant host species.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} mechanism, an ideal RAFT {{polymerization}} has several features. The pre-equilibrium and re-initiation steps are completed {{very early in}} the polymerization meaning that the major product of the reaction (the RAFT polymer chains, RAFT-Pn), all start growing at approximately the same time. The forward and reverse reactions of the main RAFT equilibrium are fast, favoring equal growth opportunities amongst the chains. The total number of radicals delivered to the system by the initiator {{during the course of the}} polymerization is low compared to the number of RAFT agent molecules, meaning that the R group initiated polymer chains from the re-initiation step form the majority of the chains in the system, rather than initiator fragment bearing chains formed in the Initiation step. This is important because initiator decomposes continuously during the polymerization, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>at</b> the start, and polymer chains arising from initiator decomposition cannot, therefore, have a narrow length distribution. These mechanistic features lead to an average chain length that increases linearly with the conversion of monomer into polymer.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{it was clear}} that the Fitzroy River {{crossing}} was still inadequate. Seasonal flooding had closed the road several times, and damaged the embankments leading up the bridges. The crossing had been closed for twenty four days in 1982; while in 1983, the most severe flooding since 1914 extensively damaged [...] of the highway, closing it for twenty-five days. To alleviate the problem, two new bridges were built in 1985, and the road was widened and raised [...] above the flood plain. The earthworks for the project included constructing guide banks to direct excess water to flow over floodways, which were protected with rocks. This was designed to minimise the time the road would be closed in such a scenario. The $11million upgraded crossing was opened on 19 December 1985 by the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris. Then, one month later, Cyclone Hector produced 70% more water than the crossing had been designed for. Water overflowed the road all along the flood plain, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>at</b> designated floodways, ravaging the shoulders and then destroying sections of road. [...] of the highway was washed away, leaving the bridges isolated and disconnected. The road was closed from 27 January to 14 February 1986, with $200,000 spent just to make the crossing passable. It was then redesigned and rebuilt at a cost of $1.9million to make it more flood resistant.|$|E
