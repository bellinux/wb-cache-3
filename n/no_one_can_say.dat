5|$|Further {{material}} was {{gleaned from the}} De honesta disciplina of 1504 by Petrus Crinitus, which included extracts from Michael Psellos's De daemonibus, and the De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum (Concerning the mysteries of Egypt…), a book on Chaldean and Assyrian magic by Iamblichus, a 4th-century Neo-Platonist. Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) {{in his first two}} verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.|$|E
5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say.</b> It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
25|$|The riders {{of early}} domesticated horses {{probably}} used {{some type of}} bitless headgear made of sinew, leather, or rope. Components of the earliest headgear {{may be difficult to}} determine, as the materials would not have held up over time. For this reason, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> with certainty which came first, the bitted or the bitless bridle. There is evidence of the use of bits, located in two sites of the Botai in ancient Kazakhstan, dated about 3500-3000 BC. Nose rings appear on the equids portrayed on the Standard of Ur, circa 2600 BC - 2400 BC. To date, the earliest known artistic evidence of use of some form of bitless bridle comes in illustrations of Synian horseman, dated approximately 1400 BC.|$|E

'Wow, honey. I'm speechless. And uncomfortable. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>say</b> you play it safe.'" [...] Pink's love interest is played by Broadway dancer Colt Prattes.|$|R
6000|$|And {{in the air}} are no streets, no channels, <b>no</b> {{point where}} <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> of an antagonist, [...] "If he wants to reach my capital he must come by here." [...] In the air all {{directions}} lead everywhere.|$|R
5000|$|As per 2010 LawNow.org article, {{there is}} some {{question}} as to whether any of the infants were murdered - but perhaps killed by a substance called MBT (mercaptobenzothiazole) that was used in the manufacture of the syringes used to medicate the babies and can mimic digoxin in autopsies. To quote from the epilogue, [...] "Today, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> even <b>say</b> with certainty whether any crimes were ever committed on the pediatric cardiac ward." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{reception}} of the work was divided. Music critic Filippo Filippi in la Perseveranza noted: [...] "This time, Rossini has outdone himself, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> what prevails, science and inspiration. The fugue is worthy of Bach for erudition." [...] A reviewer for L'Illustration wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{begins to}} {{read one of}} his {{childhood}} horror stories to the children, but Michael enters and insists that he stop upsetting the kids. Michael decides to show {{the children and the}} office a video of him as a child (Jake Kalender) during an appearance on a kid's show, where he revealed his dream was to [...] "get married and have 100 kids, so I can have 100 friends, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> 'no' to being my friend." [...] He retreats into his office when he realizes that he never came close to that dream. Toby talks to Michael, who decides to start online dating (with the user name [...] "Little Kid Lover"). After being tormented by Jake all day, Dwight is finally stern with him, which quietly pleases Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Pam wins over Jake with the paper shredder. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) leaves the office early to go on a date, to Pam's chagrin. Michael and Dwight end the party by singing to the children.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{did in fact}} punch a producer, {{knocking}} him down, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> which producer it was. Some writers say it was David O. Selznick, who fired him in anger over script changes for A Star is Born (an adaptation of What Price Hollywood). In Sixty Years of Hollywood, John Baxter (author) [...] asserts the victim was the producer of The Devil is a Sissy and resulted in Brown's being replaced {{as director of the}} film. There is no question about Brown's having punched a producer; {{the question is whether the}} punch was career-ending.|$|E

50|$|What {{the future}} holds <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> exactly <b>say.</b> The long awaited new {{building}} has been promised, but whether it comes about or not the work must and will go on; boys will continue to find here both knowledge and experience and skill of mind and hand and muscle; they will take to heart the school’s motto and courageously seek for wisdom, and {{the world will be}} a better place because of their presence in it and their abiding faith in the high standards of work and conduct which the school has ever striven to uphold.|$|R
5000|$|Roberts {{wrote that}} the Act was immensely {{successful}} [...] "at redressing racial discrimination and integrating the voting process” and noted that the USA has made great progress thanks to the Act. But he added: “If Congress had started from scratch in 2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present coverage formula.” According to the Court, [...] "Regardless of how {{to look at the}} record <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> fairly <b>say</b> that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive,' 'flagrant,' 'widespread,' and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions {{from the rest of the}} nation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Yorkshire did not {{appoint a}} {{professional}} {{captain in the}} 20thcentury until Vic Wilson in 1960, even though Len Hutton captained England as a professional in the 1950s while playing for Yorkshire. [...] Alan Gibson expressed a view that Sutcliffe should have been made captain and posed an intriguing [...] "what if?" [...] scenario by saying that Sutcliffe might then have been appointed England captain in 1931. In that case, Sutcliffe would have led the England tour of Australia in 1932–33 instead of Douglas Jardine. [...] Although Sutcliffe backed Jardine's deployment of the bodyline tactic, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> what tactics he would have adopted himself in Jardine's position. [...] Sutcliffe said later that he regretted having to withdraw his acceptance. His son Billy, who went to a public school and was an amateur player, became Yorkshire captain in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{wrote to}} a friend: [...] "I have never heard such a squalid {{confession}} from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday". In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson (in a letter now lost) saying of Churchill: [...] "If {{there is going to}} be a war – and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that there is not – we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister". Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job".|$|E

60|$|The {{question}} of human immortality {{is the most}} momentous that the mind is capable of conceiving. If {{it is a fact}} that the dead live all other facts are in comparison trivial and without interest. The prospect of obtaining certain knowledge with regard to this stupendous matter is not encouraging. In all countries but those in barbarism the powers of the profoundest and most penetrating intelligences have been ceaselessly addressed to the task of glimpsing a life beyond this life; yet today <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> truly <b>say</b> that he knows. It is as much a matter of faith as ever it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>no</b> telling that--no <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that," [...] put in Deerslayer; [...] "a hound is {{not more}} sartain on the scent than a red-skin, when he expects to get {{anything}} by it. Let this party see scalps afore 'em, or plunder, or honor accordin' to their idees of what honor is, and 't will be a tight log that hides a canoe from their eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{light from}} the hall-lamp struck full on his face; we all involuntarily shrank back, except the girl, who looked, not at the man before her, but first at her aunt and then at her uncle, timorously, and murmured some inaudible question. They did not answer, and now Tedham and his {{daughter}} looked at each other, with what feeling <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> ever fully <b>say.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{terms of}} global {{interpretation}} of the council, Luciani wrote: [...] "The physiognomy {{and structure of the}} Catholic Church have been determined once and for all by the Lord and cannot be touched. If anything, superstructures can. Things that have not been determined by Christ, but were introduced by popes or councils or the faithful, can be changed, or eliminated today or tomorrow. Yesterday they might have introduced a certain number of dioceses, a certain way to lead missions, to educate priests, they might have chosen to follow certain cultural trends. Well, this can be changed and <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> [...] "the Church that comes out of the Council is still {{the same as it was}} yesterday, but renewed". <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>say</b> [...] "We have a new Church, different from what it was".|$|R
6000|$|... "I like Jacob Flanders," [...] wrote Clara Durrant in her diary. [...] "He is so unworldly. He gives himself <b>no</b> airs, and <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> what <b>one</b> {{likes to}} him, though he's {{frightening}} because ..." [...] But Mr. Letts allows little space in his shilling diaries. Clara {{was not the}} one to encroach upon Wednesday. Humblest, most candid of women! [...] "No, no, no," [...] she sighed, standing at the greenhouse door, [...] "don't break--don't spoil"--what? Something infinitely wonderful.|$|R
5000|$|The bill resurfaced again, a year later, {{still under}} the {{sponsorship}} of Sen. Brownback. This time, it also received disapproval from a fellow state official, who reprised the concern of the creative community as an offense to the United States Constitution. Congressman Gary Ackerman of the 5th District of New York expressed that “We need to defend our Constitution. We need to defend freedom of speech, and that is really {{what is at stake}} here. Passing this bill is a huge mistake and this vote will mark a very dark day in American history. We are going down a slippery slope and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> honestly <b>say</b> where it will stop. A vote for this bill is a frontal assault on our Constitution and the protections that it gives to the American people.” ...|$|R

60|$|Miss Rhoda Broughton {{belongs to}} a very {{different}} school. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>say</b> of her that she has tried to separate flippancy from fiction, and whatever harsh criticisms may be passed {{on the construction of}} her sentences, she at least possesses that one touch of vulgarity that makes the whole world kin. We are sorry, however, to see from a perusal of Betty's Visions that Miss Broughton has been attending the meetings of the Psychical Society in search of copy. Mysticism is not her mission, and telepathy should be left to Messrs. Myers and Gurney. In Philistia lies Miss Broughton's true sphere, and to Philistia she should return. She knows more about the vanities of this world than about this world's visions, and a possible garrison town is better than an impossible ghost- land.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Jenkins refused {{to open her}} {{performances}} to the general public, and was clearly aware of her detractors. [...] "People may say I can't sing," [...] she once remarked to a friend, [...] "but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>say</b> I didn't sing." [...] She dismissed her original accompanist, Edwin McArthur, after catching him giving her audience [...] "a knowing smile" [...] during a performance. She {{went to great lengths}} to control access to her rare recitals, which took place at her apartment, in small clubs, and once each October in the Grand Ballroom of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Attendance, by personal invitation only, was restricted to her loyal clubwomen and a select few others. Jenkins handled distribution of the coveted tickets herself, carefully excluding strangers, particularly music critics. [...] "There's no way she could not have known," [...] said Schuman. [...] "No one is that unaware ... she loved the audience reaction and she loved singing. But she knew." ...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most {{watercolor}} artists, who {{paint on}} surfaces which are horizontal {{to keep the}} paint from running, Guati Rojo painted on vertical surfaces. He defied the effect of gravity by painting thin strokes also giving the images more exactness. He {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Water, for me, has always had its mystery. Watercolors do what they want to do. You can´t change them for anything… <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> really <b>say</b> they have dominated the technique. Every time I start a new painting I am terrified that I will fail." [...] Although he did not do self-portraits, he included his likeness in some of his works. One of these is Salome (1984) where the face of John the Baptist is that to the artist with a beard. In El circo de la vida, Guati Rojo appears as one of the clowns. In Homenajo a mi madre (Homage to my mother)(1983), he appears with empty eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "As for fighting, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> {{how long}} these {{troubles}} may last; and I am greatly mistaken if those round Henry of Navarre, when he reaches manhood, {{will not have}} their full share of it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> of Clodd {{that he did}} {{not deserve}} {{whatever}} profit his unlicensed lunatic asylum may have brought him. A kindly man was William Clodd when indulgence in sentiment did not interfere with business.|$|E

2500|$|The {{encyclical}} Humani generis redemptionem from 15 June 1917, {{deals with}} blatant ineffectiveness of Christian preaching. According to Benedict XV, {{there are more}} preachers of the Word than ever before, but [...] "in the state {{of public and private}} morals as well as the constitutions and laws of nations, there is a general disregard and forgetfulness of the supernatural, a gradual falling away from the strict standard of Christian virtue, and that men are slipping back into the shameful practices of paganism." [...] The Pope squarely put part of the blame on those ministers of the Gospel who do not handle it as they should. It is not the times but the incompetent Christian preachers who are to blame, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> today <b>can</b> <b>say</b> for sure that the Apostles were living in better times than ours. Perhaps, the encyclical states, that the Apostles found minds more readily devoted to the Gospel, or they may have met others with less opposition to the law of God.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{before the}} Courier {{published}} these words {{they would have}} been wise to send their representative to me. I have thought the matter out, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else has occasion to do, and it is possible that I might have removed some of the more obvious difficulties of the narrative and brought it one degree nearer to scientific acceptance. Let me then write down the only explanation which seems to me to elucidate what I know to my cost to have been a series of facts. My theory may seem to be wildly improbable, but at least <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> venture to <b>say</b> that it is impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, now, my love," [...] {{continued}} the colonel, [...] "or I fail in my duty. I go shortly to stand {{face to face}} with your parents, my children; for the man who, dying, expects not to meet worthy Hugh Griffith and honest Jack Plowden in heaven can have no clear view of the rewards that belong to lives of faithful service to the country, or of gallant loyalty to the king! I trust <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> justly <b>say</b> that I ever forgot the delicacy due to your gentle sex; but it is no moment for idle ceremony when time is shortening into minutes, and heavy duties remain to be discharged. I could not die in peace, children, were I to leave you here in the wide ocean, I had almost said in the wide world, without that protection which becomes your tender years and still more tender characters. If it has pleased God to remove your guardian, let his place be supplied by those he wills to succeed him!" ...|$|R
