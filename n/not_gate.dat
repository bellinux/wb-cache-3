A <b>NOT</b> <b>gate,</b> on the other hand, is fundamentally different from the majority gate, as shown in Figure 6. The key to this design is that the input is split and both resulting inputs impinge obliquely on the output. In contrast with an orthogonal placement, the electric field effect of this input structure forces a reversal of polarization in the output.|$|E

Figure 5 shows a majority gate with three inputs and one output. In this structure, the electrical field effect of each input on the output is identical and additive, {{with the result that}} whichever input state ("binary 0" [...] or [...] "binary 1") is in the majority becomes the state of the output cell — hence the gate's name. For example, if inputs A and B exist in a “binary 0” state and input C exists in a “binary 1” state, the output will exist in a “binary 0” state since the combined electrical field effect of inputs A and B together is greater than that of input C alone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We give {{improved}} lower bounds for {{the size}} of negation-limited circuits computing Parity and {{for the size}} of negation-limited inverters. An inverter is a circuit with inputs x 1, [...] ., xn and outputs ¬x 1, [...] ., ¬xn. We show that (1) For n = 2 r − 1, circuits computing Parity with r − 1 <b>NOT</b> <b>gates</b> have size at least 6 n − log 2 (n + 1) − O(1) and (2) For n = 2 r − 1, inverters with r <b>NOT</b> <b>gates</b> have size at least 8 n − log 2 (n + 1) − O(1). We derive our bounds above by considering the minimum size of a circuit with at most r <b>NOT</b> <b>gates</b> that computes Parity for sorted inputs x 1 ≥ · · · ≥ xn. For an arbitrary r, we completely determine the minimum size. For odd n, it is 2 n − r − 2 for ⌈log 2 (n + 1) ⌉ − 1 ≤ r ≤ n/ 2, and it is ⌊ 3 / 2 n⌋− 1 for r ≥ n/ 2. We also determine the minimum size of an inverter for sorted inputs with at most r <b>NOT</b> <b>gates.</b> It is 4 n− 3 r for ⌈log 2 (n+ 1) ⌉ ≤ r ≤ n. In particular, the negation-limited inverter for sorted inputs due to Fischer, which is a core component in all the known constructions of negation-limited inverters, is shown to have the minimum possible size. Our fairly simple lower bound proofs use gate elimination arguments. ...|$|R
