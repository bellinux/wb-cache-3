Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, [...] "a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art.... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer Anthony Kiedis to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] while flipping through Kiedis' <b>notebook</b> <b>and</b> instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it {{to the rest of the}} band: [...] "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this.'" [...] Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis recalls that they [...] "got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier".|$|E

Instead of a body, the duo find only a small notebook, which Nathan refuses to allow Elena to read. A small fleet of pirates attack their ship {{and set it on}} fire, destroying any record of their find save for the <b>notebook</b> <b>and</b> Elena's camera. After getting her to safety, Nate holds a private discussion with Victor [...] "Sully" [...] Sullivan (Richard McGonagle), his old friend and mentor. Based on clues provided by the notebook, he theorizes that Drake faked his death to cover up the discovery of El Dorado, an ancient city said to be made entirely of gold. Burdened by severe financial problems, Sully persuades him to help find the city, ditching Elena in port, as he fears that a report on the find will summon competitors.|$|E

The {{evidence}} was overwhelming; the prosecution case highlighted the contents of Lody's <b>notebook</b> <b>and</b> the luggage that he had left at the Roxburgh Hotel, and called a series of witnesses, including the elderly Scottish woman who ran the boarding-house in which he had stayed in Edinburgh and the fashionably dressed Ida McClyment, who caused a stir when she described her meeting with Lody aboard the London to Edinburgh train. Bodkin did not read the incriminating letters aloud, due to the sensitivity of their content, but described them in general terms. The witnesses testified about their interactions with Lody and identified him as the man who had posed as [...] "Charles A. Inglis", though the proprietress of the Edinburgh boarding-house experienced some difficulty. When she [...] "was asked if she could see 'Charles A. Inglis' in court, [...] looked everywhere except at the dock. Lody, who was sitting, stood up and gently waved his hands to attract her attention, while he smiled broadly and almost broke into laughter at the absurdity of the situation." ...|$|E

A.B. {{spoke out}} against the [...] "filler songs" [...] that their father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. wanted on their recordings, and began playing a groove that {{gradually}} became a song. Suzette Quintanilla, the band's drummer, said [...] "we were goofing off" [...] and insisted that after A.B. began playing on his guitar, Selena started singing, coming up with lyrics [...] "as ideas came to her". Pérez, who later eloped with Selena in 1992, wrote that the lyrics Selena came up with were unfamiliar to him despite the singer's habit of spontaneously writing ideas in a <b>notebook</b> <b>and</b> leaving it [...] "wherever around the house". The song was originally used for soundchecks during the band's rehearsals and was then transformed into a short recording by Selena about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean. Pérez said that what was then called [...] "Little Bidi Bubbles" [...] came easily [...] "for everyone in the band." [...] In a 2002 interview {{he said that he}} played a riff using a crybaby (which gave off a wah-wah sound) and that A.B. gave him a [...] "look" [...] that suggested he was impressed with the sound that he had improvised. The riff became the basis of the song before the writing process began.|$|E
