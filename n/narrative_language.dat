He notes: [...] "Loquacity is the illusion of action and engagement [...] The real and the fantastical short-circuit one another." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the ample first-person {{narrative}} Sînt o babă comunistă!, Lungu {{explores the}} theme of nostalgia and its pitfalls. Through introspection and flashbacks, the volume depicts the disorientation and anguish of Emilia (Mica) Apostoae, an aging woman whose longing for the childhood and youth she spent under the communist regime make her block out negative memories of the period. According to Mihaela Ursa, the novel builds on two [...] "extremely productive" [...] sources, [...] "literature about childhood (fed by the tremor of retrospection) and the literature of 'the innocent' (of picaresque extraction)." [...] In Soviany's view, the text recalls the works of Moldovan author Vasile Ernu and elements from classic works in Romanian literature (from Ion Creangă's Childhood Memories to Marin Preda's Moromeții), while Axinte believes it a synthesis of Lungu's own narrative techniques, seeping into [...] "a kind of discourse objectification that has rarely been frequented in recent times." [...] Ciotloș places stress on the work's reworking of communist stereotypes. He argues that Emilia Apostoae's early biography, in particular her migration from village to urban center, assimilates a theme from socialist realism ("the prose works produced and expired during the 1950s"), while the aspects of <b>narrative</b> <b>language</b> incorporate the diverse avatars of speech under ideological pressure, from the [...] "parental and always costly discussions" [...] confronting politically appointed supervisors and their nonconformist employees to subversive forms of Romanian humor and the [...] "wooden tongue" [...] of official speeches. Spread out between these fragments of authentic speech are Lungu's own observations, which prompt Ciotloș to argue: [...] " [...] this is where [...] originality can be found, in the rare moments when he decides to intervene. When he blocks out the verbal stream to produce a funny remark, when he stretches a joke over several chapters, when, instead of diacritics, he places on the cover a majestic and Soviet five-cornered star." ...|$|E

We performed {{quantitative and qualitative}} analyses of content, <b>narrative,</b> and figurative <b>language</b> on 311 opening forum posts. Linguistic patterns indicated a distinction between narrative and figurative functions of language in communication that is sensitive to the concreteness of the content. Individuals were more likely to use narrative to convey concrete psychosocial content, and figurative language to convey abstract psychosocial content. Individuals did not use <b>narrative</b> or figurative <b>language</b> to communicate abstract, technical biomedical content. Although they belong to the biomedical model, concrete physical symptoms receive treatment in a manner more similar to concrete psychosocial content than more abstract, technical biomedical content. Our findings suggest that individuals’ use of <b>narrative</b> and figurative <b>language</b> is largely driven by the concreteness or perceptibility of the underlying content rather than the content domain...|$|R

40|$|Adapting {{fiction has}} been an {{established}} tradition {{since the beginning of}} film. In converting “ fictional language” into “screen-play language,” changes are unavoidable and discrepancies between the two different narrative forms frequent. The Hong Kong “ New Wave ” began in the late 1970 ’s, when a group of young directors, informed by new aesthetic paradigms and different cinematic visions, started to make their own films. Ann Hui, one of these directors, is a representative figure with a diversity of works. She is also the first in Hong Kong to adapt fictional works by Eileen Chang, which include Love in a Fallen City and Eighteen Springs.

30|$|Our {{results provide}} further {{evidence}} for overlap in neurocognitive processing across domains, such as language, music, and visual narratives (Cohn et al., 2014; Magliano et al., 2015; Patel, 2003).

Such parallels are reinforced by our finding that visual narrative comprehension is conditioned by “fluency” in particular visual narrative systems. Because this fluency seems to map onto an anterior–posterior axis it aligns with work on language proficiency, suggesting reliance on domain-general processing that extends {{beyond the scope of}} visual <b>narratives</b> and/or <b>language.</b> Thus, studying visual narratives, and experience with them, can potentially inform our broader understanding of cognitive processes which may otherwise be viewed as domain specific.|$|R
40|$|Speakers use {{differential}} referring expressions in pragmatically appropriate ways {{to produce}} coherent <b>narratives.</b> <b>Languages,</b> however, differ in a) whether REs as arguments can be dropped and b) whether personal pronouns encode gender. We examine two languages {{that differ from}} each other in these two aspects and ask whether the co-reference context and the gender encoding options affect the use of REs differentially. We elicited narratives from Dutch and Turkish speakers about two types of three-person events, one including people of the same and the other of mixed-gender. Speakers re-introduced referents into the discourse with fuller forms (NPs) and maintained them with reduced forms (overt or null pronoun). Turkish speakers used pronouns mainly to mark emphasis and only Dutch speakers used pronouns differentially across the two types of videos. We argue that linguistic possibilities available in languages tune speakers into taking different principles into account to produce pragmatically coherent narrative...|$|R

50|$|Stephan Huber's oeuvre is {{characterized}} by a <b>narrative</b> <b>language</b> which distills the conceptional and experiential world of the artist into striking images with immediate emotional impact. Huber often makes himself the protagonist of his works, thematizing his homeland and childhood as well as giving artistic expression to what he sees, reads, and remembers, and thus delineates the social, geographical, and intellectual horizon within which he moves. The autobiographical references—for example, models of radiantly white mountains, upper middle-class interiors, and his parental home—not only are to be understood as aesthetic psychograms of the artist, but also combine with fictional elements and art-historical, political, or literary references so as to give rise to personally colored but simultaneously universal, archetypal symbols of social or emotional states.|$|E
