25|$|This missile {{will form}} part of the triad in India's <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence,</b> and will provide retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The {{development}} of this missile (under the title Project K-15) started in 1991. The Indian government first confirmed Sagarika's development seven years later (1998), when the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, announced it during a press conference.|$|E
25|$|The {{second phase}} {{remained}} continued until 1998 {{when it was}} abruptly ended by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after imposing economic emergency after ordering to perform capability of <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> in response to Indian nuclear aggression. All stock exchange, stock markets and {{the second phase of}} the privatization programme were immediately halted by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif until his government was ended in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} punk movement explicitly tackled {{issues surrounding}} nuclear warfare. With many punks exhibiting an explicitly pacifist world view {{there was a}} need to challenge the conventional wisdom of <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> and deployment. Much of this sentiment can be found in British punk bands, especially those emerging from the crust punk subgenre such as Amebix or Antisect and the related anarcho-punk subgenre where bands like Flux of Pink Indians made clear their opposition to nuclear warfare.|$|E
5000|$|... "They give every indication, Mr Chairman, {{that they}} don't want a <b>nuclear</b> weapon for <b>deterrence,</b> {{they want a}} nuclear weapon to use it on Israel. So it's a very {{threatening}} situation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Agni [...] V [...] is [...] {{primarily}} [...] for [...] enhancing [...] India’s [...] <b>nuclear</b> [...] <b>deterrence</b> against China. Until recently, {{the longest}} range missile India had was Agni-III {{with a range}} of 3000–3500km. This range was not sufficient to reach targets on the extreme eastern and north- eastern region of China. Most of the important economic centres of China lay on its eastern sea board.|$|R
50|$|Beaufre's thesis, {{that the}} threat of using atomic weapons is the only means for {{worldwide}} stabilization, is pessimistic. His pessimism lies in the contradictions between <b>nuclear</b> and conventional <b>deterrence.</b> When one party develops greater offensive capability than another, instability results.|$|R
25|$|The Polaris A-1 missile was {{developed}} to complement {{the limited number of}} medium-range systems deployed throughout Europe. As those systems lacked the range to attack major Soviet targets, Polaris {{was developed}} to increase the level of <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence.</b> At this time there was little threat of counterforce strikes, as few systems had the accuracy to destroy missile systems. The primary advantages of ballistic missile submarines was their ability to launch submerged, which offered improved survivability for the submarine while also (like their Regulus predecessors) keeping shorter ranged systems within range.|$|E
25|$|Khalilzad {{began his}} {{education}} at the public Ghazi Lycée school in Kabul. He first spent time in the United States as a Ceres, California high school exchange student with AFS Intercultural Programs. Later, he attained his bachelor's and master's degrees from the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. Khalilzad received his PhD at the University of Chicago in the United States, where he studied closely with strategic thinker Albert Wohlstetter, a prominent <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> thinker and strategist, who provided Khalilzad with contacts in the government and with RAND.|$|E
25|$|The Skywarrior {{is one of}} {{only two}} U.S. Navy attack {{aircraft}} intended as a strategic bomber to enter full-scale service (the other being its predecessor, the North American AJ Savage). The carrier-based supersonic North American A-5 Vigilante was also originally designed for strategic nuclear strike missions and initially, very briefly, supplanted the A-3 in that role beginning in the early 1960s. However, with the removal of aircraft carriers from the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), the realization that very high altitude penetration of the Soviet Union was no longer feasible, and the transfer of the U.S. Navy's strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> mission to the Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine force, the Vigilante saw its mission changed to carrier-based tactical air reconnaissance.|$|E
50|$|Historical {{analysis}} {{of nuclear weapons}} deterrent capabilities has led modern researchers {{to the concept of}} the stability-instability paradox, whereby nuclear weapons confer large scale stability between nuclear weapon states, as in over 60 years none have engaged in large direct warfare due primarily to <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>deterrence</b> capabilities, but instead are forced into pursuing political aims by military means in the form of comparatively smaller scale acts of instability, such as proxy wars and minor conflicts.|$|R
5000|$|Preparations for {{the arrival}} of the {{submarine}} squadron went forward with haste throughout the remainder of 1978 and into 1979. Commander Submarine Squadron 16 greeted the submarine tender , when it arrived at Kings Bay on 2 July 1979. Four days later, [...] entered Kings Bay and moored alongside Simon Lake’s starboard side to begin a routine refit in preparation for another <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>deterrence</b> patrol. Kings Bay has been an operating submarine base ever since that time.|$|R

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Deterrence</b> Operations Service Medal was announced by Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James on 27 May 2014. The timing of {{the announcement of the}} medal was very close to the timing of an announcement about the ongoing efforts of Air Force Global Strike Command to improve and reform the nuclear-capable and ICBM career fields. The creation of this medal is part of a multifaceted approach to attract and retain high-caliber personnel in the nuclear and missile operations career fields. The idea for this medal had been circulating within the Air Force for a few years prior to approval, with confirmation as early as 2011 that work was ongoing to develop this award.|$|E
25|$|Together with dr. I. H. Usmani, Salam {{initiated}} {{the deal with}} the United States to established the Pinstech in Nilore and gave its first directorship to nuclear physicist dr. R.M. Chaudhry of the Government College University (GCU). For sometime, the Pinstech became affiliated with the Quaid-i-Azam University in 1967, bearing some special materials testing. Soon, the scientists from Institute of Theoretical Physics at the Quaid-i-Azam University joined the Pinstech to engage research in physics. After the war with India in 1971, President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto orchestrated to established an efforts towards a <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> loosely based on Manhattan Project of the 1940s. Salam took over the operations of PINSTECH institute to oversee the research and development, and its eventual production of the weapons in 1972.|$|E
25|$|But controversially, Benazir Bhutto did not {{authorise}} the directives {{to carry}} out the denationalisation programme or liberalisation of the national economy. No nationalised units were privatised, only few economic regulations were reviewed. Although limited-scale privatisation continued under Benazir Bhutto's second government, the UBL Pakistan and railway consortium was completely nationalised by Benazir Bhutto before being dismissed in 1996. During the second government, the Peoples Party intensified the government control on Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Steel Mills; all shares were kept under government management ownership. In 1998, Prime minister Nawaz Sharif imposed economic emergency after performing <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> in a direct response to India. All state-owned corporations and private sector industries' assets were frozen by Nawaz Sharif after ordering to freeze the private assets under government control to prevent the financial collapse.|$|E
50|$|The navy {{was a major}} {{participant}} in the Vietnam War, blockaded Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and, {{through the use of}} ballistic missile submarines, became an important aspect of the United States' <b>nuclear</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> policy. The U.S. Navy conducted various combat operations in the Persian Gulf against Iran in 1987 and 1988, most notably Operation Praying Mantis. The Navy was extensively involved in Operation Urgent Fury, Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Deliberate Force, Operation Allied Force, Operation Desert Fox and Operation Southern Watch.|$|R
50|$|Production of Regulus was {{phased out}} in January 1959 with {{delivery}} of the 514th missile, and it was removed from service in August 1964. Some of the obsolete missiles were expended as targets at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Regulus not only provided the first <b>nuclear</b> strategic <b>deterrence</b> force for the United States Navy during {{the first years of}} the Cold War and especially during the Cuban Missile Crisis, preceding the Polaris missiles, Poseidon missiles, and Trident missiles that followed, but it was also the forerunner of the Tomahawk cruise missile.|$|R
50|$|William Martin {{was also}} {{involved}} in the conceptualization {{and implementation of the}} National Program Office. The National Program was established to ensure continuity of the United States government in the even of a <b>nuclear</b> attack. This <b>deterrence</b> system was later adapted following the 9/11 attacks to protect the US government {{in the event of a}} hostile terrorist attack.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, India {{carried out}} nuclear tests {{and a few}} days later, Pakistan responded with more nuclear tests giving both {{countries}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> capability, although India had tested one hydrogen bomb which Pakistan lacked. Diplomatic tensions eased after the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the Kargil district of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were supposed to be reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital Srinagar-Leh Highway (NH 1A), Batalik and Dras.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War {{and facing}} the threats of the newly {{emerging}} Cold War, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was keen not only preserve but to strengthen its strategic capabilities. In particular, RAF Bomber Command sought to replace its inventory of wartime bombers with more capable models that would take advantage of the latest technologies, such as jet propulsion and nuclear weapons. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, an entirely new jet-powered bomber fleet comprising three aircraft, the Vickers Valiant, the Avro Vulcan, and Handley Page Victor, which were collectively known as the V-bombers, were developed and introduced to service with the RAF. The V-bombers were purpose-built to be armed with the first generation of Britain's nuclear weapons, designated as Blue Danube, and served as the airborne carriers of Britain's <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence</b> for many years.|$|E
25|$|Post–Second World War {{economic}} and political decline, as well as changing attitudes in British society and government, were reflected by the armed forces' contracting global role, and later epitomised by its political defeat during the Suez Crisis (1956). Reflecting Britain's new {{role in the world}} and the escalation of the Cold War (1947–1991), the country became a founding member of the NATO military alliance in 1949. Defence Reviews, such as those in 1957 and 1966, announced significant reductions in conventional forces, the pursuement of a doctrine based on <b>nuclear</b> <b>deterrence,</b> and a permanent military withdrawal East of Suez. By the mid-1970s, the armed forces had reconfigured to focus on the responsibilities allocated to them by NATO. The British Army of the Rhine and RAF Germany consequently represented the largest and most important overseas commitments that the armed forces had during this period, while the Royal Navy developed an anti-submarine warfare specialisation, with a particular focus on countering Soviet submarines in the Eastern Atlantic and North Sea.|$|E
50|$|Cohen has {{researched}} {{various issues}} {{with regard to}} <b>nuclear</b> weapons, including <b>deterrence,</b> morality, and proliferation. His seminal work, Israel and the Bomb, which chronicled the Israeli nuclear program, was published in 1998. This book led him to encounter problems with the Israeli censor, and provoked substantial legal difficulties upon his return to Israel to give a keynote speech at an academic conference.|$|R
40|$|For NATO's {{first four}} decades the {{overwhelming}} {{threat to its}} members' security arose from the enormous military strength of the Soviet Union … the allies were unable to match the numerical levels of the Warsaw Pact's conventional armaments and manpower. This … underlined the key role of <b>nuclear</b> weapons in <b>deterrence,</b> ensuring {{that the cost of}} aggression was plainly too high for any attacker to contemplate...|$|R
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of massive retaliation {{was based on}} the West's increasing fear at the perceived imbalance of power in conventional forces, a corresponding inability to defend itself or prevail in conventional conflicts. By relying on a large <b>nuclear</b> arsenal for <b>deterrence,</b> President Eisenhower believed that conventional forces could be reduced while still maintaining military prestige and power and the capability to defend the western bloc.|$|R
