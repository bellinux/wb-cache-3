5|$|Galland {{succeeded in}} {{temporarily}} persuading Milch to support cancelling the Me 209 program {{in favour of}} producing 100 Me 262s {{by the end of}} 1943. However, because of persistent problems with its turbojet engines and later, Hitler's determination {{to use it as a}} bomber, the Me 262 was <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> as a fighter until late in the war.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{insects that}} go through {{incomplete}} metamorphosis are called nymphs {{or in the}} case of dragonflies and damselflies, also naiads. Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings, which are <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> until adulthood. With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects.|$|E
50|$|In addition, another {{disorder}} {{associated with}} the lateral rectus muscle is Duane Syndrome. This syndrome occurs when the sixth cranial nerve which controls the lateral rectus muscle does <b>not</b> <b>develop</b> properly. The reason why the nerve does <b>not</b> <b>develop</b> correctly is <b>not</b> completely understood.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{extraction}} process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction, was <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> {{in time to}} be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the modern}} sweet orange carrot was <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> until the 16th century, in the Low Countries, {{it has been}} {{represented}} as a tradition, and it was once customary for English people to eat Crécy soup annually on 26 August in commemoration of {{the anniversary of the}} Battle of Crécy, which occurred in Crécy, France on that date in 1346.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage {{was most}} likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, {{although}} savoys were <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage heads are generally picked {{during the first year}} of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Great {{confidence}} {{was placed in}} being able to reduce the noise of a turbojet and massive strides by SNECMA in silencer design were reported during the programme. However, by 1974 the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective. The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise but it was <b>not</b> <b>developed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E

5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> such weapons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{has made}} use of {{technologies}} such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which {{is a type of}} Radioisotope thermoelectric generator used on space missions. Shortages of this material have curtailed deep space missions {{since the turn of the}} millennia. An example of a spacecraft that was <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.|$|E

5|$|Scandium {{is present}} {{in most of the}} {{deposits}} of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> until the 1970s. The positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of scandium oxide is about 10 tonnes per year.|$|E
5|$|Since 1992, {{the city}} has {{undergone}} several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had <b>not</b> <b>developed,</b> {{and did not}} employ {{radioactive}} poisons, so Operation Peppermint {{was never}} put into effect. After VE-Day, the equipment and all the documents relating to Operation Peppermint were collected, returned to the United States, and {{handed over to the}} Manhattan Project. However, the effort put into developing portable radiation detection equipment was not wasted. Survey teams from the Manhattan Project used the equipment to assess the fallout from the Trinity nuclear test, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Operation Crossroads, during which 10,000 film badges were used.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.35 million viewers in the UK and {{achieved}} an Appreciation Index of 85. Reviewers were generally positive about the episode; some praised the setting and characters but others commented that the story had <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> enough {{even though it was}} only the first part. The computer-generated effects used for one scene were also disapproved of by a couple of reviewers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|This form is {{very common}} in castles adapted for guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and {{elsewhere}} in between. Other types of port, though less common, were horizontal slits– allowing only lateral movement– and large square openings, which allowed greater movement. The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, {{such as that of}} Château de Ham in France. Defences against guns were <b>not</b> <b>developed</b> until a later stage. Ham {{is an example of the}} trend for new castles to dispense with earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.|$|E
