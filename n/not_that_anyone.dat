5000|$|The huge {{kingdom of}} Takicardia is {{ruled by a}} king under the {{unwieldy}} title of Charles V + III = VIII + VIII = XVI. He’s a heartless ruler, hated by his people {{as much as he}} hates them. The king is fond of hunting, but is unfortunately cross-eyed - <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> would dare acknowledge this in front of him, as the numerous statues and paintings that adorn the palace and the land show. Occasionally the king does hit his target though, notably the wife of the bird, known only as [...] "l'Oiseau", the narrator of the story who takes pleasure in taunting the terrible king at every opportunity.|$|E
5000|$|While not {{reviewed}} by critics in mainstream media, The Hunt for Eagle One did garner some interest from internet bloggers and critics. Nix in BeyondHollywood.com said, [...] "For an action film on a budget, 'The Hunt for Eagle One' {{is more than}} decent entertainment. A bigger budget and longer shooting schedule, not to mention about 30 extra minutes added to the running time, would have fleshed out the characters and the political situation in the Philippines [...] To be sure, the script for “Eagle One” doesn’t show much interest in being substantive on a geopolitical level, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> should notice, as that particular niche is currently filled up by Hollywood ala “Syriana” and others. Which leaves you to wonder what Brian Clyde and company could have done with 'Syriana's budget ... Hopefully, we’ll get to find out one day." ...|$|E

I haven't got a record deal, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> one has record deals now. I was {{supposed}} to sign back with Trevor Horn for it. He picked it up and I thought if Trevor does that I could have a worldwide fucking hit. He said {{it was the best thing}} he'd heard in ages, but then it got down to the business side of everything, and I just thought I can't go down that road again. They tried to boss me around thinking I'm still sixteen or whatever. I can't go backwards instead of forwards. But I've gone through so much, and this is the most revolutionary thing I have ever written. I know it is outstanding. I've lived with it so long. It fucking is... I know it is.|$|E
50|$|Early in 1992 {{the science}} fiction writer Orson Scott Card {{reviewed}} reissues of several Diana Wynne Jones novels. He wrote concerning Witch Week:Thus {{it is that}} underneath {{what seems to be}} rather low comedy—brooms that demand to be taken riding by witches (and hoes and rakes and mops that can be ridden, but behave more like mules and pigs than noble steeds); prankster spells at about the level of magic spitwads—there is a continuous foundation of truth. Children need powerful adult intervention to help them get control of their powers and keep their powers from taking control of them. Instead of using them for immediate self-gratification, the children instead have to create and respect certain limits in order to avoid destroying themselves and others. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> ever says such a thing outright. Rather the stories are that lesson, learned over and over again, yet with such humor and extravagant imagination and devastating satire that few readers will imagine that they are being civilized as they read.|$|E
40|$|There is one truth, {{but many}} truths: i. e., one unambiguous, non-relative truth-concept, but many and various {{proposition}}s that are true. One truth-concept: {{to say that}} a proposition is true is to say (<b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone,</b> or everyone, believes it, but) that things are as it says; but many truths: particular empirical claims, scientific theories, historical propositions, mathematical theorems, logical principles, textual interpretations, state-ments about what a person wants or believes or intends, about gram-matical and legal rules, etc., etc. But, as Frank Ramsey once said, “There is no platitude so obvious that eminent philosophers have not de-nied it”; and as soon as you ask why anyone would deny that there is one truth-concept, or that there are many true propositions, it becomes apparent that my initial, simple formula disguises many complexities...|$|E

40|$|Great Aunt Oleander is dead. To {{each of her}} nearest and dearest she {{has left}} a seed pod. The seed pods might be deadly, but then again they might also contain the secret of enlightenment. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> has much time for enlightenment. Fleur, left behind at the {{crumbling}} Namaste House, must step into Oleander's role as guru to lost and lonely celebrities. Bryony wants to lose the weight she put on after her botanist parents disappeared, but can't stop drinking. And Charlie struggles {{to make sense of}} his life after losing the one woman he could truly love. A complex and fiercely contemporary tale of inheritance, enlightenment, life, death, desire and family trees, The Seed Collectors is the most important novel yet from one of the world's most daring and brilliant writers. As Henry James said of George Eliot's Middlemarch, The Seed Collectors is a 'treasurehouse of detail' revealing all that it means to be connected, {{to be part of a}} society, to be part of the universe and to be human...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{some ideas}} for systems projects. We usually do {{about six or}} seven projects in a 15 -week semester, meaning one every two weeks or so. The first few are usually done by a single student, and the last few in groups of size two. Each semester, the projects follow this same outline; however, we vary the details to keep it interesting and make “sharing ” of code across semesters more challenging (<b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> would do that!). We also use the Moss tool [M 94] to look for this kind of “sharing”. As for grading, we’ve tried a number of different approaches, each of which have their strengths and weaknesses. Demos are fun but time consuming. Automated test scripts are less time intensive but require a great deal of care to get them to carefully test interest-ing corner cases. Check the book web page for more details on these projects; if you’d like the automated test scripts, we’d be happy to share. 106. 1 Intro Project The first project is an introduction to systems programming. Typ-ical assignments have been to write some variant of the sort utility, with different constraints. For example, sorting text data, sorting bi-nary data, and other similar projects all make sense. To complete the project, one must get familiar with some system calls (and their return error codes), use a few simple data structures, and not much else...|$|E

All {{the makings of a}} Guetta classic are present and correct, and Cudi's nonchalant, mellow vocals are pleasant enough, but it all feels that bit too familiar. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that 'Memories' adds nothing new to a sound that seemingly took over the world in '09 - <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>anyone's</b> going to grumble when it comes on at Oceana this Friday night, of course".|$|R
