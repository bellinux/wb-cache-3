40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to find some important characteristics of rubber gutter compound such as tensile strength, elongation at break, and constant deflection because of adding Phenyl Beta <b>Naphtylamine</b> on it. Rubber gutter compound was made from mixing of natural (RSS) and synthetic rubber (SBR) and some aditives such Zink Oxide, Stearic Acid, Napthenic Oil, HAF black, Phenyl Beta <b>Naphtylamine,</b> Mercapto Benz Thiazol Disulfide, Diphenyl Guanidine and Sulphur. Three compositions of RSS/SBR and Phenyl Beta <b>Naphtylamine</b> were used in {{the research}}, namely 40 / 60; 50 / 50; 60 / 40, and 1 : 1, 5; 2 respectively. A statistical procedure was used to analyze the data of the physical characteristic of rubber gutter compound produced. The results were compared to the data of the physical characteristic of rubber gutter compound produced. The results were compared to the physical strength of rubber gutter available in the market. From the statistical analyses they denoted that the levels of Phenyl Beta <b>Naphtylamine</b> gave significant effects on elongation at break and constant deflection however there was no effect on tensile strength. The composition levels of RSS /SBR could produce compounds which were significant difference in the tensile strength, elongation at break and constant deflection. Compounds resulted from this research had better tensile strength and elongation compared to rubber gutter available in the market...|$|E
40|$|Odorant binding {{proteins}} (OBPs) {{are small}} (around 14 kDa) soluble proteins {{isolated from the}} sensory organs {{of a wide range}} of insect species. OBP reversely bind odorants with dissociation constants in the micromolar range and are good candidate for transporting hydrophobic odorant molecules to olfactory receptors, through the aqueous sensillar lymph. In the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, 52 OBPs with high sequence divergence have been identified. Amongst them, OBP 28 a is one of the most abundant odorant binding proteins suggesting an important physiological role. A recent study proposed a novel role for this OBP in buffering changes in the odor environment (Larter et al., 2016). To further unravel and decipher the physiological role of this OBP, we investigated the ligand binding and physicochemical characterization of the recombinant OBP 28. We report the heterologous secretion of OBP 28 a using the yeast Pichia Pastoris. The purified OBP 28 a was characterized using mass spectrometry, circular dicroism and gel filtration coupled to multi-angle static light scattering. We found that OBP 28 a is monomeric with the expected secondary structure content. Using N-phenyl <b>naphtylamine</b> as competitive fluorescent probe, OBP 28 a was shown to bind a family of attractive floral-like chemical compounds with micro-molar affinities. These results pave the way for three-dimensional investigations, experiments made feasible by the large amount of recombinant protein produced, with the aim of clearly defining the relationships between the structure and function of this drosophila OBP.
