50|$|Entered {{into service}} in 1935, the Breda Mod. 35, {{together}} with the SRCM Mod. 35 and the OTO Mod. 35 represented {{the new generation of}} hand grenades with which the Royal Italian Army faced the Second World War. It is an offensive type hand grenade, made up of an aluminium cylindrical body with the two trunk-conical shaped ends of, painted red and loaded with 63 grams of TNT-dinitronaphthalene {{that at the time of}} the explosion projects splinters in a radius of 10 meters.The device consists of the charge carrier, the detonator, the capsule and the <b>needle</b> <b>carrier.</b> It has two safeties, an ordinary one consisting of a rubber flap attached to a plate with two branches, and an automatic one consisting of headphones, cross bar and brass tape delay.|$|E
40|$|A laparoscopic suturing device {{includes}} a handle and a shaft mounted to the handle. A toggle knob {{is adapted to}} rotate the shaft about its longitudinal axis. A pair of opposed jaws, each having a hollow structure, open and close relative to one another. A <b>needle</b> <b>carrier</b> and a needle holder are respectively slideably disposed in a lumen of a first and a second jaw. A needle has first and second pointed ends and is adapted to be press fit into the lumen of the first jaw with the first pointed end exposed and alternatively into the lumen of the second jaw with the second pointed end exposed. A spring-loaded pusher advances and retracts the <b>needle</b> <b>carrier</b> when the toggle knob is in a first position and advances and retracts the needle holder when in a second position. The tool assists a surgeon in suturing tissue captured between the jaws...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{simplified}} the Blom-Singer 1 puncture. The fistula is formed {{with the help}} of his new device, the endo-extralaryngeal <b>needle</b> <b>carrier</b> and pointed metal cone fixed to a catheter. The voice prosthesis is placed in the fistula formed thus in an endo-extra oesophagotracheal way. The advantage of the method is, that when the fistula being formed from inside out, the back wall of the oesophagus will not become injured...|$|E
40|$|Severe type III laryngomalacia LM is {{represented}} by a retroflexed epiglottis that touches the posterior pharyngeal wall and obstructs the laryngeal inlet. Endoscopic epiglottopexy is advised in such cases wherein pexy sutures are passed between the epiglottis and base of tongue. Using conventional needle carriers, {{it is difficult to}} pass such sutures that go deep enough into the tongue base. Such a pexy is prone to a break down. We describe a novel technique of placing these glossoepiglottic sutures using the Lichtenberger's <b>needle</b> <b>carrier.</b> We used this technique in three patients with excellent results and report no complications. We propose to use this technique in cases of epiglottic prolapse seen in severe LM and certain hypotonic conditions...|$|E
40|$|US 2002055752 A UPAB: 20020802 NOVELTY - A <b>needle</b> <b>carrier</b> (2) is {{arranged}} {{at one end}} of an elongated holder such that the needle seat (3) is extended radially to form overhang projection beyond the periphery of the holder. Several needles (7) are arranged vertically on the projection of the needle seat, surrounding the holder. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following: (1) Blood vessel joining method; (2) Blood vessel joining device usage method. USE - For coronary by-pass surgery, vascular surgery, for treatment of stenosis, occlusions, strictures and thromboses in peripheral arteries and in surgery of gastrointestinal tract. ADVANTAGE - By the needle seat arrangement, the rear wall of the vessels are protected from the needles, hence vessels are joined simply and safely...|$|E
40|$|Leaf {{chlorophyll}} {{content in}} coniferous forest canopies, {{a measure of}} stand condition, is the target of studies and models linking leaf reflectance and transmittance and canopy hyperspectral reflectance imagery. The viability of estimation of needle chlorophyll content from airborne hyperspectral optical data through inversion of linked leaf level and canopy level radiative transfer models is discussed in this paper. This study is focused on five sites of Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) in the Algoma Region (Canada), where field, laboratory and airborne data were collected in 1998 and 1999 campaigns. Airborne hyperspectral CASI data of 72 bands in the visible and near-infrared region and 2 m spatial resolution were collected from 20 20 m study sites of Jack Pine in 2 consecutive years. It was found that needle chlorophyll content could be estimated at the leaf level (r 2 = 0. 4) by inversion of the PROSPECT leaf model from needle reflectance and transmittance spectra collected with a special <b>needle</b> <b>carrier</b> apparatus coupled to the Li-Cor 1800 integrating sphere. The Jack Pine forest stands {{used for this study}} with LAI > 2, and the high spatial resolution hyperspectral reflectance collected, allowed the use of the SPRINT canopy reflectance model coupled to PROSPECT for needle chlorophyll content estimation by model inversion. The optical index R 750 / R 710 was used as the merit function in the numerical inversion to minimize the effect of shadows and LAI variation in the mean canopy reflectance from the 20 20 m plots. Estimates of needle pigment content from airborne hyperspectral reflectance using this linked leafcanopy model inversion methodology showed an r 2 = 0. 4 and RMSE = 8. 1 Ag/cm 2 when targeting sunlit crown pixels in Jack Pine sites with pigment content ranging between 26. 8 and 56. 8 Ag/cm 2 (1570 â€“ 3320 Ag/g).
