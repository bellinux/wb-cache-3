5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first <b>night</b> <b>because,</b> according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the first night fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England, once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at <b>night</b> <b>because</b> of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E
5|$|In {{the police}} commissioner's Annual Report for 1919, Curtis {{presented}} {{his view of}} the strike. He argued that he had not even needed the requested State Guards for the strike's first <b>night</b> <b>because</b> the city remained quiet and he had reports that many policemen would not join the strike. By {{the end of the year}} the strikers had formed a new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{cinematography}} {{was shot}} at <b>night,</b> <b>because</b> Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less believable. Bakshi recounts that during {{the first day of}} shooting, the actors were unable to play their roles naturally, but began casually talking and acting the way he wanted their characters to act when the cameras were off, including flirting with an actress. However, the camera man was not around to capture these events, so Bakshi filmed them himself. When Bakshi excitedly told William A. Fraker about this, Fraker quit the production, and was replaced by a young cinematographer who had never worked in film before.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} at the Budich Institute, Maeser came across Die Mormonen, an anti-Mormon book, by Moritz Busch. He and Edward Schoenfield, Maeser's brother-in-law and fellow teacher, decided to investigate the beliefs and practices of the LDS Church. Maeser wrote letters to missionaries of the church; missionary William Budge volunteered to go to Maeser's home to teach him and answer his questions. Both Maeser and Schoenfield joined the LDS Church. Maeser was baptized by Franklin D. Richards and Budge on October 14, 1855, in the Elbe River. Maeser was baptized at <b>night</b> <b>because</b> the church was banned in Germany at that time. Maeser was the first Mormon baptized in Saxony. His wife, Anna, was baptized shortly after on October 19. The following Sunday, a new branch of the church was established in Dresden, and Maeser became the first president. He {{and his family were}} forced to leave Germany by the Dresden police in July 1856, and would eventually travel to Salt Lake City, where Latter-day Saints were gathering.|$|E

5000|$|After the Civil War, Whitesborough {{grew into}} a {{frontier}} town where female residents were prohibited from leaving their homes on Saturday <b>nights</b> <b>because</b> shootings were so common. Whitesborough had a population of 500, saloons, several stores, and other businesses when it was incorporated on June 2, 1873. By 1879, it had a bank, a newspaper, and train service from Denison on {{a line from the}} Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad. In 1887, it altered the spelling of its name to [...] "Whitesboro".|$|R
25|$|M. flavitarsis nests {{are often}} invaded by moths (Chalcoela iphitalis) at <b>night</b> <b>because</b> the wasps cannot see them.

M. flavitarsis do {{not attempt to}} rid the nest of the parasite. Instead, they will continue as a nest or abandon and renest elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy that}} is {{extracted}} from the air is ultimately derived from the sun, so this {{can be considered a}} form of solar power. Energy production continues at <b>night,</b> <b>because</b> air retains some of the day's heat after dark. However, power generation by the energy tower is affected by the weather: it slows down each time the ambient humidity increases (such as during a rainstorm), or the temperature falls.|$|E
25|$|Caroline {{returned}} on 9 March 1977 on 953kHz, actually 315 metres but {{announced as}} 319. This gave reasonable reception by day but strong heterodyne interference at <b>night</b> <b>because</b> the transmitter crystal was off-channel. In July Caroline {{moved to the}} adjacent channel, 962kHz (312 metres but still called 319) and reception in the UK improved. Meanwhile, Radio Mi Amigo had interference on 1562kHz and changed to 1412kHz (212 m).|$|E

Three cases suffered periumbilical infection at the trocar entry site and were treated efficiently with antibiotics. Five cases reported spontaneous pregnancy during the first-year follow-up.|$|R
25|$|The Talmud in Pesahim (p.2a) {{derives from}} the Torah that the search for chametz be {{conducted}} {{by the light of}} a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the chametz (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at <b>night</b> <b>because</b> the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all chametz from one's possession.|$|E
25|$|ASL makes {{heavy use}} of time-sequenced {{ordering}}, meaning that events are signed {{in the order}} in which they occur. For example, for I was late to class last <b>night</b> <b>because</b> my boss handed me a huge stack of work after lunch yesterday, one would sign 'yesterday lunch finish, boss give-me work big-stack, night class late-me'. In stories, however, ordering is malleable, since one can choose to sequence the events either in {{the order in which}} they occurred or in the order in which one found out about them.|$|E

25|$|Mermaids {{who live}} in the waters near Neverland reside within the Mermaids' Lagoon. They are {{described}} as being very beautiful and mysterious creatures but equally just as vain and malevolent. Barrie states in the novel Peter and Wendy that the mermaids are only friendly to Peter, and that they will intentionally splash or even attempt to drown anyone else if they come close enough. It is especially dangerous for mortals to go to Mermaids' Lagoon at <b>night,</b> <b>because</b> that's when the mermaids sing hauntingly in the moonlight and utter strange wailing cries to attract potential victims.|$|E
25|$|One Taíno oral {{tradition}} {{explains that the}} Sun and Moon come out of caves. Another story tells of people who once lived in caves and only came out at <b>night,</b> <b>because</b> {{it was believed that}} the Sun would transform them. The Taíno believed they were descended from the union of Deminán Caracaracol and a female turtle. The origin of the oceans is described in the story of a huge flood, which occurred when a father murdered his son (who was about to murder the father). The father put the son's bones into a gourd or calabash. When the bones turned into fish, the gourd broke, and all the water of the world came pouring out.|$|E

Bratton of Little Rock. Jones continued to support the cases, and in 1923 the Supreme Court ruled in Moore v. Dempsey that, for the first time, collateral attack through habeas corpus was permissible on a state appellate court decision. It was a landmark precedent that marked the Court's review of state criminal cases {{from the point of view}} of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. During the trials, Jones received frequent lynching threats while in Arkansas. He was said to have shifted his location each <b>night</b> <b>because</b> of the risk to his safety.|$|E
