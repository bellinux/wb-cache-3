500|$|The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its {{commitment}} to Bryant by stating that it [...] "wholeheartedly support(ed)" [...] her right to free speech, praising her [...] "courageous leadership on a moral issue that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> decide, we're only going to lose. I wish she would just resign." [...] Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.|$|E
500|$|Tonight is {{a concept}} album that explores the highs and lows {{associated}} with an evening of debauchery, as stated by a critic on online publication Ventvox. [...] "This album covers all its bases from the initial excitement of the early evening to the numbness of the morning after", writes the reviewer. The line [...] "come on, let's get high" [...] from [...] "Ulysses", the album's first track, reveals this theme. The album has been influenced by non-British music. It has been inspired by the [...] "heavy dub sound of Jamaican reggae stars" [...] and has [...] "the heavy bass and space echo you would find on a dub mix." [...] The album also has somewhat of an African influence. Alex Kapranos stated in an XFM article that [...] "We're one of these bands that are always gonna sound the same <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do, {{but there are other}} influences there. I guess the drums are a little different, Paul has been listening to a lot of African stuff so that's gonna come through." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1940s, Hart had sunk into {{alcoholism}} and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and [...] prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein {{to ask if}} he would consider working with him. [...] Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was Oklahoma! (1943). [...] Thomas Hischak states, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, that Oklahoma! is [...] "the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. [...] In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma! and what came after it." [...] An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, Oklahoma! would serve, according to Hischak, as [...] "the model for Broadway shows for decades", and proved a huge popular and financial success. [...] Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair. [...] Movie producer Sam Goldwyn saw Oklahoma! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers [...] "was Sam's blunt but funny way of telling me that I'd never create another show as good as Oklahoma!" [...] As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, [...] "We're such fools. [...] <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another Oklahoma!

500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E

2500|$|He accuses {{animal rights}} advocates of [...] "pre-scientific" [...] anthropomorphism, {{attributing}} traits to animals that are, he says, Beatrix Potter-like, where [...] "only man is vile." [...] It is within this fiction that {{the appeal of}} animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.|$|E

2500|$|Historians {{have been}} divided {{as to whether}} Heisenberg and his team were {{sincerely}} trying to construct a nuclear weapon, or whether their failure reflected a desire not to succeed {{because they did not}} want the Nazi regime to have such a weapon. This latter view, largely based on postwar interviews with Heisenberg and Weizsäcker, was put forward by Robert Jungk in his 1957 book Brighter Than a Thousand Suns. In a 1957 interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel, Weizsäcker frankly admitted to the scientific ambitions of those years [...] "We wanted to know if chain reactions were possible. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would end up doing with our knowledge– we wanted to know."

2500|$|The Devil {{is nearly}} indestructible, and scoffs {{at the idea}} that he could be {{contained}} within a Solomon's cage (which can confine the strongest demon). He also has superhuman strength, having tricked and placed Sam once in a painful arm-hold to interrogate him. However, the Devil can be affected by angelic relics, as he can be killed by the Sword of the Archangel Michael (which he has in safekeeping), and could be [...] "destroyed" [...] if the whole world were to turn to pacifism (as Sam deduced after the Devil's near-annihilation of a demon rebellion, as if the Devil couldn't tempt others with sin, he would cease to exist - although the Devil notes that all humanity adopting complete pacifism would be nearly impossible). In addition, the Devil cannot see, hear, or appear within curves or circles, although he can be summoned within a circle. He holds no influence over true love, which may be attributed to his belief that humans are incapable of experiencing it. The Devil also confesses that even though he tried to overthrow God, he still loved Him when Sam asked the Devil about love. He confesses to Sam that God loves us all <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are.|$|E
