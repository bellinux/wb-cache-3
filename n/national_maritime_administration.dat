40|$|The article {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} the apparently contradictory findings in recent research about accident rates in shipping and IMO implementation records. It is argued here that although IMO conventions have probably greatly improved shipping safety, they cannot credibly be held to be the chief cause of reduced accident rates as claimed in a recent Marine Policy article, when the documented failures of flag state and port state implementation continue to leave vessels sailing with grave deficiencies. The present analysis posits and corroborates a cluster of linked tendencies that jointly undermine IMO implementation. The core problem is IMO's weak connection to the <b>national</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>administrations,</b> leading to broadly discretionary practices, exacerbated by language difficulties. Adding new rules is no panacea, as new rules in some cases negatively affect the functioning of existing regulations, and sometimes seem motivated mainly to show political alertness. The structural weakness of the IMO/member state link is the core implementation problem that urgently needs {{to be dealt with}} if marine safety is to be improved. The concluding section proposes a reform to bring the IMO out of this conundrum and ensure effective implementation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{maritime}} safety {{is widely used}} in regulations, recommendations and guidelines, e. g. SOLAS (IMO, 1974), in the shipping domain. Various regulators (e. g. IMO, <b>national</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>administrations)</b> define this concept as the overall goal {{which is to be}} achieved by measures such as Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS), Vessel Traffic Service (VTS), and fairway design etc. Common is also the introduction of new technology, e. g. decision support systems, with the aim to improve this specific type of safety. To the best of my knowledge, most of the research in the shipping domain connected to safety issues has up to now focused on technology development or on quantitative measures of performance in simulated environments (e. g. Sablowski, 1989; Perdok & Wewerinke, 1995; Hockey et al., 2003; Stitt, 2003; Koester & SÃ¸rensen 2004; Hetherington et al., 2006). It has also been a common approach to study maritime safety by assessing the safety culture on board (Ek, Olsson, & Akselsson, 2000) as well as to identify the human element or human error as the root of accidents in this domain (e. g. Schager, 2008; Zachau, 2008). Although there is a large body of quantitative research, the results of these studies fail to explain maritime safety as a concept from a crew perspective. Therefore this qualitative study has been conducted to derive insights in how crew members on board of merchant vessels define, promote and act in relation to the concept maritime safety. The preliminary results {{of this study indicate that}} maritime safety from the crew perspective is more than what is stated in legal national and international guidelines, rules and regulations. The work the individual crew member conducts in relation to safety consists of actions taken based on knowledge and experience. The resources and precondition for the work on board are highly dependent on the investments a company is willing to make to promote safety. Further, instead of identifying the human as the failing part in the system, it should be considered that the crew members actively shape and promote maritime safety by the work that they are conducting within the boundaries set by external parties. Finally, rather than introducing more technology, there should be considerations on what type of systems and services are needed to conduct the safety-related activities carried out daily by the crew members to maintain a constant level of safety...|$|R
