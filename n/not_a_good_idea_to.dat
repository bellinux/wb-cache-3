500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> {{have a lot of people}} around because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E

2500|$|Marr and {{his wife}} Angie have been {{together}} since 1979, before the Smiths formed. They have two children, Sonny and Nile Marr; Nile is also a musician, {{best known as the}} frontman of the band Man Made. Having resided in Portland, Oregon, for more than five years, the family returned to Britain for Marr to record his solo album in Manchester. Marr initially gave up meat around 1985 in solidarity with Morrissey and Angie. He stated: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> have a number one album called Meat Is Murder and be seen eating a bacon sarnie." [...] After hanging out with American rap group Naughty By Nature, he was inspired by their philosophy of strength through health, and soon after quit drinking, smoking and converted to veganism. Marr is a keen runner, and completed the 2010 New York Marathon in a time of 3:54:18. He is a supporter of Manchester City football club and has been seen attending games.|$|E

2500|$|At school, Garner had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} the work of Aeschylus and Homer, as well as the Ancient Greek language. Thus, he decided to pursue the study of Classics at Magdalen College, Oxford, passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic. He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his [...] "cultural background" [...] and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who [...] "could not cope with me, and I could not cope with" [...] them. Looking back, he remarked, [...] "I soon learned that it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> come home excited over irregular verbs". In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of Mark Antony in a performance of William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra where he co-starred alongside Dudley Moore and where Kenneth Baker was the stage manager. In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956. He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained [...] "a permanent strength through all my life".|$|E
