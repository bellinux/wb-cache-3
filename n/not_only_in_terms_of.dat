The album presents a different sound from their debut album, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> lyrics but in sound, the band privileged long guitar riffs, and the drums themselves feel more present and loud in the final mix of the album.

25|$|The {{result of}} the battle was an {{overwhelming}} Spanish victory, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> casualties in favour to the Spaniards, {{also in terms of}} immediate strategic consequences. The position of Francis, Duke of Anjou, became impossible to hold with the States-General of the Netherlands, and he eventually left the Low Countries in late June. The defeat {{and the end of the}} Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours was a severe blow to the Dutch Protestants and discredited William of Orange, his main supporter. Moreover, the Spanish progress was unstoppable, and the Prince of Parma moved to Dunkirk, city blocked by the forces of the Spanish commander Don Cristóbal de Mondragón. On July 16, the bombardment began, and a few days later, the city surrendered to the Spaniards, along with Nieuwpoort on July 23.|$|E

It was an army entirely dependent for support upon the countryside it occupied for provisions and wages. Until 1796, wages were paid in the worthless assignat (France's paper currency); after April 1796, although pay was made in metallic value, wages were still in arrears. Throughout that spring and early summer, the French army was in almost constant mutiny: in May 1796, in the border town of Zweibrücken, the 74th Demi-brigade revolted.
