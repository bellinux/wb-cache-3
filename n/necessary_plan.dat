Developing a software system for traffic hotspots alerting and visualization that can be viewed on mobile devices by drivers, will improve decision making for the vehicle driver. In order to provide the driver with information that can help driving, and manage and detect potential risks, developing a mobile application that helps the user in these cases was <b>necessary.</b> <b>Plan</b> Nacional I+DNo data (2016) UE...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{effectiveness}} of an intervention designed to improve nursing students’ conceptual understanding of decimal numbers. Results of recent intervention studies have indicated some success at improving nursing students’ numeracy through practice in applying procedural rules for calculation and working in real or simulated practical contexts. However, in this we identified a fundamental problem: a significant minority of students had an inadequate understanding of decimal numbers. The intervention aimed to improve nursing students’ basic understanding of the size of decimal numbers, so that, firstly, calculation rules are more meaningful, and secondly, students can interpret decimal numbers (whether digital output or results of calculations) sensibly. A well-researched, time-efficient diagnostic instrument was used to identify individuals with an inadequate understanding of decimal numbers. We describe a remedial intervention that resulted in significant improvement on a delayed post-intervention test. We conclude that nurse educators should consider diagnosing and, as <b>necessary,</b> <b>plan</b> for remediation of students’ foundational understanding of decimal numbers before teaching procedural rules...|$|E
