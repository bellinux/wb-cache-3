50|$|Operophtera fagata, the <b>northern</b> <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. The species {{can be found in}} Europe.The female of this species is {{virtually}} wingless and cannot fly. The wingspan of the males is 32-40 mm. The species resembles the winter moth, but is of a lighter colour and is bigger. The adults are active from October to December.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{unresolved}} {{questions in}} studies on population dynamics of forest Lepidoptera is why some populations at times reach outbreak densities, whereas others never do. Resolving {{this question is}} especially challenging if populations {{of the same species}} in different areas or of closely-related species in the same area are considered. The present study focused on three closely-related geometrid moth species, autumnal Epirrita autumnata, winter Operophtera brumata and northern winter moths Operophtera fagata, in southern Finland. There, winter and <b>northern</b> <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> populations can reach outbreak densities, whereas autumnal moth densities stay relatively low. We tested the hypothesis that a lower vulnerability to pupal predation may explain the observed differences in population dynamics. The results obtained do not support this hypothesis because pupal predation probabilities were not significantly different between the two genera within or without the Operophtera outbreak area or in years with or without a current Operophtera outbreak. Overall, pupal predation was even higher in winter and northern winter moths than in autumnal moths. Differences in larval predation and parasitism, {{as well as in the}} reproductive capacities of the species, might be other candidates...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the composition of}} the female sex pheromone of the <b>northern</b> (beech) <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> Operophtera fagata Scharf. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), ovipositor extracts of unmated, calling females were analysed by gas chromatography with simultaneous electroantennographic and flame ionization detection (GC-EAD/FID). Male antennal responses indicated three active components, two of which had distinct matching peaks in the FID trace. Using coupled gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS), these two compounds were identified as (9 Z) -nonadecene (9 Z- 19 :Hy), and (6 Z, 9 Z) -nonadecadiene (6 Z 9 Z- 19 :Hy), respectively. The third component, present in very small amounts only, was identified as (1, 3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) -nonadecatetraene (1, 3 Z 6 Z 9 Z- 19 :Hy), known as the sex pheromone of the common <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> O. brumata. Field tests revealed that traps baited with 6 Z 9 Z- 19 :Hy and 1, 3 Z 6 Z 9 Z- 19 :Hy caugth large numbers of male O. fagata. Both compounds were found to be essential for attraction of O. fagata. In addition, the diene prevented captures of co-occurring O. brumata. In contrast, 9 Z- 19 :Hy neither influenced the attractiveness of the two-component mixture towards O. fagata nor contributed to bait specificity. A binary mixture of 6 Z 9 Z- 19 :Hy and 1, 3 Z 6 Z 9 Z- 19 :Hy in a ratio of 10 : 1, applied to pieces of rubber tubing, constituted a highly attractive and species-specific bait for O. fagata, which can be used for monitoring of the flight of this defoliator pest of deciduous forests...|$|R
40|$|Among cyclic {{populations of}} herbivores, inter-specific {{temporal}} synchrony has {{been attributed to}} both climatic factors and trophic interactions. In <b>northern</b> Europe, <b>winter</b> and autumnal <b>moths</b> undergo regular 9 – 11 year population cycles. The <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> cycle has typically been phase-locked with that of the autumnal moth, but with a 1 – 3 - year phase lag. We examined potential effects of natural enemies on this phase lag using field experiments and observational data. We found that larval parasitism was significantly higher in autumnal than in <b>winter</b> <b>moths.</b> Conversely, pupal predation by generalist invertebrates was clearly greater in winter than in autumnal moths. The difference in parasitism rates may contribute to the earlier collapse of the autumnal moth cycle. In addition, the phase lag may be strengthened by higher pupal mortality in <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> in the early increase phase of the cycles. As a consequence, we put forward a hypothesis on reversed effects of natural enemies, providing a potential explanation for phase-lagged population cycles of these moth species...|$|R
40|$|Widespread and {{prolonged}} defoliation by the European <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> Operophtera brumata L., {{has occurred in}} forests of eastern Massachusetts {{for more than a}} decade and populations of <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> continue to invade new areas of New England. This study characterized the forests of eastern Massachusetts invaded by <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> and related the duration of <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation estimated using dendrochronology to observed levels of tree mortality and understory woody plant density. Quercus basal area mortality in mixed Quercus and mixed Quercus—Pinus strobus forests in eastern Massachusetts ranged from 0 – 30 %; mortality of Quercus in these forests was related to site quality and the number of <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation events. In addition, <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation events lead to a subsequent increase in understory woody plant density. Our results indicate that <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation has been an important disturbance in New England forests that may have lasting impacts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>moth,</b> Operophtera brumata L. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), {{has been}} defoliating {{hardwood}} trees in eastern Massachusetts since the 1990 s.

Using dendroecological techniques, this study related annual radial growth of individual host (Quercus spp. and Acer spp.) trees to detailed defoliation estimates. <b>Winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation was associated with up to a 47 % reduction in annual radial growth of Quercus trees. Latewood production of Quercus was reduced by up to 67 % {{in the same year}} as defoliation, while earlywood production was reduced by up to 24 % in the year following defoliation. <b>Winter</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation was not a strong predictor of radial growth in Acer species.

40|$|The <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> (Operophtera brumata) {{belongs to}} one of the most species-rich {{families}} in Lepidoptera, the Geometridae (approx. 23, 000 species). This family is of great economic importance as most species are herbivorous and capable of defoliating trees. Genome assembly of the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> allows the study of genes and gene families, such as the cytochrome P 450 gene family, which is known to be vital in plant secondary metabolite detoxification and host plant selection. It also enables exploration of the genomic basis for female brachyptery (wing reduction), a feature of sexual dimorphism in <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> and for seasonal timing, a trait extensively studied in this species. Here we present a reference genome for the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> the first geometrid and largest sequenced Lepidopteran genome to date (638 Mb) including a set of 16, 912 predicted protein-coding genes. This allowed us to assess the dynamics of evolution on a genome wide scale using the P 450 gene family. We also identified an expanded gene family potentially linked to female brachyptery, and annotated the genes involved in the circadian clock mechanism as main candidates for involvement in seasonal timing. The genome will contribute to Lepidopteran genomic resources and comparative genomics. In addition, the genome enhances our ability to understand the genetic and molecular basis of insect seasonal timing and thereby provides a reference for future evolutionary and population studies on the <b>winter</b> <b>moth...</b>|$|R

40|$|Amplitudes of {{extracellular}} action potentials in {{indirect flight}} muscles of honey-bees and cuculiinid <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> decline with decreasing muscle temperatures and fall suddenly to zero. Action potential durations increase with amplitude decline. Amplitudes at 11 °C are only 20 % of values near 30 °C in workers of Apis mellifera mellifera. They fall to zero at approx. 10 °C. In the cuculiinid <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> Eupsilia devia, amplitudes at 1 °C are approx. 12 % of values at 27 °C. They fall to zero between 0 and 1 °C. The duration of action potentials in bees and cuculiinid <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> is about 7 ms at 27 °C and increases to 52 ms at 11 °C in bees and to 66 ms at 1 °C in moths. The ratios of action potential rise time to fall time are about 1 at 27 °C for bees and moths. They decrease to 0 - 45 at 11 °C in bees and to 0 - 56 at 1 °C in moths. Results suggest that bees can heat flight muscles only if muscle temperatures are above 10 °C, whereas cuculiinid <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> can shiver with muscle tempera-tures near 0 °C...|$|R
40|$|Geographically {{separate}} {{populations of}} <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> (Operophtera brumata L.) were sampled in heather habitats on the Orkney Isles {{in order to}} investigate the prevalence of virus pathogens. Reoviruses were isolated in 11 of the 13 <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> populations sampled, with 3 novel species being detected. Two species of Cypoviridae (CPV) were isolated, Operophtera brumata CPV 18 and O. brumata CPV 19, with one host population suffering 46 % infection prevalence of OpbuCPV 19. A third virus, O. brumata Reovirus (OpbuRV), was isolated from both <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> and a hymenopteran parasitoid wasp, Phobocampe tempestiva, which is abundant in these populations. This {{was identified as a}} non-occluded reovirus, which was clearly able to infect and persist in both the lepidopteran and the hymenopteran host. The genomes of the three viruses were characterised using gel electrophoresis and the virus structure was investigated using transmission electron microscopy. The relationship of these viruses with a baculovirus that also infects <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> OpbuNPV, was investigated, as well as the association of OpbuRV with P. tempestiva. The detection of such viruses is discussed with reference to studies of similar viruses in other lepidopteran and hymenopteran host systems...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between an insect's developmental rate and temperature is crucial to forecast insect phenology under climate change. In the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> Operophtera brumata timing of egg-hatching has severe fitness consequences on growth and reproduction as egg-hatching has to match bud burst of the host tree. In the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> as in many insect species, egg development is strongly affected by ambient temperatures. Here we use laboratory experiments to show {{for the first time}} that the effect of temperature on developmental rate depends on the stage of development of the eggs. Building on this experimental finding, we present a novel physiological model to describe <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> egg development in response to temperature. Our model, a modification of the existing Sharpe−Schoolfield biophysical model, incorporates the effect of developmental stage on developmental rate. Next we validate this model using a 13 -year data-set from <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> eggs kept under ambient conditions and compared this validation with a degree day model and with the Sharpe−Schoolfield model, which lacks the interaction between temperature and developmental stage on developmental rate. We show that accounting for the interaction between temperature and developmental stage improved the predictive power of the model and contributed to our understanding of annual variation in <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> egg phenology. As climate change leads to unequal changes in temperatures throughout the year, a description of insect development in response to realistic patterns of temperature rather than an invariable degree-day approach will help us to better predict future responses of insect phenology, and thereby insect fitness, to climate change. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{seasonal}} environments {{the timing}} of various biological processes is crucial for growth, survival and reproductive success of an individual. Nowadays, rapid large-scale climate change is altering species’ seasonal timing (phenology) in many eco¬systems. In this thesis Lucia Salis focuses {{on the study of}} seasonal timing in the food chain of the oak-winter moth-great tit. As temperature increased over the last decades, both phenologies of the host plant, the oak, and the herbivorous insect, the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> have advanced. However, timing of egg-hatching in the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> has advanced more than the oak bud burst leading to the phenological mismatch and increased selection for later egg-hatching. In turn, {{as a result of the}} earlier phenology of the insects, a phenological mismatch has occurred between the great tit offspring’s food demand and the peak in caterpillars’ biomass, leading to enhanced selection for earlier egg-laying on the birds. The work presented in this thesis show that <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> have adapted to warmer temperatures via microevolutionary shift in timing of egg-hatching. Next, the influence of temperature and photoperiod on the phenology of the entire life-cycle in the <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> and {{the timing of}} reproduction in the great tit is investigated. Finally, this research deepens our understanding of the mechanisms underlying seasonal timing and ultimately forecast the rate of adaptation to changing conditions...|$|R

We believe this approach is deeply flawed. Using Varley and Gradwell’s <b>winter</b> <b>moth</b> study, we show that the problems with Hunter’s analysis lie in his misinterpretation of the population dynamics and his inappropriate use of statistical techniques. We also emphasize the importance of distinguishing clearly between two quite different things: firstly, top-down and bottom-up regulation of populations and secondly, the much simpler task of categorizing factors affecting changes in population density as either top-down or bottom-up processes...|$|R
