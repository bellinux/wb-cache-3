25|$|In 1934, bachelor's degrees were {{required}} for admission and Yale Corporation authorized the Master of Nursing degree.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} ability of <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> in {{accident}} and emergency (A&E) to interpret distal limb radiographs, by comparison with senior house officers.

OUTCOME MEASURE: A total score for each subject was calculated by comparing answers against agreed correct responses. RESULTS: <b>Nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> in general compared favourably with senior house officers. Those <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> who interpret radiographs {{as part of their}} role in minor injury units performed as well as the experienced senior house officer group. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> in A&E are able to interpret radiographs to a standard equal to senior house officers with three to five months' experience.

25|$|In Canada, the {{educational}} standard {{is a graduate}} degree in nursing. The Canadian Nursing Association (CNA) notes that advanced practice nurses must have {{a combination of a}} graduate level education and the clinical experience that prepare them to practice at an advanced level. Their education alone does not give them the ability to practice at an advanced level. Two national frameworks have been developed in order to provide further guidance for the development of educational courses and requirements, research concepts, and government position statements regarding APRNs: The CNA's Advanced Nursing Practice: A National Framework and the Canadian <b>Nurse</b> <b>Practitioner</b> Core Competency Framework. All educational programs for NPs must achieve formal approval by provincial and territorial regulating nurse agencies {{due to the fact that}} the NP is considered a legislated role in Canada. As such, it is common to see differences among approved educational programs between territories and provinces. Specifically, inconsistencies can be found in core graduate courses, clinical experiences, and length of programs. Canada does not have a national curriculum or consistent standards regarding advanced practice nurses so all APRNs must meet individual requirements set by the provincial or territorial regulatory nursing body where they are practicing. In conclusion, the completion of a graduate education, a passing of an exam through the CNA <b>Nurse</b> <b>Practitioner</b> Exam Program, and a successful registration within the appropriate territory or province is required in order to practice as a <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> in Canada.|$|E

25|$|The path to {{becoming}} a <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> in the United States begins by earning a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) or other undergraduate degree, and requires licensure as a registered nurse (RN) and experience in the generalist RN role.

The typical curriculum for a <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> program includes courses in epidemiology; health promotion; pathophysiology; physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning; pharmacology; laboratory/radiography diagnostics; statistics and research methods; health policy; role development and leadership; minor acute and chronic disease management (e.g., adults, children, women's health, geriatrics, etc.); and clinical rotations, which varies widely depending on the program and population focus.

DNP programs also require completion of a research project. Some nurse practitioners, {{as well as other}} APRN roles, may choose to pursue the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) as a terminal degree.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{characteristics of}} collaboration between <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> and medical practitioners {{in the primary}} healthcare setting in Australia. Background: Recent definitions of collaboration in the literature describe it as being based on communication, shared decision-making and the respect and equality of team members. However, research demonstrates a tension between this theoretical ideal and how collaboration between <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> and medical practitioners occurs in practice. Different socialization processes of the two professions and legislative requirements influence collaborative practice. The way these two professions overcome traditional boundaries and realize collaborative practice in the primary healthcare setting needs to be examined. Design: Mixed methods multiple case study including up to six sites {{with a minimum of}} six and a maximum of 20 participants in total. Methods: Data on collaborative practice between <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> and medical practitioners in primary health care will be collected in three phases: (1) two-week direct observation in the practice setting to capture actual behaviour and context; (2) questionnaire to measure dimensions of collaboration; and (3) one-to-one semi-structured interviews with <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners,</b> medical practitioners and practice managers to record experiences, perceptions and understanding of collaboration. Discussion: Triangulation of findings will generate a comprehensive understanding of how collaboration between <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> and medical practitioners in Australia occurs in the primary care setting.
