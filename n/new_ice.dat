5|$|After Lillehammer {{was awarded}} the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became {{necessary}} to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. The name of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, {{as part of a}} broader branding policy, based on the history of the Birkebeiner. Originally the administration had suggested the new larger hall be named Håkons Hall, after Haakon Haakonarson, later king of Norway, while the smaller hall would be named Sveres Hall, for Sverre Sigurdsson. During the political debate, a number of female councilors suggested that the smaller hall be named Kristins Hall, for Sigurdsson's daughter Kristina Sverresdotter, which was passed by the city council. Kristin and Håkon would be used to name the mascots for the Olympics. Kristins Hall has had small renovations throughout the years, including an upgrade in 2007 which included <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> hockey sideboards, a <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> machine, a new lighting system, and a new handball floor.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, the velodrome {{was removed}} {{and the track}} {{converted}} for use for speedway. For the 1952 Winter Olympics, the venue was upgraded with a <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> hockey clock, a new lighting system and <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> hockey boards. The speedway course was dismounted in 1968. During the 1980s, the stadium became a central location for drug dealing, but the traffic moved away during the 1990s. In 1985, artificial ice was laid north of the football pitch, costing 2.1 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Of this, NOK1.3 million was financed by Grüner IL through loans. At {{the same time a}} new gravel pitch was laid on the football field.|$|E
5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> cap.|$|E

5|$|The city {{sponsored}} a major {{expansion of the}} St. Louis Convention Center during the 1980s, and Schoemehl focused efforts on retaining professional sports teams. To that end, the city purchased The Arena, a 15,000-seat venue for professional ice hockey that was home of the St. Louis Blues. In the early 1990s, Schoemehl worked with business groups to develop a <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> hockey arena (now known as the Scottrade Center) {{on the site of}} the city's Kiel Auditorium, with the promise that the developer would renovate the adjacent opera house.|$|E
5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} {{of ice cream}} also resulted from the ice trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with the general public.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 the Panthers {{became a}} founder {{member of the}} <b>new</b> <b>Ice</b> Hockey Superleague. The new league {{abolished}} the wage cap and restrictions {{on the number of}} non-British trained players a club was allowed. Many of Nottingham's British players, who had risen through the ranks of the club's youth development system, were dropped in favour of North American imports. Of Nottingham's locally trained contingent only Randall Weber, Ashley Tait and Simon Hunt were retained. The Panthers began the season by qualifying for the Benson & Hedges Cup final for a third straight year following a 6–3 aggregate victory over archrival Sheffield at the semi final stage. In the final they defeated the Ayr Scottish Eagles 5–3, taking the lead 29 seconds into the game and never relinquishing it. The Panthers finished fourth in the league and qualified for the last four in the playoffs after finishing top of their group with five wins and one overtime loss from six games. Their semi final against the Ayr Scottish Eagles became the longest game in British ice hockey history. The scores were level at 5–5 after regulation time and each of the following five periods of ten-minute overtime ended goalless. Only in the sixth period of overtime, with the two-hour mark of the match nearing, did Jeff Hoad finally score a shorthanded winner for Nottingham ending the game after 115 minutes and 49 seconds. In the final the Panthers met Sheffield where they were defeated 3–1 after taking an early lead.|$|E

40|$|Measuring icing {{load and}} icing rate are {{important}} parameters for an atmospheric <b>icing</b> sensor. A <b>new</b> <b>icing</b> sensor {{has recently been}} designed and developed at Narvik University College for measuring atmospheric icing rate, icing load and icing type. Unlike the existing atmospheric icing sensors commercially available in market, which uses the axial loading for measuring icing load and <b>icing</b> rate, this <b>new</b> sensory system measures icing load and icing rate using the torque loading physics. The performance of this <b>new</b> <b>icing</b> sensor has been tested and validated at cryospheric environment simulator Japan. This research work focus upon the lab based experimentation and evaluation of axial loading and torque loading sensory physics during an icing event. ...|$|R

25|$|In the 1960s the {{expansion}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet allowed navigation in more severe ice conditions, and the Finnish ice class rules published in 1965 introduced a <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> class, 1A Super, which was considerably stronger than the existing classes. Since ice class 1A was already exempted from the ice fees, the 50% reduction to lighthouse fees was given to ships of the <b>new</b> <b>ice</b> class. However, the additional requirements of the highest ice class were deemed excessive and only three such ships were built.|$|E
