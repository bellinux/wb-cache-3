It will be necessary for the inspection party to have the capability for more than vertical drilling since there may not be a drilling site available vertically above the suspected nuclear cavity location. This means having, the ability to perform directional drilling and to obtain accurate positioning of the drilling tool. Consequently, several directions may be explored from a single surface drilling pad. If the target depth is expected to be at or less than 600 m (2000 ft), slant drilling may be required to a length well in excess of 600 m. Clearly, the operation must be designed with health and safety features to prevent radioactive exposure if the drilling encounters a nuclear source region. The DOE/LLNL community has developed a strong expertise in this regard. In this initial assessment we focus on the portability and directionality of drilling systems...|$|R
5000|$|Fott: Synthetic xenophobic Leporoid rednecks. They {{were created}} by {{scientific}} polymath genius, self-made gagillionaire, and super-terrorist [...] "Uncle Ernie" [...] Freiberg to stymie Alliance law. They fit {{the definition of a}} sentient race rather than a bio-weapon, making it illegal to contain them, sterilize them, or wipe them out. Fott are curious, reckless, aggressive, reproduce rapidly, and have a strange sense of entitled superiority over other races - sort of a mean parody of Humans. Other races view them as the perfect minority group - obnoxious, dim-witted, lazy, violent, oversexed, wasteful, crude, reactionary and anti-social. Uncle Ernie seeded the race on Delphix-9 of the Netas Hydri star system in the And-3 galaxy, just as it was declared Alliance space but before it could be settled. When the Alliance first tried to colonize the planet, the Fott initiated a guerrilla war with them. Settlements were under constant siege and a war of attrition began. An Alliance fleet was dispatched to eradicate the Fott from orbit, but Human and Zen ambassadors were able to <b>negotiate</b> a <b>conference</b> that led to the Fott surrendering after signing a treaty. The Alliance set up an agency called the Fott Welfare Administration (FWA) whose purpose is to educate, house, care for and feed its clients until they are judged able to be fully assimilated into Alliance society. The Fott resent the Alliance and resist any attempt to govern or control them. They are organized in extended family-based social groups called Kin. Kins will feud with each other but will unite against non-Fott enemies. Fott live in rural agrarian communes in which they own the land and automated machines, subjugated laborers, and domesticated animals farm it for them. The Fott have resisted any attempts to get them to liberate their workforce and have threatened a civil war if the matter is pushed too far.Fott are omnivores who love to hunt; if an animal is inedible, they will hunt it for sport. Fott display their hunting prowess by either stuffing and mounting the bodies of their prey or making craft items and furniture out of them. These trophies are displayed in their living quarters in a special area called a [...] "den". They collect firearms, preferring gunpowder-based projectile weapons because they require great skill to use and it is easier to recover usable prey after a kill. Some Fott hunters use archaic projectile weapons like crossbows, slingshots, or muskets to make it more challenging.Fott often find work as mercenaries because it allows them to legally work out their aggressions on outsiders and blow things up while they get paid to do it. Fott mercenaries will often collect and trade trophies like enemy weapons, spent ammo casings or power cores, dud or defused munitions, etc.; they often learn everything they can about the objects they collect. Since Fott are furry, there is an aversion to using flame-throwers or energy weapons.|$|R
40|$|We are {{grateful}} to the MODELS organizers, Springer Verlag, the sponsors of), the Program Committee and reviewers of SLE 2008, The response to the call for papers for {{the first edition of}} the SLE conference was overwhelming, and it was significantly over the number we initially expected. We received 106 abstract submissions out of which we got 90 full completed submissions; from those, the program committee selected 18 papers: 16 full papers, 1 short paper, and 1 tool demonstration. The full conference program including all papers and abstracts along with the details of both keynotes are attached to this report. I am a co-editor of the abstract reader, which is available at [URL] and published by the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in its Mainzer Informatik-Berichte series. Currently, we are working on the compilation of the conference’s postproceedings that will be printed by Springer in their Lecture Notes of Computer Science series. The submission due of camera ready papers for the postproceedings is November 1, 2008, while we expect the completed publication of the post-proceedings in early 2009. Together with Prof. Eric Van Wyk and Prof. Ralf Laemmel, I am going to be an editor of the postproceedings book. Due to the very high quality of the selected and presented papers, we are also considering the compilation of a special issue in an international journal. We were also able to attract four industrial sponsors: Ateji, CapGemini, Oboe Model Driven Company, and Software Improvement Group. The resulting program covered nearly all of the diverse topics in software language engineering. That is, the selected papers cover engineering aspects in many phases of the software language development life cycle. These include the analysis of languages in the design phase, and their actual usage after deployment as well as various tools and techniques used in language implementations including different approaches to language transformation and composition. The conference program was scheduled to provide ample time for the interesting discussion that we expect the papers and keynotes to trigger. This was especially appreciated by the participants of the conference, as they appreciated very much an opportunity to participate in very interactive discussions during the whole conference. Yet, given that this is a brand new conference, I we perceived a need to further work on the better interlinking across the overall SLE community, so that we can build a better common understanding and shared vocabulary. Therefore, we will invite “tutorial” papers for the next instance of the conference. The Steering Committee of the conference has appointed me to be the general conference of the next edition of the conference – 2 nd International Conference on Software Language Engineering. We were already able to <b>negotiate</b> that the <b>conference</b> will be collocated to the 12 th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering of Systems and Languages and will be held in Denver, Colorado, USA in early October, 2009. Together with the program committee co-chairs Prof. Mark van den Brand and Prof. Jeff Gray, I have already started an intensive preparation for the next year’s conference. This already included the development of the conference’s web site ([URL] invitation of keynotes, preparation of the call for papers and publicity strategy. I am one of the initiators of the International Conference on Software Language Engineering. I am serving on the steering committee of the conference along with several well-known researchers in the area of software engineering, including, * Mark van den Brand, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, The Netherlands * James Cordy, Queen's University, Canada * Jean-Marie Favre, University of Grenoble, France * Dragan Gašević, Athabasca University, Canada * Görel Hedin, Lund University, Sweden * Ralf Lämmel, Universität Koblenz-Landau, Germany * Eric Van Wyk, University of Minnesota, USA * Andreas Winter, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Germany Dr. Eric Van Wyk and I are appointed by the steering committee to be the program co-chairs of the first instance of the conference. Thus, our role is to put together the conference's research program, including, defining the scope of the conference; writing and distributing the call for papers; building the international program committee; organizing the peer-review process of the submitted papers (July 14 -August 25, 2008); making selection of the submitted papers, panel proposals, and demonstrations; creating the final conference program (August 25 -September 10, 2008); inviting the keynote speakers; selecting the best conference papers; editing the conference proceedings (Springer's LNCS volume); making sure that the conference program is followed; opening and closing the conference. Later on, organizing and editing a special issue in a well-known international journal (currently, we are negotiating the arrangements with the prestigious the Science of Computer Programming journal published by Elsevier). In addition, given the SLE 2008 conference is co-located with the MODELS 2008 conference, I also plan to attend the MODELS conference. With my students, I have already submitted a paper “Model Driven Engineering of Policy-Based Service Oriented Architecture” to the main program of MODELS 2008. For this paper, we expect to receive the review of the submitted paper on July 4 th, 2008. In addition, at this conference, I organize the 1 st International Workshop on Non-functional System Properties in Domain Specific Modeling Languages (NFPinDSML 2008) : [URL] and as chair I am expected to attend. The workshop has been approved by the MODELS 2008 conference organizers. Furthermore, given the rich workshop program of the MODELS 2008 conference, that directly fits into my research agenda, with my graduate students, I plant to submit at least one workshop papers.
