2500|$|The biblical baptising {{is related}} to springs and a Wadi (al-Kharrar) close to the Eastern site of the Jordan River, [...] not the Jordan itself. The pilgrimage sites, {{important}} for both Christians and Jews have shifted place during history. The site of Al-Maghtas (baptism, or immersion in Arabic) on the East side of the River in Jordan has been deemed the earliest place of worship. This site was found following UNESCO-sponsored excavations. Al-Maghtas was visited by Pope John Paul II in March 2000, and he said: [...] "In my mind I see Jesus coming to {{the waters of the}} river Jordan <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> to be baptized by John the Baptist". The Muslim conquest {{put an end to the}} Byzantine buildings on the east bank of the Jordan River, the later reverence took place just across the river in the West Bank at Qasr el Yahud.|$|E

6000|$|... "Your {{account of}} her," [...] {{returned}} the preacher, {{with a little}} smile, [...] "makes me long to see her again. Indeed, the sight of these two would comfort me greatly whether I live or die. They are <b>not</b> <b>far</b> distant <b>from</b> <b>here,</b> you say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, when {{they were out of}} the store, [...] "we have done all that we can for the time being. I do <b>not</b> live <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here.</b> Perhaps you would give me the {{pleasure}} of taking supper with me, if you have no other engagement." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1683 de Rossi {{worked for}} Camillo Pamphilj in Valmontone, {{a little town}} <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Rome. <b>Here</b> he planned the new main church, the Collegiata, or Church of Saint Mary, {{inspired}} by the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone by Borromini (Rome) and the Church of the Assunta in Ariccia, by Bernini.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is a long}} story, Uncle; but {{the real}} news is that Tippoo, with his army, has left {{the head of the}} western passes, and has gone to Seringapatam.

6000|$|... "I think, Hilliard, we had best {{go to the}} tailor, first. His shop is <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here.</b> As {{you want}} to get your things in three days, it is as well to have that matter settled, at once." ...|$|E

Six {{children}} are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{much prefer}} our self-won information; [...] And {{if we have}} Marshal Soult at Landsberg here, [...] [Which seems to be truth, despite this man,] [...] And Dupont hard upon us at Albeck, [...] With Ney <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Gunzburg; somewhere <b>here,</b> [...] Or further down the river, lurking Lannes, [...] Our game's to draw off southward--if we can! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{yet she was}} so well spoken," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{looking at me with}} wide open eyes, [...] "that it made a person's heart bleed.

And so I told her I had been a poor child myself, and it was {{according}} to parishes. But she said she meant a poor burying ground <b>not</b> very <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here,</b> where there was an archway, and a step, and an iron gate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} clerk, [...] "that {{she will be}} very glad to {{exchange}} with you, and pay you the difference. She lives <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here,</b> and if you will wait a few minutes, I will send and see." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So when it {{was dark}} I came alone, riding one horse and leading another for you.

"Yes," [...] {{said his}} father; [...] "the Arve {{is coming down}} from the mountains, and flowing towards the Rhone <b>not</b> very <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here,</b> {{on the other side of}} this flat land. This land {{constitutes}} a sort of tongue lying between the two rivers. I suppose it has been formed by the deposits that the Arve brings down. I have no doubt that if we should walk across the tongue of land, we should come to the Arve; but it is better to go on down the path till we reach the point where the two rivers come together." ...|$|R

I have got a little sister, who is at boarding-school, <b>not</b> very <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here,</b> and, as I keep a decent tongue in my head when I am talking with my little Patty, and expect others to do as much, sure I may try and do as much by you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry if}} I did Reddy Fox an injustice," [...] thought he, [...] "but he makes {{so much trouble}} for other people that I guess {{no one else will}} be sorry. He isn't likely to bother any one for some time. Peter really ought to be punished, but somehow I don't feel so much like {{punishing}} him as I did. I'll just give him a little scare and let the scamp off with that. Now, I wonder where he can be. I have an idea he isn't very far away. Let me see. Seems to me I remember an old house of Johnny Chuck's <b>not</b> very <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here.</b> I'll have a look in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a regular}} {{outfitting}} store <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here.</b> But {{the first thing to}} be done, now you have turned up, is to secure those passage tickets to Juneau.

6000|$|Felix drained his own glass. [...] "Well, it 's in the country, {{among the}} meadows and woods; a wild sort of place, and yet <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here.</b> Only, such a road, my dear!

6000|$|... "We {{must get}} a horse for Waboose," [...] said the Indian, as we galloped over the prairie that day.

60|$|Berengaria was a lady of {{an ardent}} and romantic temperament, and nothing could please her better than such a {{proposal}} as this. She very readily acceded to it, {{and her father}} was very willing to intrust her {{to the charge of}} Eleanora. So the two ladies, with a proper train of barons, knights, and other attendants, set out together. They crossed the Pyrenees into France, and then, after traversing France, they passed over the Alps into Italy. Thence they continued their journey down the Italian coast by land, as Richard had done by water, until at last they arrived at a place called Brindisi, which is on the coast of Italy, <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Messina. <b>Here</b> they halted, and sent word to Richard to inform him of their arrival.|$|R
60|$|A {{suitable}} {{spot was}} chosen in a pleasant grove {{on the banks}} of the stream where it swept round the base of a magnificent precipice, <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Jeffson's store. <b>Here</b> Douglas, Meyer, and Joe set to work to build a kind of hut of logs, branches, and mud, while Frank returned to the store to purchase the necessary tools. Having little money left, he was compelled to take credit, which Jeffson readily granted to him, knowing full well that there was little fear of the account remaining long unpaid.|$|R
