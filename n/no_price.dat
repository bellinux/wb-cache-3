Arnall threatened to give the steel companies <b>no</b> <b>price</b> rise, then Putnam ordered a $3-per-ton price increase. Neither tactic budged the steelmakers. Sawyer threatened to impose a wage increase; that stratagem failed. Sawyer then formally gave the workers a small pay raise; once more, the talks stalled.|$|E

In areas where piped water is not available, water is purchased from water tankers for prices five to six times higher than for piped water. The long term objective to recover water production costs, or at least operation and maintenance costs, is still not reached.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in early}} 2011, representatives from school {{employee}} health care trust funds, nursing associations, community health clinics, and others accused Benefis of raising prices 16 percent in 2010 and 30 percent overall since {{removal of the}} COPA agreement. But Benefis also said its costs fell 2 percent in the 2008-2009 period, and another 8 percent in 2010. Benefis denied the accusation, saying the 16 percent figure was overstated because much of that number came from a discontinuation of health care price breaks the health system used to provide. Benefis officials also said their charges for inpatient care were still 2.6 percent below those of its peers, while charges for outpatient service were 29.2 percent lower. Benefis also said it would implement <b>no</b> <b>price</b> increase in 2011, and hoped to reduce costs another 5.2 percent.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the Harbour Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} modify the Toronto Islands, including a new tunnel under the Western Gap. A new highway would connect to the tunnel and run {{the length of the}} island, and bridge the Eastern Gap channel. The highway would remove the need for the ferry service and bus service on the island, which was costing the City $100,000 per year. Under the plan, the airport's runways would be extended, a new regatta course would be built, amusements would be moved from the Sunnyside Amusement Park to the island and apartment buildings would be built. The plan would mean the filling of various channels and expanding the land mass of the islands. The project came with <b>no</b> <b>price</b> tag and was sent back to the THC for further study. The city hoped to persuade the Government of Canada to pay for the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has <b>no</b> <b>price</b> label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{recording}} equipment used to create the movie's intricately complicated sound effects was, at the time, extremely cutting edge. Among these pieces of equipment was the ADS (Advanced Digital Synthesizer) 11, manufactured by Pasadena, California custom synthesizer manufacturer Con Brio, Inc. The movie provided major publicity and was used to advertise the synthesizer, though <b>no</b> <b>price</b> was given. The film's soundtrack also provided a debut for the Blaster Beam, an electronic instrument [...] long. It was created by musician Craig Huxley, who played a small role in an episode of the original television series. The Blaster had steel wires connected to amplifiers fitted to the main piece of aluminum; the device was played with an artillery shell. Goldsmith heard it and immediately decided {{to use it for}} V'Ger's cues. Several state-of-the-art synthesizers were used as musical instruments, notably the Yamaha CS-80, ARP 2600, Oberheim OB-X, and Serge synthesizer.

2500|$|As of 2005, 68% of American flex-fuel car {{owners were}} not aware they owned an E85 flex. Flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} looked the same. There was <b>no</b> <b>price</b> difference. American automakers did not label these vehicles. In contrast, all Brazilian automakers clearly labeled FFVs with text that was some variant of the word Flex. Beginning in 2007 many new FFV models in the US featured a yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities. As of 2008, GM badged its vehicles with the text [...] "Flexfuel/E85 Ethanol". Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that in 2009 only 504,297 flex-fuel vehicles were regularly fueled with E85, and these were primarily fleet-operated vehicles. As a result, only 712 million gallons were used for E85, representing just 1% of that year's ethanol consumption.|$|E
