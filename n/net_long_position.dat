50|$|The economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks {{argued that}} in general, the natural hedgers of a {{commodity}} are {{those who wish to}} sell the commodity at a future point in time. Thus, hedgers will collectively hold a net short position in the forward market. The other side of these contracts are held by speculators, who must therefore hold a <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>position.</b> Hedgers are interested in reducing risk, and thus will accept losing money on their forward contracts. Speculators on the other hand, are interested in making a profit, and will hence only enter the contracts if they expect to make money. Thus, if speculators are holding a <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>position,</b> it must be the case that the expected future spot price is greater than the forward price.|$|E

Empirical results show that foreigners' daily <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> in the futures market exert significant influence in KTB and KTB futures prices.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} joint {{responses}} of commodity future prices and positions of various trader groups to {{changes of the}} CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) {{before and after the}} recent financial crisis. Financial traders reduced their <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> during the crisis in response to market distress, whereas hedgers facilitated this by reducing their net short positions as prices fell. This “convective risk flow ” induced by the greater distress of financial institutions led to a change in the allocation of risk with hedgers holding more risk than they did previously. The presence of such a risk flow confirms the market impact of financial traders conditional on trades they initiate...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} {{three different}} short-term oil models {{on a weekly}} basis. With these models we try to forecast oil prices out-of-sample up to three months. Two of the models {{are based on the}} VAR methodology and consider fundamental factors like the <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>position</b> and oil inventories. The third variant is a pure futures model. It is shown that the first two fundamental models perform better until mid/end 2007 and since mid 2009. During the financial market crisis from end 2007 until mid 2009, the futures model clearly has better forecasting quality than the other models...|$|E
40|$|The {{role played}} by “speculators” during the 2007 / 08 food price spike is lively disputed. Our {{analysis}} focuses on the increasing participation of index funds in agricultural commodity futures markets before the food price spike. Our central theme is to determine if their prespike massive entry does prepare the subsequent crisis by maintaining low stock levels. We develop a theoretical model explaining the behaviour of speculators and traders on futures and cash markets. We allow index funds to inflict an informational externality on commercial traders {{that is supposed to}} induce a lower desire to hold stock. We find out that, once the production decisions of commercial traders are taken into account into the model, the increased <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>position</b> of index funds is inconsistent with lower stocks. We therefore conclude that commodity index funds are not a systematic cause of high market swings and that other relevant causes should be further studied.

40|$|Both our USA and Australian {{reference}} accounts {{were fully}} funded and commenced trading securities on 1 June 2009, and so, with {{the month of}} May behind us, Bronte has been managing money for a full year. Over this time our USA and Australian reference accounts have increased by 36. 8 % and 35. 6 % respectively compared to our benchmark increasing by only 11. 7 % and 5. 9 % respectively. (We are global equity investors and when we measure ourselves it is against global equities.) The outperformance of 25. 1 % and 29. 7 % respectively has not resulted from excessive leverage. Our <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>position</b> has never exceeded 100 % {{and for the most}} part has been close to where it is today ~ 70 %. In the last month the US accounts were down about 6. 6 percent and the Australian accounts up almost 1. 2 percent.

40|$|Using futures {{data for}} the period 1990 - 2008, this paper finds {{evidence}} that expansionary monetary policy surprises tend to increase crude and heating oil prices, and contractionary monetary policy shocks increase gold and platinum prices. Our analysis uncovers substantial heterogeneity in {{the magnitude of this}} response to positive and negative surprises across different commodities and commodity groups. The results also suggest that the positions of futures traders for the metals and energy commodities strongly respond to monetary policy shocks. The adjustment of the <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> of hedgers and speculators appears to be a channel through which the monetary policy shocks are propagated to commodity price changes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of recent {{commodity}} price hikes, the financialisation of commodity derivative markets, reflected in the increased presence of financial investors and new financial products such as commodity index and exchange traded funds has been controversially discussed. Many studies focus {{on the effect of}} passive index investors on rising commodity prices, but hardly look at the effect of the diverse group of money managers where an important share engages in technical and trend following trading strategies and thus has the potential to push prices up and down. This is problematic given the increased importance of money managers and more generally of active trading strategies in recent years. We analyze for the commodities coffee, cotton, soft red winter and hard red winter wheat and WTI and Brent crude oil the effect of both types of financial investors within a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model framework, conducting Granger (non-) causality tests and impulse response analyses for the period June 2006 to October 2012. We complement the bivariate model approach, which looks at the lead-lag relationship between financial investors' positions and commodity returns, with a multivariate approach. We thus assess financial investors' positions in addition to a range of fundamental and macroeconomic variables which may influence commodity prices. In both models, index investors' <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> are not found to {{have a significant effect on}} commodity returns in recent years. In the multivariate model money managers' <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> have a statistically significant and large effect on returns for all commodities; in the bivariate model they only have an effect for coffee. In the bivariate model, we also find that commodity returns drive money managers' positions, which may indicate the presence of trend following trading strategies. Overall, our results support the hypothesis of financialisation of commodity derivative markets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the joint responses of commodity futures prices and traders’ futures positions {{to changes in}} the VIX before and after the recent financial crisis. We find that while financial traders accommodate the needs of commercial hedgers in normal times, in times of distress, financial traders reduce their <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> in response to an increase in the VIX causing the risk to flow to commercial hedgers. By exploiting a cross-section of traders, we provide micro-level evidence for a convective flow of risk from distressed financial traders to commercial hedgers. The presence of such risk convection confirms the market impact of financial traders conditional on trades initiated by them and motivates an extension of the long-standing hedging pressure theory of commodity futures markets to incorporate time-varying risk capacities of financial traders...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{observed}} options returns {{have been}} a challenge for no-arbitrage asset pricing models, most notably {{in the case of}} out-of-the-money equity index puts. I propose that liquidation risk, defined as the possibility of forced selling of speculative positions following a liquidity shock, is a major driver of the relative price of out-of-the-money put vs. call options (option-implied skewness) in commodity futures options markets and gives rise to a skewness risk premium in option returns. Using speculative <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> in options (OSP) as a key proxy for liquidation risk, I find that the skewness risk premium rises (falls), but realized skewness remains unchanged, when OSP is more positive (negative). I also provide direct evidence of the price effects during such liquidation events. Trading strategies designed to theoretically exploit the skewness premium yield up to 2. 5 percent per month and load significantly on risk factors related to the ease of funding for financial intermediaries.

40|$|In {{a period}} of great oil price volatility, the paper assesses the role of {{expected}} net demand compared to liquidity and leverage driven expansion in <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions.</b> We apply time series tests for mutual and across exchange causality, and lead-lag relationships, between crude oil spot and futures prices on two international and one Indian commodity exchange. We also search for short duration bubbles, and how they differ across exchanges. The results show expectations mediated through financial markets {{did not lead to}} persistent deviations from fundamentals. There is mutual Granger causality between spot and futures, and in the error correction model for mature exchanges, spot leads futures. Mature market exchanges lead in price discovery. Futures in these markets lead Indian (daily) futures-markets are integrated. But there is stronger evidence of short-term or collapsing bubbles in mature market futures compared to Indian, although mature markets have a higher share of hedging. Indian regulations such as position limits may have mitigated short duration bubbles. It follows leverage due to lax regulation may be responsible for excess volatility. Well-designed regulations can improve market functioning...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThe {{role that}} {{speculation}} in futures markets plays during food price spikes {{is a subject}} of lively dispute. This issue is often addressed with empirical analyses. They suffer from data limitations {{and focus on the}} short-term impacts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approachThe authors develop a theoretical model to explain the behaviour of speculators and producers in futures and cash markets. Compared to the only two theoretical analyses by Vercammen and Doroudian where informational externalities are excluded and by Fishe et al. where production responses are excluded, the authors introduce both informational externalities and lagged production responses. FindingsThe authors find that the expanded <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> of commodity index funds (CIF) are inconsistent with lower stock levels that typically prevail before the price spikes. These positions stimulate production, hence stocks, before the price spikes. Thus they contribute to soften the price volatility. Practical implicationsThe simulation results indicate that before imposing new regulations on financial markets, such as position limits on index funds, their beneficial medium-term effect as a hedging instrument for commercial participants should not be omitted or underestimated. Originality/valueBecause the authors develop a second-best theoretical framework, the authors find that CIF are not a systematic cause of medium-term market swings...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} whether momentum and other trend-following strategies are profitable when implemented in commodity futures markets. The study {{is motivated by}} the relatively low transactions costs in commodity futures, the supposition that commodity futures markets and equity markets {{are likely to be}} influenced by markedly different factors and the availability of commitments data in futures. We find that momentum profits in commodity futures are highly significant for short and intermediate time horizons, and that abnormal returns are at least equal in magnitude to those that have been reported in stocks. Interestingly, we show that pure trend-following strategies generally perform even better than momentum strategies. Our results appear to be robust with respect to the particular set of commodities they are implemented with, and also with respect to the time period (although post- 1981 profits, albeit still highly significant, are lower then pre- 1981). Unlike in the stock market, our results show that trading volume adds little information useful for predicting future returns. However, when we examine the relation between <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> by trader type and trading rule indicators, we find strong evidence that in most futures markets commercial traders are contrarians, while non-commercial traders use trend-following strategies in the aggregate...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} pricing behaviors {{of two major}} energy commodities, U. S. natural gas and crude oil, using times series models. It examines the relationships between U. S. natural gas price variations and changes in market fundamentals within a two-state Markov-switching framework. It is found that the regime-switching model does a better forecasting job in general than the linear fundamental model without regime-switching framework, {{especially in the case}} of 1 -step-ahead forecast. Studies are conducted of the dynamics between crude oil price and U. S. dollar exchange rates. Empirical tests are applied to both full sample (1986 ? 2010) and subsample (2002 ? 2010) data. It is found that causality runs in both directions between the oil and the dollar. Meanwhile, a theoretical 5 -country partial dynamic portfolio model is constructed to explain the dynamics between oil and dollar with special attention to the roles of China and Russia. It is shown that emergence of China?s economy enhances the linkage between oil and dollar due to China's foreign exchange policy. Further research is dedicated to the role of speculation in crude oil and natural gas markets. First a literature review on theory of speculation is conducted. Empirical studies on speculation in commodity markets are surveyed, with special focus on energy commodity market. To test the theory that speculation may affect commodity prices by exaggerating the signals sent by market fundamentals, this essay utilizes the forecast errors from the first essay to investigate the forecasting ability of speculators' <b>net</b> <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> in the market. Limited evidence is provided to support the bubble theory in U. S. natural gas market. In conclusion, this dissertation explores both fundamentals and speculators' roles in the U. S. natural gas and global crude oil markets. It is found that market fundamentals are the major driving forces for the two energy commodities price booms seen during the past several years...|$|R

40|$|An option {{market maker}} incurs funding costs when {{carrying}} and hedging inventory. To hedge a <b>net</b> <b>long</b> delta inventory, for example, she pays a fee to borrow stock from the securities lending market. Because of haircuts, she posts additional cash margin to the lender which {{needs to be}} financed at her unsecured debt rate. This paper incorporates funding asymmetry (borrowed cash and invested cash earning different interest rates) and realistic stock financing cost into the classic option pricing theory. It is shown that an option position can be dynamically replicated and self financed {{in the presence of}} these funding costs. Noting that the funding amounts and costs are different for <b>long</b> and short <b>positions,</b> we extend Black-Scholes partial differential equations (PDE) per position side. The PDE's nonlinear funding cost terms create a free funding boundary and would result in the bid price for a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> on an option lower than the ask price for a short position. An iterative Crank-Nicholson finite difference method is developed to compute European and American vanilla option prices. Numerical results show that reasonable funding cost parameters can easily produce same magnitude of bid/ask spread of less liquid, longer term options as observed in the market place. Portfolio level pricing examples show the netting effect of hedges, which could moderate impact of funding costs.
