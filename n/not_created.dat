5|$|At the {{beginning}} of August Garbage's involvement was confirmed in a press release from MGM and Radioactive Records, Shirley Manson's record label, which would release the soundtrack and the single. Although Music Week reported that Jamiroquai, Robbie Williams, Sharleen Spiteri, Björk and Melanie C were rejected by the producers before Garbage was chosen, Arnold denied that the other artists had auditioned; the single was suitable only for a film, and was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> with a particular artist in mind.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Sorrow {{continues}} {{the story of}} Aria of Sorrow, in which Dracula has been completely defeated, and his powers assumed by his reincarnation, Soma Cruz. With {{the help of his}} allies, Soma avoids becoming the new dark lord. A cult forms to bring forth a new dark lord by killing Soma. Soma and his allies move to ensure that a new dark lord is <b>not</b> <b>created.</b>|$|E
5|$|Independent Croatia has {{submitted}} {{films for}} the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1992. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a {{feature-length motion picture}} produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was introduced for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1995, the ODA {{has used}} the Hinomaru motif in their {{official}} logo. The design itself was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> by the government (the logo was chosen from 5,000 designs submitted by the public) but the government was trying increase the visualization of the Hinomaru through their aid packages and development programs. According to the ODA, {{the use of the}} flag is {{the most effective way to}} symbolize aid provided by the Japanese people.|$|E

5|$|The single {{received}} a mixed reception from music critics who highlighted her genre combinations but downplayed the lyrics. A music video was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> for the single, but the singer performed it live on several occasions, {{like at the}} Heaven nightclub in London in February 2012. The performance was compared to ones by both Rihanna and Robyn.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, {{the main highway}} running north–south through Gaylord {{was part of the}} {{original}} M-14. This was renumbered as part of US Highway27 (US27) in 1926 after the United States Numbered Highway System was formed. I-75 was completed and US27 was removed through the Gaylord area in 1961. The business loop was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> at that time, however. Instead, it was created in 1986.|$|E
5|$|A Scientology {{representative}} in France {{asserted that the}} Scientology personality test was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> by the Church of Scientology, {{and that it was}} not related to Ballo's death. The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that the test was not dangerous and that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the modern}} county of Greater Manchester was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> until 1974, {{the history of}} its {{constituent}} settlements goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, {{believed to have been}} an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes. Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth, are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is <b>not</b> <b>created</b> by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Maniac Mansions {{story and}} {{structure}} were designed before coding commenced. The project's earliest incarnation {{was a simple}} paper-and-pencil board game, in which the mansion's floor plan {{was used as a}} game board, and cards represented events and characters. Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways by which characters could travel. Strips of cellulose acetate were used to map out the game's puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters. Impressed by the map's complexity, Winnick included it in the final game as a poster hung on a wall. Because each character contributes different skills and resources, the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur. This extended the game's production time beyond that of previous Lucasfilm Games projects, which almost led to Gilbert's firing. The game's dialogue, written by David Fox, was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> until after programming had begun.|$|E

A tight simplification is one that does <b>not</b> <b>create</b> new Nash equilibria, a strongly tight simplification is one that does <b>not</b> <b>create</b> new ε-Nash equilibria. This note offers characterizations of tightness and strong tightness. When the preference domain is that of continuous utility functions on the outcome space, the two notions are equivalent, and are also equivalent to the outcome closure property of Milgrom (2008). ...|$|R

5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were <b>not</b> <b>created</b> {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.|$|E
5|$|The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the Academy {{presented}} Honorary Awards to {{the best}} foreign language films released in the United States. These awards were not competitive, as there were no nominees but simply a winner every year that was voted on by the Board of Governors of the Academy. Three Japanese films were recipients of Honorary Awards during this period. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is {{the head}} of the Government of the United Kingdom, and chairs Cabinet meetings. There is no {{specific}} date when the office of Prime Minister first appeared, as the role was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> but rather evolved over a period of time. The term was used in the House of Commons in 1805 and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s, and in 1905 the post of Prime Minister was officially given recognition in the order of precedence. Modern historians generally consider Sir Robert Walpole, who led the government of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742, as the first Prime Minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving Prime Minister by this definition. However, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the first Prime Minister and Margaret Thatcher the longest-serving Prime Minister to have been officially referred to as such.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{persistent}} misconception {{that the game}} is, or was released in lieu of, a follow-up to Secret of Mana. Other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger were being localized simultaneously with the production of Secret of Evermore. Fehdrau explained {{in an interview that}} Secret of Evermore was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> in place of Seiken Densetsu 3 and that the team that developed Secret of Evermore was assembled from newly hired staff, and would otherwise never have been assembled. Several of the team members joined Humongous Entertainment, which spawned Cavedog Entertainment, {{while the rest of the}} team spread to other Seattle-area game studios like Electronic Arts, Boss Game Studios, Microsoft Game Studios, and Gas Powered Games, among others.|$|E
5|$|Troop cars saw service through 1947, {{after which}} many were {{sold by the}} U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the railroads and {{subsequently}} converted into mail cars, express service boxcars, or refrigerator cars, while others remained in sleeper configuration for use in maintenance of way (MOW) service as bunk cars for the maintenance workers. Subsequent conflicts have <b>not</b> <b>created</b> {{the need for such}} an arrangement, partially due to the much smaller level of manpower involved but primarily due to the wider use of aircraft for long-distance transportation of troops.|$|E
5|$|Using MVP voting results, {{historical}} {{surveys and}} sabermetric analysis, historian Bill Deane projected in 1989 that Pierce {{would have won}} the American League Cy Young Award in 1953 and 1956 {{if it had been}} given at the time; the award was <b>not</b> <b>created</b> until 1956 (when the National League's Don Newcombe won the award by unanimous vote), and awards were not given for both leagues until 1967. In 1988, baseball historian and statistician Bill James chose Pierce as having had the tenth greatest career value among left-handers, ahead of six Hall of Famers.|$|E
