When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence." [...] In an interview with Big Think, Tyson said, [...] "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... {{at the end of the}} day I'd rather not be any category at all." [...] Additionally, in the same interview with Big Think, Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page - I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it - and it said [...] "Neil <b>deGrasse</b> <b>Tyson</b> is an atheist."

[...] I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said [...] "Neil <b>deGrasse</b> <b>Tyson</b> is an atheist." [...] - again within a week - and I said, [...] "What's up with that?" [...] so I said [...] "Alright, I have to word it a little differently."
