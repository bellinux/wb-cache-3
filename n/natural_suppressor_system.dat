40|$|The {{hypothetical}} replicase or replicase subunit cistron in the 5 '-proximal part {{of tobacco}} mosaic virus (TMV) RNA yields a major 126 -K protein and a minor 183 -K `readthrough' protein in vivo and in vitro. Two <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNAs were purified from uninfected tobacco plants {{on the basis}} of their ability to promote readthrough over the corresponding UAG termination codon in vitro. In a reticulocyte lysate the yield of 183 -K readthrough protein increases from ˜ 10 % in the absence of added tobacco plant tRNA up to ˜ 35 % in the case of pure tRNATyr added. Their amino acid acceptance and anticodon sequence (GψA) identifies the two <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNAs as the two normal major cytoplasmic tyrosine-specific tRNAs. tRNATyr 1 has an A:U pair at the base of the TψC stem and an unmodified G 10, whereas tRNATyr 2 contains a G:C pair in the corresponding location and m 2 G in position 10. This is the first case that, in a higher eukaryote, the complete structure is known of both the <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNAs and the corresponding viral RNA on which they exert their function. The corresponding codon-anticodon interaction, which is not in accordance with the wobble hypothesis, and the possible biological significance of the readthrough phenomenon is discussed...|$|R

Experiments employing a cellular ELISA technique demonstrated that the antibody bound specifically to NS cells. It is proposed that the naturally occurring pregnancy-associated suppressor cells as defined by our specific anti-NS monoclonal antibodies may have physiological relevance in maintaining a state of immunological equilibration between the maternal and fetal environments by non-specifically downregulating potentially deleterious maternal anti-fetal immune reactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnimal <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNA did {{not affect}} the release {{reaction}} of reticulocyte release factor (RF) at the same concentration of tRNA (both estimated as being present at a similar level of 3 – 5 × 10 − 8 M in vivo); even at a 10 -fold greater concentration the tRNA did not prevent the release reaction with RF. In order to confirm this result, the Ka values were determined. The Ka value between RF and UGA was 1. 26 × 106 M− 1 and that between the suppressor tRNA and UGA amounted to 8 × 103 M− 1. This result showed that RF had a 150 -fold stronger affinity than suppressor tRNA for the opal termination codon. Incorporation of phosphoserine into phosphoprotein via phosphoseryl-tRNA was inhibited by addition of RF to the reaction mixture. These results suggest that animal <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNA in the normal state does not perform its suppressor function, except in special cases where mRNA has the context structure near the opal termination codon (UGA) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain an insight into the {{pathogenesis}} of mouse muscular dystrophy, we investigated the <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> serine tRNA. The <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> seryl-tRNA was distinguished from the other seryl-tRNAs {{on the basis of}} its specific property of being converted into phosphoseryl-tRNA by a tRNA kinase. On a wet-weight basis, the content of total tRNA in dystrophic muscles was 47 % of that in normal muscles. Although the serine-accepting activities of tRNA were similar in muscles of 3 -month-old dystrophic and normal mice, the ratio of [32 P]phosphoseryl-tRNA (suppressor tRNA) to the total serine tRNA was significantly enhanced in dystrophic muscles compared with that in normal muscles. This high content of suppressor tRNA in dystrophic muscles was further confirmed by dot-blot hybridization experiments with the DNA probes CGTAGTCGGCAGGAT and CGCCCGAAAGGTGGAA for major tRNA(IGASer) and suppressor tRNA respectively. At the early postnatal age of 3 weeks, when only a week had elapsed since the first manifestation of the dystrophic symptom (hindleg dragging), the ratio of suppressor tRNA to major tRNAs in dystrophic hindleg muscles was abnormally increased. Thereafter it decreased with age in normal mice but remained almost unchanged in dystrophic mice. Consequently, at 3 months old, it was 1. 7 times higher in dystrophic than in normal mice. The suppressor tRNA is now accepted to play a role in the synthesis of glutathione peroxidase. The present study showed that the content of this enzyme was abnormally elevated in dystrophic mice. Previously we had demonstrated that the docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6) acid content in phospholipids was decreased, possibly resulting from the enhanced oxidative milieu caused by the dystrophic condition. Thus far, the findings suggest that an increase in the contents of suppressor tRNA and glutathione peroxidase in dystrophic muscle may have been secondarily induced by such a highly oxidative state in the dystrophic condition. However, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that the <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNA plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies...|$|R

We investigated NSCA in lymphocyte-depleted rat bone marrow (BM) which {{is used as a}} model for preventIon of graft vs host disease (GVHD) following aliogeneic BM transplantation (BMT). The T-ceIl depleted fraction obtained after elutrlation contained higher levels of NSCA than the unseparated BM. Further separation of this graft fraction by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation revealed high levels of radiosensitive NSCA in the low density (< 1. 070) fraction which represented 0. 5 % of the original BM population. These cells were of blast morphology, stained intensely wIth a dansylated derivative of cyciosporine A (dans C 8 A) and weakly expressed macrophage/granulocyte antigens and non-specific esterase (NSE). These cells were initially non-adherent but proliferated in culture to produce intensely NSE positive, adherent, phagocytic cells of macrophage morphology. We conclude that the highly suppressive, radiosensitive cell present in rat BM may be of early progenitor or monocyte lineage.

We have recently characterized tobacco cytoplasmic (cyt) and chloroplast (chl) tRNA TrpCmCA and tRNA CysGCA as <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNAs {{that are able to}} read the leaky UGA codon in RNA- 1 of tobacco rattle virus, albeit with different efficiencies. Here we have identified a third <b>natural</b> UGA <b>suppressor</b> in plants. We have purified and sequenced four cyt tRNAArg iso-acceptors with ICG, CCG, U*CG and CCU anticodons from wheat germ. With the exception of tRNA Arg ICG, these are the first sequences of plant tRNAsArg. In order to study the potential suppressor activity of wheat tRNAsArg we have used in vitro synthesized mRNA transcripts in which different viral read-through regions had been placed. In vitro translation was carried out in a homologous wheat germ extract. We found that tRNA ArgU*CG is an efficient UGA suppressor in vitro, whereas the other three tRNAArg isoacceptors exhibit no or very low suppressor activity. Interaction of tRNA ArgU*CG with the UGA codon requires a G:U base pair at the third anticodon position. This {{is the first time that}} an arginine-accepting tRNA has been characterized as a <b>natural</b> UGA <b>suppressor.</b> A remarkable feature of cyt tRNA ArgU*CG is its ability to misread the UGA at the end of the coat protein cistron in RNA- 1 of pea enation mosaic virus, which is not accomplished by cyt tRNA TrpCmCA or cyt tRNA CysGCA, due to an unfavourable codon context...|$|R

They also contained relatively low frequencies of partial suppressor or insensitive second chromosomes of varying degrees, but completely insensitive second chromosomes were practically absent in all populations examined. The frequencies of suppressor X chromosomes, {{as well as those}} of the partially insensitive or suppressor second chromosomes, were the same among the populations investigated.

The NS cell-free supernatant was partially enriched by chromatography and some fractions suppressed the PFC response and thymocyte proliferation. Heat treatment of the fractions failed to deplete the suppressive activity. The fractions were confirmed, by immunoblotting analysis, to contain transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta. Recombinant human TGF-beta was also able to suppress the PFC response and thymocyte proliferation. Neutralizing anti-TGF-beta reversed the suppression by both human TGF-beta and the fraction.

On further analysis, it became apparent that the site of inhibition was on the DNA template, not on the enzyme. This inhibitor could be extracted into 0. 25 N HCl by the standard procedure for the isolation of histones. This acid-soluble inhibitor, showing typical histone band on gel, was RNase A and DNase I resistant, but was sensitive to both pronase and snake venom phosphodiesterase digestion, as well as to 0. 1 N KOH hydrolysis. Furthermore, when [14 C]adenine labeled poly-ADP-ribosylated histones were digested by snake venom phosphodiesterase, the release of radioactivity was in parallel to the loss of inhibitor activity.

Further purification and characterization of these NS cells by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter indicated that wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) -positive cells have potent NS activity, whereas WGA-negative cells have no NS activity. Spleen colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assays demonstrated a significant correlation between the number of CFU-S cells and the NS activity in the bone marrow. However, WGA-positive cells obtained from the bone marrow of animals treated with 5 -fluorouracil, which cells in turn were exposed to 5 -fluorouracil, showed a marked reduction in NS activity.

40|$|Cyclophosphamide {{was used}} to assess the role of {{suppressor}} cells in the contact sensitivity reaction. A single painting with 300 microgram and 30 microgram oxazolone produced poor contact sensitivity reactions (ear swelling). Cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) 2 days before painting increased the response to the lower doses but had less effect on the response to 3 mg oxazolone. A single feed with 10 mg oxazolone caused strong contact sensitivity while lower doses (10 - 1000 microgram) caused poor responses. Cyclophosphamide increased the response to the lower doses but not to the highest dose of oxazolone. These results suggested that the poor response to painting and feeding lower doses of oxazolone was due to a <b>suppressor</b> <b>system</b> which was sensitive to cyclophosphamide. A different result was obtained when contact sensitivity was measured by arrival of radioactively labelled cells. Cyclophosphamide had the greatest effect on cell arrival when high doses were fed. This indicates that ear swelling and cell arrival measure separate aspects of the contact sensitivity response. The lower doses of oxazolone, which caused little contact sensitivity, reduced the response to a standard immunizing dose. This low dose unresponsiveness occurred after either painting or feeding (Chase-Sulzberger phenomenon). It did not occur in mice treated with cyclophosphamide before the first exposure to oxazolone. This suggested that the low dose unresponsiveness was due to suppressor cells. The response to oxazolone was also assessed by DNA synthesis in the regional lymph nodes. A small dose of oxazolone (30 microgram) caused a peak of DNA synthesis on day four while a high dose (3 mg) caused a peak on day three. Pretreatment with cyclophosphamide depressed the response to 30 microgram although it increased contact sensitivity. The secondary response was smaller than the primary on days 3, 4 and 5 after immunization but larger on day two. The depression but not the increase was prevented by cyclophosphamide and was probably due to a <b>suppressor</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
30|$|MDSCs {{appeared}} {{to the scientific}} field in the late 1970 s (Strober 1984; Holda et al. 1985; Ribechini et al. 2010). At that time, {{this was just a}} formerly unknown immune cell population which possesses immunosuppressive features, but it was enough to attract scientists. Firstly, MDSCs were isolated from bone marrow and spleens from tumor-challenged mice, and it was revealed that those isolated cells were able to suppress T cell responses both in vivo and in vitro against tumor cells (Roder et al. 1978; Subiza et al. 1989). Because of its immunosuppressive functions and immature status, MDSCs were also called as <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> cells, immature myeloid cells, and myeloid suppressor cells. Finally, the naming issue has been fixed by Gabrilovich and his colleagues in 2007 as they suggest the unification of the name: “MDSC” which is reflecting both origin of those cells and the function after 37  years of its discovery (Gabrilovich et al. 2007). From that point, MDSCs are uprising as a novel immune cell population that regulates innate and adaptive immunity by inactivating T cells. Studies for MDSCs have been accelerated since 2000, but many things about MDSCs are behind the veil and waiting for being elucidated.|$|R
40|$|Patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, severe asthma, pre-existing pulmonary lesions, {{and severely}} immunocompromised patients {{are susceptible to}} develop infections with the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, called aspergillosis. Infections in these patients are associated with persistent pro-inflammatory T-helper (TH) 2 and TH 17 responses. Regulatory T-cells, <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> cells of the immune system, control pro-inflammatory T-cell responses, but can also contribute to disease by shifting to a pro-inflammatory TH 17 -like phenotype. Such a shift could {{play an important role}} in the detrimental immunopathology that is seen in aspergillosis. Our study demonstrates that Aspergillus fumigatus induces regulatory T-cells with a TH 17 -like phenotype. We also demonstrate that these regulatory T-cells with a pro-inflammatory TH 17 -like phenotype can be reprogrammed to their "classical" anti-inflammatory phenotype by activating Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2), which regulates the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA 4). Similarly, soluble CTLA 4 could reverse the pro-inflammatory phenotype of Aspergillus-induced regulatory T-cells. In conclusion, our results suggest a role for regulatory T-cells with a pro-inflammatory TH 17 -like phenotype in Aspergillus-associated immunopathology, and identifies key players, i. e. TLR 2 and CTLA 4, involved in this mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{appearance}} of <b>natural</b> <b>suppressor</b> cells and circulating endothelial progenitor cells in tumour tissue {{has been associated}} with myelopoetic stimulation by growth factors that may increase fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by the bone marrow and high FDG uptake by bone marrow in patients suffering from human malignancies is a not uncommon finding. Methods This study looked at the relationship between bone marrow FDG uptake, biochemical (Hb level, RBC count, WBC count and platelet count), clinical and radiological findings and outcome in a series of 35 patients suffering from squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and neck}} (SCCHN), consecutively referred for FDG PET as part of their routine staging procedure. Results and conclusion In SCCHN, mean FDG standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the primary tumour correlate significantly with blood WBC count (r= 0. 44; P= 0. 011, Bonferroni corrected P= 0. 04) and mean FDG SUVs of bone marrow are significantly correlated to the maximum FDG SUVs of the primary tumour (r= 0. 523; P= 0. 002). Finally, FDG uptake by the bone marrow is related to disease-free and overall survival. These findings warrant confirmation in a larger patient series...|$|R
