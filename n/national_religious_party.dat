5|$|Israel {{continued}} {{to control the}} city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} from military service, Eitam entered politics, joining the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party.</b> Despite {{not being a}} member of the Knesset, he was appointed a Minister without Portfolio on 8 April 2002, serving until 18 September that year, when he became Minister of National Infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, two modern-orthodox (and religious-zionist) parties, Mizrachi and Hapoel HaMizrachi, {{joined to}} form the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party.</b> The party was a {{component}} of every Israeli coalition until 1992, usually running the Ministry of Education. Mapai was once again victorious in the 1959 elections, increasing its number of seats to 47, Labour had 7. Ben-Gurion remained Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} to the Knesset on the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party's</b> list in 1996, and was {{appointed}} Deputy Speaker. He was placed tenth on the party's list for the 1999 elections, but lost his seat as the party was reduced from nine to five seats.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 {{he became}} the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party's</b> {{political}} secretary, a role he held until 1995. He was first elected to the Knesset in the 1992 elections.

25|$|On 10 June 2004, Eitam and Yitzhak Levy {{quit the}} {{government}} to protest the disengagement plan. However, the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> refused to leave the coalition. Eventually, Eitam and Levi left the NRP, too, and formed the Renewed Religious National Zionist Party, later renamed Ahi, which would later join the National Union - a Knesset list of right-wing parties.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1976 his {{coalition}} government with the religious parties suffered a crisis: A {{motion of no confidence}} had been brought by Agudat Yisrael over a breach of the Sabbath on an Israeli Air Force base when four F-15 jets were delivered from the US and the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> had abstained. Rabin dissolved his government and decided on new elections, which were to be held in May 1977.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, {{answering}} a call made by friends, Peretz {{ran for the}} office of mayor of Sderot, as candidate of the Israel Labor Party. At only 31 years of age he won a victory that ended a long period of dominance of the town's politics by the right-wing Likud party and the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party.</b> It was {{the first in a series}} of local councils that passed back to Labor control in the late 1980s. As mayor, he strongly emphasized education and worked to improve previously fractious relations with the kibbutzim in the area.|$|E
50|$|On 16 July 1970 {{he entered}} the Knesset on the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party's</b> list as a {{replacement}} for the deceased Haim-Moshe Shapira, and in September that year Shaki was appointed Deputy Minister of Education and Culture.

50|$|He {{was first}} elected to the Knesset in the 1977 {{elections}} on the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party's</b> (NRP) list. He was re-elected in 1981, and was appointed Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs on 11 August. However, an opponent of the Camp David Accords, he lost the post on 2 March 1982. On 10 October 1983, he {{broke away from the}} NRP and attempted to form a Knesset faction by the name of Zionist Religious Camp, but was refused permission to do so by the House Committee. Instead, he sat as a single MK {{for the remainder of the}} Knesset term.|$|R
25|$|Following Golda Meir's {{resignation}} in April 1974, Rabin {{was elected}} party leader, after he defeated Shimon Peres. The rivalry {{between these two}} Labour leaders remained fierce and they competed {{several times in the}} next two decades for the leadership role, and even for who deserved credit for government achievements. Rabin succeeded Golda Meir as Prime Minister of Israel on 3 June 1974. This was a coalition government, including Ratz, the Independent Liberals, Progress and Development and the Arab List for Bedouins and Villagers. This arrangement, with a bare parliamentary majority, held for a few months {{and was one of the}} few periods in Israel's history where the religious parties were not part of the coalition. The <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> joined the coalition on 30 October 1974 and Ratz left on 6 November.|$|E
500|$|In Israel, Chief of the Military Intelligence Directorate Aharon Yariv {{stated that}} a raid would damage Fatah's prestige. On the other hand, Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban and {{his chief of}} bureau Gideon Rafael — mindful of an adverse American {{reaction}} due to the good relationship between Jordan and the US — worried a raid could result in innocent civilian deaths and be a political disservice to Israel. Chief of Staff Haim Bar-Lev promised a [...] "clean action". Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan asked for a [...] "principal approval" [...] for a raid, but this was denied by the cabinet. On 13 December, Operation Karameh was scheduled for the next night, it {{was placed in the}} hands of both Brigade 35 of the Paratroop Corps and the Sayeret Matkal special-operations force. The operation was called off, rescheduled for 12 March and then called off again. Dayan warned the other ministers that a bus might strike a mine. On 18 March, an Israeli school bus was blown up by a mine near Be'er Ora in the Arava, killing two adults and wounding ten children. This was the 38th Fatah operation in little more than three months. That night, the cabinet approved the attack. The U.S. tried to prevent it by forwarding Israel a message from King Hussein. Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol called in the cabinet for further counseling; only the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> leader Haim-Moshe Shapira vocally opposed the attack, while Education Minister Zalman Aran opposed it too but remained silent.|$|E

50|$|In the 1996 elections, Slomiansky {{was placed}} 10th on the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party's</b> list of candidates. He entered the Knesset in May 1997, {{following}} the death of Avraham Stern. He lost his seat in the 1999 elections, but regained it in 2003 when he was placed sixth on the party's list of candidates. He was later re-elected to the Seventeenth Knesset in 2006. During this period, he set a record for being the only member of Knesset to be present for 100% of the meetings and votes; likewise, he was known for being an extremely prolific legislator.|$|R

Abuhatzira left the NRP and formed his own party, Tami. The party won three seats in the 1981 elections and was included in Begin's new government. Abuhatzira was appointed both Minister of Immigrant Absorption and Minister of Labor and Social Welfare. Abuhatzira was re-elected in the 1984 elections, but his party won only one seat. Towards the end of the Knesset term he merged the party into Likud, and in the 1988 elections, won a seat on the Likud list, but failed to retain it in the 1992 vote.|$|R
2500|$|... 'The {{government}} {{was caught by}} surprise. Internally divided, depending for its survival on the votes of the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party,</b> and reluctant to forcibly evacuate the settlers from a city whose Jewish population had been massacred thirty-nine years earlier, the Labor government backed away from its original prohibition against civilian settlement {{in the area and}} permitted this group to remain within a military compound. After {{more than a year and}} a half of agitation and a bloody Arab attack on the Hebron settlers, the government agreed to allow Levinger's group to establish a town on the outskirts of the city.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 2004, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon {{announced}} {{his plan to}} transfer all the Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip. The Israeli opposition dismissed his announcement as [...] "media spin" [...] but the Israeli Labour Party said it would support such a move. Sharon's right-wing coalition partners <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> and National Union rejected the plan and vowed to quit the government if it were implemented. Yossi Beilin, peace advocate and architect of the Oslo Accords and the Geneva Accord, also rejected the proposed withdrawal plan. He claimed that withdrawing from the Gaza Strip without a peace agreement would reward terror.|$|E
2500|$|Kahane was {{endorsed}} {{in his bid}} for a Knesset seat by Zvi Yehuda Kook, the son of {{the first}} Chief Rabbi of Israel and the spiritual leader of the Gush Emunim movement. Kook had been a staunch supporter of the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party,</b> but he broke with them in 1974 when they entered the Rabin government despite his opposition. In his letter of support for Kahane, Kook stated: [...] "The presence of Rabbi Meir Kahane and his uncompromising words from the Knesset platform will undoubtedly add strength and value to the obligatory struggle on behalf of the entire Land of Israel." [...] The announcement of Kook's support of Kahane and his letter were made available to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.|$|E

50|$|Eitam and Levi {{originally}} named their <b>party</b> the <b>Religious</b> Zionism (Hebrew: הציונות הדתית, HaTzionut HaDatit), {{but due to}} {{objections from}} the NRP that its name was too broad, a discussion at the party registrar resulted in the party being renamed the Connection Faction (Hebrew: סיעת התחברות, Siat Hitkhabrut). The party's final name listed in the party registry was the Renewed <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> Zionist <b>Party</b> (Hebrew: מפלגת ציונות דתית לאומית מתחדשת, Miflaget Tzionut Datit Leumit Mithadeshet).|$|R
2500|$|After being re-elected on {{the joint}} <b>National</b> Union-National <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> list, Eitam caused {{controversy}} during a memorial ceremony for a fallen Israeli soldier on 10 September 2006, saying, [...] "We'll have to expel {{the overwhelming majority}} of West Bank Arabs from here and remove Israeli Arabs from political system", and, [...] "We have raised a fifth column, a group of traitors." [...] Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz warned Eitam at the time that criminal charges could be brought against him, if he repeated the statements.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{a vibrant}} {{movement}} {{tied to the}} opposition Herut Party, Betar's following in Israel has declined since the 1970s due to a generally transformed political landscape. An important change has been the rise of religious conservatives in Israel. Though Betar had {{many of the same}} political goals as the rapidly growing Gush Emunim ("Bloc of the Faithful") and Bnei Akiva youth movements (tied to the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party),</b> they remained a secular movement. They did not join the latter organizations in seeking annexation of the contested West Bank and Gaza Strip. During the 1980s, {{as a result of the}} Camp David Accords negotiated by Menachem Begin (the leader of Herut and its successor movement Likud), a similar effect occurred due to the rise of the [...] "Secular Right". The more extreme movements drew youth away from Betar.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1968, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, {{together}} {{with a group of}} Israelis posing as Swiss tourists, rented from its owner Faiz Qawasmeh [...] the main hotel in Hebron and then refused to leave. The Labor government's survival depended on the religious Zionism-associated <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> and was, under pressure of this party, reluctant to evacuate the settlers. Defence Minister Moshe Dayan ordered their evacuation but agreed to their relocation to the nearby military base on the eastern outskirts of Hebron which was to become the settlement Kiryat Arba. After heavy lobbying by Levinger, the settlement gained the tacit support of Levi Eshkol and Yigal Allon, while it was opposed by Abba Eban and Pinhas Sapir. After {{more than a year and}} a half, the government agreed to legitimize the settlement. The settlement was later expanded with the nearby outpost Givat Ha’avot, north of the Cave of the Patriarchs.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, the {{discovery}} of a violent Israeli Neo-Nazi cell (Patrol 35) in Petah Tikva, made up of teenage immigrants from the former Soviet Union, led to renewed calls amongst politicians to amend the Law of Return. [...] Effi Eitam of the <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> and the National Union, which represent the religious Zionist movement and have previously attempted to advance bills to amend the Law of Return, stated that Israel has become [...] "a haven for people who hate Israel, hate Jews, and exploit the Law of Return to act on this hatred." [...] On {{the other end of the}} political spectrum, MK Ahmed Tibi of United Arab List and Ta'al criticized the system's double-standard, stating that, [...] "people immigrated to Israel and received automatic citizenship under the Law of Return, while citizens of Nazareth and Tayibe are not allowed to visit their own relatives merely due to the fact that they are Arabs." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{memorandum}} {{from the}} military on March 12, 1971 threatened intervention, forcing the Demirel government to resign.

50|$|In 2002, Strook {{founded the}} Human Rights Organization of Judea and Samaria, {{following}} the Israeli evacuation of Israeli settlers Livnat Ozeri and {{her five children}} from Hill 26 near Kiryat Arba, and has since headed the organization voluntarily. As part of her involvement in the organization, she filed various complaints in the Israeli Police Investigations Department (מח"ש), along with various lawsuits against police officers who allegedly attacked protesters during the protests against Israel's unilateral disengagement plan and during the evacuation of Amona. Strook was placed thirteenth on the joint <b>National</b> Union-National <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> list for the 2006 elections, but failed to win a seat as the alliance won only nine seats.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2007, the Israeli Knesset {{approved}} the Jewish National Fund Bill, submitted by MK Uri Ariel (<b>National</b> Union/National <b>Religious</b> <b>Party),</b> in its preliminary reading; but {{the bill was}} later dropped. The bill sought to authorize the JNF practice of refusing to lease land to Arab citizens. The bill called for a new provision to the 1960 Israel Land Administration Law, entitled [...] "Management of the Jewish National Fund's Lands"; the provision stated that regardless of other conflicting rulings, leasing JNF lands for Jewish settlement did not constitute discrimination, and: [...] "For the purpose of every law, the association documents of the Jewish National Fund will be interpreted according to {{the judgment of the}} Jewish National Fund's founders and from a nationalist-Zionist standpoint." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{criticism}} {{directed at}} Levin following You, and Me and the Next War and Ketchup deepened after {{the premiere of}} his third political play, Queen of a Bathtub ("מלכת אמבטיה), produced by the Cameri Theater in April 1970. David Levin directed the controversial play, which made pointed use of vulgarity, and contained provocative sketches such as [...] "The Binding" [...] in which Isaac begs his father Abraham not to hesitate to slaughter him, and [...] "The Courting" [...] which mocks Israeli volubility and arrogance. Perhaps because it was presented {{on the stage of}} an established theater, the play aroused an unprecedented storm of public opinion. Viewers protested and made a disturbance during the performances. The <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party</b> demanded censorship of a song that, in its opinion, profaned the honor of the Bible. The government threatened to withdraw its financial support from the theater. The criticism further addressed the play itself: [...] "a combination of flawed dialogues and ditties attempting to toss salt on our open wounds" [...] (Dr. Haim Gamzu); [...] "This 'theatrash' (mahazevel) makes us all out to be despicable killers, citizens of a militarist, money-grabbing state." [...] (Uri Porat); and [...] "a scene about a reporter, who comes to interview a young widow whose husband died in the trenches, and plays at love with her, only a demonic or infirm mind could devise... it's a malicious abuse of thousands of bereaved parents" [...] (Reuven Yanai). In spite of Levin's objections, the theater's management decided, in the wake of these outraged responses, to close the show after only nineteen performances.|$|E

50|$|This {{system also}} allows fringe parties which hold views {{outside of the}} {{mainstream}} political and public consensus to have representation in the Knesset.

5000|$|The Israeli Minister for Education {{requested}} that time {{be set aside}} in all junior and high schools throughout Israel for a lesson on the attempted lynching episode..The incident did not deter Palestinians from East Jerusalem or those from the West Bank who had obtained permits from visiting downtown Jerusalem. Tamar Rotem reported that life at Zion Square has resumed its normal tranquil rhythms. Interviewing youths from the Bnei Akiva <b>National</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Party's</b> youth movement, she found they knew nothing of the incident, and, when informed of the circumstances, were quick {{to come to the}} defense of the suspected perpetrators. One said: [...] "It's very good that they (the Jewish assailants) hit them[...] [...] It's just too bad they didn't kill them." [...] Another boasted, [...] "Had I been there, I would have killed them." [...] Arabs are, they said, [...] "terrorists who carry out attacks and want to murder all of us". The director of the Masorti community, Rabbi Andrew Sacks, while noting that the attack elicited condemnation over the entire spectrum of the Jewish world, also drew attention to a certain diffidence, in the fact that Lehava had begun circulating a flyer in Jerusalem soon afterwards that was warning Arab males against flirting with or talking to Jewish girls. The pamphlet, distributed both in Hebrew and Arabic, is similar to former messages by the Kach movement, reads in part: [...] "We don't want you to get hurt, respect our girls' honor because they are dear to our hearts," [...] and [...] "If you're thinking of going to the pedestrian mall or the Jerusalem mall in order to go out with Jewish girls, this isn't the place. You can walk around your village and find girlfriends there. Not by us! Last week an Arab who thought he'd find some Jewish girls got hurt. We don't want you to get hurt." [...] Jerusalem police later asked the Justice Ministry for guidance in determining whether or not to pursue allegations that Lehava is inciting Jerusalemites to racism.|$|R
