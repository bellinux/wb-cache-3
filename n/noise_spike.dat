This output variability is quantified by the output’s power spectrum and appears in the denominator of the coherence function. With individual intrinsic <b>noise,</b> <b>spike</b> times of different neurons are slightly shifted, drastically reducing cross-correlations at high frequencies and thus the amount of the signal-unrelated variability in these frequency bands. Therefore, the coherence function increases with frequency.|$|E

40|$|The design, development, and {{analysis}} are reported of a digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) for FM demodulation and threshold extension.

The sampling frequency is constant and all the required arithmetic and logic operations are performed within one sampling period, generating an output sequence which is converted to analog form and filtered. An equation relating the sampling frequency to the carrier frequency must be satisfied to guarantee proper DPLL operation. The synchronous operation enables a time-shared operation of one DPLL to demodulate several FM signals simultaneously. In order to obtain information about the DPLL performance at low input signal-to-noise ratios, a model of an input <b>noise</b> <b>spike</b> was introduced, and the DPLL equation was solved using a digital computer.

40|$|Single spikes {{and their}} timing matter in {{changing}} synaptic efficacy, {{which is known}} as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Most previous studies treated spikes as all-or-none events, and considered their duration and magnitude as negligible. Here we explore the effects of action potential (AP) duration on synaptic plasticity in a simplified model neuron using computer simulations. We propose a novel STDP model that depresses synapses using an AP duration dependent LTD window and induces potentiation of synaptic strength when presynaptic spikes arrive before and during a postsynaptic AP (dSTDP). We demonstrate that AP duration is another key factor for insensitizing the postsynaptic neural firing and for controlling the shape of synaptic weight distribution. Extended AP durations produce a wide unimodal weight distribution that resembles the ones reported experimentally and make the postsynaptic neuron tranquil when disturbed by poisson <b>noise</b> <b>spike</b> trains, while equivalently sensitive to the synchronized. Our {{results suggest that the}} impact of AP duration, modeled here as an AP-dependent STDP window, on synaptic plasticity can be dramatic and should motivate future STDP studies...|$|E

The test setup {{is based on a}} tire on tire principle, which requires less space than a classic drum (rigid rotating cylinder). The setup is used to analyse mechanisms of tire/road noise during road impact excitations, such as a cobbled roads, joints of a concrete road surface, railroad crossings,… The noise that is radiated from a tire strongly determines the passenger acoustic comfort and the traffic noise. Besides the radiated noise, the spindle forces induce vibrations that generate noise in the passenger compartment. Typical for a road impact excitation are a short duration tactile spike (shock) and a short duration <b>noise</b> <b>spike</b> (impact boom) experienced by a passenger. A series of test are performed with different driving speeds, cleat dimensions and inflation pressures. The test results are used to identify and quantify the mechanisms of noise generation during impact excitations with respect to the different parameters.

Modulation supports perceptual segregation of "objects" in complex acoustic scenes, and provides information for speech understanding and pitch perception. Previous work in our laboratory showed increased modulation gain without change in temporal modulation transfer function (tMTF) bandwidth in auditory-nerve fiber responses to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones measured in chinchillas with noise-induced hearing loss (HL), compared to normal-hearing (NH) controls. The ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) provides significant input-output transformations with respect to amplitude-modulation representation, with enhanced spike synchrony to the amplitude envelope in several distinct cell types. We recorded spike times in response to SAM tones with modulation depths between 3 % and 100 % from all major VCN unit types in anesthetized NH and HL chinchillas.

Multisite, silicon-based probes containing implantable electrode arrays afford greater coverage of neuronal activity than single electrodes and therefore potentially offer a more complete view of how neuronal ensembles encode information. However, scaling up the number of sites {{is not sufficient to}} ensure capture of multiple neurons, as action potential signals from extracellular electrodes may vary due to numerous factors. In order to understand the large-scale recording capabilities and potential limitations of multisite probes, it is important to quantify this variability, and to determine whether certain key device parameters influence the recordings. Here we investigate the effect of four parameters, namely, electrode surface, width of the structural support shafts, shaft number, and position of the recording site relative to the shaft tip. This study employs acutely implanted silicon probes containing up to 64 recording sites, whose performance is evaluated by the metrics of <b>noise,</b> <b>spike</b> amplitude, and spike detection probability.

40|$|Neurons in {{the brain}} are able to detect and {{discriminate}} salient spatiotemporal patterns in the firing activity of presynaptic neurons. It is open how they can learn to achieve this, especially {{without the help of}} a supervisor. We show that a well-known unsupervised learning algorithm for linear neurons, slow feature analysis (SFA), is able to acquire the dis-crimination capability of one of the best algorithms for supervised linear discrimination learning, the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), given suit-able input statistics. We demonstrate the power of this principle by show-ing that it enables readout neurons from simulated cortical microcircuits to learn without any supervision to discriminate between spoken digits and to detect repeated firing patterns that are embedded into a stream of <b>noise</b> <b>spike</b> trains with the same firing statistics. Both these computer simulations and our theoretical analysis show that slow feature extrac-tion enables neurons to extract and collect information that is spread out over a trajectory of firing states that lasts several hundredms. In addition, it enables neurons to learn without supervision to keep track of time (rel-ative to a stimulus onset, or the initiation of a motor response). Hence, these results elucidate how the brain could compute with trajectories of firing states rather than only with fixed point attractors. It also provides a theoretical basis for understanding recent experimental results on the emergence of view- and position-invariant classification of visual objects in inferior temporal cortex. ...|$|E
40|$|An energy theoretic {{approach}} {{to augment the}} existing noise model is proposed by including the cryogenic (down to 77 K) behaviour of the noise spikes due to the regeneration process (when loop gain close to 1) of a relaxation oscillator. This noise model is useful in many time domain applications, e. g., design of Sigma-Delta Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC). The loop gain can be lowered towards 1 to increase the oversampling frequency, and subsequently reduce the quantization noise. The presented noise model tackles the <b>noise</b> <b>spike</b> problem from regeneration when loop gain close to 1. Three methods are used to obtain the noise model. The first method, a first attempt, is to identify the potential energy of the macroscopic behaviour of the Schmitt trigger (an integrated component of relaxation oscillators) with the underlying assumption that the system can be represented by one degree of freedom. Investigation on {{the dynamics of the}} Schmitt trigger shows a metastable state (maximum energy) and two stable states (minimum energy) which is due to the cross-coupled topology of the circuit. The limitation of this method is that it ignores the internal degrees of freedom i. e., the thermodynamic aspects appearing as temperature varies (decreases to cryogenic temperature). This limitation is then addressed in the second method by accounting for the different configurations in which these internal degrees of freedom manifest, resulting in the distribution of energy among the different configurations. The concept of free energy is introduced and from the free energy, the noise model obtained is now in function of temperature. As temperature drops further, quantum aspects start to arise. A third method is introduced as the temperature of the oscillator decreases and addresses the manifestation of quantum mechanical effect (at low temperature limit) with the assumption that the system is represented by one degree of freedom (macroscopic behavior), but with internal degrees of freedom represented by the immersion of the system in a heat bath with many degrees of freedom. The model for this method agrees with the second method when the loop gain is close to 1 at high temperature limit, thus giving us the confidence for the counterpart noise model at low temperature limit, where the quantum mechanical effects show up. The experimental results of relaxation oscillators, designed and fabricated in 130 nm CMOS technology, show two regions with different slopes: at higher temperature, the phase noise is consistent with the noise model prediction where the phase noise (from thermal noise) is proportional to √T; at lower temperature, the phase noise becomes relatively constant and the trend agrees rather well with noise model (quantum noise) at low temperature limit. By changing the regeneration time of the relaxation oscillator (doubling the aspect ratio of transistors), there is a shift of the crossover temperature of the two regions, which is as predicted by the noise model. Finally, a 1 -bit Sigma-Delta TDC is designed, and fabricated, using the relaxation oscillator, and the measured functional operation of the TDC agrees with simulation...|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to flux jumps, raw pass-through paleomagnetic measurement may also contain <b>spike</b> <b>noises.</b> Different to flux jumps after which magnetic moment level {{does not go}} back to a previous level, <b>spike</b> <b>noise</b> is a sudden change in magnetic moment at a measurement position, after which the magnetic moment level goes back to that prior to the <b>spike</b> <b>noise.</b> At measurement positions with <b>spike</b> <b>noise,</b> measurement values are apparently distinct from the average values of the surrounding measurement positions. Flux jumps and <b>spike</b> <b>noises</b> both significantly affect the resulting paleomagnetic measurement, and measurements containing flux-jumps or <b>spike</b> <b>noises</b> need to be repeated or corrected before any paleomagnetic interpretation or deconvolution can be made (e.g., Oda and Shibuya 1996).

30|$|A {{short time}} {{variance}} window that {{is larger than}} the target rise time will result in a lower score for the target profile, since the variance calculated on each window is normalized by the window's length. Thus, for the target profile, the optimal variance window size is expected to be {{less than or equal to}} the sub-profile length. In fact, the shorter the window, the higher the score of the target profile. On the other hand, a short variance window is more sensitive to random <b>noise</b> <b>spikes</b> in a temporal profile dominated by noise. Therefore, the optimal variance window size for noise-dominated profiles should be as large as possible so as to diminish the effect of the <b>noise</b> <b>spikes.</b> The optimal variance window for the overall algorithm's performance is the one offering the best compromise between the need to enhance the target profile score (i.e., as short as possible) and the need to suppress the short-term noise fluctuations (i.e., as long as possible).|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to investigate <b>noise</b> <b>spikes</b> due to regeneration in a relaxation oscillator is proposed. <b>Noise</b> <b>spikes</b> have not been satisfactorily accounted for in traditional phase noise models. This paper attempts to explain noise spikes/jump phenomenon by viewing it as phase change in the thermodynamic system(for example, from gas to liquid or magnetization of ferromagnet). Both are due to regeneration (positive feedback in oscillator as well as alignment of spin due to positive feedback in ferromagnet). The mathematical tool used is the partition function in thermodynamics, and the results mapped between thermodynamic system and relaxation oscillator. Theory is developed and formula derived to predict {{the magnitude of the}} jump, as a function of design parameter such as regeneration parameter or loop gain. Formulas show that noise increases sharply as regeneration parameter/loop gain approaches one, {{in much the same way}} when temperature approaches critical temperature in phase change. Simulations on circuits (Eldo) using CMOS as well as Monte Carlo simulations (Metropolis) on ferromagnet (Ising model) were performed and both show jump behaviour consistent with formula. Measurements on relaxation oscillators fabricated in 0. 13 um CMOS technology verify such behaviour, where the sharp increase in noise when regeneration parameter/loop gain is close to one, matches closely with the theoretical formula. Using the formula the designer can quantify the variation of <b>noise</b> <b>spikes</b> dependency on design parameters such as gm (device transconductance), R, I 0, via their influence on regeneration parameter/loop gain.
