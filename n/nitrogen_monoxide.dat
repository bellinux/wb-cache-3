5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>monoxide,</b> and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
2500|$|Nitric oxide (nitrogen oxide, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>monoxide)</b> is a molecular, {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula of ·NO.

50|$|Another {{example of}} {{portable}} optical air sensors can involve fluorescence. One {{example of a}} fluorescence based sensor is an electronic nose, which can measure analytes in vapor or air. It operates so that an analyte is detected by different sensors in different ways to ensure what is being measured can be differentiated. As the vapor flows into the system it is hit with a high intensity light so that different organic dyes located in different small holes, or micropores, emit a certain wavelength and varied intensity of light based on what vapor compound they are in contact with. The light from the different sensors can then be compiled and used to determine what analytes were present. One large application of the fluorescent method is the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s). Another type of fluorescent sensor focuses on metal complexes, rather than organic complexes. One example {{is the use of}} dirhodium tetracarboxylate structure to detect <b>nitrogen</b> <b>monoxide,</b> a common pollutant. This involves a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>monoxide</b> molecule coming in and bonding to the dirhodium tetracarboxylate to cause a shift in the intensity of the fluorescence of the molecule.|$|E
