5|$|On June 30, 2014, Ramirez {{made his}} Orioles {{debut in the}} ninth inning against the Texas Rangers, {{relieving}} Ubaldo Jiménez after pitching 8 innings only allowing 1 run pass. This was not a save opportunity since the Orioles were winning 7-1 in Baltimore. He allowed one walk and had two strikeouts. He helped Jimenez get his first win at Camden Yards of the 2014 Major League Baseball season. Ramírez had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Orioles manager Buck Showalter before his debut with the Orioles which has never happened to Buck in his Career. He was designated for assignment on July 6, 2014.|$|E
5|$|To {{finance the}} war, the Confederate {{government}} initially issued bonds, but investment {{from the public}} <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> demands. Taxes were lower than in the Union and collected with less efficiency; European investment was also insufficient. As the war proceeded, both the Confederate government and the individual states printed more and more paper money. Inflation increased from 60% in 1861 to 300% in 1863 and 600% in 1864. Davis {{did not seem to}} grasp the enormity of the problem.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} {{appearing}} against England in a warm-up match in Moscow for the 1958 World Cup, Streltsov {{was invited to}} a party by a Soviet military officer, Eduard Karakhanov, to be held on 25 May. Streltsov {{and the rest of}} the Soviet squad were on a pre-World Cup training camp at Tarasovka, just outside Moscow, but the team had been given the day as holiday. At the end of such days, the players had to report to the authorities at Dynamo Stadium at 4:30pm, but Streltsov and two team-mates, Spartak players Mikhail Ogonkov and Boris Tatushin, ignored this rule and went to the party anyway. Held at Karakhanov's dacha, it was also attended by a 20-year-old woman named Marina Lebedeva, whom Streltsov had <b>never</b> <b>met.</b> <b>The</b> following morning, Streltsov, Ogonkov and Tatushin were all arrested and charged with raping her.|$|E

5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E

When Reed interrogates him, he says he <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> OCU mole; all their business was conducted over the phone. All Tuzzi knows {{is that he has}} a Spanish accent.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, the Crown Princess Marie José {{involved}} {{herself in}} vain attempts {{to arrange a}} separate peace treaty between Italy and the United States, and her interlocutor from the Vatican was Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, a senior diplomat who later became Pope Paul VI. Her attempts were not sponsored by the king and Umberto was not (directly, at least) involved in them. After her failure – she <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> American agents – she was sent with her children to Sarre, in Aosta Valley, and isolated from the political life of the Royal House.|$|E
25|$|Pianists {{who have}} {{performed}} Scriabin to particular critical acclaim include Vladimir Sofronitsky, Vladimir Horowitz and Sviatoslav Richter. Sofronitsky <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> composer, as his parents forbade him {{to attend a}} concert due to illness. The pianist said he never forgave them; but he did marry Scriabin's daughter Elena. According to Horowitz, when he played for the composer as an 11-year-old child, Scriabin responded enthusiastically and encouraged him to pursue a full musical and artistic education. When Sergei Rachmaninoff performed Scriabin's music his playing style was criticized by the composer and his admirers as being earthbound.|$|E
25|$|Scriabin's {{second wife}} Tatiana Fyodorovna Schlözer was the niece of the pianist and {{possible}} composer Paul de Schlözer. Her brother was the music critic Boris de Schlözer. Scriabin had seven children in total: {{from his first}} marriage Rimma (Rima), Elena, Maria and Lev, and from his second Ariadna, Julian and Marina. Rimma died of intestinal issues in 1905 at the age of seven. Elena Scriabina was to become the first wife of the pianist Vladimir Sofronitsky, though only after her father's death; hence Sofronitsky <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> composer. Maria Skryabina (1901–1989) became an actress at the Second Moscow Art Theatre and the wife of director Vladimir Tatarinov. Lev also {{died at the age of}} seven, in 1910. At this point, relations with Scriabin's first wife had significantly deteriorated, and Scriabin did not meet her at the funeral.|$|E

25|$|Critical opinion has {{generally}} held Avellaneda's work in low regard, and Cervantes himself is {{highly critical of}} {{it in his own}} Part 2. However, it is possible that Cervantes would never have completed his own continuation {{were it not for the}} stimulus Avellaneda provided. Throughout Part 2 of Cervantes' book Don Quixote meets characters who know of him from their reading of his Part 1, but in Chapter 59 Don Quixote first learns of Avellaneda's Part 2, and is outraged since it portrays him as being no longer in love with Dulcinea del Toboso. As a result of this Don Quixote decides not to go to Zaragoza to take part in the jousts, as he had planned, because such an incident features in that book. From then on Avellaneda's work is ridiculed at frequent intervals; Don Quixote even meets one of its characters, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and gets him to swear an affidavit that he has <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> true Don Quixote before.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you? It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>Never</b> <b>Met</b> <b>the</b> Dead Man" [...] {{was written}} by Chris Sheridan and {{directed}} by Michael Dante DiMartino, both firsts in the Family Guy series. Much of the episode's humor, in standard Family Guy fashion, is structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture, including those centered on Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, , Wizard of Oz, ALF, Gilligan's Island, Bewitched, and Beverly Hills, 90210. The title [...] "I <b>Never</b> <b>Met</b> <b>the</b> Dead Man" [...] was derived from 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology Suspense, which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. The episode featured guest performances by Erik Estrada, Butch Hartman, Aaron Lustig and Joey Slotnick, along with several recurring voice actors for the series. This episode was rated TV-14.|$|E
