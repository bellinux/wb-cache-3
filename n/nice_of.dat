25|$|In 2000, {{the first}} National Institute of Clinical Excellence (<b>NICE)</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom set {{guidelines}} {{to limit the}} removal of asymptomatic disease-free third molars citing the number of pathology free impacted teeth being removed and the potential cost savings to the public purse. Advocates of the policy {{point out that the}} impacted wisdom teeth can be monitored and avoidance of surgery also means avoidance of the recovery, risks, complications and costs associated with it. Following implementation of the NICE guidelines the UK saw a {{decrease in the number of}} impacted third molar operations between 2000 and 2006 and a rise in the average age at extraction from 25 to 31 years. American Public Health Association has adopted a similar policy against removal of third molars before any problems have occurred.|$|E

The curious mouse creeps closer, is captured, [...] "and because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet—Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which {{is not at all}} <b>nice</b> <b>of</b> Miss Moppet". She ties him up in the duster and tosses him about. [...] However, the mouse makes his escape, and once safely out of reach, dances a jig atop the cupboard.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, Gittings {{traveled}} to California {{on the advice}} of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very <b>nice</b> <b>of</b> me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
500|$|Agnes Bron, a Scientology {{representative}} in France, {{denied that the}} test was related to Ballo's death, and asserted that the Scientology personality test was not created by the Church of Scientology. Scientologists pay royalties to the Hubbard Foundation {{for use of the}} test. She said that Ballo never actually received the results of her personality test. A spokesperson for Scientology asserted to Verdens Gang that the results of the personality test are seen as neither positive nor negative, but rather allow the individual to gain insight into their own personality. A representative of Scientology in Norway described the concerns leveled against the organization as [...] "deeply unfair". The Scientology official noted Ballo had a psychological history as a teenager, and said she had an eating disorder. The Church of Scientology's Information Chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse, asserted that the Scientology personality test was not [...] "dangerous", and stated that [...] "millions" [...] of individuals had partaken in the examination. He asserted that approximately 10,000 residents of Norway had taken the test. [...] "I have never, never, never heard of someone who has killed {{on the basis of the}} OCA test," [...] said Fosse. Fosse said that Ballo had entered the Scientology premises in <b>Nice</b> <b>of</b> her own volition. Fosse maintained that the negative views of the organization were based on ignorance and intolerance. [...] "I feel deeply for the Ballo family, but it is a rude insinuation that the Church of Scientology has any responsibility for this incident," [...] said Fosse.|$|E

500|$|Milian's {{first major}} acting role was {{offered by the}} Disney Channel to join The Mickey Mouse Club; however, she did not accept and opted to star as a {{reporter}} on Movie Surfers. During this time, she had minor roles in film and television, including Sister, Sister, Smart Guy, The Steve Harvey Show, Get Real, The Wood and American Pie. In 2002, Milian was appointed {{the host of the}} live competitive music series Becoming Presents: Wannabe on MTV, where she met director Joseph Kahn. Kahn suggested she audition for a lead role in the film Torque. Her audition was successful and she played a minor role in the film. She was subsequently cast in her first lead role in Love Don't Cost a Thing. Milian {{has been described as a}} role model to young girls; she has said that there are a lot of people who young girls look up to, but [...] "at the end of the day you have to be your own person and love yourself." [...] Milian worked with the Children Uniting Nations charity, in which she was a big sister to foster children, and says her favorite charity is the Penny Lane Foundation. Milian was awarded with a humanitarian award at The Reign fundraiser from the Elton John AIDS Foundation for being a role model for young children. Milian said, [...] "I've never been rewarded that way and never been acknowledged like that. That was really <b>nice</b> <b>of</b> them, and I was happy I was able to show up for the kids." ...|$|E

From a romantic reunion to entertainingly awkward comments from the eccentric Dr. Eugene Porter, it {{had a little bit of}} everything." [...] Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] "After last week's heart-rending episode, the producers of 'The Walking Dead' took things easy on the audience with the episode 'Us.' No major plot twists this week, no shocking revelations and the only recurring character death was no one we'll mourn. Essentially, this was a breather before the season finale next week." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minneapolis became {{noted as}} a center for rhythm and blues (R) in the 1980s, when the multi-talented star Prince (d. 2016) rose to fame.

He became {{the architect of the}} Minneapolis sound, a funk, rock and disco-influenced style of R, and inspired a legion of subsequent performers, including the Prince-related acts The Time, Wendy & Lisa and Vanity 6. Curtiss A, who opened for Prince the first time he played First Avenue in 1980, at first thought that it was <b>nice</b> <b>of</b> Prince to let him open and then later realized: [...] "You know: 'You guys think this is the top thing in town?
