40|$|The {{study of}} the Emission Factors (EF) of methane (CH 4) and Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) emitted from vehicle exhaust {{is the study of}} {{greenhouse}} gases that are crucial to climate change. These gases are part of a fuel known as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or as <b>Natural</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>for</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (NGV) in Thailand. This fuel is used as an alternative to oil, which has decreased the amount of gasoline and diesel oil used in the transportation sector of Thailand. This study used different types of cars that were tested on a chassis dynamometer with a Bangkok driving cycle to measure the emissions of CH 4 and CO 2 and then to calculate the averages of EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2, which are associated with speed and fuel consumption, respectively. This study was conducted in 3 vehicle types that are actually used in Thailand, namely, Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicles (HDDV), Light Duty Diesel Vehicles (LDDV) and Light Duty Gasoline Vehicles (LDGV). Our results showed that of the three vehicle types, HDDV produced the highest EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 averages at 7. 22 and 919. 6 g km - 1, respectively. LDDV produced the lowest EF-CH 4 (0. 17 g km - 1) and LDGV produced the lowest EF-CO 2 (153. 8 g km - 1). In addition, the EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 values of LDDV and LDGV were comparable even though the engine types of these vehicles were different. With respect to fuel consumption, the EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 of HDDV indicated a higher fuel consumption, which differed from those of LDDV and LDGV. Nevertheless, LDGV or taxis, which account for {{a large portion of the}} transportation sector in Thailand, emitted higher proportions of CH 4 and CO 2 than the other vehicle types, as shown by the CH 4 :CO 2 ratio. Therefore, according to the results, the EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 values can be applied for the effective evaluation of CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from vehicles in Thailand...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{around one}} third of the food {{produced}} is lost or wasted. Instead of landfilling or incinerating, organic municipal solid waste has increasingly been used in anaerobic digestion in order to produce biogas. The produced biogas contains around 60 - 70 % methane, 30 - 40 % carbon dioxide, and minor parts of impurities such as hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, or water vapor. The biogas can be cleaned of impurities and upgraded by removing the carbon dioxide to substitute either natural gas in the national gas grid or liquid <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Different technologies exist for the removal of the carbon dioxide. The most widely used technologies are pressure swing adsorption, water scrubbing, amine scrubbing, membrane separation, and cryogenic separation. These five technologies were assessed in this study using literature data. The first {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the environmental impact of the anaerobic digestion with following biogas upgrading in the geographical context of the United States. A life cycle assessment considering all the impacts from the anaerobic digestion to the substitution of natural gas including the biogas upgrading technology, gas compression and possible leakages along the way was performed using the EASETECH software. The normalized results show that the largest impacts occur in Freshwater Eutrophication and Global Warming. The largest savings are achieved in Freshwater Ecotoxicity, followed by Marine Ecotoxicity, fossil Depletion and Human Toxicity. Of the total 14 impact categories, cryogenic separation had the largest saving in eight impact categories and the largest impact in only one. However, including the sensitivity analysis, it was found that the uncertainty is so large that the error bars overlap for most impact categories and it is therefore most of the time not possible to show clearly which category is best or worst. Only for climate change, cryogenic separation clearly had the smallest impact, and for human toxicity and marine ecotoxicity, cryogenic separation clearly had the largest saving. It was also found that for the two impact categories with the largest environmental impact, the biogas production of the anaerobic digestion was the major contributing process for three of the scenarios. For the four impact categories with a negative impact, the substitution of natural gas was the major contributor. This study also evaluates the costs and revenues associated with the anaerobic digestion and the following biogas upgrading. The calculations included investment cost, yearly costs, as well as income from tipping fees, the sale of biogas, and the sale of digestate. The net present value was calculated for plants with three raw biogas flow rates to compare the profitability of anaerobic digestion with following pressure swing adsorption, water scrubbing, and amine scrubbing. The analysis showed that water scrubbing and amine scrubbing had similar net present values, whereas the net present values for pressure swing adsorption was considerably lower. The sensitivity analysis showed that the factors with the largest sensitivity are the tipping fee and the biogas yield of the food waste which are both part of the anaerobic digestion. However, there is large uncertainty in the data used. Only one set of data was available from literature. Also, this data is from Europe and from 2008 adding additional uncertainty. The conclusion was that depending on the goal of a project, such as low environmental impact, high energy efficiency, low methane slip, etc., a different technology may be preferred.

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} covers three research topics on catalytic environmental emissions control, including (1) {{aging and}} regeneration mechanisms of Rh- and Pd- model three-way catalysts (TWC) for gasoline automotive emission control, (2) catalytic methane emissions abatement from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> vehicles, and (3) scale-up of CO₂ capture and methanation using dual functional catalytic materials. The study resulted in two peer-reviewed publications, two future papers and one patent application {{which is currently}} under review. Modern TWC use supported two separate catalyst layers on a monolith containing one Pd and the other Rh for the emissions control of CO, HC and NOₓ. The rhodium (Rh) metallic component (active for NOₓ reduction) experiences the most severe oxidative thermal deactivation (forming inactive Rh³⁺) during fuel cutoff, an engine mode (e. g., at downhill coasting) used for enhancing fuel economy. In a subsequent switch to a slightly fuel rich condition, in situ catalyst regeneration is accomplished by {{the reduction of the}} Rh³⁺ with H₂ generated through steam reforming catalyzed by residual Rh⁰ sites. The present thesis reports the effects of the deactivation and regeneration processes on the activity, stability and structural properties of 0. 5 % Rh/Al₂O₃ and 0. 5 % Rh/Ce_xO_y-ZrO₂ (CZO) as model catalysts. Both materials are used to varying extents in modern TWC. A very brief introduction of three-way catalysis and system considerations will be presented. During simulated fuel cutoff, catalyst deactivation is accelerated with increasing aging temperature from 800 °C to 1050 °C. Rh on a CZO support experiences less deactivation and faster regeneration than Rh on Al₂O₃. Catalyst characterization techniques including BET surface area, CO chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning-electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction measurements were applied to examine the role of metal-support interactions in each catalyst system. For Rh/Al₂O₃, strong metal-support interactions leading to the formation of a stable rhodium aluminate (Rh(AlO₂) _y) complex dominates during fuel cutoff, resulting in more difficult catalyst regeneration (reduction). For Rh/CZO, Rh sites were partially oxidized to Rh₂O₃ and were relatively easy to be reduced to active Rh⁰ during regeneration. Moderate Pd and support sintering of Pd-Ce_xO_y is experienced upon aging, but with a minimal effect on the catalyst activity. Cooling in air, following aging, was not able to reverse the metallic Pd sintering by re-dispersing to PdO. Unlike the aged Rh-TWCs, reduction via in situ steam reforming (SR) of exhaust HCs was not effective in reversing the deactivation of aged Pd/Al₂O₃, but did show a slight recovery of the Pd activity when CZO was the carrier. The Pd⁺/Pd⁰ and Ce³⁺/Ce⁴⁺ couples in Pd/CZO are reported to promote the catalytic SR by improving the redox efficiency during the regeneration, while no such promoting effect was observed for Pd/Al₂O₃. A suggestion is made for improving the catalyst performance. The use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> <b>vehicle</b> applications is growing in popularity due to advanced fracking technology. Exhaust methane has been excluded from regulations since it does not participate in photochemical reactions. New vehicle environmental regulations are expected for controlling methane emissions given their contribution to the greenhouse gas effects. Methane is extremely resistant to oxidation when the natural gas-fueled engine operates in the stoichiometric mode with a supported Rh-Pd three-way catalyst (TWC). Furthermore, vehicles will still operate with fuel cutoff (for enhanced fuel economy), resulting in thermal oxidative deactivation (1050 °C) of the Rh metal in TWC to inactive Rh³⁺, resulting in a loss of both NOₓ and methane abatement activity. When the engine returns to the slightly rich mode, H₂ generated by methane steam reforming does not readily occur to reduce and regenerate the Rh. We report a solution to methane emissions abatement by catalytic reforming of an injected aqueous solution of ethanol into the simulated exhaust stream in TWC mode, which generates sufficient H₂ to regenerate especially Rh by reducing Rh³⁺ to its metallic active state. Conventional CO₂ capture and sequestration (CCS) in aqueous alkaline solutions is a very energy-intensive process with relative unstable performance and low efficiency especially for power plant effluents, and therefore {{there is a need for}} new approaches to control green house gas emissions of CO₂. Here we report on progress with an advanced technology involving CO₂ adsorption from flue <b>gas</b> and synthetic <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> production, via methanation, both performed at the same temperature with the addition of renewable H₂ and by using a dual functional material (DFM). The stored H₂ used is produced by water electrolysis during those times when solar, wind, and other alternative energies generate excess power out of phase with the direct use of the electricity. The DFM is composed of nano-dispersed CaO (or Na₂CO₃) and Ru metal supported on γAl₂O₃ carrier, respectively functioning as the CO₂ adsorbent and methanation catalyst. The present paper focuses on a laboratory scale-up study by using a simulated flue gas and 5 %Ru, 10 %CaO/Al₂O₃ and 5 % Ru, 10 %Na₂CO₃/Al₂O₃ DFM samples. The effects of DFM preparation methods, Al₂O₃ carrier materials (with different shapes and properties), and adsorption and methanation conditions (feed compositions, flow rates, reaction temperatures) on the DFM performance were examined. Samples were prepared using chloride precursor salts and showed stable performance under pseudo scale-up conditions, with SASOL TH 100 Al₂O₃ (with the highest BET surface area and pore volume/radius among the support materials) exhibiting the best performance. Compared to Ru-CaO, Ru-Na₂CO₃ based DFM materials showed improved CO₂ utilization and methanation production. Reaction conditions were explored to find optimized CO₂ adsorption and methanation...|$|R

40|$|Nanoporous materials, such as metal-organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs), {{have enormous}} internal surface areas. Their consequent adsorption properties demonstrate promise towards solving energy-related problems in gas storage and gas separations. Owing to their modular and versatile chemistry, millions of possible nanoporous materials can be synthesized. This vast chemical space allows a material to be tailor-made or fine-tuned to target specific adsorbate molecules and conditions. In this thesis, we utilize molecular models and simulations of gas adsorption in both existing and predicted nanoporous material structures {{to accelerate the}} discovery of new materials targeted <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> storage and separations at specific conditions. In {{the first part of}} this work, we approach the problem of identifying an optimal porous material to densify <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> storage onboard <b>vehicles</b> as fuel. We developed a series of statistical mechanical models to find the thermodynamic parameters that optimize the deliverable capacity of a material. We conclude that the heat of adsorption, which is a commonly used metric to evaluate materials <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> storage, is a misleading metric because the optimal heat of adsorption depends on the pore size. Our models also reveal that adsorbate-adsorbate attractions [...] in the case where multiple methane molecules can fit into a pore [...] can enhance the deliverable capacity. Next, we carried out a high-throughput computational screening of metal-organic frameworks, porous polymer networks, zeolites, and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> storage. The data that we collected provide candidate structures for synthesis, reveal relationships between structural characteristics and performance, and suggest that it may be difficult to reach the current Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) deliverable capacity target. To assess thermodynamic limits to the methane deliverable capacity, we then built a model of an extreme scenario where an energy field can be created without taking up space with material. This model suggests that, while the failure to reach the ARPA-E storage target is due to material design constraints rather than purely thermodynamic constraints, the ARPA-E storage target is ambitiously close to the thermodynamic limit. In the second part of this work, we approach the problem of identifying a material that selectively adsorbs xenon over krypton. With over half a million nanoporous material structures to consider as candidate adsorbents, the computational cost of a brute-force computational screening strategy was prohibitive. Instead, we employed a machine learning algorithm, a random forest, to learn the relationship between quickly computed structural descriptors and Xe/Kr selectivity, which is more expensive to compute. The trained random forest allowed us to rule out a large percentage of the materials on the basis of quickly-computed structural descriptors. Our machine learning accelerated screening pinpoints top candidates on which to focus experimental efforts and elucidates structure-property relationships for design guidelines for a Xe-selective material. As we are now working with mixed gas adsorption, we developed a user-friendly software package in Python, pyIAST, for ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations. IAST is a thermodynamic framework to predict mixed gas adsorption from pure-component adsorption isotherms, which are easier to measure. We provide practical guidelines for applying IAST. Finally, we carry out a high-throughput computational screening of metal-organic frameworks for capturing Xe from air at dilute conditions, a separation encountered in used nuclear fuel reprocessing. Our computational screening, facilitated by a parallelized code on GPUs, predicted a metal-organic framework, SBMOF- 1, to be among the most Xe-selective. Our experimental collaborators synthesized and tested SBMOF- 1 and found it to exhibit the highest Xe/Kr selectivity and Xe Henry coefficient reported in the literature. Column-breakthrough experiments reveal that SBMOF- 1 is a near-term material for capturing xenon from the off-gases of used nuclear fuel reprocessing plants. This is a rare case of a computation-assisted materials discovery...|$|R
