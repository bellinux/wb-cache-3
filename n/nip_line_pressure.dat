40|$|An optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control {{algorithm}} was proposed for the fuel economy improvement of an AT-based parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). By performing lever analysis at each gear step, the required <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> was obtained considering the torque ratio of the friction elements. In addition, the required <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> of the mode clutch was calculated. Based on these results, the optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> map at each gear step of the EV and HEV modes was presented. Using the <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> map, an optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> was performed for the AT input torque and mode. To investigate the proposed <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> {{control algorithm}}, a HEV performance simulator was developed based on the powertrain model of the target HEV, and fuel economy improvement was evaluated. Simulation results showed that as the gear step became higher, the optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control could reduce the hydraulic power loss, which gave a 2. 2 % fuel economy improvement compared to the existing <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control for the FTP- 72 mode...|$|R
40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} area in the spinning process of staple yarns. Its geometry influences the distribution of fiber tension in the spinning triangle and the properties of spun yarns. In earlier theoretical models, the spinning tension of the yarn acting on the convergence point {{is assumed to be}} perpendicular to the <b>nip</b> <b>line</b> of front rollers. This assumption is reasonable {{in the study of the}} conventional ring spinning triangle, but may not be appropriate for modified ring spinning systems in which the yarn spinning tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the <b>nip</b> <b>line.</b> Thus in this paper a new theoretical model is proposed by considering the inclination angle of the spinning tension. Based on the principle of minimum potential energy, the theoretical model quantitatively describes the fiber tension distribution and its relationships with the spinning parameters, shape of the spinning triangle and the inclination angle of yarn spinning tension. As an application of the proposed method, spinning triangles of a modified ring spinning system were investigated under various spinning parameters. The fiber tension distributions in the spinning triangle both with and without fiber buckling were numerically simulated and the results were compared with those from our earlier model. In addition, the properties of spun yarns produced by the modified system were evaluated and analyzed. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

CME activity resulting from degassing was investigated in relation to subatmospheric venous <b>line</b> <b>pressure,</b> partial oxygen pressure (pO), and hematocrit in {{a model of a}} centrifugal pump-based circuit for long-term ELS. Additionally, a device that provides instantaneous volume buffer capacity during hypovolemia was evaluated in relation to GME appearance. An exponential relationship was found between decreasing venous <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> and GME downstream of the centrifugal pump (P = 0. 001). Arterial bubble activity appeared at subatmospheric venous <b>line</b> <b>pressures</b> of - 200 mm Hg and less. A rising (pO) increased formation of GME (P = 0. 05). A rise in hematocrit, in contrast, did not affect embolic activity (P = 0. 22). With simulated hypovolemia, volume buffer capacity added to the venous line dampened fluctuations of venous <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> by approximately 40 %, but a significant reduction in GME formation could not be found (P = 0. 22). Moreover, the device enabled a 14 % higher support flow. With ELS flow being related to patient volume status, hypovolemia can diminish support. A coherent decrease of venous <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> triggers degassing of blood-dissolved gases and causes arterial GME, which can become massive during persistent conditions of limited venous return.

40|$|Various pumping {{arrangements}} and their pressure profile control for forced cooling of long pipe type transmission lines were investigated. In order {{to overcome the}} extensive friction head losses and provide ample cable cooling, a number of pump stations has to be used. Since the inner line segments cannot be provided with pressure control head tanks, line blockages, flow resistance changes, flow rate changes, pump shutdowns, or other imbalances in one segment can alter the pressure profile along the entire line, and, when two head tanks are used, create transverse flow. Using experimental and analytical methods, {{it was determined that}} the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant flow source is superior to the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant pressure source, and that the configuration consisting of an even number of loops, each loop having the opposite flow direction from its neighbor's, is the best solution when operated with only one pressure control head tank. The simplest, and yet effective, <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> profile control appears to be the pump bypass, which could be easily implemented on existing installations. The head tank pressure adjustment, however, is the most effective <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> profile control scheme, and should be considered when a new system is being designed. From the analysis performed on an electric analogy model it was found, that the head tank pressure adjustment or the pump bypass would be sufficient to mainain the <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> profile within its working limits for all practical imbalance sizes, and that, to extend the range of either of these <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> profile controls, the emergency pump shutdown and the pump bypass itself should be based on the pump discharge, rather than the pump inlet pressure.

Reoperative sternotomy carries with it the risk of cardiac injury {{and the need for}} emergency peripheral cannulation. Unfortunately, in smaller children, many of the standard sites are occluded, stenosed, or too small for the smallest manufactured cannulas. Using a model, we evaluated the feasibility of using peripheral intravenous catheters for establishing cardiopulmonary support. MethodsA model cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was created. Catheters of varying diameter and length were used to simulate arterial cannulation. With each catheter, flows were incrementally increased until a maximum arterial <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> was achieved. Data were recorded. ResultsCatheter diameters increased from 24 to 14 gauge, and catheter lengths increased from 1 inch to 1. 88 inches. Flow could not be established through the 24 -gauge catheter without an unacceptably high arterial <b>line</b> <b>pressure.</b> From the next smallest catheter (22 gauge × 1 inch) to the largest catheter (14 gauge × 1. 88 inches), maximum achievable flow rates ranged from 70 to 540 mL/min, respectively. ConclusionsPeripheral arterial cannulation may be lifesaving in cases of complicated sternal re-entry in children. Intravenous catheters can be used when vessels are too small for standard cannulas.
