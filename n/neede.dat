In April 572 municipalities were {{willing to accept the}} debris, but in the latest survey done by the Ministry of Environment on 7 October only 54 municipalities in 11 prefectures were willing to consider acceptance, and only six places had already taken in parts of the debris. Fear for radioactive contamination was thought to be the cause for this. The ministry declined to identify the municipalities that have agreed, or refused, to accept the debris. Some 4.88 million tons of rubble were <b>neede</b> to be disposed of a year after the quake. Around 20.5 million tons was collected in Iwate and Miyagi, all was stored at multiple temporary storage sites. The debris from Fukushima would be stored within this prefecture. On 2 November 30 tons of debris was loaded on train, and sent to Tokyo by rail from the city of Miyako, Iwate. The first train carrying the debris would arrive in Tokyo on 4 November. This made Tokyo the first local government outside Japan's northeast to accept debris.|$|E

The opening lines--"What might I call this Tree? A Laurell?

40|$|During my PhD course I {{have been}} {{involved}} in research activities into the frame of the NA 62 experiment, which main goal is the measurement of the branching fraction B(K+ -> pi+ nu anti-nu). NA 62 is a very challenging experiment due to ultra rare nature of this decay (BR is about 8 e(- 11)). The study of the decay K+ -> pi+ nu anti-nu is very important because it allows the first direct measurement of CKM element Vtd. Moreover it could provide signals of physics beyond Standard Model (SM) as that decay is highly sensitive to new physics. The experiment will be located at CERN experimental SPS North Area (hence the acronym NA). It is a fixed target experiment done using a unseparated 75 GeV/c beam of positive hadrons, produced by a 400 GeV/c proton beam. Positive Kaons, although being only 6 % of the beam, are produced in a very abundant fashion, and will allow us to collect enough statistics to reach a about 10 % relative uncertainty after a 2 years long data taking. To reach such level of uncertainty and to keep signal/background ratio below 10, the apparatus is designed in order to provide both particle identification and kinematical rejection. My work was focused on two veto subsystems with different scope, different architecture and different dimensions: the Large Angle photon Veto (or LAV) and the CHarged ANTIcounter (or CHANTI). The LAV is made of 12 different stations all along the decay region. Each station is ring shaped. The main task of LAV is to veto photons from neutral pions decay with an inefficiency lower than 10 e(- 4), to reduce background from K+ -> pi+ pi 0. In order to choose the best technology to implement the detector we have had an intense R&D program. Three different prototypes were tested and finally a solution that uses lead glass blocks from former OPAL electromagnetic calorimeter was chosen. The prototype used to measure inefficiency was made in Naples and tested at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati beam test facility with electrons of energy between 300 and 500 MeV/c. Unfortunately the area at CERN where blocks were stored was flooded and all blocks were involved. This major event forced a massive recovering campaign, of which I was responsible. During recovering operations many problems were found and (most of them) solved. However not all flooded blocks may be used for LAV. Part of them were damaged (9 %) and an other part showed an abnormal behaviour. During the recovering operation the design of the LAV was refined and construction started. In order to reduce costs we opted for a read-out electronics based on Time over Threshold (ToT) technique. The first station out of 12 was realized and tested at CERN in June-September 2009. It was an important mile stone. The test was intended, basically, as confirmation of ToT usefulness and as check of off-line equalization procedure that each block <b>needes</b> to pass before being mounted. To test ToT, signals were splitted and read on one side by custom ToT electronics and from the other side by a commercial CAEN QDC, in order to produce a ToT versus charge curve. Surprisingly not a unique curve was found. After an accurate data analysis the problem was isolated and a solution proposed, consisting in changing the HV dividers of all blocks. A second module was built with new dividers and tested again at CERN. Preliminary data analysis (still going) is showing that the problem is solved and ToT can be used as read-out solution. The other item I was involved on is the CHANTI project. It is a small detector that will be placed just after last station of incoming Kaon tracking system (called Giga TracKer or GTK). GTK is made of three silicon station hit by the 800 MHz incoming beam of hadrons.
