40|$|No known {{detector}} {{or series}} of detectors in personnel neutron dosimeters have correct dose equivalent energy-dependence. Useful dosimeter performance is assumed by calibrating dosimeters for the exposure spectrum. This method {{implies that the}} exposure spectrum will be constant within a given facility or the wearer will not be exposed to different spectra in other areas. Since exposure spectra are known to vary widely a composite damage track-albedo personnel <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeter</b> was developed to separately respond to the softer and more energetic parts of various spectra. The relationships of {{the responses of the}} elements vary with different spectra and are used to convert dosimeter readings to dose equivalent. Measurements indicate that dose equivalent deviation was less than approximately 50 percent for unshielded lucite and steel shielded HPRR spectra, monoenergetic spectra from 4. 7 to 15 MeV, a $sup 252 $Cf spontaneous neutron spectrum and an AmBe spectrum. Dosimeter sensitivity was similar to present NTA film methods. The composite personnel <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeter</b> was also tested with calculated spectra by simulating badge response through known energy-dependence of the badge elements. Dose equivalent deviation was less than approximately 20 percent for 19 significantly different assumed spectra.

40|$|Albedo <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeters</b> {{have proven}} to be {{effective}} as a method of measuring the dose from low-energy neutrons that other types of personnel <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeters</b> do not detect. Many albedo <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeters</b> have been designed, and some are being used extensively. All albedo <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeters</b> are energy- dependent, becoming less sensitive as the energy of the neutrons is increased. In this paper the energy dependence and the effect it has on the evaluation of the dose are discussed. Numerous measurements are shown which were made under field conditions at five reactors, two accelerators, a radiochemistry facility, two plutonium facilities, a low-scatter neutron irradiation facility, three storage vaults, and at the N.

These measurements show the limits imposed by the energy dependence on the evaluation of the dose determined by albedo <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeters.</b> In most cases evaluation of an individual's dose occurring in a single facility can be reasonably accurate, but it must be known in which facility the person was exposed.

40|$|Cadmium is {{a highly}} {{volatile}} element and its abundance in meteorites may help better understand volatility-controlled processes in the solar nebula and on meteorite parent bodies. The large thermal neutron capture cross section of 113 Cd suggests that Cd isotopes might be well suited to quantify neutron fluences in extraterrestrial materials. The aims {{of this study were}} (1) to evaluate the range and magnitude of Cd concentrations in magmatic iron meteorites, and (2) to assess the potential of Cd isotopes as a <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeter</b> for iron meteorites. Our new Cd concentration data determined by isotope dilution demonstrate that Cd concentrations in iron meteorites are significantly lower than in some previous studies. In contrast to large systematic variations in the concentration of moderately volatile elements like Ga and Ge, there is neither systematic variation in Cd concentration amongst troilites, nor amongst metal phases of different iron meteorite groups. Instead, Cd is strongly depleted in all iron meteorite groups, implying that the parent bodies accreted well above the condensation temperature of Cd (i. e., ≈ 650 K) and thus incorporated only minimal amounts of highly volatile elements. No Cd isotope anomalies were found, whereas Pt and W isotope anomalies for the same iron meteorite samples indicate a significant fluence of epithermal and higher energetic neutrons. This observation demonstrates that owing to the high Fe concentrations in iron meteorites, neutron capture mainly occurs at epithermal and higher energies. The combined Cd-Pt-W isotope results from this study thus demonstrate that the relative magnitude of neutron capture-induced isotope anomalies is strongly affected by the chemical composition of the irradiated material. The resulting low fluence of thermal neutrons in iron meteorites and their very low Cd concentrations make Cd isotopes unsuitable as a <b>neutron</b> <b>dosimeter</b> for iron meteorites...|$|E
