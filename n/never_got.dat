5|$|On November 12, 1942, the (Japanese) Imperial Navy had {{the better}} ships {{and the better}} tactics. After November15, 1942, its leaders lost heart and it lacked the {{strategic}} depth to face the burgeoning U.S. Navy and its vastly improving weapons and tactics. The Japanese <b>never</b> <b>got</b> better while, after November 1942, the U.S. Navy never stopped getting better.|$|E

5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{a tribute}} album titled Every Man Has a Woman was released, {{featuring}} {{a selection of}} Ono songs performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, Roberta Flack, Eddie Money, Rosanne Cash, and Harry Nilsson. It was one of Lennon's projects that he <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to finish. Later that year, Ono and Lennon's final album, Milk and Honey, was released as an unfinished demo. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the U.S., going gold in both countries {{as well as in}} Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Sing was {{contacted}} by the World Wrestling Federation to help their ailing women's division. She, however, was repackaged as Bertha Faye, a comedic character {{who lived in a}} trailer park and dated Harvey Wippleman. (in an OWW radio interview Wippleman revealed that the two <b>never</b> <b>got</b> along well) WWF management originally wanted her to have an on-screen feud with Bull Nakano, but there was a change of plans after Nakano was charged with cocaine possession.|$|E

5|$|In {{his years}} as the Bengals' head coach, Brown took the team to the playoffs three times, {{including}} in 1970. Yet despite finding a franchise quarterback in Ken Anderson, Brown's team <b>never</b> <b>got</b> past {{the first round of}} the postseason tournament. Four days after the Bengals were eliminated from the playoffs in 1975, Brown announced he was retiring after 45 years of coaching. The game had changed dramatically during his time in the NFL, growing from America's second sport to the country's biggest and most lucrative pastime. Brown was 67 years old.|$|E
5|$|McLeod married Albertus Bethune in 1898, {{and they}} {{lived for a}} year in Savannah, Georgia, where she did social work. They had a son Albert together. Coyden Harold Uggams, a visiting Presbyterian minister, persuaded the couple to {{relocate}} to Palatka, Florida, to run a mission school. The Bethunes moved in 1899; Mary ran the mission school and began an outreach to prisoners. Albertus left the family in 1907; he <b>never</b> <b>got</b> a divorce but relocated to South Carolina. He died in 1918 from tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Sid Meier, Robert T. Smith {{created the}} {{precursor}} of all 4X strategy video games: Armada 2525 (followed up by a version with enhanced graphics: Armada 2525 Deluxe). However, {{due to the}} financial problems of the publishing company Interstel Corporation, Armada 2525 <b>never</b> <b>got</b> enough marketing and attention from gamers. Future 4X space strategy games such as Master of Orion {{would go on to}} adopt the gameplay and concepts found in Armada 2525. Armada 2526, the spiritual successor to Armada 2525 was released by Ntronium Games in 2009, 19 years after the release of the original in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan. They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and probably <b>never</b> <b>got</b> closer than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E
5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that <b>never</b> <b>got</b> finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} over Bennett's actions became public in mid-1945, {{when the war}} ended and Percival and Callaghan were released from Japanese captivity. Percival, who had <b>never</b> <b>got</b> on with Bennett, wrote a letter accusing him of relinquishing his command without permission. Callaghan delivered the letter to Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a court of enquiry under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, and Major Generals Victor Stantke and George Wootten, which found that Bennett was not justified in handing over his command, or in leaving Singapore. Veterans of the 8th Division, who were generally loyal to Bennett, protested against this finding.|$|E

5|$|After what {{is later}} {{believed}} to have been at least three months, Daniel is finally able to reconstruct the planet's history with the finished translations: the Ancients had attempted to escape a mysterious plague by building a time machine but <b>never</b> <b>got</b> it to work properly. Upon returning to the planet, SG-1 learn of the death of Malikai's wife, whom Malikai wants to visit in the past {{with the help of the}} time machine. O'Neill's experience of his son's death convinces Malikai to shut down the device before yet another new loop can start. Back at the SGC, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel have their first breakfast after the loops, and O'Neill answers Daniel's question about unusual activities in the loops with a long look at Carter.|$|E
5|$|Although three launch battalions {{were formed}} by the Germans in late 1943, they <b>never</b> <b>got</b> the chance to deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the Oberkommando West {{authorised}} the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker {{to make it a}} LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{graduated}} in 1925 and enrolled at Ohio State University the following year, {{hoping to make}} the Buckeyes team. He <b>never</b> <b>got</b> past the tryout phase. After his freshman year, he transferred to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he followed Weeb Ewbank as the school's starting quarterback. Under Coach Chester Pittser, Brown {{was named to the}} All-Ohio small-college second team by the Associated Press at the end of 1928. In two seasons at Miami, Brown guided the team to a 14–3 record. He married his high school sweetheart Katie Kester the following year. Brown had taken pre-law at Miami and considered studying history on a Rhodes Scholarship, but after college he instead took his first job as a coach. On Stewart's recommendation, Severn School, a private prep school in Maryland, hired him in 1930.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones <b>never</b> <b>got</b> back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{lost the}} April 8 {{national}} championship game against Midwest number one seed Louisville by an 82–76 score. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Burke scored 24 points {{in the championship game}} and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan <b>never</b> <b>got</b> closer than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{had become}} one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, {{on the back of the}} highly {{successful}} Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but in the event the planned development of the follow-up C10 and C15 electric cars <b>never</b> <b>got</b> further than the drawing board.|$|E
