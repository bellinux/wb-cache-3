5|$|Fitting new {{traction}} equipment both improves Miles per Breakdown values and overall reduces operating and maintenance costs. As the trains will therefore {{be in the}} depot less, it will allow South West Trains to acquire additional rolling stock without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new depot.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was opened}} in 2001 after just under {{a year of}} {{construction}} and almost two decades of community requests. Local residents led by Doug and Bruce Stephens urged the state to connect I-84 directly to Adams Avenue, bypassing the congested US-89. Then-governor Mike Leavitt suggested that a private company rather than the state would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the road.|$|E

5|$|Discussions on the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an {{underground}} transportation system in Buenos Aires {{began in the}} late nineteenth century, alongside the tramway system, {{which was one of the}} most extensive in the world at the time. The first trams appeared in 1870, and by about 1900 the system was in a crisis exacerbated by the monopolisation of the lines, which had concentrated under the ownership of fewer companies during the electrification of the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E
5|$|In the south, the 3rd Parachute Brigade started {{crossing}} the River Dives on 18August, delayed by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a crossing {{to replace the}} bridge destroyed by the division during Operation Tonga. By nightfall the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was engaging the German rearguard and the 8th Parachute Battalion reached the outskirts of Goustranville. The next morning the brigade advance continued into Goustranville, where they came under heavy artillery fire from the high ground at Putot. Their attack faltered and Gale decided to restart the advance that night. He ordered the 3rd Parachute Brigade to secure the start point along the Dives canal and railway line, while the 5th Parachute Brigade assaulted the artillery position at Putot.|$|E

5|$|The US {{plan had}} been delayed by the wartime <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> smaller vessels. Nevertheless, {{estimates}} by the Admiralty were {{that by the}} early 1920s the Royal Navy would be behind in ships. By the beginning of 1920, the Americans had completed one battleship {{since the end of}} World War I and had five more building. Seven more were intended to be laid down in 1920–21, six of these were the very large and powerful , armed with twelve 16-inch guns. The Japanese had finished one battleship {{since the end of the}} war and had three more under construction. To correct this state of affairs, the Admiralty initially planned to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in Fiscal Year (FY) 1921–22 and again in FY 1922–23, but this was changed to four s to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, the Maltese islands {{along with}} the North African port city of Tripoli {{were given to the}} Order of Saint John by Emperor Charles V. The knights settled in the town of Birgu and made it their capital. Soon after their arrival, the Order rebuilt the Castrum Maris, calling it Fort Saint Angelo. Later on, the entire town of Birgu began to be {{surrounded}} by new fortifications, in a similar style to the Order's earlier defences in Rhodes. Birgu's land front was built by 1540. Following the attack of 1551, the Order realised the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> more defences. Two forts were built in 1552 - Fort Saint Elmo {{at the tip of the}} Sciberras Peninsula, on the site of an Aragonese watchtower, and Fort Saint Michael on Isola. In 1553, a new fortified city began to be built around Fort Saint Michael, and it was named Senglea after the Grand Master who built it.|$|E
