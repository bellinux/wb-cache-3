40|$|BeFinD {{working paper}} n° 17 There is {{currently}} no agreed comprehensive methodology {{on how to}} track and report on public climate finance. One of the difficulties – next to determining the climate relevance of projects funded– is the {{valuation of financial instruments}} other than grants (i. e. loans, guarantees, equity). For loans, the calculation of the <b>grant</b> <b>equivalent</b> of the financial flow is relatively straightforward, but for equity, it is unclear what the best way is to value the <b>grant</b> <b>equivalent.</b> Hence, the primary objective of this research paper is to provide an overview of the variety of methods {{that can be used to}} value the provision of public climate finance to developing countries through equity investments. In this endeavour, special attention will be paid to recent debates taking place in the context of the modernisation of the OECD DAC statistical system about how to better represent the donor effort involved in extending private sector instruments and especially equity investments. nrpages: 40 status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Franz Xaver Schwarz, {{who held}} Ehrenführer (honorary) rank, {{was the only}} holder of the rank who was not <b>granted</b> <b>equivalent</b> police or Waffen-SS rank. The Oberst-Gruppenführer rank was worn on the field-grey Waffen-SS tunic, the grey SS service tunic, or in Daluege's case the German police uniform.

50|$|The SS Membership Runes {{were the}} first step in a merger of the Order Police and the SS, with Kurt Daluege and Heinrich Himmler both agreeing on a total merger of the SS and Police in Germany to be {{accomplished}} by the mid 1950s. This process was taken one step further in 1942, when all Orpo Police Generals were <b>granted</b> <b>equivalent</b> SS rank and began wearing modified SS-Police rank insignia. This was also expanded very slightly to the Fire Police and other Police forces.|$|R
50|$|In 1940, {{standard}} {{practice in the}} German Police was to <b>grant</b> <b>equivalent</b> SS rank to all police generals. Police generals {{who were members of}} the SS were referred to simultaneously by both rank titles - for instance, a Generalleutnant in the Police who was also an SS member would be referred to as SS Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei. In 1942, SS membership became mandatory for police generals, with SS collar insignia (overlaid on police green backing) worn by all police officers ranked Generalmajor and above.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} between {{the police and the}} SS had virtually disappeared by 1943 with the creation of the SS and Police Regiments, which were consolidated from earlier police security battalions.

In August 1944, when Himmler was appointed Chef des Ersatzheeres (Chief of the Home Army), all police generals automatically were granted Waffen-SS rank because they had authority over the prisoner-of-war camps.|$|R

500|$|The most {{significant}} rapid transit proposal came {{as part of}} the Forward Thrust initiatives of the late 1960s, which was centered around a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue. The subway would be fed by lines from Ballard, Lake City, the University District, Capitol Hill, Bellevue, and Renton, combining for a planned minimum headway of [...] minutes at rush hour, [...] minutes during midday, and five minutes at all other times. The stations on 3rd Avenue were to be situated at South Jackson Street and 5th Avenue South, James and Cherry streets, Seneca and Spring streets, and Pike and Pine streets, all planned to open by 1985 and operated by the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle. Seattle voters were asked to provide $385 million (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars), to supplement a $765 million <b>grant</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to $ in [...] dollars) from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), during a municipal election on February 13, 1968, narrowly passing the bond by 50.8%, but falling short of the required 60 percent supermajority. A second attempt on May 19, 1970, with an adjusted $440 million local contribution (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) and $881 million federal <b>grant</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to $ in [...] dollars), failed to pass with only 46% approval amid a local recession caused by layoffs at Boeing; the earmarked funds intended for the Forward Thrust rapid transit project were instead allocated to Atlanta, to build its rapid transit system.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, {{nearly every}} SS general was <b>granted</b> <b>equivalent</b> Waffen-SS rank, {{without regard to}} {{previous}} military service. This was ordered so to give SS-generals authority over military units and POW camps and apparently to try to provide potential protection under the Hague Convention rules of warfare. In the event of capture by the Allies, SS-Generals would be given status as military prisoners rather than captured police officials. This distinction was observed by British and American forces in the West, but hardly ever even noticed by the Soviet Red Army, in particular in situations where SS and Police Leaders or other SS units involved in genocide, would fall into Soviet hands.|$|R

50|$|The first {{plans to}} build a branch line towards Pomerania arose with the {{development}} of plans for the Berlin-Szczecin railway in 1837. The city of Prenzlau approached the planning committee for the Berlin-Stettin Railway Company (BStE) to ask it to build the line to Stettin (now Szczecin) {{as close as possible to}} Prenzlau. The Prussian inspector of road building, Friedrich Neuhaus investigated the various route alternatives and favoured a route via Prenzlau. Two years later, Prenzlau sent a deputation to offer a <b>grant</b> <b>equivalent</b> to 30,000-50,000 marks to sway the committee accordingly. Furthermore, it presented the benefits of a northern alignment via Prenzlau rather than a direct connection.

5000|$|From 1873 to 1881 the Texas and Pacific built a {{total of}} 972 miles (1,560 km) of track; as a result it was {{entitled}} to land grants totalling 12,441,600 acres (50,349 km²). T&P, however, received land only {{for the construction of}} track east of Fort Worth. This meant the firm received only 5,173,120 acres (20,935 km²). The State of Texas did not award the additional area because, it said, the construction had not been completed within the time required by the firm's charter. The then state Attorney General Charles A.

40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid has intensified in recent years as aid has come under increasing budgetary pressures in donor countries. Whatever the merits of the opposing arguments, the fundamental issue arises of whether conventionally-used measures of aid such as ODA, that lump together grants and loans, accurately reflect true aid flows. In this paper we analyze the methodological shortcomings of conventional aid measures, and propose a new valuation approach that measures official aid flows as the sum of grants and the <b>grant</b> <b>equivalents</b> of official loans. We show how this conceptually-superior aid measure can diverge significantly from the conventional aggregates and provide a quite different view on major aid trends. We include a companion data set with this paper to provide estimates of our new aid measure - Effective Development Assistance - for a set of 133 developing countries from 1975 to 1995. _____________________________________________________ [...] ...|$|R

This algorithm runs in linear time. The decision problem determines whether the given set of nets is coupling-free routable.

The concept of a true ensemble company - a nucleus of actors performing a roster of plays back-to-back within the course of each season - was practically unheard of in American theatre, let alone a theatre based on the black experience, created and staffed by black artists.
