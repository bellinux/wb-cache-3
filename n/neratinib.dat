We further assessed its effects with or without trastuzumab in several sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells as well as a BT 474 xenograft model. We confirmed that <b>neratinib</b> was significantly more active in HER 2 -amplified than HER 2 non-amplified cell lines. <b>Neratinib</b> decreased the activation of the 4 HER receptors and inhibited downstream pathways. However, HER 3 and Akt were reactivated at 24 hours, which was prevented by the combination of trastuzumab and <b>neratinib.</b> <b>Neratinib</b> also decreased pHER 2 and pHER 3 in acquired trastuzumab resistant cells. <b>Neratinib</b> in combination with trastuzumab had a greater growth inhibitory effect than either drug alone in 4 HER 2 positive cell lines.

40|$|Background The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of <b>neratinib</b> monotherapy were {{compared with that of}} lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 -positive (HER 2 +), locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer and prior trastuzumab treatment. Methods Patients received <b>neratinib</b> 240 mg/d continuously (n = 117) or lapatinib 1250 mg/d continuously plus capecitabine 2000 mg/m 2 per day on days 1 - 14 of each 21 -d cycle (n = 116). The primary aim was to demonstrate non-inferiority of <b>neratinib</b> for progression-free survival (PFS). Findings The non-inferiority of <b>neratinib</b> was not demonstrated when compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine (hazard ratio, 1. 19; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 89 - 1. 60; non-inferiority margin, 1. 15). Median PFS for <b>neratinib</b> was 4. 5 months versus 6. 8 months for lapatinib plus capecitabine and median overall survival was 19. 7 months versus 23. 6 months. Objective response rate (<b>neratinib,</b> 29 % versus lapatinib plus capecitabine, 41 %; P = 0. 067) and clinical benefit rate (44 % versus 64 %; P = 0. 003) were lower for the <b>neratinib</b> arm but consistent with previously reported results. In both treatment arms, diarrhoea was the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event of any grade (<b>neratinib,</b> 85 % versus lapatinib plus capecitabine, 68 %; P = 0. 002) and of grade 3 / 4 (28 % versus 10 %; P < 0. 001), but was typically managed with concomitant anti-diarrhoeal medication and/or study treatment modification. Importantly, <b>neratinib</b> had no significant skin toxicity. Interpretation The results are considered as inconclusive since neither inferiority nor non-inferiority of treatment with <b>neratinib</b> versus lapatinib plus capecitabine could be demonstrated. The study confirmed relevant single-agent clinical activity and acceptable overall tolerability of <b>neratinib</b> in patients with recurrent HER 2 + advanced breast cancer. © 2013 The Authors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction: Despite the {{availability}} of several potent HER 2 -directed targeted agents, primary and acquired resistance continues to influence patient outcomes in HER 2 -positive breast cancer. <b>Neratinib</b> is an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor in late-phase clinical development. Areas covered: This review article focuses on <b>neratinib</b> {{in the treatment of}} HER 2 -positive breast cancer – early and metastatic stage – and HER 2 -mutant breast cancer, with particular emphasis on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Expert opinion: The phase III ExteNET trial shows that <b>neratinib</b> improves 2 -year invasive disease-free survival after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in early-stage HER 2 -positive breast cancer, and in particular HER 2 +/HR+ tumors. Survival data are awaited. The investigational role of <b>neratinib</b> in high-risk patients or conversely in de-escalation dual regimens with other anti-HER 2 therapies and without chemotherapy are of interest. Phase II trials show that <b>neratinib</b> has efficacy, either as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic or endocrine agents, in patients with HER 2 -positive metastatic breast cancer and in tumors harboring HER 2 mutations. The role of <b>neratinib</b> in therapeutic algorithms of HER 2 -positive patients, as well as delaying CNS events, awaits the results of ongoing trials such as NALA. Diarrhea, the main toxicity of <b>neratinib,</b> can be effectively managed with early loperamide prophylaxis. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

In recent years, {{a new group of}} compounds that bind irreversibly to the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket of HER receptors have been developed. One of these compounds, <b>neratinib,</b> has passed preclinical phases and is currently undergoing various clinical trials. This manuscript reviews the preclinical as well as clinical data on <b>neratinib.</b> As a pan-HER inhibitor, this irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor binds and inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptors, EGFR (or HER 1), HER 2 and HER 4, which leads to reduced phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways. <b>Neratinib</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective against HER 2 -overexpressing or mutant tumors in vitro and in vivo. <b>Neratinib</b> is currently being investigated in various clinical trials in breast cancers and other solid tumors, including those with HER 2 mutation. Earlier studies have already shown promising clinical activity for <b>neratinib.</b> However, more translational research is required to investigate biomarkers that could help to predict response and resistance for selection of appropriate patients for treatment with <b>neratinib,</b> either as monotherapy or in combination with other drug(s).

40|$|<b>Neratinib</b> is an {{irreversible}} pan-human epidermal {{growth factor}} receptor (HER) inhibitor. It targets the tyrosine-kinase activity of the {{epidermal growth factor}} receptors EGFR/ HER 1, HER 2 and HER 4. Through the inhibition of tyrosine-kinase activity, downstream signalling pathways get activated and phosphorylation is reduced. Currently, <b>neratinib</b> is neither approved in the US nor in Europe for any indication. The safety and efficacy of <b>neratinib</b> after trastuzumab-based adjuvant treatment in patients with early stage HER 2 -positive breast cancer were assessed in the ExteNET trial, a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study. 2, 840 women were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either <b>neratinib</b> (n= 1, 420; 240 mg daily) or matching placebo (n= 1, 420). The stratification of randomisation (permuted block randomisation) {{was based on the}} hormone receptor status, nodal status, and the type of previously received trastuzumab-based adjuvant regimen. The median follow-up of the study was 24 months (IQR 20 – 25) in the <b>neratinib</b> group and 24 months (IQR 22 – 25) in the placebo group. The primary outcome of the study was invasive disease-free survival (DFS). After a 24 -month follow-up, significantly fewer invasive DFS events had occurred in the <b>neratinib</b> group compared to the placebo group (70 vs. 109 events). The two-year invasive DFS rate was 93. 9 % (95 % CI 92. 4 – 95. 2) and 91. 6 % (95 % CI 90. 0 – 93. 0) in the <b>neratinib</b> and placebo groups, respectively. At the time of primary analysis the secondary outcome, overall survival (OS), was immature, since the target number of OS events had not been reached. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) in the <b>neratinib</b> group was diarrhoea: Over 90 % of the patients had diarrhoea of any grade (40 % had grade 3 diarrhoea). Serious AEs occurred in 103 patients (7 %) of the <b>neratinib</b> group and in 85 patients (6 %) of the placebo group. Currently, no cost estimates are available for <b>neratinib</b> neither in the US nor in Europe. However, additional costs for possible prospective biomarkers as well as increased costs due to the treatment and monitoring of possible gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicities are likely to incur. Although <b>neratinib</b> offers an improvement in invasive DFS, the gastrointestinal toxicities in combination with possible cardiac toxicities suggest an unfavourable benefit-risk ratio. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate patient population, to verify the long-term benefit, and to exclude toxic effects of the cardiovascular system...|$|E
30|$|<b>Neratinib</b> is an oral, {{irreversible}} inhibitor of both EGFR and HER 2; in preclinical {{studies conducted}} on cell lines with both an activating EGFR mutation and the T 790 M, <b>neratinib</b> {{was more effective}} at suppressing cell proliferation than gefitinib [22]. After a phase I trial, recruiting heavily pretreated patients with NSCLC in which the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was at 320  mg daily [23], <b>neratinib</b> was studied in a phase II study. During the study, due {{to the development of}} grade 3 diarrhea in more than 50 % of patients at MTD, the dose was decreased to 240  mg orally daily. Unfortunately the drug showed modest clinical efficacy with only 3 % response rate in 91 EGFR mutant patients included in a phase II study and with no response in patients EGFR T 790 M mutated [24]. The lack of efficacy could probably be related to the high concentrations of <b>neratinib</b> required in preclinical studies to inhibit EGFR T 790 M and the limitations of clinical dosing.|$|E
40|$|Background: In a phase II study, oral <b>neratinib</b> was {{administered}} to patients (pts) with advanced breast cancer in 2 cohorts, those with prior trastuzumab (prior T, n= 66) and those with no prior trastuzumab treatment (no prior T, n= 70). <b>Neratinib</b> demonstrated robust antitumor activity with objective response rates of 26 % and 51 %, respectively, and was generally tolerable (Burstein et al. Cancer Res 2009; 69 : 72 S). Diarrhea, all grades, occured in 89 % of total pts. Characteristics of the diarrhea and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements are described. Methods: Pts were required to have ErbB 2 -gene amplification in tumor tissue as measured by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} by independent assessment. Serial LVEF measurements were made with a multigated acquisition scan or echocardiogram. Pts were ineligible if baseline LVEF was < 50 %. Adverse events were graded based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria, v 3. 0. Pts received oral <b>neratinib</b> 240 mg daily. Results: Data collected by 18 Mar 2009 are reported; the median (range) duration of <b>neratinib</b> treatment was 4. 5 (0. 2 - 23. 5) months for pts with prior T and 7. 8 (0. 5 - 24. 2) months for pts with no prior T. Diarrhea, all grades, occurred in 93 % of the total population (prior T: 97 %, no prior T: 13 %). Median times of onset were 2 and 3 days after first dose of <b>neratinib,</b> respectively, and median durations of diarrhea were 7 and 5 days. In study week 1, 86 % and 73 % of pts with prior T and no prior T, respectively, had diarrhea; this decreased to 12 - 14 % in months 3 and 4 (Table). Diarrhea was the cause of dose interruptions in 36 % of pts with prior T and 11 % in pts with no prior T and of dose reductions in 30 % of pts with prior T and 5 % of pts with no prior T; only 1 pt (prior T) discontinued treatment due to diarrhea. Pts used anti-diarrheal medications for supportive therapy (prior T: 91 %, no prior T: 67 %). For LVEF measurements, there was little variation from baseline in most pts during the study. Four pts had at least 1 LVEF measurement < 50 % (2 of these pts had measurements within the institutional range of normal). None had congestive heart failure. One of these pts had grade III atrioventricular block and grade III bradycardia, which were considered unrelated to <b>neratinib.</b> Discussion: <b>Neratinib</b> treatment was not associated with clinically significant cardiotoxicity. Pts who developed diarrhea with <b>neratinib</b> monotherapy had early onset, but frequency and severity decreased with time on study. Despite the high frequency of diarrhea with <b>neratinib</b> treatment, it was readily managed with supportive therapy and dose interruptions and/or reductions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in the HER 2 tyrosine kinase {{have been identified}} in human breast cancers that lack HER 2 gene amplification. These patients are not candidates for HER 2 -targeted drugs under current standards of care, but preclinical data strongly suggest that these patients will benefit from anti-HER 2 drugs. This case report describes a young woman with metastatic breast cancer whose tumor was found to carry a HER 2 L 755 S mutation, which is in the kinase domain of HER 2. Treatment with the second-generation HER 2 /EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor <b>neratinib</b> resulted in partial response and dramatic improvement in the patient’s functional status. This partial response lasted 11 months, and when the patient’s cancer progressed, she was treated with <b>neratinib</b> plus capecitabine and her cancer again responded.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Efficacious {{application}} of HER 2 -targetting agents requires {{the identification of}} novel predictive biomarkers. Lapatinib, afatinib and <b>neratinib</b> are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of HER 2 and EGFR growth factor receptors. A panel of breast cancer cell lines was treated with these agents, trastuzumab, gefitinib and cytotoxic therapies and the expression pattern of a specific panel of genes using RT-PCR was investigated as a potential marker of early drug response to HER 2 -targeting therapies. 				 				 					 						Results 					Treatment of HER 2 TKI-sensitive SKBR 3 and BT 474 cell lines with lapatinib, afatinib and <b>neratinib</b> induced {{an increase in the}} expression of RB 1 CC 1, ERBB 3, FOXO 3 a and NR 3 C 1. The response directly correlated with the degree of sensitivity. This expression pattern switched from up-regulated to down-regulated in the HER 2 expressing, HER 2 -TKI insensitive cell line MDAMB 453. Expression of the CCND 1 gene demonstrated an inversely proportional response to drug exposure. A similar expression pattern was observed following the treatment with both <b>neratinib</b> and afatinib. These patterns were retained following exposure to traztuzumab and lapatinib plus capecitabine. In contrast, gefitinib, dasatinib and epirubicin treatment resulted in a completely different expression pattern change. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					In these HER 2 -expressing cell line models, lapatinib, <b>neratinib,</b> afatinib and trastuzumab treatment generated a characteristic and specific gene expression response, proportionate to the sensitivity of the cell lines to the HER 2 inhibitor. Characterisation of the induced changes in expression levels of these genes may therefore give a valuable, very early predictor of the likely extent and specificity of tumour HER 2 inhibitor response in patients, potentially guiding more specific use of these agents...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE <b>Neratinib</b> is an oral, {{irreversible}} pan-ErbB receptor {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor. The efficacy and safety of <b>neratinib</b> were evaluated in two cohorts of patients with advanced ErbB 2 -positive breast cancer-those with and those without prior trastuzumab treatment-in an open-label, multicenter, phase II trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients in the two cohorts (prior trastuzumab, n = 66; no prior trastuzumab, n = 70) received oral <b>neratinib</b> 240 mg once daily. The primary end point was the 16 -week progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the evaluable population (prior trastuzumab, n = 63; no prior trastuzumab, n = 64), as assessed by independent review. Results The 16 -week PFS rates were 59 % for patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 78 % for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment. Median PFS was 22. 3 and 39. 6 weeks, respectively. Objective response rates were 24 % among patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 56 % in the trastuzumab-naïve cohort. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Diarrhea was the most frequent grades 3 to 4 adverse event, occurring in 30 % of patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and in 13 % of patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment, which prompted dose reductions in 29 % and 4 % of patients, respectively, but treatment discontinuation in only one patient. No neratinib-related, grades 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity was reported.

40|$|Increased {{expression}} and activation of human {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) and HER- 2 {{have been reported in}} numerous cancers. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the sensitivity of a large panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines (OCCLs) to treatment with various forms of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cytotoxic drugs. The aim was to see if there was any association between the protein expression of various biomarkers including three putative ovarian cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (CD 24, CD 44, CD 117 /c-Kit), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and HER family members and response to treatment with these agents. The sensitivity of 10 ovarian tumour cell lines to the treatment with various forms of HER TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, sapitinib, afatinib, canertinib, <b>neratinib),</b> as well as other TKIs (dasatinib, imatinib, NVP-AEW 541, crizotinib) and cytotoxic agents (paclitaxel, cisplatin and doxorubicin), as single agents or in combination, was determined by SRB assay. The effect on these agents on the cell cycle distribution, and downstream signaling molecules and tumour migration were determined using flow cytometry, western blotting, and the IncuCyte Clear View cell migration assay respectively. Of the HER inhibitors, the irreversible pan-TKIs (canertinib, <b>neratinib</b> and afatinib) were the most effective TKIs for inhibiting the growth of all ovarian cancer cells, and for blocking the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER- 2, AKT and MAPK in SKOV 3 cells. Interestingly, while the majority of cancer cells were highly sensitive to treatment with dasatinib, they were relatively resistant to treatment with imatinib (i. e., IC 50 > 10 µM). Of the cytotoxic agents, paclitaxel was the most effective for inhibiting the growth of OCCLs, and of various combinations of these drugs, only treatment with a combination of NVP-AEW 541 and paclitaxel produced a synergistic or additive anti-proliferative effect in all three cell lines examined (i. e., SKOV 3, Caov 3, ES 2). Finally, of the TKIs, only treatment with afatinib, <b>neratinib</b> and dasatinib were able to reduce the migration of HER- 2 overexpressing SKOV 3 cells. We did not find any significant association between the expression of putative ovarian CSC marker, HER family members, c-MET, ALK, and IGF-IR and the response to the irreversible HER TKIs. Our results support the need for further investigations of the therapeutic potential of these irreversible HER family blockers in ovarian cancer, and the therapeutic potential of dasatinib when used in combination with the inhibitors of the HER family members in ovarian cancer...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: While the {{treatment}} of HER 2 over-expressing breast cancer with recent HER-targeted drugs has been highly effective for some patients, primary (also known as innate) or acquired resistance limits {{the success of these}} drugs. microRNAs have potential as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as replacement therapies. Here we investigated the role of microRNA- 630 (miR- 630) in breast cancer progression and as a predictive biomarker for response to HER-targeting drugs, ultimately yielding potential as a therapeutic approach to add value to these drugs. METHODS: We investigated the levels of intra- and extracellular miR- 630 in cells and conditioned media from breast cancer cell lines with either innate- or acquired- resistance to HER-targeting lapatinib and <b>neratinib,</b> compared to their corresponding drug sensitive cell lines, using qPCR. To support the role of miR- 630 in breast cancer, we examined the clinical relevance of this miRNA in breast cancer tumours versus matched peritumours. Transfection of miR- 630 mimics and inhibitors was used to manipulate the expression of miR- 630 to assess effects on response to HER-targeting drugs (lapatinib, <b>neratinib</b> and afatinib). Other phenotypic changes associated with cellular aggressiveness were evaluated by motility, invasion and anoikis assays. TargetScan prediction software, qPCR, immunoblotting and ELISAs, were used to assess miR- 6302 ̆ 7 s regulation of mRNA, proteins and their phosphorylated forms. RESULTS: We established that introducing miR- 630 into cells with innate- or acquired- resistance to HER-drugs significantly restored the efficacy of lapatinib, <b>neratinib</b> and afatinib; through a mechanism which we have determined to, at least partly, involve miR- 6302 ̆ 7 s regulation of IGF 1 R. Conversely, we demonstrated that blocking miR- 630 induced resistance/insensitivity to these drugs. Cellular motility, invasion, and anoikis were also observed as significantly altered by miR- 630 manipulation, whereby introducing miR- 630 into cells reduced cellular aggression while inhibition of miR- 630 induced a more aggressive cellular phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest miR- 630 as a key regulator of cancer cell progression in HER 2 over-expressing breast cancer, through targeting of IGF 1 R. This study supports miR- 630 as a diagnostic and a predictive biomarker for response to HER-targeted drugs and indicates that the therapeutic addition of miR- 630 may enhance and improve patients 2 ̆ 7 response to HER-targeting drugs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe current {{standard}} adjuvant {{systemic treatment}} of early HER 2 -positive breast cancer consists of chemotherapy plus 12 months of trastuzumab, {{with or without}} endocrine therapy. Several trials have investigated modifications of the standard treatment that are shorter and less resource-demanding (de-escalation) or regimens that aim at dual HER 2 inhibition or include longer than 12 months of HER 2 -targeted treatment (escalation). Seven randomized trials investigate shorter than 12 months of trastuzumab treatment duration. The shorter durations were not statistically inferior to the 1 -year duration in the 3 trials with survival results available, but 2 of the trials were small and 1 had a relatively short follow-up time of the patients {{at the time of}} reporting. The pathological complete response (pCR) rates were numerically higher in all 9 randomized trials that compared chemotherapy plus dual HER 2 inhibition consisting of trastuzumab plus either lapatinib, <b>neratinib,</b> or pertuzumab with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatments, but the superiority of chemotherapy plus dual HER 2 -inhibition over chemotherapy plus trastuzumab remains to be demonstrated in the adjuvant setting. One year of adjuvant trastuzumab was as effective as 2 years of trastuzumab in the HERA trial, and was associated with fewer side-effects. Extending 1 -year adjuvant trastuzumab treatment with 1 year of <b>neratinib</b> improved disease-free survival in the ExteNET trial, but the patient follow-up times are still short, and no overall survival benefit was reported. Several important trials are expected to report results in the near future and may modify the current standard...|$|E
40|$|Deregulation of ErbB/HER {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases {{has been}} linked to several types of cancer. The mechanism of activation of these receptors includes establishment of receptor dimers. Here, we have analyzed the action of different small molecule HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on HER receptor dimerization. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with distinct TKIs and the formation of HER 2 -HER 3 dimers was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation and western blot or by Förster resonance energy transfer assays. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was analyzed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase and cell viability. Lapatinib and <b>neratinib</b> interfered with ligand-induced dimerization of HER receptors; while pelitinib, gefitinib, canertinib or erlotinib did not. Moreover, lapatinib and <b>neratinib</b> were able to disrupt previously formed receptor dimers. Structural analyses allowed the elucidation of the mechanism by which some TKIs prevent the formation of HER receptor dimers, while others do not. Experiments aimed at defining the functional importance of dimerization indicated that TKIs that impeded dimerization prevented down-regulation of HER 2 receptors, and favored the action of trastuzumab. We postulate that TKIs that prevent dimerization and down-regulation of HER 2 may augment the antitumoral action of trastuzumab, and this mechanism of action should be considered in the treatment of HER 2 positive tumors which combine TKIs with antireceptor antibodies.

40|$|THESIS 10347 Cancer {{remains one}} of the leading causes of death worldwide. Breast and {{prostate}} cancer are the most frequently diagnosed cancers among women and men, respectively. Despite some breakthroughs in their treatment, innate or acquired-resistance hinders the continued success of some treatments. Through the initial use of breast cancer cell lines with acquired- or innate-resistance to trastuzumab, lapatinib and later assessing <b>neratinib</b> and afatinib, this PhD investigated the mechanisms behind resistance to these therapies. Similarly, the mechanisms involved in regulating docetaxel-resistance in prostate cancer cell lines were also investigated. The second focus of this PhD involved testing the hypothesis that the extracellular environment may carry biomarkers representative of their cells of origin, thus offering the potential of identifying biomarkers in a minimally- invasive manner...|$|E
40|$|Background Trastuzumab is an anti-HER 2 {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) therapy capable of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) {{and used in}} the treatment of HER 2 + breast cancer. Through interactions with FcƴR+ immune cell subsets, trastuzumab functions as a passive immunotherapy. The EGFR/HER 2 -targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib and the next generation TKIs afatinib and <b>neratinib,</b> can alter HER 2 levels, potentially modulating the ADCC response to trastuzumab. Using LDH-release assays, we investigated the impact of antigen modulation, assay duration and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) activity on trastuzumab-mediated ADCC in breast cancer models of maximal (SKBR 3) and minimal (MCF- 7) target antigen expression to determine if modulating the ADCC response to trastuzumab using TKIs may be a viable approach for enhancing tumor immune reactivity. Methods HER 2 levels were determined in lapatinib, afatinib and neratinib-treated SKBR 3 and MCF- 7 using high content analysis (HCA). Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC was assessed following treatment with TKIs utilising a colorimetric LDH release-based protocol at 4 and 12 h timepoints. PBMC activity was assessed against non-MHC-restricted K 562 cells. A flow cytometry-based method (CFSE/ 7 -AAD) was also used to measure trastuzumab-mediated ADCC in medium-treated SKBR 3 and MCF- 7. Results HER 2 antigen levels were significantly altered by the three TKIs in both cell line models. The TKIs significantly reduced LDH levels directly in SKBR 3 cells but not MCF- 7. Lapatinib and <b>neratinib</b> augment trastuzumab-related ADCC in SKBR 3 but the effect was not consistent with antigen expression levels and was dependent on volunteer PBMC activity (vs. K 562). A 12 h assay timepoint produced more consistent results. Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC (PBMC:target cell ratio of 10 : 1) was measured at 7. 6 ± 4. 7...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the cancer}} {{biomarkers}} widely used today is the amplifi cation and aberrant overexpression of human epi-dermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2, {{a member of the}} ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases [1]. HER 2 amplifi cation/overexpression, observed in several cancers, including breast cancer, is associated with poor prognosis and predicts therapeutic benefi t from anti-HER 2 agents [1, 2]. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, was the fi rst agent targeting HER 2 and was approved for the treatment of HER 2 + breast cancer in 1998 [3]. Since then, several small molecule inhibitors targeting HER signaling have been developed, such as the reversible HER 1 /HER 2 inhibitor lapatinib and the irreversible pan-HER inhibitor <b>neratinib</b> [4, 5].

40|$|There {{are four}} {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the ´HER´ or ErbB receptor family: EGFR, HER 2, HER 3, and HER 4.

40|$|Tyrosine and aurora kinases are {{important}} effectors in signal transduction pathways {{that are often}} involved in aberrant cancer cell growth. Tyrosine (TKI) and aurora (AKI) kinase inhibitors are anti-cancer agents specifically designed to target such signaling pathways through TKI/AKI binding to the ATP-binding pocket of kinases thereby leading to diminished kinase activity. Some TKIs {{have been identified as}} inhibitors of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which are commonly upregulated in malignant cells. TKI/AKIs have been investigated as ABC transporter inhibitors in order to facilitate the accumulation of concomitantly administered chemo-therapeutics within cancer cells. However, ABC transporters are prominently expressed in the liver and other eliminating organs, and their inhibition has been linked to intracellular accumulation of drugs, altered disposition, and toxicity. The potential for TKIs/AKIs to inhibit other important hepatic efflux transporters, particularly multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to compare the inhibitory potency of 20 selected TKI/AKIs against MRP 4 and BCRP through the use of inverted membrane vesicle assays. Relative IC 50 values were estimated by determining TKI/AKI inhibition of MRP 4 -mediated [3 H]-dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate uptake and BCRP-mediated [3 H]-estrone sulfate uptake. To provide insight to the clinical relevance of TKI/AKI inhibition of ABC efflux transporters, the ratio of the steady-state maximum total plasma concentration (Css) to the IC 50 for each compound was calculated with Css/IC 50 ratio > 0. 1 deemed potentially clinically relevant. Such analysis identified several potentially clinically relevant inhibitors of MRP 4 : alisertib, danusertib, erlotinib, lapatinib, <b>neratinib,</b> nilotinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and tozasertib. The potentially clinically relevant inhibition of BCRP was much more extensive and included alisertib, barasertib, danusertib, enzastaurin, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, <b>neratinib,</b> nilotinib, pazopanib, selumetinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, tozasertib, and vandetanib. These findings indicate the significant potential for TKI/AKIs to inhibit multiple ABC efflux transporters. The resulting inhibition data could provide insight regarding the clinical interpretation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic outcomes when TKI/AKIs are administered concomitantly with additional chemotherapeutic agents...|$|E
40|$|Additions of {{cysteine}} thiols to Michael acceptors underpin {{the mechanism}} of action of several covalent drugs (e. g., afatinib, osimertinib, ibrutinib, <b>neratinib,</b> and CC- 292). Reversible Michael acceptors {{have been reported in}} which an additional electron-withdrawing group was added at the α-carbon of a Michael acceptor. We have performed density functional theory calculations to determine why thiol additions to these Michael acceptors are reversible. The α-EWG group stabilizes the anionic transition state and intermediate of the Michael addition, but less intuitively, it destabilizes the neutral adduct. This makes the reverse reaction (elimination) both faster and more thermodynamically favorable. For thiol addition to be reversible, the Michael acceptor must also contain a suitable substituent on the β-carbon, such as an aryl or branched alkyl group. Computations explain how these structural elements contribute to reversibility and the ability to tune the binding affinities and the residence times of covalent inhibitors...|$|E

Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer remains the commonest form of metastatic incurable disease. Although estrogenic signalling in breast cancer is one of the most critical oncogenic pathways known, there are no specific therapies designed to overcome endocrine resistance. This is in contrast to the situation in less common types of breast cancer including triple negative disease (PARP inhibitors) and HER 2 positive relapsed tumours (T-DM 1 and <b>neratinib,</b> amongst others). As kinases are some of the most common drug targets [1], we sought to identify previously uncharacterized molecules that regulate the estrogen receptor-α (ERα) [2, 3].
