He occurs as a witness to royal charters.|$|E

40|$|CALL {{materials}} {{may provide}} a mechanism for implementing theoretically-ideal conditions for second language acquisition and for conducting empirical research to investigate effects of these conditions. This paper explores methodological issues involved in realizing this potential by focusing on investigation of the <b>noticing</b> hypothesis (Schmidt, 1990) in CALL reading materials. It reviews the problem of assessing <b>noticing</b> in classroom and experimental settings through a) conditions for <b>noticing,</b> b) retrospective assessment, and c) concurrent assessment. Concurrent assessment, which provides the most direct measure of <b>noticing,</b> is illustrated through CALL materials that gather data on <b>noticing,</b> test retention of word meaning, and calculate the correlation between <b>noticed</b> and remembered words. Methodological issues of implementation and validation are discussed...|$|R
