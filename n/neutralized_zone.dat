5|$|The team {{rode with}} heavy hearts at the Tour of California in May. It {{was their first}} event back in {{competition}} after their mass withdrawal from the Giro d'Italia {{the day after the}} death of team member Wouter Weylandt. The race paid tribute to Weylandt by holding a moment of silence before its first stage and allowing the Leopard Trek team to lead the peloton into the <b>neutralized</b> <b>zone,</b> as well as all organization, staff, and riders wearing black armbands. The team did not attain any victories in the race, with Gerdemann in 11th place their best finisher. Neo-pro Nizzolo took the team's lone win in the month of May, triumphing in the field sprint finish to Bayern-Rundfahrt's final stage.|$|E
50|$|With {{a battery}} {{connected}} this way, {{the holes in}} the p-type region and the electrons in the n-type region are pushed toward the junction and start to <b>neutralize</b> the depletion <b>zone,</b> reducing its width. The positive potential applied to the p-type material repels the holes, while the negative potential applied to the n-type material repels the electrons. The change in potential between the p side and the n side decreases or switches sign. With increasing forward-bias voltage, the depletion zone eventually becomes thin enough that the zone's electric field cannot counteract charge carrier motion across the p-n junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical resistance. The electrons that cross the p-n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type material) will diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current that may flow through the diode.|$|R
40|$|Complement {{is part of}} {{the innate}} immune system {{and one of the first}} lines of host defense against infections. Its {{importance}} was evaluated in this study in virus infections in mice deficient either in soluble complement factors (C 3 �/ �, C 4 �/ �) or in the complement signaling complex (complement receptor [CR] 2 �/ �, CD 19 �/ �). The induction of the initial T cell–independent neutralizing immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody response to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), poliomyelitis virus, and recombinant vaccinia virus depended on efficient antigen trapping by CR 3 and- 4 –expressing macrophages of the splenic marginal <b>zone.</b> <b>Neutralizing</b> IgM and IgG antibody responses were largely independent of CR 2 -mediated stimulation of B cells when mice were infected with live virus. In contrast, immunizations with nonreplicating antigens revealed an important role of B cell stimulation via CR 2 in the switch to IgG. The complement cascade was activated after infection with VSV via the classical pathway, and active complement cleavage products augmented the effector function of neutralizing IgM and IgG antibodies to VSV by a factor of 10 – 100. Absence of the early neutralizing antibody responses, together with the reduced efficiency of neutralizing IgM in C 3 �/ � mice, led to a drastically enhanced susceptibility to disease after infection with VSV...|$|R
