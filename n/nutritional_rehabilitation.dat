40|$|AbstractPalliative care is an {{approach}} {{aimed at improving}} {{the quality of life of}} patients (and their families) faced with a life-threatening condition. Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a progressive disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Despite (or perhaps, because of) all the advances in medicine, CHF remains one of the leading causes of death. Even with the availability of numerous prognostic tools, an estimate of the course and outcome of a CHF patient continues to pose a challenge. As a result, palliative care should be initiated early and provided in parallel with curative treatment. The cornerstone of palliative care is communication based, mainly, on listening to the patient, telling the patient their unfavorable diagnosis, and therapeutic dialog. Drug therapy is provided in an effort to alleviate the symptoms. Non-pharmacological options of {{improving the quality of}} life of the patient include <b>nutritional</b> care, <b>rehabilitation</b> and, possibly, treatment of sleep apnea. Deactivation of the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator should also be considered as an option. Last but not least, the attending physician should focus on the psychological and spiritual needs of the patient.

40|$|Although {{advances}} {{in intensive care}} have enabled more patients to survive an acute critical illness, they also have created a large and growing population of chronically critically ill patients with prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation and other intensive care therapies. Chronic critical illness is a devastating condition: mortality exceeds that for most malignancies, and functional dependence persists for most survivors. Costs of treating the chronically critically ill in the United States already exceed $ 20 billion and are increasing. In this article, we describe the constellation of clinical features that characterize chronic critical illness. We discuss the outcomes of this condition including ventilator liberation, mortality, and physical and cognitive function, noting that comparisons among cohorts are complicated by variation in defining criteria and care settings. We also address burdens for families of the chronically critically ill and the difficulties they face in decision-making about continuation of intensive therapies.

40|$|Purpose: There is {{paucity of}} {{research}} investigating oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD) {{in young children}} with cerebral palsy (CP), and most studies explore OPD in high-resource countries. This study aimed at determining the proportion and severity of OPD in preschool children with CP in Bangladesh, compared to Australia. Method: Cross-sectional, comparison of two cohorts. Two hundred and eleven children with CP aged 18 – 36 months, 81 in Bangladesh (mean = 27. 6 months, 61. 7 % males), and 130 in Australia (mean = 27. 4 months, 62. 3 % males). The Dysphagia Disorders Survey (DDS) –Part 2 was the primary OPD outcome for proportion and severity of OPD. Gross motor skills were classified using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), motor type/distribution. Results: (i) Bangladesh sample: proportion OPD = 68. 1 %; severity = 10. 4 SD = 7. 9. Australia sample: proportion OPD = 55. 7 %; severity = 7. 0 SD = 7. 5. (ii) There were no differences in the proportion or severity of OPD between samples when stratified for GMFCS (OR = 2. 4, p = 0. 051 and β = 1. 2, p = 0. 08, respectively). Conclusions: Despite overall differences in patterns of OPD between Bangladesh and Australia, proportion and severity of OPD (when adjusted for the functional gross motor severity of the samples) were equivalent. This provides support for the robust association between functional motor severity and OPD proportion/severity in children with CP, regardless of the resource context. Implications for Rehabilitation The proportion and severity of OPD according to gross motor function level were equivalent between high- and low-resource countries (LCs). Literature from high-resource countries may be usefully interpreted by rehabilitation professionals for low-resource contexts using the GMFCS as a framework. The GMFCS is a useful classification in LCs to improve earlier detection of children at risk of OPD and streamline management pathways for optimal <b>nutritional</b> outcomes. <b>Rehabilitation</b> professionals working in LCs {{are likely to have}} a caseload weighted towards GMFCS III–V, with less compensatory OPD management options available (such as non-oral nutrition through tubes) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Surgeons often perform {{surgery for}} {{patients}} who are critically ill. Intensive care unit (ICU) -acquired weakness (ICUAW) is {{a condition in which}} systemic and prolonged muscle weakness occurs and causes worse short-term and long-term outcomes. Presentation of case: A 60 -year-old woman with sudden nausea and vomiting presented to our hospital and developed shock. Abdominal CT showed thickness of the descending colon and ascites. She was diagnosed with sepsis due to descending colon cancer. Colectomy of the descending colon was performed due to necrosis, and a stoma was created. After surgery, she received intensive care in the ICU. It was difficult to wean her from the ventilator, and she developed severe flaccid weakness of the limbs. Her Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score was 0. Since other organic disorders causing prolonged paralysis were excluded, she was finally diagnosed as having ICUAW. Active <b>rehabilitation,</b> <b>nutritional</b> support, and glycemic control were continued. Now, 6 months after surgery, her MRC score has improved to 30.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Swallowing {{dysfunction}} (also {{known as}} dysphagia), {{which results in}} a deterioration of <b>nutritional</b> intake, slows <b>rehabilitation</b> and causes aspiration pneumonia, is very common following neurological impairments. Although videofluorographic (VF) examination is widely used for detecting aspiration, an objective and non-invasive method for assessing swallowing function {{has yet to be}} established {{because of a lack of}} adequate devices and protocols. In this paper, a bend sensor whose resistance is altered by bending was introduced to monitor swallowing-related laryngeal movement. METHODS: Six healthy male volunteers were recruited in the present study. Specific time points on the signal waveform produced by the bend sensor were defined to describe laryngeal movement by differential analysis. Additionally, the physiological significance of the obtained waveform was confirmed by analyzing the sequential correlations between the signal waveform from the bend sensor and hyoid bone kinetics simultaneously recorded by VF. RESULTS: Seven time points were successfully defined on the signal waveform to reference laryngeal movement. Each time point was well correlated with certain VF events, with evidence of no significant time lags, and there were positive correlations between waveform time points and matched VF events. Furthermore, obvious similarities were noticed between the duration of each phase on the signal waveform and the duration of the matched hyoid bone activity. CONCLUSIONS: The present monitoring system using a bend sensor might be useful for observing the temporal aspects of laryngeal movement during swallowing, and it was well coordinated with hyoid bone movement...|$|R
40|$|Critically injured {{patients}} {{are characterized by}} hypermetabolism and accelerated catabolism, leading to rapid malnutrition. The prevalence of malnutrition among hospitalized patients {{is as high as}} 50 % [1, 2]. Inadequate nutrition is associated with an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and longer hospital stays [3]. Most trauma {{patients are}} well nourished before injury. These patients are candidates for nutritional support because of the hypercatabolic state associated with multiple trauma. Adjuvant nutritional therapy has developed an expanding role in clinical intensive care, as the medical community begins to understand the immune system, sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction, and wound healing. With {{a better understanding of the}} endogenous responses to injury, more can be learned about the mediators of these responses. These mediators can be manipulated through improved insight into nutritional support, its timing, complications, and its role in the full recuperation of patients from the acute phase to <b>rehabilitation.</b> <b>Nutritional</b> assessment Assessment is used to identify patients who would benefit from nutritional support and suggests a design for that therapy. No patient is more difficult to feed than one with multiple injuries. As catecholamines, cytokines, and insulin levels rise in response to these traumatic insults, energy expenditure and protein turnover increase. Because of the heterogeneity of this patient population, it is difficult to develop guidelines applicable to all critically injured patients. There is a great need for clinical judgment.

40|$|Abstract AIMS AND BACKGROUND: In Italy {{more than}} 55 % of cancer {{patients}} live {{for more than}} 5 years after diagnosis, sometimes with several cancer-related sequelae. For this reason rehabilitation must offer not only physical interventions but also psychological, clinical, social and nutritional support. The CAREMORE pilot {{study was designed to}} assess whether cancer registries could serve to collect information on rehabilitation services, to describe and quantify the services provided by the National Health Service, and to examine the allocation of rehabilitation services to cancer patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This was a pilot population-based cohort study. A sample of 1200 patients was identified from the databases of the Varese, Genoa, Reggio Emilia, Sassari and Ragusa cancer registries, all diagnosed in 2002 and followed for 5 years. For 4 cancer sites a list of rehabilitation items to be collected was drafted by a joint community of researchers and voluntary associations, with variables regarding rehabilitation data and follow-up. Data were analyzed by groups of patients, vital status, sex, and age. RESULTS: This pilot study suggested it is useful to collect information on several rehabilitation services: disability benefits, home care, aids and other support; {{it was not possible to}} collect reliable information on <b>nutritional</b> and psychological <b>rehabilitation.</b> In all, 36 % of the sample applied for disability benefits, but with important differences between cancer sites. Eleven percent of the sample obtained home care, with no substantial differences between cancer sites, and 16 % received at least one aid, with percentages varying from 27 % for rectal cancer to 8 % for lymphoma patients. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study indicated that cancer registries could collect information on rehabilitation services. In the future it would be interesting to expand the roles of these registries to factors that influence quality of life, taking into account the possibility of collecting more information by actually interviewing patients...|$|R

40|$|Eating {{disorders}} (ED) usually develop during adolescence, {{and intervention}} to stop further weight loss {{is believed to}} improve outcome and long-term prognosis. Adolescents with ED who do not receive effective treatment risk poor outcome and even untimely death as adults. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate long-term mortality and causes of death {{in a series of}} female adults with chronic ED. The second aim was to study the one-year outcome of an unselected series of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (AN) and “other restrictive eating disorders” who had been treated within a specialist ED out-patient service focused on <b>nutritional</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> based on family therapy and without planned hospitalization. The third aim was to investigate the possible metabolic and hormonal side effects of olanzapine when used as an adjunct to facilitate <b>nutritional</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> The fourth aim was to investigate the relationship between polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status and depression. In adult women with chronic ED, a very low body mass index and psychiatric co-morbidity confer a substantially increased risk of premature death. A treatment programme for adolescent ED with rapid access to assessment and prompt start of treatment with initial emphasis on <b>nutritional</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> proved efficient. The outcome was encouraging, as 43 % of all patients with ED and 19 % of those with AN did not have an ED at one-year follow-up. Of the remaining patients the vast majority had gained weight and regained menstruation, and were back in school on a full-time basis. Olanzapine was used to reduce anxiety, excessive exercise and rumination over weight and shape. Side effects were similar to those observed in normal-weight individuals, and do not preclude its use in underweight adolescents with ED. Low ω 3 PUFA were associated with depression. The ω 3 PUFA status improved during <b>nutritional</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> with ordinary foods and without supplementation. The investigations indicate that adolescent ED can be successfully treated in an out-/day-patient setting. An essential feature of the service is rapid handling and weight gain. Further weight loss can be avoided, and chronic disease hopefully prevented. ...|$|E
40|$|There were {{estimated}} to be over 20 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) {{at the end of}} 1999, a number that surpasses global estimates of refugees. Displacement exposes IDPs to new hazards and accrued vulnerability. These dynamics result in greater risk for the development of illness and death. Often, access of IDPs to health care and humanitarian assistance is excluded deliberately by conflicting parties. Furthermore, the arrival of IDPs into another community or region strains local health systems, and the host population ends up sharing the sufferings of the internally displaced. Health outcomes are dismaying. From a health perspective, the best option is to avoid human displacement. WHO contributes to the prevention of displacement by working for sustainable development. Placing health high on the political agenda helps maintain stability, and thereby, reduce the likelihood for displacement. Primary responsibility for assisting IDPs, irrespective of the cause, rests with the national government. However, where the government is unwilling or unable to provide the necessary aid, the international humanitarian community must step in, with WHO playing {{a major role in the}} health sector. There is consensus among the partners of the World Health Organization (WHO) that, in emergencies, the WHO must: 1) take the lead in rapid health assessment, epidemiological and nutritional surveillance, epidemic preparedness, essential drugs management, control of communicable diseases, and physical and psychosocial rehabilitation; and 2) provide guidelines and advice on <b>nutritional</b> requirements and <b>rehabilitation,</b> immunisation, medical relief items, and reproductive health. If the vital health needs of IDPs—security, food, water, shelter, sanitation and household items—are not satisfied, the provision of health services alone cannot save lives. Community participation is essential, and community participation implies bolstering the assets and capacities of the beneficiarie...|$|R
40|$|Mr. B is a 56 -year-old {{man who has}} {{hypertension}} and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was well until {{the day of his}} admission to hospital. He presents with an occipital headache, tingling in the right hand, ataxia of the right limb, a hoarse voice, dyspha-gia, nausea, vomiting and vertigo. On examination he appears to be a well-nourished, physically fit but fatigued man. His blood pressure is elevated (190 / 110 mm Hg), and although no focal weakness is noted during the physical examination he is falling to the right. He has decreased pain and temperature sensation {{on the left side of}} his body, ptosis of the right eyelid and a diminished gag reflex. A CT scan demonstrates the pres-ence of an infarct of the right lateral medulla oblongata. A chest radiograph shows the presence of pneumonia in both lungs; antibiotic therapy is initiated. What is dysphagia and how is it diagnosed and managed? What is the relation between nutrition and stroke? People who have had a stroke are nutritionally andmedically vulnerable because dysphagia and otherneurologic deficits can contribute to aspiration and decreased dietary intake, and potentially malnutrition. Mal-nourished states can lead to adverse outcomes (e. g., in-creased complication rates, a poorer functional outcome, a prolonged hospital stay and decreased quality of life), 1 and dysphagia is a frequent cause of aspiration pneumonia. In this article, we review practical strategies for the diagnosis and management of dysphagia by primary care physicians and others caring for stroke patients. Nutritional status and related functional outcomes in stroke patients Stroke may affect and be affected by nutrition and diet. An important clinical goal should be the prevention of, or identification and treatment of, dysphagia and inadequate nutritional and feeding states in patients with stroke to help them reach their full potential for <b>rehabilitation.</b> <b>Nutritional</b> status should be monitored by means of rou-tine nutritional screenings or comprehensive assessments every week or 2 weeks. Further information about nutri-tional assessment is given in the online Appendix 1 (se...|$|R
40|$|Keisuke Maeda, 1, 2 Takayuki Koga, 3 Junji Akagi 4 1 Department of Nutrition and Dysphagia Rehabilitation, Tamana Regional Health Medical Center, Kumamoto, 2 Palliative Care Center, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, 3 Department of Swallowing and Nutritional Therapy, 4 Department of Surgery, Tamana Regional Health Medical Center, Tamana, Tamana City, Kumamoto, Japan Background: Neuromuscular {{electrical}} stimulation with muscle contraction, administered {{through the skin}} of the neck, improves a patient’s swallowing ability. However, the beneficial effects of transcutaneous electrical sensory stimulation (TESS), without muscle contraction, are controversial. We investigated the effect of TESS, using interferential current, in patients undergoing dysphagia rehabilitation. Methods: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 43 patients who were prescribed in-hospital dysphagia rehabilitation for ≥ 3 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to the sensory stimulation (SS) or sham groups; all received usual rehabilitative care plus 2  weeks of SS or sham intervention. Outcome measures included cough latency times against a 1 % citric acid mist, functional oral intake scale (FOIS) scores, and oral nutritional intake – each determined after the second and third week following treatment initiation. Results: Mean patient age was 84. 3 ± 7. 5 years; 58 % were women. The SS and sham groups had similar baseline characteristics. Changes in cough latency time at 2 weeks (- 14. 1 ± 14. 0 vs - 5. 2 ± 14. 2 s, p= 0. 047) and oral nutrition intake at 3 weeks (437 ± 575 vs 138 ± 315 kcal/day, p= 0. 042) improved more in the SS group than in the sham group. Changes in cough frequency and FOIS scores indicated better outcomes in the SS group, based on substantial effect sizes. Conclusion: TESS, using interferential current through the neck, improved airway defense and nutrition in patients suffering from dysphagia. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the technique’s effect on swallowing ability.
