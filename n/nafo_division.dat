A number of biological parameters were compared between the sample areas.

Sampling at St. Lewis was repeated in 1986 and 1987, sampling at Makkovik was repeated in 1986, three offshore sites parallel to these areas were sampled in February of 1986, and a sample was taken from the more northerly location of Nain (<b>NAFO</b> <b>division</b> 2 H) in September of 1987.

Three year projections indicate that fishing at the low Fbar level currently estimated for 2008 should allow SSB to increase to higher levels than estimated for the late 1980 ´s, although in terms of abundance the stock will remain at lower levels.

The catch table (to September 2008) and biomass estimates (EU survey summer 1988 - 2008) are updated within this report. Preliminary data indicate that 20533 t and 16869 t of shrimp were taken in 2006 and 2007 respectively against an annual TAC of 48000 t. In the 2008 EU survey the 3 M biomass index was 10931 t, the lowest value of the last 10 years and confirm the decreasing trend initiated in 2002...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} feeding {{characteristics of}} immature and mature capelin (Mallotus villosus) on the Grand Bank (<b>NAFO</b> <b>Divisions</b> 3 LNO) during 1987 – 90 in April and May are presented. Copepods, mainly Calanus finmarchicus, {{were the main}} food for immature capelin. Areas of intensive feeding on copepods were the northern and northeastern slopes of the Grand Bank. In addition to copepods, the euphausiid Thysanoessa raschii was a very im-portant prey of mature capelin. Poor feeding on euphausiids by prespawning capelin was partly compensated for by increased predation on juvenile capelin and sandeel. The inten-sive feeding of capelin on euphausiids and juveniles was observed for several years {{on the border of}} NAFO Div. 3 L and 3 O, namely to the south of the Avalon Peninsula. Although {{little is known about the}} biology of T. raschii on the Newfoundland Grand Bank, its occurrence in the diet of capelin and cod (from a previous study) suggests that in some years it is widely distributed and important in the food chain...|$|R
