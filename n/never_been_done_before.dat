At that time, she developed original method of cheetah identification based on visual analysis of the unique spot patterns on front limbs (from toes to shoulder) and hind limbs (from toes to the hip), and spots and rings on the tail (Cat News #41, 2004 http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/01_information/1_3_periodical-reports/cat-news/cat-news.htm).

This work has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> and the team is sharing results with the Mara stakeholders and respondents.

500|$|Punk rock {{lyrics are}} {{typically}} frank and confrontational; {{compared to the}} lyrics of other popular music genres, they frequently comment on social and political issues. Trend-setting songs such as the Clash's [...] "Career Opportunities" [...] and Chelsea's [...] "Right to Work" [...] deal with unemployment and the grim realities of urban life. Especially in early British punk, a central goal was to outrage and shock the mainstream. The Sex Pistols' [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] and [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] openly disparaged the British political system and social mores. Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in [...] "Love Comes in Spurts", written by Richard Hell and recorded by him with the Voidoids. Anomie, variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's [...] "Blank Generation" [...] and the bluntness of the Ramones' [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", is a common theme. Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by V. Vale, founder of San Francisco fanzine Search and Destroy: [...] "Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it that had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> by any generation in such a thorough way".
