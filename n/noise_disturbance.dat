25|$|The Cadburys were {{particularly}} {{concerned with the}} health and fitness of their workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming, walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports. In the early 1920s, extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to football and hockey pitches together with a grassed running track. Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built {{in accordance with the}} instructions of George Cadbury and opened in July 1924. At that time, it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido's healthy waters. The Rowheath Pavilion itself, which still exists, was used for balls and dinners and the whole area was specifically {{for the benefit of the}} Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families. The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of <b>noise</b> <b>disturbance</b> were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate, coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities. Cadbury's also built the Bournville indoor swimming baths on Bournville Lane (separate buildings for 'girls' and men), the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site, that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|At these parties, BDSM can be {{publicly}} performed on a stage, or more privately in separate [...] "dungeons". A {{reason for the}} relatively fast spread {{of this kind of}} event is the opportunity to use a wide range of [...] "playing equipment", which in most apartments or houses is unavailable. Slings, St. Andrew's crosses (or similar restraining constructs), spanking benches, and punishing supports or cages are often made available. The problem of <b>noise</b> <b>disturbance</b> is also lessened at these events, while in the home setting many BDSM activities can be limited by this factor. In addition, such parties offer both exhibitionists and voyeurs a forum to indulge their inclinations without social criticism. Sexual intercourse is not permitted within most public BDSM play spaces or not often seen in others, because it is not the emphasis of this kind of play. In order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants certain standards of behavior have evolved; these include aspects of courtesy, privacy, respect and safewords. Today BDSM parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the Western world.|$|E

For example, H 1 tools are used when dealing with bounded energy (or power) gain uncertainty (see [12], [10], [18]), while when working with l 1 disturbances, the uncertainty is assumed to be of finite amplitude gain (see [9]).

40|$|Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} relation for measurement <b>noise</b> and <b>disturbance</b> {{states that}} any position measurement with noise epsilon brings the momentum disturbance {{not less than}} hbar/ 2 epsilon. This relation holds only for restricted class of measuring apparatuses. Here, Heisenberg's uncertainty relation is generalized to a relation that holds for all the possible quantum measurements, from which conditions are obtained for measuring apparatuses to satisfy Heisenberg's relation. In particular, every apparatus with the <b>noise</b> and the <b>disturbance</b> statistically independent from the measured object is proven to satisfy Heisenberg's relation. For this purpose, all the possible quantum measurements are characterized by naturally acceptable axioms. Then, a mathematical notion of the distance between probability operator valued measures and observables is introduced and the basic properties are explored. Based on this notion, the measurement <b>noise</b> and <b>disturbance</b> are naturally defined for any quantum measurements in a model independent formulation. Under this formulation, various uncertainty relations are also derived for apparatuses with independent <b>noise,</b> independent <b>disturbance,</b> unbiased <b>noise,</b> and unbiased <b>disturbance</b> as well as noiseless apparatuses and nondisturbing apparatuses. Two models of position measurements are discussed to show that Heisenberg's relation can be violated even by approximately repeatable position measurements. Comment: 35 pages, revte...|$|R
