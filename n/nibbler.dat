25|$|In {{addition}} to the main cast, Frank Welker voiced <b>Nibbler</b> and Kath Soucie voiced Cubert and several supporting and minor characters. Like The Simpsons, many episodes of Futurama feature guest voices {{from a wide range}} of professions, including actors, entertainers, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest-stars voiced supporting characters, although many voiced themselves, usually as their own head preserved in a jar. Recurring guest stars included Dawnn Lewis (as Hermes' wife LaBarbara), Tom Kenny, Dan Castellaneta (as the Robot Devil), Al Gore, and George Takei, among others.|$|E

As per her final wishes, the human Leela {{is taken to}} a planet to be eaten by a cyclops-devouring monster called the Cyclophage. At the service, Bender's obnoxious partying wakes Leela, who is horrified by the existence of Robot Leela. The Cyclophage approaches, and the crew escapes in the ship. The Cyclophage accidentally attaches itself to {{the underside of the}} ship as it takes off.|$|E

500|$|While {{the plot}} of the episode stands on its own, it also sets up much of the {{continuing}} plot of the series by including Easter eggs for events that do not occur until much later: as Fry falls into the freezer, the scene shows a strange shadow cast on the wall behind him. It is revealed in [...] "The Why of Fry" [...] that the shadow belongs to <b>Nibbler,</b> who intentionally pushes Fry into the freezer as part of a complex plan to save Earth from the Brainspawn in the future. Executive producer David X. Cohen claims that from the very beginning the creators had plans to show a larger conspiracy behind Fry's journey to the future. In the movie , it is revealed that the spacecraft seen destroying the city while Fry is frozen are piloted by Bender and those chasing him after he steals the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
500|$|In {{the ending}} of Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, the game hints at a sequel titled Snakes in Space, but the game would never be released. However, Rare {{developed}} a follow-up on the Game Boy titled Sneaky Snakes; the game was published by Tradewest in June1991. The game features two Snakes named Genghis and Atilla who must save Sonia Snake from the Nasty <b>Nibbler.</b> The game features identical gameplay to Snake Rattle 'n' Roll but in a 2D side-scrolling platforming mode instead of the 3D isometric mode. Sneaky Snakes received mediocre ratings from Electronic Gaming Monthly in its July1991 issue. Reviewer Steve Harris criticized the game for its awkward controls, lack of originality, and a [...] "zero-grav effect" [...] while jumping. Ed Semrad said that the game got old after the first several levels, and Martin Alessi said that while it is an original idea, likewise repeated the previous reviewers criticism of the game's repetitiveness. Reviewer [...] "Sushi-X" [...] called the game [...] "average" [...] and said, “It lacks {{the rest of the}} positive traits that truly rates an exceptional game.” ...|$|E
500|$|Gosling {{played an}} {{introvert}} who {{falls in love}} with a sex doll in the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl. He drew inspiration from James Stewart's performance in Harvey. Roger Ebert felt [...] "a film about a life-sized love doll" [...] had been turned into [...] "a life-affirming statement of hope" [...] because of [...] "a performance by Ryan Gosling that says things that cannot be said". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described his performance as [...] "a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes." [...] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt [...] "the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career." [...] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget. Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller Fracture. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on. Gosling noted that he was drawn to his character, Willie, because he had flaws and seemed like a real person. He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role. Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that [...] "watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood is worth the price of admission". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt it was a treat to watch [...] "the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen <b>nibbler</b> Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma." [...] The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.|$|E

Knowing the consequences, <b>Nibbles</b> attempts to stop Jerry from doing so, but Jerry just pats him on the head again, then blows his noisemaker and the firecracker inside it explodes, giving him a blackface appearance.

5000|$|A <b>nibble</b> (sometimes nybble), is {{a number}} {{composed}} of four bits. [...] Being a half-byte, the <b>nibble</b> was named as a play on words.

He is revealed in [...] "The Why of Fry" [...] to have been directly responsible for Fry's cryogenic freezing.

The {{first series}} of the Toynami figures is separated into 3 waves: wave one, released in September 2007, featured Fry and Zoidberg; wave two, released in January 2008, consisted of Leela and Zapp (who comes with Richard Nixon's head-in-a-jar); the third wave, released in June 2008, includes Bender and Kif. Each figure comes with a build-a-figure piece to assemble the Robot Devil. The second series of Toynami figures includes Captain Yesterday (A Fry variant from [...] "Less Than Hero") and Nudar in the first wave. The second wave includes Super-King (Bender from [...] "Less Than Hero") and Calculon, and the third wave includes Clobberella (Leela from [...] "Less Than Hero") and Amy Wong.

50|$|Transmission of a byte is {{accomplished}} by dividing it into two <b>nibbles</b> of four bits each. Each <b>nibble</b> is transmitted by setting the four data lines according to the four <b>nibble</b> bits and then toggling the acknowledge line. This toggle indicates the receiving host that the <b>nibble</b> {{is ready to be}} read. Once the receiving host has read the <b>nibble,</b> it toggles its synchronization line to tell the transmitter that the <b>nibble</b> has been read and that a new one may be sent. Both hosts use a toggle on their acknowledge lines to indicate that the read or write operation has been performed. As a result, each host has to wait for a toggle from the other host before proceeding with a new operation.|$|R
