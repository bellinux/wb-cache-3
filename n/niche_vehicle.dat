40|$|This brief paper {{considers}} the New Product Development (NPD) strategies and practices recently {{employed by the}} Ford Motor Company {{as a base for}} a substantial, near-term improvement in automotive vehicle development performance. The recognition of current industry "best practices" in lean design and manufacturing coupled with consumer desires for <b>niche</b> <b>vehicles</b> provides an opportunity to significantly reduce the time-to-market for new vehicle designs. This paper proposes that a Special Vehicle Operations plant be established as an ongoing facility to develop and manufacture technology demonstration vehicles for corporate research use and public sale. Such a facility, a manufacturing "proving ground" akin to vehicle test facilities, would support the more rapid introduction of advanced vehicle technologies by routinizing design experiments in a quasi-mass production setting. The expected result would be a steadier and more continuous introduction of advanced processes into mainstream products. The scheduling, technical, financial, and quality risks inherent to such introductions would be lessened as well. The research foundation of this paper is an International Motor Vehicle Program-sponsored report supervised by Professor Michael Cusumano of MIT on the NPD practices under implementation by the Ford Motor Company.

Firstly, it highlights the role of 2 ̆ 018 open innovation 2 ̆ 019 approaches in driving the sector, for example noting that smaller firms can sometimes innovate more quickly/more cheaply than the major auto firms; the increased interaction across technologies, up and down supply chains and between larger and smaller firms. In so doing, it also notes the role of hybrid firms providing services, plus prototyping/low volume manufacturing (largely in <b>niche</b> <b>vehicles)</b> and the transferability of these competences across industrial sectors. Secondly, it points to the role of historic (and relatively immobile) investments in the region, for example the past/ongoing importance of established mass producers, the depth of skills and experience in suppliers and in the local workforce; and cross-overs with the overlapping motorsport cluster. Finally, it stresses the role of public-private sector cooperation, such as: the establishment of the Automotive Council UK and its work in developing technology roadmaps, informing regulation, and supporting development of the UK supply chain (a type of industrial policy as a discovery process and in line with 2 ̆ 018 smart specialisation 2 ̆ 019 principles); the R&D funding programmes developed with industry input; and the earlier role of the Regional Development Agency.

40|$|Club motorsport, a low cost, amateur form of motorsport, forms a {{significant}} part of the motorsport industry in the United Kingdom. If efforts are not made to move towards more environmentally friendly technologies, then this form of motorsport is at risk of becoming irrelevant. One approach taken by other motorsport sectors has been to implement hybrid electric vehicle technology, which can result in improved vehicle performance on the race track. However, the companies that operate in the club motorsport sector do not typically have the resources and experience necessary to develop these technologies. An innovative process was used to guide the design of a new hybrid electric vehicle drivetrain for use in club motorsport. This process made use of the ability for vehicle manufacturers to set the vehicle specifications in club motorsport. A conjoint analysis of customer requirements was carried out, a first for the industry, and led to the development of a market simulation tool. A vehicle simulation tool was then developed to assist in the evaluation of the hybrid electric drivetrain design options. The result of following this process was a new and innovative hybrid electric drivetrain installed in a Westfield Sportscars Sport Turbo, reducing 0 - 60 mph acceleration time from 5. 4 seconds to 3. 8 seconds. An innovative type of system control was implemented, by where the driver is given a finite amount of boost energy for use throughout the race. The drivetrain can also be easily transferred to other vehicle platforms, as the first shelf engineered hybrid drivetrain for motorsport, allowing its use by multiple manufacturers across the club motorsport and <b>niche</b> <b>vehicle</b> sectors. This project has shown that it is possible to implement environmentally friendly technologies, such as hybrid electric vehicle technology, into club motorsport and be able to meet customer, technical and cost requirements. The process that has been developed enables innovation in hybrid electric race car design. This has been shown in the development of a hybrid electric vehicle suitable for use, and sale, in the club motorsport industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is the conceptual design of a battery management system for the first prototype of the UWC (University of the Western Cape) Modular Battery System. The battery system is a lithium-ion battery that aims {{to be used in}} renewable energy systems and for <b>niche</b> electric <b>vehicles</b> such as golf carts. The concept that is introduced in this thesis comprises the parameter monitoring, the safety management and has its main focus on an accurate state of charge estimation. Another battery system that was already implemented is used as base for the parameter monitoring and the safety management for the new battery management system. In contrast to that, the concept for the state of charge estimation must be developed completely. Different methods for the state of charge estimation which are based on the measured voltage, current and temperature are discussed, evaluated and the chosen method is conceived in this thesis. The method used for the state of charge estimation is different for the time when the battery is active than when it is inactive. During charge and discharge Coulomb counting is used and when the cell is inactive voltage versus state of charge lookup tables are used to update the estimation. To have an accurate estimation when the cell is inactive only for a short time, a model of the voltage relaxation is used to predict the voltage when the cells are in equilibrium. This allows the algorithm to reset the state of charge that is estimated by Coulomb counting – which tends to have a growing error over time – frequently. To evaluate the accuracy of the voltage prediction, cell tests were executed where the voltage relaxation was sampled. The recursive least square method to predict the end voltage was tested with a MATLAB programme. With the help of voltage versus state of charge lookup tables it was possible to determine the state of charge accuracy with the accuracy of the voltage prediction...|$|R
40|$|The ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) is {{an active}} safety system that is {{designed}} for emergency braking situations. In an emergency braking scenario, the ABS instructs the disk-pad braking force to achieve the maximum available tyre-road braking force without locking the wheels. The maximum available tyre-road braking force helps to achieve the optimal braking distance, while the rotating wheels allow the vehicle to retain directional control capability, which allows the driver to avoid dangerous obstacles during an emergency braking scenario. This research has delivered a new and novel approach to ABS design, which could be developed at a low cost {{in a way which}} will benefit specialist and <b>niche</b> <b>vehicle</b> manufacturers alike. The proposed ABS control method combines the control logic from both theory-based ABS and commercialised ABS. Therefore, it is more practical compared to the theory-based ABS and less complex compared to a commercialised ABS. The control method only has two control phases with simple decrease, hold, and increase control actions. The proposed ABS control method uses representable tyre-road braking force data from an in-wheel-hub force measurement sensor as well as wheel angular acceleration data from a wheel angular speed sensor as control references. It uses the detected peak tyre-road braking force and its relative predefined drop percentage as control activation and control phase alternation triggers. It uses wheel angular acceleration to identify the control phase and implement the correct control actions. Zero wheel angular acceleration is used to trigger the hold control action in the first control phase, while wheel angular acceleration is used as an aid to increase the accuracy of the in-wheel-hub force sensor. An ADAMS full vehicle model based on a Subaru Impreza and a Simulink ABS control logic model have been used to establish a co-simulation environment to test the performance of the proposed ABS control method using high, low friction and split-mu road surfaces. The co-simulation results demonstrate that the proposed novel ABS control method satisfies the ABS control target, and its control results are similar to commercialised ABS...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Sustainable {{development}} is the buzz word {{of the twenty-first century}} and it is the prerogative of the modern organization to ensure that it keeps up with sustainable development initiatives in order to keep its products marketable. As such a need has arisen to assist OPSI Systems, an IT company that specializes in software development, in selecting appropriate algorithms, implementation architectures and business processes to implement in order to achieve improved sustainability in the development, deployment and usage of its software products. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is the management tool of choice for this. Opsi Systems is an IT company that develops <b>niche</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing and scheduling software for the transport logistics industry. Opsi Systems' software products are typically used by distribution planners and managers to find the most efficient combinations of vehicles to use to transport goods, assignment of goods to vehicles, routes to take and stops to make along routes, in order to optimise the value-chain in the supply of products to customers. As a software development and support company, there are various documented methodologies {{that can be used to}} enhance Opsi Systems' own value-chain in delivering its software products to its clients. The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach is used in the development of OPSI Systems' products and a lifecycle approach to product {{development is}} important in catering for sustainability in the software design process[3]. The main objective of OPSI systems software products is optimally realistic solution of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is quite key for logistics and supply chain management companies to be able to conduct their business with minimal impact to the environment. The use of fewer vehicles and a reduction in the total distance travelled by those vehicles means lower fuel consumption and lower cost of business. IT integration also leaves less of a paper trail and thus electronic processing of orders is possible at a much reduced cost to the company and the environment than traditional paper based sign-off. The savings introduced by e cient solution of the VRP has a direct positive impact on sustainable development. As such research on the VRP is also an important component of this study...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} process planning instabilities and inefficiencies within a plastic component manufacturing company. The company was increasingly pressurised by high customer expectations and competition from the global market. A series of tools were used to highlight some of the prominent issues within the organisation. To improve on production efficiencies several lean manufacturing tools such as Value Stream Maps, Production Flow Analysis and Systems Thinking were applied. This thesis proposes a methodology for processing product lines within a supplier in the off-highway and <b>niche</b> <b>vehicle</b> industry and focuses upon categorising product lines depending upon their ranking of volume and value. The methodology {{presents a}} logical procedure for categorising parts into five "broad categories" analogous to the classical ABC stock control theory. On completion of the categorisation process, product lines are processed {{by a set of}} practical rules within the context of an "expert system". These rules have been devised by using multi-criteria ABC analysis and further applied to process the product lines throughout the manufacturing system. These rules are based on product line activity and they are defined in order to maintain minimum inventory levels as well as ensure the stable implementation of the factory production plan (smoothed over the production period), to also achieve a low throughput time and increase delivery performance, all with the goal of 100 % on-time delivery to the customer. The analysis of sales data and high volume-to-value product lines has shown that there are five classes of product lines (A 1, A 2, A 3, B 1 and B 2) which vary in their requirements for planning and operations as outlined in this paper. Evidence is presented which shows that an empirical relationship results a new "merit" parameter that can be determined by fitting a response surface to volume and value quantities and this relationship holds {{for a wide range of}} organisations. Indeed the technique can indicate which product lines are behaving in the market as expected and which are asynchronous with the market demand. The methodology was further simulated using Arena (R) software. The simulation study compared the models (before and after methodology implementation) and the results were analysed to assess the impact of the methodology on the production system...|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in December 1956, {{three months}} after the {{traditional}} September model year start-up, the Ranchero was based on the standard and new-for-1957 full-sized Ford platform, specifically the short-wheelbase Custom sedan, two-door Ranch Wagon station wagon, and utilitarian Courier sedan delivery. Essentially a Courier with an open, reinforced bed, its own unique rear window and integrated cab and cargo box, the Ranchero was initially offered in two trim levels, and throughout the model run, was built on the corresponding automobile assembly line, but sold as a truck through Ford's truck division. An extremely basic standard model was marketed to traditional pickup truck buyers such as farmers, and the Custom picked up most of the options and accessories available on the Fairlane line, including stainless steel bodyside mouldings and two-tone paint. Upscale models were badged both as a Fairlane and Ranchero, with a stylized representation of a Longhorn as the symbol for the model located on the tailgate. Indeed, print advertising of the time played on the theme of the American Southwest that the Spanish model name and Longhorn symbol were meant to evoke, showing artistic representations of the vehicle being used in ranching and outdoor activities, proclaiming it as [...] "More Than A Car! More Than A Truck!" [...] The Ranchero was a hit with both the automotive press and the buying public, filling an untapped market <b>niche</b> for <b>vehicles</b> with the utility of a light pickup and the ease of operation and riding characteristics of a car.

Comparisons to electric and other alternatives drive systems are discussed. Significant technological gains in electric control and motor efficiency in recent times has brought the electric vehicle in its many forms to a position where it can compete on nearly all vehicle performance levels with a conventional ICE-powered vehicle. The electric <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>niche</b> has shifted from a novelty or performance constrained vehicle to one which can fill the role of a general-purpose vehicle for most applications. Unfortunately, the most significant barrier to widespread use of electric vehicles is yet to be overcome. In spite of extensive research into electrical energy storage devices, none of sufficient capacity and appropriate physical properties is yet available at viable cost to allow fully electric vehicles to attain the endurance to make them attractive as the sole vehicle for most consumers’ needs. Internal combustion engines possess significant and enduring benefits for vehicles. In spite of physically limited available efficiency improvements, internal combustion engines still represent a very viable option for vehicle power plants into the future. In a full analysis, ICE vehicles can compete with electric vehicles, especially if the IC fuel can be generated in a way where the energy transfer compares, in a life cycle analysis, with the energy transfer of electrical storage devices required for electric vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the {{innovation}} process frequently distinguish between incremental and radical innovation, suggesting that product, service or process innovation can be categorised {{only in terms of}} these two polarised, relatively artificial classifications. In reality, the complexity of the designed world suggests that the majority of innovations embody elements of both and additionally engage with forms of non-innovation where existing designs are still strategically relevant. This more realistic, flexible view of innovation can be further explored by considering the varied nature of innovation impact, radical or otherwise, for although radical innovation can take many forms, in design terms radicalism can be characterised either by direct, external societal impact or by more covert shifts in the way that underlying internal systems operate. So for example, a radical ‘overt’ change in transport design might have profound implications {{for a wide range of}} users/non-users, providers, designers and decision makers in industry and government. A radical ‘covert’ transport innovation, such as a major shift in fuel technology may, or may not, result in a significant direct impact amongst similar interest groups. It can be argued that the more fundamental the change in the technology which underpins a well established infrastructure, the more important it is to minimise disruption. In reality, the gap between ‘overt’ and ‘covert’ innovation is rarely easily defined. Radical shifts in internal system design can have significant external impact, be it cost or performance. Conversely, a paradigm shift in a physical form of transport often demands fundamental change in the design of underlying support systems. The paradigm is a useful tool for investigating the role of design in relation to a mixed model of both radical and incremental innovation. The model is primarily focussed on the definition and application of design-led continuous innovation (DCI) as a means of providing long term support for core R&D linked to staged design outputs. The subtle synergies between overt/covert innovation and incremental/radical innovation in relation to a specific case study – the Microcab, hydrogen fuelled road vehicle being manufactured by Coventry University Enterprises as a collaborative project is explored in relation to the DCI model. This evolutionary project has been running for fifteen years as a long term commitment to ‘life without oil’; Microcab, has involved a complex framework of engineering, design, entrepreneurial and research activities. In particular it has been supported by a combination of public and private sector funding through a business model which uniquely integrates University and SME activities, a model particularly suitable for radical innovations which lie outside mainstream industrial activities. The case study traces the evolution of this complex framework, indentifies its strengths in relation to the interplay between covert and overt design and examines the particular challenges in achieving an appropriate balance between the two. Microcab is used as a model to compare and contrast with the corresponding innovation processes in mainstream commercial industry and concludes that radical and complex innovation is more effectively conducted in SME. In contrast, it is suggested that continuous incremental innovation, refinement of existing products and processes, is more effectively conducted in the mainstream, because the more substantial systems, resources and knowledge available. It is argued that ultimately for a radical innovation to be widely adopted, a form of integrated collaboration between the mainstream and the innovation developer is necessary for mass market rather than niche adoption. Microcab is undergoing its fifth iteration in the process of general adoption. The next stage of the Microcab, project as it moves from <b>niche</b> prototype <b>vehicle</b> to become a fully resolved as part of a major pan-European collaborative project to drive an experimental ‘Hydrogen Super-highway’ through Europe. The implications of this in terms of the CDI agenda are discussed and new research opportunities identified. Finally the long term relationship between incremental and radical innovation is re-examined and a new paradigm established transferable application to other innovative sustainable design/engineering/technology sectors...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} effect of market differences between advanced and emerging economies on the diffusion of alternative vehicle platforms (AVPs). A system dynamics simulation model was built and used to explore this transition case. This model considers two generic regions resembling advanced and emerging economies, and three generic vehicle platforms: incumbent platform (gasoline vehicles), hybrid platform (hybrid-gasoline vehicles) and radical platform (electrical vehicles). In addition, the model considers the interaction of several feedback mechanisms (Social Learning, R&D, Learning by Doing, Network Externalities and Scale Economies); as well as technical factors of the vehicle platforms, consumers’ preferences and car manufacturers’ behaviour. The analysis of several simulation experiments shows that market differences between advanced and emerging economies can influence diffusion patterns of AVPs in three main ways: First, {{the difference between the}} income level of consumers of advanced and emerging economies creates a systematic delay in the diffusion of AVPs in emerging economies. As a result, hybrid-gasoline vehicles diffuse earlier in advanced economies than in emerging economies. The diffusion of hybrid-gasoline vehicles in the advanced economies enhances its diffusion in the emerging region due to a global reduction in their purchasing prices and due to their technical improvement. Second, the difference in speed of growth of each region’s vehicle market has the potential of creating a strong market <b>niche</b> for electrical <b>vehicles</b> in the emerging region. In advanced economies, electrical vehicles find strong barriers. On the one hand, consumers driving gasoline or hybrid-gasoline vehicles are more reluctant to adopt the unknown developing electrical vehicles. On the other hand, the growth of the vehicle market is expected to hardly grow. Thus, in advanced economies most vehicle sales are replacement sales. In the emerging region, the opposite occurs, the vehicle market grows steadily and high number of vehicle sales are from consumers {{that for the first time}} purchase a vehicle. First time vehicle buyers do not favour any particular vehicle, thus there are greater chances that they adopt AVPs if these meet their economic and proficiency criteria. As a result, electrical vehicles find a strong market niche in emerging economies, which can compensate for the stagnation of the vehicle market in advanced economies. However, how this market niche is exploited depends significantly on consumers’ preferences and consumers’ familiarity with AVPs. In this regard, if consumers only consider the vehicle’s purchasing price in their adoption decisions, the transition towards AVPs becomes less likely, especially in emerging economies. On the contrary, if consumers consider in a more balanced way all the attributes of a vehicle (e. g. purchasing price, cost of fuel, fuel efficiency and driving range), the transition towards electrical vehicles becomes more likely in both regions. In this case, emerging economies can inject a strong impulse to the global diffusion of electrical vehicles. Third, differences in consumers’ preferences between both regions can significantly influence diffusion patterns. On the one hand, if consumers in advanced economies are interested in vehicles’ proficiency and consumers in emerging economies are only interested in vehicles’ purchasing price. Then, in advanced economies, hybrid-gasoline vehicles penetrate this market at high levels, but electrical vehicles stagnate. In emerging economies, the hybrid-gasoline vehicles penetrate at modest levels due to the impulse received by its diffusion in advanced economies, but electrical vehicles fail. In this case, conventional gasoline vehicles benefit from the growing vehicle market in emerging economies. On the other hand, if consumers in emerging economies are proficiency oriented and consumers in advanced economies have a purchasing price orientation. Then, advanced economies lag behind in the diffusion of AVPs. In emerging economies, the diffusion of AVPs is also delayed due to the lack of the initial impulse of advanced economies. However, in this case, electrical vehicles find a strong market niche in emerging economies and penetrate this market at high levels. It also has been found that if R&D resources are early allocated to AVPs, both the car manufacturers and the consumers discover earlier the potential of the each vehicle platform. This reduces the initial systematic disadvantages of AVPs against gasoline vehicles, increasing the possibilities of their global diffusion. It has also been found that if the development potential of the three vehicle platforms is comparable, then market differences have a strong influence in the diffusion of AVPs. However, the more unbalanced the development potential of the three vehicle platforms is, the less determinant market differences become. This research shows that the process of diffusion of AVPs can be enriched and strengthened if it is seen as a complementary process between advanced and emerging economies. Policy areas of concern are the support to the R&D of AVPs, the development of fuelling infrastructure for electrical vehicles and the encouragement of consumers to consider in a more balanced way all vehicle’s attributes in their adoption decisions.
