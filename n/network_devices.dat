25|$|With the {{increasing}} speed of modern CPUs, parallel flash devices are often much {{slower than the}} memory bus of the computer they are connected to. Conversely, modern SRAM offers access times below 10ns, while DDR2 SDRAM offers access times below 20ns. Because of this, it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into RAM; that is, the code is copied from flash into RAM before execution, so that the CPU may access it at full speed. Device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device, and then copied into SDRAM or SRAM when the device is powered-up. Using an external serial flash device rather than on-chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise (a process that is good for high-speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa). Once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block {{it is common to}} add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used. Typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives, Ethernet controllers, DSL modems, wireless <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> etc.|$|E
