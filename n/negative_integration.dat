40|$|This article {{investigates the}} reasons why the EU tried to promote {{environmental}} norms in the Doha round. It argues that the EU's support of a ‘greener’ World Trade Organization stems from tensions between the rigidity of the domestic dynamics of positive integration in the EU and the increased bindingness of <b>negative</b> <b>integration</b> commitments undertaken under the WTO. Consensual decision-making procedures in the EU led societal groups to push for stringent food safety and environmental regulations in the EU, and made them very resistant to change. These dynamics of positive integration, however, produced rules that were inconsistent with <b>negative</b> <b>integration</b> commitments undertaken under the WTO, {{at a time when the}} creation of a quasi-judicial dispute settlement mechanism in the trade regime had greatly increased the bindingness of WTO rules. As a result of the twofold effect of domestic and international institutional constraints, EU decision-makers were subject to compelling incentives to try and strengthen legitimate exceptions from WTO rules and immunise European regulation against WTO legal challenges. Empirical evidence on how the EU shaped its trade-and-environment agenda in the run-up to the Doha Round in 2001, as well as how it negotiated in the subsequent period, lends support to the argument...|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{argue that the}} Nordic alcohol policy, based on {{restrictive}} measures and aimed at reducing consumption, is changing. This paper discusses {{the potential impact of}} globalization on Nordic Alcohol policy – exemplified by the liberalising efforts of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Two countries; Norway and Sweden, are in focus. Three types of integration; positive integration, <b>negative</b> <b>integration</b> and “framing” integration, are introduced in order to characterize the influence of the WTO. Relevant WTO agreements and national participation patterns in the WTO organisation are accounted for. A conclusion is that the WTO has indeed influenced and to some extent changed alcohol regulation in many countries. This is mainly a result of efforts to reduce trade barriers. Public health motivated arguments have so far not had any weighty importance in the WTO. The influence of the WTO can mainly be assessed as <b>negative</b> <b>integration</b> through liberalization efforts, and as “framing” integration as influence on norms and cognition of involved actors. The more direct and prescriptive pressure from positive integration is less evident. Established national institutions and traditions can to some extent resist and modify externally initialised reforms. At the same time, the Nordic countries are highly globalised, and the further globalization pressure is powerful. Increasing liberalization efforts from the WTO must be followed with vigilance from actors in the national and Nordic alcohol policy field, if the traditional Nordic Alcohol policy is to remain standing...|$|E

Here, we investigated what neural mechanisms underlie the formation and subsequent retrieval of integrated mental images, and whether those mechanisms differ based on the emotionality of the integration (i. e., whether it contains an emotional item or not). Participants viewed pairs of words while undergoing a functional MRI scan. They were instructed to imagine the two items separately from one another ("non-integrative" study) or as a single, integrated mental image ("integrative" study). They provided ratings of how successful they were at generating vivid images that fit the instructions. They were then given a surprise associative recognition test, also while undergoing an fMRI scan. The cuneus showed parametric correspondence to increasing imagery success selectively during encoding and retrieval of emotional integrations, while the parahippocampal gyri and prefrontal cortices showed parametric correspondence during the encoding and retrieval of non-emotional integrations. Connectivity analysis revealed that selectively during <b>negative</b> <b>integration,</b> left amygdala activity was negatively correlated with frontal and hippocampal activity.

The aim of the present paper is to discuss, on a physical basis, the internal logic of this process of reduction. The analysis is performed on simple biological systems, namely protein and metabolic networks. A multi-sited protein that binds two ligands x and y can be considered the simplest possible biochemical network. The organization of this network can be described through a comparison of three systems, i. e. XY, X and Y. X and Y are component sub-systems that collect states x i and y j, respectively, i. e. protein states that have bound either i molecules of x (whether or not these states have also bound y), or j molecules of y (whether or not these states have bound x). XY is a system {{made up of the}} specific association of X and Y that collects states x iy j. One can define mean self-informations per node of the network, , and . Reduction of the system XY into its components is possible if, and only if, ,is equal to the sum of and . If is smaller than the sum of and , the system is integrated, for it has less self-information than the set of its components X and Y. It can also occur that , be larger than the sum of and . Hence, the system XY displays <b>negative</b> <b>integration</b> and emergence of self-information relative to its components X and Y. Such a system is defined as complex. Positive or <b>negative</b> <b>integration</b> of the system implies it cannot be reduced to its components.
