5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, the team would <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise. Team members {{expressed a desire to}} move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone.|$|E
5|$|Bacon did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crucifixion theme {{until his}} 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} {{is a far}} more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography of the biblical scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E
50|$|Tennessee wouldn't {{go back to}} a {{bowl game}} until 1979, while <b>not</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberty Bowl again until 1986. Maryland would reach four more bowl games in the decade while winning the conference twice. They have <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberty Bowl since this game.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Jayhawks have <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberty Bowl {{since this}} game. In the next 30 years, {{they went to}} bowl games only 5 times.

5|$|Briefly in 1939, a {{professional}} box lacrosse league started up in California, called the Pacific Coast Lacrosse Association. This four team league also folded shortly after opening. Professional box lacrosse did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States again until 1968 when the Coquitlam Adanacs franchise played one Western Lacrosse Association season in Portland, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Gliding did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Olympics {{after the}} war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, {{and the failure to}} agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the IOC, at its Amsterdam session, {{voted to}} strip the South African NOC of recognition. Although Brundage had hoped to keep South Africa within the Olympic movement, he {{believed}} that those who sought its expulsion had made the stronger case. South Africa did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Olympics until the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, {{after the end of}} its apartheid government.|$|E

5|$|In January 1908, {{newspaper}} reports held that Shay would <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Giants and that McGraw {{would meet with}} him to begin arranging a trade that would send him to another team. That year he played for the Stockton Millers of the California League, an independent minor league. Stockton won the 1908 league championship. During the 1909 season, he became a player-manager for the Kansas City Blues of the American Association.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig Borga did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> WWF {{after his}} ankle healed, {{so there was}} no closure to his feud with Tatanka. The feud between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow was also soon forgotten. In the summer of 1994, both wrestlers joined Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. The two {{eventually}} formed a tag team and unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 2008, Murray {{announced}} to the media in an end-of-season press conference that Emery would <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senators for the 2008–09 season.

5|$|On July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to {{announce}} the joint discovery of the new comet. Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared {{on the order of}} 4000 years ago, but any record of this previous encounter had not yet been positively identified from ancient records. It has also been determined that Hale–Bopp will <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner solar system until approximately 4385.|$|E
5|$|On May 15, 2015, it was {{announced}} by Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin, that Malhotra would <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Montreal Canadiens next season. In July 2015, Malhotra officially became a Free Agent and proceeded to go un-signed over the summer. Two months into the 2015–16 season, Malhotra returned within the Columbus Blue Jackets organization by signing a professional try-out contract with American Hockey League affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters on December 3, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location {{in the hands of}} Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression of the slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{was first}} {{reported}} by Cyrus Lundell in 1931. A year later he informed Sylvanus Morley of the site's existence {{and the presence}} of more than 60 stelae. Morley visited the ruins himself on behalf of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1932. In the 1930s surveys mapped the site core and recorded 103 stelae. Investigations stopped in 1938 and archaeologists did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site until 1982 when William J. Folan directed a project on behalf of the Universidad Autónoma de Campeche, working at Calakmul until 1994. Calakmul is now the subject of a large-scale project of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) under the direction of Ramón Carrasco.|$|E

5|$|Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov {{was born}} in Perovo, an eastern {{district}} of Moscow, on 21 July 1937, the son of Anatoly Streltsov, a front-line soldier and intelligence officer, and Sofia Frolovna. Anatoly did <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family following the Second World War, instead choosing to settle alone in Kiev; Sofia therefore raised her son on her own, working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself. As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team, Spartak Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Engen {{received}} her first call {{up to the}} United States women's national team in March 2010 for a training camp that included two matches against Mexico on March 28 and March 31.

5|$|Following further {{speculation}} {{over her}} leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent {{to join her}} in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments that he would <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd {{announced that he would}} challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.|$|E
