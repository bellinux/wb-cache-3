5|$|Butlin {{continued}} to increase {{the capacity of the}} camp until 3 September 1939 when the Second World War was declared. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> campers were sent home and the site was taken over by the Royal Navy for use as a training establishment.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone soon {{moved on}} a northwestward course and {{encountered}} wind shear. Bret weakened into a depression on August 23, {{due to the}} wind shear over the system. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> depression became a tropical wave with no low-level circulation left. The wave was soon absorbed by a trough of low pressure {{during the next few}} days.|$|E

5|$|After his release, Money {{immediately}} {{spoke to}} his official contacts, and the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> matter {{was raised in the}} House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E
5|$|By the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> loyalist {{forces had}} collapsed. Diệm {{and his younger}} brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup plotter Đôn promised them safe passage out of the country. In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E

5|$|In 1275, Magnús Óláfsson's illegitimate son, Guðrøðr, led {{a revolt}} on Mann and {{attempted}} to establish himself as king. According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and early the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> revolt was crushed as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway. Guðrøðr {{may very well have}} been slain in the defeat, although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, states that he, his wife and his followers escaped the carnage to Wales.|$|E
5|$|In October 1840, their {{paternal}} grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons {{to visit}} him {{on the night before}} his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> Cookes allowed ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and his brother Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not know if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed the hanging of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G. Allen noted the indifference the Cookes' had toward the request and the traumatic experience it must have been for the boys.|$|E
5|$|Jalaja {{reveals the}} love story of Malliswari and Nagaraju to Tirumaladevi. She also reveals that Malliswari denied {{any help from}} her and instead chose to die along with Nagaraju. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> hanging nooses are kept ready and the duo meet Krishnadevaraya before killing them. When Nagaraju blames Krishnadevaraya for sending a palanquin to her house for Rani Vasam, Krishnadevaraya defends his action and reminds Nagaraju that {{it was he who}} had asked him to send Malliswari to Rani Vasam. Krishnadevaraya forgives both Nagaraju and Malliswari, and their {{marriage}} is conducted in a grand manner at the palace.|$|E

5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> three boys reflect on how their inability to share led to the destruction of the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the alert was issued, deep {{convection}} disappeared from the low while located 400mi (645km). Convection was anticipated to redeveloped later that night or early the <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> low was moving slowly towards the northwest due to a deep trough located over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge of high pressure located over western Mexico. By the morning of July 3, convection had redeveloped near the low and its forward motion quickly increased to 11mph (18km/h). The low remained disorganized {{for the next two}} days as it steadily moved towards the northwest.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Cape Mendocino {{earthquakes}} (or 1992 Petrolia earthquakes) occurred {{along the}} Lost Coast of Northern California on April 25 and 26. The three largest events were the M7.2 thrust mainshock that struck near the unincorporated community of Petrolia midday on April 25 and two primary strike-slip aftershocks measuring 6.5 and 6.6 that followed early the <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> sequence encompassed both interplate and intraplate activity that {{was associated with}} the Mendocino Triple Junction, a complex system of three major faults (including the Cascadia subduction zone, San Andreas Fault, and Mendocino Fracture Zone) that converge near Cape Mendocino. The total number of aftershocks that followed the events exceeded 2,000.|$|E

5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> three {{companies}} of 4-503 {{were chosen to}} set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Because of intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleaguered battalion. On the afternoon of 21 November both battalions moved out to take the crest. During fierce, close-quarters fighting, some of the paratroopers {{made it into the}} PAVN trench line but were ordered to pull back as darkness fell.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> {{schooner}} Lioness discovered {{one of the}} cutters, {{and after}} saving the occupants of the second boat {{made her way to}} the scene of the disaster. Arriving in the afternoon, she found 40 people still clinging to the rigging. It was reported that of the approximately 643people aboard, only 193 were saved. Captain Edward WC Wright of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment was the most senior army officer to survive; he was awarded a brevet majority for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.|$|E
5|$|Washington then {{continued}} his flight across New Jersey; {{the future of}} the Continental Army was in doubt due to expiring enlistments and the string of losses. On the night of December 25, 1776, he led his army across the Delaware River. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> troops launched a surprise attack on a Hessian outpost in Trenton, New Jersey, capturing nearly 1,000 prisoners. Washington followed up his victory at Trenton with another over British regulars at Princeton on January 3. The British retreated to New York City and its environs, which they held until the peace treaty of 1783.|$|E

5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at Saint-Denis, and they secured passage to Mauritius on the SS Lalpoora, located at Pointe des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, the troops were transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of the troops involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|At 7:30am the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Wellington {{wrote to}} the Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E
