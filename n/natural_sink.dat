60|$|Hope and {{the future}} for me are not in lawns and {{cultivated}} fields, not in towns and cities, but in the impervious and quaking swamps. When, formerly, I have analyzed my partiality for some farm which I had contemplated purchasing, I have frequently found that I was attracted solely by a few square rods of impermeable and unfathomable bog,--a <b>natural</b> <b>sink</b> {{in one corner of}} it. That was the jewel which dazzled me. I derive more of my subsistence from the swamps which surround my native town than from the cultivated gardens in the village. There are no richer parterres to my eyes than the dense beds of dwarf andromeda (Cassandra calyculata) which cover these tender places on the earth's surface. Botany cannot go farther than tell me the names of the shrubs which grow there,--the high-blueberry, panicled andromeda, lamb-kill, azalea, and rhodora,--all standing in the quaking sphagnum. I often think that I should like to have my house front on this mass of dull red bushes, omitting other flower plots and borders, transplanted spruce and trim box, even gravelled walks,--to have this fertile spot under my windows, not a few imported barrow-fulls of soil only to cover the sand which was thrown out in digging the cellar. Why not put my house, my parlor, behind this plot, instead of behind that meagre assemblage of curiosities, that poor apology for a Nature and Art, which I call my front-yard? It is an effort to clear up and make a decent appearance when the carpenter and mason have departed, though done as much for the passer-by as the dweller within. The most tasteful front-yard fence was never an agreeable object of study to me; the most elaborate ornaments, acorn-tops, or what not, soon wearied and disgusted me. Bring your sills up to {{the very edge of the}} swamp, then, (though it may not be the best place for a dry cellar,) so that there be no access on that side to citizens. Front-yards are not made to walk in, but, at most, through, and you could go in the back way.|$|E

During most years the outlet sits about 12 ft higher than the lake surface. During rare flooding events the lake does overflow into Grapevine Creek, which flows through a canyon into the San Joaquin Valley.|$|E

40|$|Enhanced {{weathering}} (EW) aims {{to amplify}} a <b>natural</b> <b>sink</b> for CO 2 by incorporating powdered silicate rock with high reactive surface area into agricultural soils.

EW could counteract phosphorus limitation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in tropical soils, and soil acidification, a common agricultural problem studied with numerical process models over several decades. Here, we review the processes leading to soil acidification in croplands and how the soil weathering CO 2 sink is represented in models. Mathematical models capturing the dominant processes and human interventions governing cropland soil chemistry and GHG emissions neglect weathering, while most weathering models neglect agricultural processes. We discuss current approaches to modelling EW and highlight several classes of model having the potential to simulate EW in croplands.

Given a domain of type names D, it is common to interpret it with a functor F from the domain D into the category DCPO, where F assigns to each type name the corresponding dcpo of semantic values. A subtyping relation type 1 <type 2 in D is interpreted as a continuous function from F(type 1) into F(type 2). It is reasonable to require that if we have a (directed) set of type names Q st. type Q is the lub of Q in D, then the dcpo corresponding to type Q should be the colimit of all the dcpos corresponding to type names in Q.

50|$|Carbon rift is {{a result}} of CO2 gas being {{released}} into the environment by human sources, with the theory focusing specifically on capitalistic ones. In 2014, fossil fuel consumption resulted in nearly 36 billion metric tons of CO2 finding its way into <b>natural</b> <b>sinks</b> such as the atmosphere, land, and oceans.

30|$|CDR (or {{negative}} emissions technology, NET) {{refers to a}} class of techniques that reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentration either by increasing <b>natural</b> carbon <b>sinks</b> or directly removing CO 2 via industrial engineering. The proposed schemes include bioenergy with {{carbon capture and storage}} (BECCS), direct air capture through chemical engineering, storing biochar in soils, and the acceleration of chemical weathering, which in nature absorbs CO 2 on a geologic time scale. Because the definition of mitigation covers the enhancement of <b>natural</b> <b>sinks</b> (e.g., afforestation and reforestation), there is some overlap between geoengineering and conventional mitigation. In fact, the simulation of RCP 2.6 by an IAM, IMAGE, assumes widespread use of BECCS. Therefore, CDR may not necessarily represent an additional CO 2 reduction opportunity. Theoretically, one can achieve removal of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases, though literature on this is scarce.|$|R

Drag, the only <b>natural</b> <b>sink</b> mechanism, is computed through a piecewise exponential model of the atmospheric density, assuming that all objects have circular orbits. The model also includes a feedback controller on ADR where the number of removals is proportional to orbital population. The proposed control mimics the human-driven corrective actions arising from the review and adaptation of debris mitigation policies. The model is validated and then preliminary results are reported. They highlight that a synergy of PMD and ADR can reduce the number of removals needed for the current population to be maintained over a 200 -year timeframe...|$|E

Therefore, the hydrogeological and contamination processes proved to be quite different from the ones assumed initially. It was necessary to reconsider the place remediation plans and to implement the new knowledge in HM. The case shows that incomplete initial data of the place hydrogeology and contamination concentrations may lead to false interpretation of problems to be modelled. The hydrogeological model of the Bernau place area has been corrected. Although the corrected model rightly performs main events of the TCE migration, the model is still rather far from perfection, because some principal unknown impacts may not be accounted for...|$|E

40|$|Biotrophic plant {{pathogenic}} fungi differentiate specialized infection structures {{within the}} living cells of their host plants. These haustoria {{have been linked}} to nutrient uptake ever since their discovery. We have {{for the first time to}} our knowledge shown that the flow of sugars from the host Vicia faba to the rust fungus Uromyces fabae seems to occur largely through the haustorial complex. One of the most abundantly expressed genes in rust haustoria, the expression of which is negligible in other fungal structures, codes for a hexose transporter. Functional expression of the gene termed HXT 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes assigned a substrate specificity for d-glucose and d-fructose and indicated a proton symport mechanism. Abs against HXT 1 p exclusively labeled haustoria in immunofluorescence microscopy and the haustorial plasma membrane in electron microscopy. These results suggest that the fungus concentrates this transporter in haustoria to take advantage of a specialized compartment of the haustorial complex.

However, the role of trees, especially conifers, in ecosystem N 2 O and CH 4 exchange is only poorly understood.

The shoot fluxes of N 2 O and CH 4 exceeded the stem flux rates by 16 and 41 times, respectively. Moreover, higher stem N 2 O and CH 4 fluxes were observed from wet than from dry areas of the forest. The N 2 O release from boreal pine forests may thus be underestimated and the uptake of CH 4 may be overestimated when ecosystem flux calculations are based solely on forest floor measurements. The contribution of pine trees to the N 2 O and CH 4 exchange of the boreal pine forest seems to increase considerably under high soil water content, thus highlighting the urgent need to include tree-emissions in greenhouse gas emission inventories...|$|E
