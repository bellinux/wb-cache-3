5|$|The section {{immediately}} {{south of}} Highway401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> merging from Highways401 and404 into the parkway and the lane changing {{that results from}} merging traffic from Highway401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway404, but {{only two of the}} five lanes lead to it.|$|E

The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around. Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from Frontage Road.|$|E

Participants (n= 118) were probed 5 times during a simulated driving route, wherein they self-classified their own thought types as on task, off task, mind wanderings and meta-unaware mind wanderings. Performance decrements (i. e., seconds <b>of</b> speeding and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> deviations) were objectively measured in the 14 seconds preceding the probe. When participants were most frequently mind wandering without meta-awareness, the highest mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> deviations and the second highest mean seconds of speeding were recorded. When participants were most frequently on task, the lowest mean seconds of speeding and second lowest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> mean <b>lane</b> deviations resulted.

5|$|The {{opening of}} the {{southern}} regions of Perth to easier central business district access {{changed the nature of}} the metropolitan area, prompting dramatic population growth south of the river. This led to increased traffic on the bridge, causing regular traffic jams in peak hour. Over the years, governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge, including introducing congestion pricing similar to that used in Singapore, charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods. The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and by the 1990s, the bridge had become the city's worst traffic bottleneck, despite the addition of an extra traffic lane, bringing the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> to seven.|$|E
5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E
40|$|Since lane changes {{influence}} traffic operations, it {{is useful}} to know their frequency for various conditions. This paper studies the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes as function of the roadway characteristics. Two sites are studied, for which individual lane change data is available. The paper shows that the most constant measure is the lane change rate, i. e. the nr <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes per veh km driven, which is approximately 0. 5. It shows its maximum for densities just under the critical density. Furthermore, the lane change rate increases with an increase of the density in the origin lane for a constant density in the target <b>lane.</b> Surprisingly, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes also increases with an increase of the density in the target lane for a constant density in the origin lane.

40|$|Lane {{changes are}} an {{important}} aspect of freeway flow. Most lane change models are microscopic, describing whether individual vehicles/drives will change lanes, and hence are calibrated microscopically. Macroscopic validation often is restricted to the distribution <b>of</b> vehicles across <b>lanes.</b> To the best of our knowledge, no systematic analysis has been made <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes as function of the operational characteristics of the origin and target lane. This paper fills that gap, by analyzing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes as function of several incentives. Based on data availability, two “simple” sites are selected, i. e. {{as close as possible to}} a straight continuous freeway. Statistically, we find that on the selected sites, drivers change lanes on average once per two kilometer driven. Furthermore, analyzing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes (per kilometer per hour) as function of the density in the origin lane and in the target lane, we find, as expected, this increases with the density in the origin lane for a fixed density in the target lane. Surprisingly, it also increases with the density in the target lane for a fixed density in the origin lane. The underlying mechanism is therefore different than gap acceptance theory. The analyses presented in this paper can be used to qualitatively verify (microscopic and macroscopic) lane change models, and to propose better lane change models.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes, the speed <b>of</b> the ramp <b>lane,</b> and the location upstream of the ramp split. Analyses indicate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes exhibits a parabolic relationship with respect to the ramp lane speed, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes exhibits gamma-distributed relationship with respect to the distance upstream of the ramp. The macroscopic lane changing model presented is best characterized as the development of generalized lane-changing relationships, and provides a starting point from which more complex corridor-level models can be developed. This study also identifies an unusual car-following behavior exhibited by certain lane-changing drivers. When the target lane is moving slowly, some lane-changing drivers will slow down, causing a disruption in their initial lane. Regression analysis is used to estimate the speed upstream <b>of</b> the initial <b>lane</b> to indicate the disruption is responsible for the lateral propagation <b>of</b> congestion. The <b>lane</b> choice <b>of</b> exiting vehicles is also studied. Lane choice appears to be a function of origin/destination, and freeway speed. As speeds in the general purpose lanes decrease, exiting vehicles are more likely to wait longer to move into the exit ramp lanes, resulting in an increased lane changing density. 	Results from this study are expected to have the greatest impact on microscopic lane-change model validation. Additionally, results have implications for design and safety issues associated with freeway ramps. As data collection technologies improve and data becomes increasingly available, this research provides the basis for the further development of more elaborate lane-changing models. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores a novel {{approach}} to trac management that relies on a distributed scheme in which vehicles themselves select lanes. After formulating the problem of distributed trac control, we describe an initial system that uses reinforcement learning to acquire lane selection strategies from experience with a trac simulator. In addition, we report experimental studies of this method which demonstrate that the learned strategies let drivers more closely match their desired speeds than do handcrafted strategies and that it also reduces the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> changes. The experiments also suggest that the learned behaviors generalize to dierent trac densities, dierent <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes,</b> situations involving blocked lanes, and even the presence of selsh drivers. In addition, we report lesion studies that reveal {{the contributions of the}} dierent learning modules. In closing, we discuss related work on trac control and consider some directions for future research...|$|R
25|$|In late 2005, the {{intersection}} with Mannheim Road was reconstructed to remove unsafe conditions {{and bring the}} route closer to Interstate standards. In the late 1990s, the Illinois Department of Transportation restriped I-190 at Interstate 294. This action increased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> west of I-294 from two to three. In the process, the speed limit was reduced from 45 to 35, and yield signs were erected {{at the ends of}} the ramp from northbound Mannheim Road to westbound I-190, the busiest ramp at that intersection. This created a hazardous condition, often leading to high-speed crashes should drivers waiting on the ramp become impatient or underestimate the speed of westbound traffic. Often, an IDOT Minuteman (rapid response vehicle) would be stationed on the ramp waiting to tow away vehicles that would be involved in a crash during rush hour.|$|E

By the 1970s, the Pennsylvania Turnpike started to see a decline in the volume of traffic because of the opening of I-80which provided a shorter route across the north of the state, and the 1973 oil crisiswhich led to a decline in long-distance travel.
