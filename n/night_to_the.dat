The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Bamber's lawyers {{highlighted}} {{two police}} logs {{in support of}} Bamber's application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal. The question was whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police, from Bamber alone; or the defence position {{that there were two}} calls to police, one from Nevill followed by a second from Bamber.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{submitted}} a last request to walk under the stars, play basketball, and watch science-fiction films to prison warden Hank Galetka. Parsons also {{asked for his}} remains to be cremated and turned over to his family. Prison spokesperson Jack Ford said that the requests would be granted, but that Parsons would only be allowed to shoot some hoops in a fenced recreation area instead of a game of basketball in the prison gymnasium. The authorities were concerned that an injury could delay the execution. Parsons was permitted to walk outdoors at <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place of execution.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons {{timeslots}} {{in hopes that}} it would result in higher ratings for the lead out shows. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings.|$|E

5|$|The log {{discusses}} {{a telephone}} call made at 3:26am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station. According to the prosecution, this is the telephone call {{known to have been}} made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E

On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow. The massive North Korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry. The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector.|$|E

He {{was drafted by}} the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2013 NBA draft, but he was traded on draft <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wizards. He formerly played college basketball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets basketball team but was dismissed from the team during his junior season for the 2011–12 Yellow Jackets team and went pro the following season, playing {{a year for the}} Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League (D-League). He led the Vipers to a D-League championship in 2013.

5|$|Shortly after departing Stopford's {{squadron}} off the Basque Roads, Naiad had sighted three sail {{approaching from}} the north at 07:00 on 24 February. These were Italienne, Calypso and Cybèle; a French frigate squadron sent from Lorient by Troude, whose ships of the line had been delayed by unfavourable tides. The lighter frigates had put to sea without the battle squadron and sailed to join Willaumez the previous morning. Their passage had been observed by the British frigate HMS Amelia and the sloop HMS Doterel, which had shadowed the French during the <b>night.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> south, Dundas had signaled Stopford and the admiral left Amethyst and HMS Emerald to observe the French fleet while he took his main squadron {{in pursuit of the}} French frigates. Trapped between the two British forces, French Commodore Pierre-Roch Jurien took his ships inshore under the batteries of Les Sables d'Olonne. Stopford followed the French into the anchorage and in the ensuing battle drove all three French ships ashore where they were damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Through the <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{morning of}} September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked {{to raise the}} $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel nests in burrows {{which are}} visited only at <b>night,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accompaniment of their {{haunting}} calls. The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting {{during the day}} while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults {{have been subject to}} predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, has enabled the population to recover to 6580 breeding pairs; it remains endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks.|$|E
50|$|Abraham (brother of Samuel Catz of Lask) was an ascetic of a {{remarkable}} type; he fasted {{six days of}} the week, from Sabbath <b>night</b> <b>to</b> Sabbath eve, but feasted quite luxuriously on the Sabbath. Often he devoted entire days and <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study of the Torah, standing upright during that time. He took his daily ablutions in the river before offering his prayers in the morning, often breaking through the ice in winter for this purpose. Yet {{in spite of all}} this austerity {{he was a man of}} uncommon vigor.|$|R

Pride of place goes to nineteenth-century Orientalists Richard Burton, Edward W.

These in turn were translated into many languages, thus bringing <b>The</b> Arabian <b>Nights</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre of world literature...|$|R

There are many other verses in the Rig Veda which refer to this tale (e.g. RV 1.118.6; VI 62, 6; VII 69, 7; VIII 5, 22), and where consequently Samudra could be identified with the ocean as well.|$|R

25|$|One {{issue is}} {{speeding}} resulting in safety concerns. From late at <b>night</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early morning, {{in order to}} make more rounds during their shifts to earn more, drivers may risk speeding - especially on red minibuses.

This may be effective in some areas, however for the most part, most passengers do not seem to care, or in some cases even prefer the light buses to speed.|$|E
