40|$|The <b>nano-revolution</b> has {{established}} control of particle {{size and the}} manipulation of molecular structures. Atoms are the chemists’ building block and the ultimate limit of heterogeneous catalyst preparation; achieving atomic control is an on-going challenge {{in the field of}} catalysis which this book addresses. Each chapter presents a different approach to the problem, drawing on the latest developments in the field. With techniques bridging the gap between surface science and heterogeneous catalysis the book presents a tool-kit for anyone wishing to prepare and define solid catalysts. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} and implementation of new te chnologies have led to new era, the <b>nano-revolution</b> which unfolds role of plants in bio and green synthesis of nanoparticl es which seem to have drawn quite an unequivocal at tention with a view of synthesizing stable nanoparticles. Although nanopar ticles can be synthesized through array of conventi onal methods biological route of synthesizing are good competent over the physical and chemical techniques. Green p rinciple route of synthesizing have emerged as alternative to overcom e the limitation of conventional methods among whic h plant and microorganisms are majorly exploited. Employing pla nts towards synthesis of nanoparticles are emerging as advantageous compared to microbes with the presence of broad var iability of bio-molecules in plants can act as capp ing and reducing agents and thus increases the rate of reduction and stabilization of nanoparticles. Biological synthes ized nanoparticles have upsurge applications in various sectors. Hence the present study envisions on biosynthesis of nanopart icles from plants which are emerging as nanofactories...|$|E
40|$|In a European {{context of}} {{knowledge-based}} and information driven society, Spain is evolving {{to a new}} economic model for sustainable growth. Among all the research priorities and market opportunities, {{findings suggest that the}} commercialization of the nanobiotechnologies developed in Spain is a big issue for technology transfer and innovation managers. A subsequent analysis suggests that Spanish universities and science and technology parks are key players in the area of nanobiotechnology transfer and innovation, and thus they have a fundamental role in fostering the innovation and creativity that are emerging from the social and industrial <b>nano-revolution,</b> with special attention being paid to a the nanomedicine sector. The atomically precise manufacturing (APM) is expected to provide a wide array of practical and profitable technologies and products as research and development in nanotechnology proceeds. Indeed, nanotechnology is widely predicted to drive the next “industrial revolution ” [1], one referred to as “the materials age ” and which {{is the result of a}} sequence of preliminary revolutions in electronics, ICT and biotechnology [2]. Scientific papers and patents in the nanotechnology sector have grown exponentially over the last two decades. Products based on nanotechnology are already in use and analysts expect markets to grow b...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology is {{the latest}} {{platform}} technology to capture {{the imagination of the}} agricultural and food industries, with applications being adopted across these entire sectors. With companies such as Kraft Foods and H. J. Heinz investing heavily in nanotechnology research and development, industry commentators have suggested that the global nano-agri-food sector will, by 2010, be worth in excess of US$ 20 billion. While the <b>nano-revolution</b> is well under way, however, the entry of nanotechnologies into paddocks and onto our plates has occurred largely beneath the policy and regulatory radars. As such, agricultural inputs and food items that contain nano-materials are unlabelled, thereby preventing consumers from differentiating between nano-products and their non-nano counterparts. This situation persists, despite a mounting body of scientific evidence pointing to potential health and environmental risks associated with the manufacture of, and exposure to, nano-materials. While proponents of nanotechnology promise a range of benefits across the agri-food sector, this chapter considers the potential impact of the unfettered introduction of agriculture and food-related nanotechnologies on Australian rural communities. To date, this issue has received little recognition in the emerging debates. Our chapter contributes to these critical discussions by highlighting a range of social issues associated with the introduction of nanotechnology for rural Australia {{within the context of the}} development and application of nanotechnologies across the agri-food sector. The chapter also identifies potential human and environmental risks for these communities. We argue that a lack of nano-specific regulations could exacerbate a number of these risks.
