40|$|<b>Nucleoside</b> <b>analogues</b> with 2 '-modified sugar {{moieties}} {{are often}} used to improve the RNA target affinity and nuclease resistance of therapeutic oligonucleotides in preclinical and clinical development. Despite their enhanced nuclease resistance, oligonucleotides could slowly degrade releasing <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogues</b> that {{have the potential to}} become phosphorylated and incorporated into cellular DNA and RNA. For the first time, the phosphorylation and DNA and RNA incorporation of 2 '-O-(2 -methoxyethyl) (2 '-O-MOE) <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogues</b> have been investigated. Using LC/MS/MS, we showed that enzymes in the nucleotide salvage pathway including deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and thymidine kinase (TK 1) displayed poor reactivity toward 2 '-O-MOE <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogues.</b> On the other hand, 2 '-fluoro (F) nucleosides, regardless of the nucleobase, were efficiently phosphorylated to their monophosphate forms by dCK and TK 1.

25|$|The primary {{objective}} of HCV therapy is permanent eradication of the virus. The secondary potential benefit of eradication is {{a reduction in}} the risk of liver failure and liver cancer. Currently, peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin is the only FDA approved treatment for HIV–HCV co-infected patients. Interferons bind to specific cell surface receptors of virus-infected cells, which induces a complex cascade of protein-protein interactions and a rapid activation of gene transcription. The antiviral effects of interferons are mediated through inhibition of viral penetration or uncoating, inhibiting viral replication or translation of viral proteins, and/or viral assembly and release. The difference between peginterferon and interferon is the addition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer. The addition of PEG decreases plasma clearance considerably, protects the molecule from proteolytic degradation and reduces its immunogenicity. Peak concentrations are approximately 1.5-2 fold higher than trough concentrations and the half-life is 80 hours (compared to 5.1 hours for interferon alpha-2a). Ribavirin is a synthetic <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogue,</b> but its mechanism of action is not clearly established. Ribavirin inhibits the replication {{of a wide range of}} RNA and DNA viruses.

2500|$|Lamivudine was {{the first}} {{approved}} oral <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogue.</b> While effective and potent, lamivudine {{has been replaced by}} newer, more potent treatments in the Western world and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment. However, it is still used in areas where newer agents either have not been approved or are too costly. Generally, the course of treatment is a minimum of one year with a minimum of six additional months of [...] "consolidation therapy." [...] Based on viral response, longer therapy may be required, and certain patients require indefinite long-term therapy. Due to a less robust response in Asian patients, consolidation therapy is recommended to be extended to at least a year. All patients should be monitored for viral reactivation, which if identified, requires restarting treatment. Lamivudine is generally safe and well-tolerated. Many patients develop resistance, which is correlated with longer treatment duration. If this occurs, an additional antiviral is added. Lamivudine as a single treatment is contraindicated in patients coinfected with HIV, as resistance develops rapidly, but it can be used as part of a multidrug regimen.|$|E
