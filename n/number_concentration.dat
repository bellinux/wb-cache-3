25|$|There {{are several}} {{measures}} of aerosol concentration. Environmental science and health often uses the mass concentration (M), {{defined as the}} mass of particulate matter per unit volume with units such as μg/m3.

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{nucleation}} processes. Gases preferentially condense onto surfaces of pre-existing aerosol particles, known as heterogeneous nucleation. This process causes the diameter at the mode of particle-size distribution to increase with constant <b>number</b> <b>concentration.</b> With sufficiently high supersaturation and no suitable surfaces, particles may condense {{in the absence of a}} pre-existing surface, known as homogeneous nucleation. This results in the addition of very small, rapidly growing particles to the particle-size distribution.|$|E
40|$|Certain primary {{biological}} {{aerosol particles}} (PBAPs) {{are known to}} have very high ice nucleating ability under mixed-phase cloud conditions. However, since the abundances of ice nucleation active PBAPs in the atmosphere are generally thought to be extremely small, their importance has remained uncertain. Here we present evidence for the role of PBAPs as atmospheric ice nuclei (IN) active at temperatures ranging from about - 34 degrees C to - 9 degrees C in a midlatitude ponderosa pine forest ecosystem in summertime. Our measurements show that the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of IN active at these temperatures were positively correlated with <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of ambient fluorescent biological aerosol particles (FBAPs). Notably, the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of IN active at warmer temperatures increased quite rapidly in response to increases in the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of FBAPs. Moreover, we show that a newly-proposed parameterization related to the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of FBAPs can better reproduce the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of IN active over the entire temperature range examined, as compared with parameterizations related solely to the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of total aerosol particles with diameters larger than 0. 5 mu m as proposed previously. These results suggest that certain PBAPs released from forest biota can indeed {{play a key role in}} determining atmospheric IN populations in this ecosystem, especially at warmer temperatures, potentially leading to ice initiation in nearby mixed-phase clouds...|$|R
40|$|The {{initiation}} {{of ice in}} an isolated orographic wave cloud was compared with expectations based on ice nucleating aerosol concentrations and with predictions from new ice nucleation parameterizations applied in a cloud parcel model. Measurements of ice crystal <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{were found to be}} in good agreement both with measured <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of ice nuclei feeding the clouds and with ice nuclei <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> determined from the residual nuclei of cloud particles collected by a counterflow virtual impactor. Using lognormal distributions fitted to measured aerosol size distributions and measured aerosol chemical compositions, ice nuclei and ice crystal concentrations in the wave cloud were reasonably well predicted in a 1 D parcel model framework. Two different empirical parameterizations were used in the parcel model: a parameterization based on aerosol chemical type and surface area and a parameterization that links ice nuclei <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> to the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of particles with diameters larger than 0. 5 μm. This study shows that aerosol size distribution and composition measurements can be used to constrain ice initiation by primary nucleation in models. The data and model results also suggest the likelihood that the dust particle mode of the aerosol size distribution controls the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the heterogeneous ice nuclei, at least for the lower temperatures examined in this case...|$|R
40|$|Information on what aerosol {{particle}} types {{are the major}} sources of ice nucleating particles (INPs) in the atmosphere is needed for climate predictions. To determine which {{aerosol particle}}s are the major sources of immersion-mode INPs at a coastal site in Western Canada, we investigated correlations between INP <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> and both concentrations of different atmospheric particles and meteorological conditions. We show that INP <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> are strongly correlated with the <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of fluorescent bioparticles between − 15 and − 25 °C, and that the size distribution of INPs is most consistent with the size distribution of fluorescent bioparticles. We conclude that biological particles were likely {{the major source of}} ice nuclei at freezing temperatures between − 15 and − 25 °C at this site for the time period studied. At − 30 °C, INP <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> are also well correlated with <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the total aerosol particles ≥ 0. 5 μm, suggesting that non-biological particles may have an important contribution to the population of INPs active at this temperature. As we found that black carbon particles were unlikely to be a major source of ice nuclei during this study, these non-biological INPs may include mineral dust. Furthermore, correlations involving tracers of marine aerosols and marine biological activity indicate that the majority of INPs measured at the coastal site likely originated from terrestrial rather than marine sources. Finally, six existing empirical parameterizations of ice nucleation were tested to determine if they accurately predict the measured INP <b>number</b> <b>concentrations.</b> We found that none of the parameterizations selected are capable of predicting INP <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> with high accuracy over the entire temperature range investigated...|$|R

25|$|However, the {{concentration}} of LDL particles, {{and to a lesser}} extent their size, has a stronger and consistent correlation with individual clinical outcome than the amount of cholesterol within LDL particles, even if the LDL-C estimation is approximately correct. There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle <b>number</b> (<b>concentration),</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low. If LDL particle concentration is used to predict cardiovascular events, many other correlates of these clinical outcomes, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity and smoking, lose most of their predictive accuracy.|$|E

Low ice <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> ([*]<[*]  200  L − 1) and high supersaturations (150 – 160  %) have been observed in these clouds. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain these low ice <b>number</b> <b>concentrations,</b> including the inhibition of homogeneous freezing by the deposition of water vapour onto pre-existing ice crystals, heterogeneous ice formation on glassy organic aerosol ice nuclei (IN), and limiting the formation of ice number from high-frequency gravity waves. In this study, we examined the effect from three different representations of updraft velocities, the effect from pre-existing ice crystals, the effect from different water vapour deposition coefficients (α  [*]=[*]  0. 1 or  1), and the effect of 0. 1  % of the total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles acting as IN. Model-simulated ice crystal numbers are compared against an aircraft observational dataset. Including the effect from water vapour deposition on pre-existing ice particles can effectively reduce simulated in-cloud ice <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> for all model setups. A larger water vapour deposition coefficient (α  [*]=[*]  1) can also efficiently reduce ice <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> at temperatures below 205  K, but less so at higher temperatures. SOA acting as IN is most effective at reducing ice <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> when the effective updraft velocities are moderate ([*]∼[*]  0. 05 – 0. 2  m s − 1). However, the effects of including SOA as IN and using (α  [*]=[*]  1) are diminished when the effect from pre-existing ice is included. When a grid-resolved large-scale updraft velocity ([*]<[*]  0. 1  m s − 1) is used, the ice nucleation parameterization with homogeneous freezing only or with both homogeneous freezing and heterogeneous nucleation is able to generate low ice <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> in good agreement with observations for temperatures below 205  K as long as the pre-existing ice effect is included.
