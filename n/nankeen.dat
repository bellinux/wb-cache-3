Other observed visitors include the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae), <b>nankeen</b> kestrel (Falco cenchroides cenchroides), banded lapwing (Vanellus tricolor), greater sand plover (Charadrius leschenaultii), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus variegatus), greenshank (Tringa nebularia), sanderling (Calidris alba), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys) and brown songlark (Cincloramphus cruralis).|$|E
5|$|The social {{organisation}} of the blue-faced honeyeater {{has been little}} studied to date. Encountered in pairs, family groups or small flocks, blue-faced honeyeaters sometimes associate with groups of yellow-throated miners (Manorina flavigula). They mob potential threats such as goshawks (Accipiter spp.), rufous owls (Ninox rufa), and Pacific koels (Eudynamys orientalis). There is some evidence of cooperative breeding, with some breeding pairs recorded {{with one or more}} helper birds. Parents will dive at and harass intruders to drive them away from nest sites, including dogs, owls, goannas, and even a <b>nankeen</b> night heron (Nycticorax caledonicus). A study published in 2004 of remnant patches of forest in central Queensland, an area largely cleared for agriculture, showed a reduced avian species diversity in areas frequented by blue-faced honeyeaters or noisy miners. This effect was more marked in smaller patches. The study concluded that conserved patches of woodland containing the two aggressive species should be larger than 20ha (44acres) to preserve diversity.|$|E

Around 80,000 people live in the creek's catchment area. The remnant bushland across its length provides habitat for significant species such as platypus, rakali, koalas, powerful owl, <b>nankeen</b> night heron, white-winged chough and yellow-tailed black cockatoo.|$|E

25|$|Dumaresque and Paz also {{captured}} Montesquieu, {{which occurred}} on 27 March 1813. She {{belonged to the}} Philadelphia banker Stephen Girard and was bringing a valuable cargo of tea, <b>nankeen,</b> silk, copper, and cassia (Chinese cinnamon - Cinnamomum cassia), from Canton. Dumaresque put the entire crew of Montesquiue and their baggage into the ship's pinnace, except for the ship's supercargo, Arthur Grelaud, and the ship's steward. The captain and crew arrived safely in Lewis Town that same day and the captain immediately {{sent a letter to}} Girard. Beresford arrived on the scene in Poictiers. Beresford took Montesqieu into the Delaware River and immediately entered into negotiations with Girard's agents instead of sending the vessel to be condemned at the Vice admiralty court in Halifax. Girard, with the authorization of the American authorities, paid 180,000 Spanish milled dollars ransom for his vessel, an amount that Grelaud had negotiated. Girard applied to the US authorities for permission to pay the ransom, which he received. (Girard's Bank was a principal source of government credit during the War of 1812.) Dumaresque, and his descendents, blamed Beresford for having deprived them of the prize. Paz shared the ransom with Belvidera and Poictiers.|$|E

60|$|The sight brought Caron to {{a sudden}} halt, and he sat his horse observing them and {{wondering}} how it chanced that these men should find themselves {{so far from the}} army. Three of them showed signs of having been recently wounded. One carried his arm in a sling, another limped painfully and by the aid of a stick, whilst the head of the third was swathed in bandages. But most remarkable were they by virtue of their clothes. One fellow--he of the bandaged head--wore a coat of yellow brocaded silk, which, in spite of a rent in the shoulder, and sundry stains of wine and oil, was unmistakably of a comparative newness. Beneath this appeared the <b>nankeens</b> and black leggings of a soldier. Another covered his greasy locks with a three-cornered hat, richly laced in gold. A third flaunted under his ragged blue coat a gold-broidered waistcoat and a Brussels cravat. A valuable ring flashed from the grimy finger of a fourth, who, instead of the military white <b>nankeens,</b> wore a pair of black silk breeches. There was one--he of the injured arm--resplendent in a redingote of crimson velvet, whilst he of the limp supported himself upon a gold-headed cane of ebony, which was in ludicrous discord with the tattered blue coat, the phrygian cap, and the toes that peeped through his broken boots.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century {{the growth of}} {{industry}} meant {{the majority of the}} area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture. The factory system was also introduced; in 1835 1,124people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used power looms. Local hand-produced specialities included striped cotton ticks, checks, <b>Nankeens</b> and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 Ordnance Survey map of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of silk, with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft. Many factory workers were children under 12years of age.|$|R

2500|$|Possibly as {{a result}} of the {{introduction}} of non-indigenous animals, at least three species of birds became extinct: the Bonin <b>nankeen</b> night heron, the Bonin grosbeak (a finch), and the Bonin thrush. The island was the only known home of the thrush and probably the finch, although the heron was found on Nakōdojima (also [...] "Nakoudo-" [...] or, erroneously, [...] "Nakondo-") as well. The existence of the birds was documented by von Kittlitz in 1828, and five stuffed thrushes are in European museums.|$|E
2500|$|There {{had always}} been a general American desire for foreign and {{sometimes}} exotic wares, and, with the British East India Company no longer the dominant force in American trade, the job of satisfying this demand fell to American merchants. Therefore, when the Empress returned home, she brought with her a large stock of outlandish Chinese goods, which her owners sold for a significant profit of $30,000—a 25% gain. Other American merchants did not take long to realize that, while selling American specie, ginseng, and fur to the Chinese mandarins was undoubtedly profitable, selling Chinese goods in America would be considerably more so. Further motivation came from the knowledge that China, as a whole, had a mercantilist-like attitude towards foreign commerce; they tended to resist the importation of foreign goods because of a mixture of Confucian doctrine, which deprecated trade, and the underlying ethnocentrism felt by the Chinese—they did not need to actively search for trade because the inferior white [...] "barbarian" [...] states would instinctively bring it to them as a form of tribute. Because of these factors, American traders began to focus their funds on acquiring Chinese goods—a practice that the Chinese were more willing to adopt—rather than on purchasing those of America. What resulted was the flooding of Chinese teas, cottons, silks, rhubarb, cassia, nankeens (durable, yellow cloth), floor-matting, lacquerware, fans, furniture, and porcelains, into America, to the extent that even those of poor social classes possessed some Chinese items—perhaps a painting of Guangzhou's harbor or a pair of trousers made out of <b>nankeen</b> cloth.|$|E

60|$|Here {{it must be}} mentioned, {{that from}} the various gay cloths and other things {{provided}} for barter by {{the captain of the}} Parki, I had very strikingly improved my costume; making it free, flowing, and eastern. I looked like an Emir. Nor had my Viking neglected to follow my example; though with some few modifications of his own. With his long tangled hair and harpoon, he looked like the sea-god, that boards ships, for the first time crossing the Equator. For tatooed Samoa, he yet sported both kilt and turban, reminding one of a tawny leopard, though his spots were all in one place. Besides this raiment of ours, against emergencies we had provided our boat with divers <b>nankeens</b> and silks.|$|R

5000|$|Fanning & Coles was an American firm {{engaged in}} the Old China Trade and related Maritime fur trade. The two {{principal}} partners were sea captain Edmund Fanning and financier Willet Coles. The firm existed from 1798 to 1815, owning several large mercantile vessels. Sailing from New York City to South America and later the Pacific Ocean, the American vessels would gather and purchase seal skins throughout southern Atlantic and Pacific. These valuable pelts included hides from the South American fur seal. After a successful voyage around Cape Horn and enough animal furs were gathered, the vessels from Fanning & Coles then typically sailed for the Qing Dynasty port of Guangzhou, China. Here valuable Chinese manufactured goods were purchased, which included <b>nankeens</b> and porcelain, in addition to stockpiles of tea commonly valued and sold for $40,000 in profits annually.|$|R

50|$|Ongoing supply issues {{faced by}} the Russian-American Company were seen {{as a means to}} gain more furs. Cargo ships en route from the Columbia were planned to then sail north for Russian America to bring much needed provisions. By {{cooperating}} with Russian colonial authorities to strengthen their material presence in Russian America, it was hoped by Astor to stop the NWC or any other British presence to be established upon the Pacific Coast. A tentative agreement for merchant vessels owned by Astor to ship furs gathered in Russian America into the Qing Empire was signed in 1812. Company ships then were directed to sail to the port of Guangzhou, where furs were then sold for impressive profits. Chinese products like porcelain, <b>nankeens</b> and tea were to be purchased; with the ships then to cross the Indian Ocean and head for European and American markets to sell the Chinese wares.|$|R

[...] This was to be accomplished through a chain of interconnected trading posts that stretching across the Great Lakes, the Missouri River basin, the Rocky Mountains, and ending with a fort at the entrance of the Columbia River. Once the pelts were collected from the extensive outposts they were to be loaded and shipped aboard ships owned by Astor to the Chinese port of Guangzhou, where furs were sold for impressive profits.

5000|$|In the 19th century, {{the city}} walls still {{protected}} a circuit of 7 - 8 mi but embraced much vacant ground. The bay began to attract Jardines' and Dents' opium ships from 1832. Following the First Opium War, Governor Henry Pottinger proposed using Quanzhou as an official opium depot to keep the trade out of Hong Kong and the other treaty ports but the rents sought by the imperial commissioner Qiying were too high. When Chinese pirates overran the receiving ships in Shenhu Bay to capture their stockpiles of silver bullion in 1847, however, the traders moved to Quanzhou Bay regardless. [...] Around 1862, a Protestant mission {{was set up in}} Quanzhou. As late as the middle of the century, large Chinese junks could still access the town easily, trading in tea, sugar, tobacco, porcelain, and <b>nankeens,</b> but sand bars created by the rivers around the town had generally incapacitated its harbor by the First World War. It remained a large and prosperous city, but conducted its maritime trade through Anhai.|$|R
60|$|Some of us, I {{am sorry}} to say, used to call her Mrs. Major Gammon; for if the worthy widow had a propensity, it was to talk largely of herself and family (of her own family, for she held her husband's very cheap), and of the wonders of her {{paternal}} mansion, Molloyville, county of Mayo. She was of the Molloys of that county; and though I {{never heard of the}} family before, I have little doubt, from what Mrs. Major Gam stated, that they were the most ancient and illustrious family of that part of Ireland. I remember there came down to see his aunt a young fellow with huge red whiskers and tight <b>nankeens,</b> a green coat, and an awful breastpin, who, after two days' stay at the Spa, proposed marriage to Miss S----, or, in default, a duel with her father; and who drove a flash curricle with a bay and a grey, and who was presented with much pride by Mrs. Gam as Castlereagh Molloy of Molloyville.

By five o'clock in the morning of the Ninth Thermidor, the galleries of the Convention were filled by a boisterous and excited throng.

Robespierre, who had been escorted from his lodgings by the usual body of admirers, instead of taking his ordinary seat, remained standing {{by the side of the}} tribune. It is a familiar fact that moments of appalling suspense are precisely those in which we are most ready involuntarily to note a trifle; everybody observed that Robespierre wore the coat of violet-blue silk and the white <b>nankeens</b> in which a few weeks previously he had done honour to the Supreme Being.|$|R
