40|$|A {{number of}} central banks publish their own {{business}} conditions survey based on <b>non-random</b> <b>sampling</b> methods. The results of these surveys influence monetary policy decisions and thus affect expectations in financial markets. To date, however, no one has computed the statistical accuracy of these surveys because their respective <b>non-random</b> <b>sampling</b> method renders this assessment non-trivial. This paper describes a methodology for modeling complex <b>non-random</b> <b>sampling</b> behaviour, and computing relevant measures of statistical confidence, based on a given survey's historical sample selection practice. We apply this framework to the Bank of Canada's Business Outlook Survey by describing the sampling method in terms of historical practices and Bayesian probabilities. This allows us to replicate the firm selection process using Monte Carlo simulations on a comprehensive micro-dataset of Canadian firms. We find, under certain assumptions, {{no evidence that the}} Bank's firm selection process results in biased estimates and/or wider confidence intervals.

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{limitations}} of the present study.

While we recognise the downside of <b>non-random</b> <b>sampling,</b> this sampling method was selected from the viewpoint of practicality considering the study duration, resources at hand, and availability of the subjects. Although we cannot effectively comment on the parameters of the entire Swiss population or the industrial manufacturing enterprises of other nations, the results of the survey do provide meaningful insights about enterprises already interested or engaged in IoT. Moreover, {{it can be argued that}} the selection bias in <b>non-random</b> <b>sampling</b> is unlikely to have any effect on the sections pertaining to motivators and inhibitors. For example, enterprises that encounter technological challenges are not more likely to participate in the survey than those who encounter business challenges. Thus, apart from the results related to interest and activity, the results of all other sections of the survey should represent the trends among the industrial manufacturing enterprises who are already interested in IoT.|$|R

For example, interviewers {{might be tempted to}} interview those people in the street who look most helpful, or may choose to use accidental sampling to question those closest to them, for time-keeping sake. The problem is that these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a chance of selection. Whereas in stratified sampling (its probabilistic version), the chance of any unit of the population is the same as 1/n (n= number of units in the population).

Mean reversion in the market is not the same concept as regression to the mean as used by statisticians where retesting a <b>non-random</b> <b>sample</b> of a population tends to produce results that are closer to the mean than the original test. The existence of mean reversion in financial markets is controversial and is a subject of active research. If it exists, then it is almost certainly very slight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Non-random</b> <b>sample</b> {{selection}} is a commonplace amongst many empirical studies {{and it appears}} when an output variable of interest is available only for a restricted non-random sub-sample of data. We introduce {{an extension of the}} generalized additive model which accounts for <b>non-random</b> <b>sample</b> selection by using a selection equation. The proposed approach allows for different distributions of the outcome variable, various dependence structures between the (outcome and selection) equations through the use of copulae, and nonparametric effects on the responses. Parameter estimation is carried out within a penalized likelihood and simultaneous equation framework. We establish asymptotic theory for the proposed penalized spline estimators, which extends the recent theoretical results for penalized splines in generalized additive models, such as those by Kauermann et al. (2009) and Yoshida & Naito (2014). The empirical effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a simulation study...|$|E

40|$|Sample {{selection}} {{models are}} employed when {{an outcome of}} interest is observed for a restricted non-randomly selected sample of the population.

This is achieved using a multiple-stage procedure, and a newly developed simultaneous equation estimation scheme. Both approaches are based on the penalized likelihood estimation framework. The problems of identification and inference are also discussed. The empirical properties of the proposed approaches are studied through a simulation study. The methods are then illustrated using data from the American National Election Study where the aim is to quantify public support for school integration. If <b>non-random</b> <b>sample</b> selection is neglected then the predicted probability of giving, for instance, a supportive response may be biased, an issue that can be tackled using the proposed tools...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Bayesian method for learning causal networks using samples that were selected in a non-random manner from {{a population of}} interest. Examples of data obtained by <b>non-random</b> <b>sampling</b> include convenience samples and case-control data in which a fixed number of samples with and without some condition is collected; such data are not uncommon.
