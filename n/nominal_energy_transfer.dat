We consider both radiative (mediated by real photons) and non-radiative (mediated by virtual photons) mechanisms of <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> using a unified Green's function approach {{that takes into account}} modification of the exciton energy dispersions as a result of interactions. The large optical oscillator strengths associated with excitons in TMDs result in very fast <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> rates. The <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> times depend on the exciton momentum, exciton linewidth, and the interlayer separation and can range from values less than 100 femtoseconds to more than tens of picoseconds.

Both singlet and triplet quenching are attributed to electronic <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> by the collisional, electron-exchange mechanism. Steric hindrance to exothermic triplet <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is significant, with azo-n-butane a better accep-tor than azo-tert-butane by a factor of 3. 6 - 10. 7. Steric hindrance to singlet <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is less pronounced (comparable steric factors are 1. 7 - 2. 9), apparently because diffusion rather than <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is rate limiting in solution. For a given donor-acceptor pair, singlet <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is two to three times faster than triplet <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> The triplet <b>energy</b> level of the azobutanes is estimated to be 53 f 1 kcal/mol.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{amount of}} <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from the hammer to the casing is a {{critical}} consideration for assessing of the constructability of the required length and diameter of pipe with a given hammer. Due to various contractor-selected pipe-hammer connections and natural sources of energy loss (e. g., thermal, frictional, etc.), the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiency of pipe ramming hammers must be less than 100 percent; however, actual hammer- pipe <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiencies, defined as the ratio of actual <b>energy</b> <b>transferred</b> to the rated hammer energy, have not been reported to-date. Overestimates of hammer- pipe <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> could result in corresponding overestimates of driving stresses and penetration rates; likewise, over-estimates of driving stress could lead to excessive and uneconomical wall thickness. This study focuses on the characterization of hammer- pipe <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiencies for commonly used pneumatic and hydraulic hammers observed during production and test pipe ramming installations.
