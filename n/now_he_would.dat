5|$|The {{siege of}} Krujë in 1450 {{resulted}} in heavy loss for both Murad II and the League of Lezhë. A {{large portion of}} the Albanian land was wasted from the long campaign where the Turkish forces had been stationed {{for more than half a}} year. The country was left with few resources to produce crops and a large famine was the result. In 1451, the year after Murad's forces had devastated the country, Mehmed II gained control of the Ottoman Empire after his father's death. Mehmed's great energy was already apparent during the previous years when he had accompanied his father to Albania. Skanderbeg realized that if Mehmed struck <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be in great difficulty since he lacked the resources and the support to successfully hold off a large invasion. One of Albania's most powerful princedoms, the Dukagjini, were making open negotiations with the Turks, suggesting that they would become Mehmed's vassals.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} onwards, the Carpenters changed their stage show to allow Karen {{to have more}} {{presence}} and {{to interact with the}} audience, particularly between instrumental breaks. However, extensive touring and lengthy recording sessions had begun to take their toll on the duo and contributed to their professional and personal difficulties during {{the latter half of the}} decade. Karen dieted obsessively and developed anorexia nervosa, which first manifested itself in 1975 when the duo was forced to cancel concert tours in the Philippines, UK and Japan. Richard has said that he regrets the six- and seven-day work schedules of that period, adding that had he known then what he knows <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have agreed to it, and was persuaded to do so by the belief that the Carpenters would not be financially stable without the touring. Richard's Quaalude addiction began to affect his performance in the late 1970s and led to the end of the duo's live concert appearances in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Brazelton {{admitted}} in a 2003 interview {{that when he}} started the comic and was unsure as to its potential longevity, he fell back on using himself and those close to him to avoid writing backstories for potentially short-lived characters. This shortcut also hamstrings Brazelton's potential for development; he cannot reveal too much back story of the characters {{out of concern for}} their counterparts' privacy, yet he can't make something up because readers will attribute the fiction to the real person. In 2009, Brazelton confessed that if he were to go back with what he knew <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> begin again with all-original characters, despite the artificial familiarity it breeds in his fans. The main characters which have been based on real people are author Tom, his wife Cami, their beagle Truman, and Tom's friend Jared. Brazelton has gone on record saying his young son, Henry, will not be joining the comic strip because of the limitations it would put on he and his wife's characters to be responsible and parental.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, a period free of {{official}} team practices, Young and his receivers spent extra practice time working on their timing and team-work. The fall Orange and White intra-team scrimmage was held on August 21, 2005, as an event open to the public. Running back Ramonce Taylor returned the opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. Young completed five of seven passing attempts for 68yards and one touchdown. Senior Richmond McGee made two 33-yard field goals and emerged as the top candidate to handle field goals, kickoffs and punts. Brown said of McGee, [...] "We've never had one person do all three, so it's a concern, but right <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be the guy." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a college}} prospect, Rivals.com ranked him 30th nationally among dual-threat quarterbacks, Scouts, Inc. ranked him 33rd nationally among wide receivers, and SuperPrep placed him on its Virginia 33. ESPN {{assessed}} {{him as a}} [...] "do-it-all prospect" [...] and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed. Smith was recruited by Maryland, Penn State, and Virginia Tech. He was shown interest by Virginia, but did not receive a scholarship offer. The Virginia staff, which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year, asked Smith to run a 4.5-second 40-yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University, which he did. The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus, but Maryland offered a scholarship, which Smith accepted. He later said, [...] "I kind of hold a grudge against U.Va. a little bit. I'm not afraid to say it. I kind of want {{to show them that}} they questioned my speed and whether I was going to get it back. I want to show them that I'm all healed up." [...] Virginia head coach Al Groh said of the Fredericksburg native before the 2009 game against Maryland, [...] "Clearly if we [...] him being the type of player that he is <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be returning kicks for Virginia. So we are not above admitting that there is a player that certainly {{has turned out to be}} superior to what many people thought, including ourselves. He's—regardless of what the circumstances were in the past—he is a superior college football player." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, {{after four}} decades of service, Lore Rogers, age 67 retired from the United States Department of Agriculture. It had been an amazingly {{productive}} career; paths had been forged, advances made, and 86 papers bearing his name were published in scientific journals and U. S. Department of Agriculture bulletins. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> turn to other interests.|$|E

2500|$|In the maftir (...) {{reading that}} concludes the parashah, Moses asked God why God had dealt so ill {{with the people}} and why God had sent him, for since he came to Pharaoh to speak in God's name, he had dealt ill with the people, and God had not {{delivered}} the people. And God told Moses that <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> see what God would do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand would he let the people go, and by a strong hand would he drive them out of his land. The seventh reading ( [...] , aliyah), a closed portion ( [...] , setumah), and the parashah end here.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 March Reinado {{was quoted}} on Al Jezeera {{as saying that}} [...] "Australian special troops" [...] were [...] away from his hideout {{and that he would}} [...] "fight to the end", criticising the {{government}} and stating that [...] "if any political leader wants to harm the stability of this nation, I have a right to stand up and defend the people." [...] Brigadier Mal Rerden, Commander ISF, subsequently delivered an ultimatum, saying that [...] "any operation to capture Reinado would involve appropriate use of force", urging him to surrender. [...] "He has one option. He can help the people of Timor-Leste by surrendering himself and removing the threat of the weapons... If he cares about the people of Timor-Leste, if he cares about the people with him <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give up his weapons and surrender. Anything that happens from now on is his responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bion {{would speak}} of [...] "an intense catastrophic {{emotional}} explosion O," [...] which {{could only be}} known through its aftereffects. Where before he had privileged the domain of knowledge (K), <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> speak as well of [...] "resistance to the shift from transformations involving K (knowledge) to transformations involving O ... resistance to the unknowable". Hence his injunctions to the analyst to eschew memory and desire, to [...] "bring to bear a diminution of the 'light' — a penetrating beam of darkness; a reciprocal of the searchlight. If any object existed, however faint, it would show up very clearly". In stating this he was making connections to Freud, who {{in a letter to}} Lou Andreas Salome had referred to a mental counterpart of scotopic, [...] "mole like vision", used to gain impressions of the Unconscious. He was also making links with the apophatic method used by contemplative thinkers such as St John of the Cross, a writer quoted many times by Bion. Bion was well aware that our perception and our attention often blind us to what genuinely and strikingly is new in every moment.|$|E
6000|$|Father Eustace again made {{an effort}} to possess himself of the will. He saw the labour of years {{slipping}} from him <b>now,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have stopped at nothing to regain the will. He again pushed forward, exclaiming-- ...|$|R

60|$|In {{this section}} Pope reproves {{those who are}} {{dissatisfied}} with man's faculties. He points out that all animals, man included, have powers suited to {{their position in the}} world (ll. 179-188), and asserts that if man had keener senses than <b>he</b> <b>now</b> has, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be exposed to evils from which <b>he</b> <b>now</b> is free (ll. 193-203).|$|R
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{hear her}} talk to him, {{and he would}} lie sighing by her while she so did. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> bid her pray for him, {{that he might be}} {{delivered}} from Hell. {145a} ...|$|E
6000|$|Doctor Desprez always rose early. Before {{the smoke}} arose, {{before the first}} cart rattled over the bridge to the day's labour in the fields, {{he was to be}} found {{wandering}} in his garden. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> pick a bunch of grapes; <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eat a big pear under the trellice; <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> draw all sorts of fancies on the path with the end of his cane; <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go down and watch the river running endlessly past the timber landing- place at which he moored his boat. There was no time, he used to say, for making theories like the early morning. 'I rise earlier than any one else in the village,' he once boasted. 'It is a fair consequence that I know more and wish to do less with my knowledge.' ...|$|E

25|$|Although from <b>now</b> on <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be mainly {{active as}} an architect, {{he did not}} abandon {{painting}} completely. In 1605 he painted two altarpieces, a Deposition(Brussels, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) and St. Helena with the Holy Cross (Saint James' Church, Antwerp).|$|R
60|$|At last {{he reached}} the {{well-known}} woods near the bridge, and off in a little opening he saw Aunt Judy's cabin. It was so dark <b>now</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have known it was a cabin, {{had he not been}} so familiar with it.|$|R
60|$|Jonas had reluctantly {{given the}} pledge but, from that hour until John had {{declared}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fight no more, Jonas had been moody and silent. <b>Now,</b> however, as <b>he</b> walked behind his friend, {{his face was}} full of satisfaction. There was no chance, <b>now,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to take home the news of his leader's death. Whatever befell them, they would share together.|$|R
60|$|They {{hurried to}} the window. It was a dim grey night; an almost {{unbroken}} sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon, and the hedge and trees {{in front of the}} house were black against the pale roadway. They saw Hapley, looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers, running to and fro in the road, and beating the air. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stop, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> dart very rapidly at something invisible, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> move upon it with stealthy strides. At last he went out of sight up the road towards the down. Then, while they argued who should go down and lock the door, he returned. He was walking very fast, and he came straight into the house, closed the door carefully, and went quietly up to his bedroom. Then everything was silent.|$|E
60|$|As I {{said just}} <b>now,</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> never cause, by any act or word of His, one of God's little ones to stumble and fall away.|$|E
60|$|Clara {{rushed out}} into the garden to tell the stiff old rose-trees that if Lord Ormersfield were savage <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be more horrid than ever.|$|E
60|$|He lit {{the dining-room}} lamp, got out a cigar, and began pacing the room, ejaculating. <b>Now</b> and then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> argue with himself.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, {{the target}} end-date of the campaign, General Powell {{determined}} that America’s Promise should continue its work {{and continue to}} operate as a nonprofit organization.

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{hear her}} talk to him, {{and he would}} lie sighing by her while she so did. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> bid her pray for him, {{that he might be}} {{delivered}} from hell. He would also now consent that some of her good ministers might come to him to comfort him; and he would seem to show them kindness when they came, for he would treat them kindly with words, and hearken diligently to what they said; only he did not care that they should talk much of his ill-spent life, because his conscience was clogged with that already. He cared not now to see his old companions, the thoughts of them were a torment to him; and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> speak kindly to that child of his that took after its mother's steps, though he could not at all abide it before.|$|E
60|$|Brown had to refuse, and {{explained}} that he was keen to get back to his mining claim, which he believed <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to work.|$|E
60|$|The {{fellow was}} {{shouting}} and waving his spear above his head. <b>Now</b> and again <b>he</b> <b>would</b> point to {{something on the}} ground before him.|$|R
60|$|The preacher, in his swift glance, had {{apparently}} not observed the half-hidden Cleve. Certainly it appeared <b>now</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have no attention {{for any other}} than Kells. The bandit was a study. His astonishment was terrific and held him like a chain. Suddenly he lurched.|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like Mrs. Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly.
