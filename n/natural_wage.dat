40|$|The {{notion of}} wealth appears and reappears in Ricardo’s works within three {{different}} sets of arguments. One {{is concerned with the}} distinction between wealth and value, another with the causes of the progress of wealth, the third with the consequences of this progress on the trend of <b>natural</b> <b>wages,</b> profit and rent. Ricardo deals with these subjects sometimes in agreement and sometimes in disagreement with Smith. The agreement reaches a climax on the notion of wealth as such {{as well as on the}} causes of its progress while the disagreement ramifies into the foundations both of that distinction and of the resulting conclusions on the trend of <b>natural</b> <b>wages,</b> profits and rent. This entry will focus on the details of Ricardo’s agreements and disagreements with Smith on the subject of wealth as distinct from the close subject of value. We will prove that, except for some minor differences, Ricardo’s notion of wealth is the same as Smith’s. As such, it is used by Ricardo as synonymous with the notion of the “annual produce of the land and labour”, or of the “necessaries, conveniences and amusements of human life”, available in a country in a period. This coincidence permeates Ricardo’s theory of wealth in so far as this theory is focused on the progress, as distinct from the distribution, of wealth. Thus, starting from a similar theory of wealth but from a very different theory of value, Ricardo develops some of his criticisms of Adam Smith’s theory on the basis of his distinction between value and riches (wealth) as well as of his exclusive notion of rent as a price paid to the owner of land “for the use of its original and indestructible powers”. These criticisms are consistent with Ricardo’s starting point on value as labour embodied and are in contrast with Smith’s different starting point on value as labour commanded.

5000|$|A form of individualist anarchism {{was found}} in the United States, as {{advocated}} by the [...] "Boston anarchists." [...] Some [...] "Boston anarchists", including Benjamin Tucker, identified themselves as [...] "socialists", which in the 19th century was often used {{in the sense of a}} commitment to improving conditions of the working class (i.e. [...] "the labor problem"). By around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed, On the other hand, anarchist historian George Woodcock describes Lysander Spooner's essays as an [...] "eloquent elaboration" [...] of Josiah Warren and the early American development of Proudhon's ideas, and associates his works with that of Stephen Pearl Andrews. Woodcock also reports that both Lysander Spooner and William B.

Tucker influenced and interacted with anarchist contemporaries - including Spooner, Voltairine de Cleyre, Dyer D. Lum, and William B.

5000|$|For American anarchist {{historian}} Eunice Minette Schuster, American individualist anarchism [...] "stresses {{the isolation}} of the individual - his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is [...] "aesthetic" [...] anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the transcendentalism, humanitarianism, and romanticism of {{the first part of the}} nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War." [...] It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account [...] "the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society ... the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs." [...] and so [...] "Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisanal socialism ... while communist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism." [...] Contemporary individualist anarchist Kevin Carson characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that [...] "Unlike the rest of the socialist movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the <b>natural</b> <b>wage</b> of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a classical liberal movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business." [...] In European individualist anarchism a different social context helped the rise of European individualist illegalism and as such [...] "The illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run." [...] And so a European tendency of individualist anarchism advocated violent individual acts of individual reclamation, propaganda by the deed and criticism of organization. Such individualist anarchist tendencies include French illegalism and Italian anti-organizational insurrectionarism. Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th [...] "it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity - and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy.".|$|E

After the reform, these specific incentives to stay on in education have disappeared and the relative cost of education for men has plausibly increased. As a matter of fact, our data reveal that the reform has been followed by a significant {{decrease in the number of}} years spent at school by male students, as well as in the proportion of male degree holders. In contrast, the reform had no significant effect on the demand for education for women nor for men of high socio-economic background.

The natural economic system {{is a sort of}} ideal configuration, which allows to accomplish the potentialities of the production system concerning growth, employment and the satisfaction of final wants. Actual (capitalist) economies do not normally fulfil the “natural” configuration. But this configuration can be considered a reference point in order to discriminate between the conditions that have to be verified for the system to reproduce itself and grow according to its potentialities, and the conditions that have to be regarded as pertaining to the institutional sphere. On this perspective several indications can be drawn on various aspects. In this work we shall focus on the normative conclusions that can be drawn about income distribution.

40|$|I will in {{this thesis}} examine the family gap in pay (i. e. {{differences}} in hourly pay between mothers and non-mothers) among Norwegian women. While women in general make up {{a substantial part of}} the workforce today, a large literature shows that women with children have lower hourly earnings than women without children even with same type of education and experience. Evidence of a family gap in pay has been found for the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and also for Norway. Conventionally, five explanations have been given to explain the lower wages of mothers. (1) Mothers may earn less because they lose experience that are relevant for their work effort, (2) they may be less productive at work due to childrearing,(3) they may choose jobs more compatible with childrearing but at the expense of higher wages, (4) employers might discriminate against mothers, (5) or it could be that non-mothers differ from mothers in ways that are relevant for wages and careers. However, which of these explanations to put most emphasis on is still an unresolved matter in the literature of the family gap. The available data was obtained from Statistics Norway and the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO). It covers the private business sector in Norway for the years 1980 - 1997. The data contains information about wages, establishments, occupation, age, education, family status, number of children (including when they were born) and more. The feature of the data (matched employer –employee data) allows me scrutinize the causes of the family gap in ways that have not been done before. One important aspect concerns that of employer discrimination. With the available data I can see if mothers are being paid less than non-mothers once they perform the same work for the same employer. Another central aspect concerns the time-frame of the data. A presumption in the exciting literature of the family gap is that the lower wages for women with children {{can be explained by the}} lack of well-developed family policies in such countries. The data I have available covers the years 1980 - 1997, a period with significant expansion in family policies in Norway. This allows me to see if the penalties to motherhood have changed over time, and to see if the family policies implemented in this years have had any of the intended effects. I will use Ordinary Least Square Models (OLS) to examine the family gap in Norway with the <b>natural</b> log for <b>wage</b> as the dependent variable. In my analyses I will use different specifications of the OLS model, which will take into account the different levels of the data which arises with matched employer-employee data. The main finding from my analysis is that is has occurred a great change in the situation for mothers in the private sector. The critical disparities in wages between mothers and non-mothers evident in the earliest years are severely reduced by the end of study. However, mothers still earn on average less than non-mothers, and these differences also increase with how many children you have. The main explanation for this is that mothers are sorted on different occupations and different establishment where lower wages prevails compared to non-mothers. Another important finding is when mothers and non-mothers actually work for the same employer and in same establishment, they receive same pay. As such within-job-wage discrimination is not what constitutes the family gap in pay in Norway. Whether this differential sorting is due to some compensating differentials i. e. mothers seek this positions because they are more easily combined with childrearing but at the expense of lower wages, or if it is a result of employer discrimination is difficult to determine. One could imagine that employers in the hiring situation channel mothers in to lower paid occupations, or give mothers less promotions compared to non-mothers. But also mothers may choose to spend less time at work and /or give less effort at work when they have children. In order to settle such a discussion more research on how family life and work life intersect is needed...|$|R
