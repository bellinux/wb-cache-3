40|$|Racial {{minorities}} are disproportionately imprisoned in the United States. This disparity {{is unlikely to}} be due solely to differences in criminal behavior. Behavioral science research has documented that prosecutors harbor unconscious racial biases. These unconscious biases play a role whenever prosecutors exercise their broad discretion, such as in choosing what crimes to charge and when <b>negotiating</b> <b>plea</b> bargains. To reduce this risk of unconscious racial bias, we propose a policy change: Prosecutors should be blinded to the race of criminal defendants wherever feasible. This could be accomplished by removing information identifying or suggesting the defendant’s race from police dossiers shared with prosecutors and by avoiding mentions of race in conversations between prosecutors and defense attorneys. Race is almost always irrelevant to the merits of a criminal prosecution; it should be omitted from the proceedings whenever possible for the sake of justice...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} <b>negotiated</b> <b>plea</b> agreements {{introduced by the}} Attorney General in 2009 for cases of serious or complex fraud, {{and the degree to}} which these differ from plea agreements reached through informal plea bargaining in other types of criminal case. It first considers whether the formally negotiated agreements are a result of coercion being brought to bear on defendants, or of defendants ‘playing the system’ (the two most common criticisms of ordinary plea bargains). It is then argued that an alternative conceptualisation may be more appropriate in serious fraud cases. To this end, approaches to plea bargaining more commonly applied in the United States (consensual, concessions, and contractual models) are considered in light of the current context. It is submitted that whilst these approaches have only limited application to defendants in ordinary criminal cases, they may help explain the dynamic of plea agreements in serious fraud cases. This in turn provides a basis upon which to assess the fairness of negotiated pleas in serious fraud cases, and highlights issues which lie at the core of the plea bargaining debate...|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} all crimes run a {{gauntlet}} of procedures {{that begins with}} an investigation and arrest, leads to charging and arraignment, and culminates (at least in successful prosecutions) with a conviction {{and the application of}} punishment. The reality is more nuanced. As this article 2 ̆ 7 s empirical study of the invocation and utilization of specific crimes contained within the United States Code indicates, there exist “detention crimes,” “charging crimes,” and “pleading crimes,” three types of offenses that, as applied, tend to implicate only portions of this sequence. This article examines the three categories of “facilitating crimes” and the benefits and drawbacks associated with their use. On the one hand, these offenses may reflect the more sensitive criminalization of specific misconduct; on the other, the failure of these crimes to engage the entire procedural continuum may compromise their legitimacy. The article concludes that while facilitating crimes and the practices that produce these offenses raise significant concerns, a species of pleading crime that categorically could not form the basis for an arrest or an initial charge, but could provide grounds for a <b>negotiated</b> <b>plea</b> bargain, might be considered as a replacement for some conventional crimes...|$|E
