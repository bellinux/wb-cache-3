5000|$|Energy {{recovery}} ventilation (ERV) is {{the energy}} recovery process of exchanging the energy contained in <b>normally</b> <b>exhausted</b> building or space air {{and using it}} to treat (precondition) the incoming outdoor ventilation air in residential and commercial HVAC systems. During the warmer seasons, the system pre-cools and dehumidifies while humidifying and pre-heating in the cooler seasons. [...] The benefit of using energy recovery {{is the ability to}} meet the ASHRAE ventilation & energy standards, while improving indoor air quality and reducing total HVAC equipment capacity.|$|R

500|$|The initial design had two islands {{with the}} flight deck running between them. Each island {{contained}} one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the bridge was mounted {{on top of the}} bracing, which left a clear height of [...] for the aircraft on {{the flight deck}}. Fairly early in the design process, {{the decision was made to}} delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They <b>normally</b> <b>exhausted</b> underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{management}} is treated by first exploring the energy requirements for a cryogenic tunnel. The requirement {{is defined as}} a function of Mach number, Reynolds number, temperature, and tunnel size. A simple program and correlation is described which allow calculation of the energy required. Usage of energy is also addressed in terms of tunnel control and research operation. The potential of a new wet expander is outlined in terms of cost saved by reliquefying a portion of the exhaust. The expander is described as a potentially more efficient way of recovering a fraction of the cold nitrogen gas <b>normally</b> <b>exhausted</b> to the atmosphere from a cryogenic tunnel. The role of tunnel insulation systems is explored in terms of requirements, safety, cost, maintenance, and efficiency. A detailed description of two external insulation systems is given. One is a rigid foam with a fiber glass and epoxy shell. The other is composed of glass fiber mats with a flexible outer vapor barrier; this system is nitrogen purged. The two systems are compared with the purged system being judged superior...|$|R
500|$|Alonso Duralde of MSNBC {{described}} Doomsday: [...] "It's ridiculous, derivative, confusingly {{edited and}} laden with gore, but it's {{the kind of}} over-the-top grindhouse epic that wears down your defenses and eventually makes you just go with it." [...] Duralde believed that Mitra's character would have qualified as a [...] "memorable fierce chick" [...] if the film was not so silly. David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer rated Doomsday at 2.5 out of 4 stars and thought that the film was better paced than most fantasy-action films, patiently building up its action scenes to the major [...] "fireworks" [...] where other films would <b>normally</b> be <b>exhausted</b> early on.|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{wheels are}} not {{suitable}} for use where total separation of supply and exhaust air streams is required, since air will bypass at the interface between the air streams at the heat exchanger boundary, and {{at the point where}} the wheel passes from one air stream to the other during its normal rotation. The former is reduced by brush seals, and the latter is reduced by a small purge section, formed by plating off a small segment of the wheel, <b>normally</b> in the <b>exhaust</b> air stream.|$|R
50|$|When the {{locomotive}} is started, cold water is fed {{directly into the}} main boiler which operates <b>normally</b> with the <b>exhaust</b> gases flowing out of the main chimney via the smokebox. Once the boiler is producing steam, the exit from the smokebox into the main chimney is closed and the exhaust gases instead flow through the feedwater heater and exit via the secondary chimney located towards the rear of {{the locomotive}}. Water fed into the boiler is now pre-heated in the feedwater heater and enters the boiler at higher than normal temperature.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{experimental}} data on jets exhausting into a crossflow is presented with particular {{interest for the}} case of a circular jet <b>exhausting</b> <b>normally</b> into a crossflow. This is followed by a survey of a number of proposed models attempting to describe this jet interference phenomenon. As a result of this survey a vortex sheet model, in which the jet is replaced by a pair of trailing vortices connected by a bound vortex sheet, is developed to predict the jet flow properties. Comparisons with experimental data, and in particular the collapse of data presented in similarity form, gives valuable support to this model. Computer programs, in Algol 60, have been developed for the calculation of flow properties and for plotting of the induced pressure distribution on a flat plate...|$|R
40|$|Planar-laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (PLIF) measurements {{have been}} used to investigate the mean flow pattern of a zero-net-mass-flux elliptical jets in cross-flow (ZNMF-EJICF). This particular jet is generated using the working fluid without net transfer of mass across the system boundary during one period of oscillation. The investigation involves the measurement of the mean jet profiles of the elliptical JICF. Two distinct flow regimes are observed namely single trajectory and multiple trajectory jets. Single trajectory jets demonstrate mixing of the bulk of the fluid outside the upstream boundary layer, while multiple trajectory ZNMF-JICF can penetrate more deeply into the ambient cross-flow. Ensemble-averaged PLIF images of two elliptic jets of aspect ratios (AR) of 2 and 3 <b>exhausting</b> <b>normally</b> into a cross flow with velocity ratios (VR) ranging from 2 to 5 have been studied and compared...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cogeneration {{is the use}} {{of single}} input of fuel to {{simultaneously}} produce useful electricity and heat from the same source. In the production of electricity, heat is <b>normally</b> wasted as <b>exhaust.</b> If the wasted heat from the electricity generation process can be reused, a large amount of fuel will be saved. Therefore, cogeneration conserves more energy both thermal and electrical. Considering the diminishing oil reserves, most countries are now switching into energy sector development based mainly on biomass, coal, and gas. With the new power sector structure and emerging market, industries can receive maximum benefit from the application of cogeneration. There is always a ready market for excess industrial power from cogeneration systems, which is a very competitive power source. The use of Synchronous or Induction generators for steam turbine cogeneration has been briefly discussed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|In the United States {{either a}} {{judicial}} or executive official designated by law issues an execution warrant. This is done {{when a person}} has been sentenced {{to death in a}} trial court, after trial and conviction, and usually after appeals are <b>exhausted.</b> <b>Normally</b> when a death warrant is signed and an execution date is set, the condemned person is moved from his or her death row cell to a death watch cell, which is typically located adjacent to the execution chamber. Usually, the government agency charged with carrying out an execution, normally the state's Department of Corrections or the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in federal cases, has a limited time frame, normally about 60 days, from the date the warrant is signed, to complete the execution process, or the warrant expires and the condemned person is returned to the death row cell, where he or she will await another execution date.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto dump, valve on the shoulder. Automatic valves can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the automatic valve at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no dump valve, but are clamped to the helmet with a watertight seal, so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a dump valve. Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist seals or the neck seal open to vent the suit.Surface dry suits do not <b>normally</b> have <b>exhaust</b> valves, but the wearer may vent excess air by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the neck seal.|$|R
40|$|A {{purpose-built}} {{diesel engine}} test bed with specially developed software {{has been used to}} acquire NO emission data in conjunction with additional engine parameter data under selected operating conditions. With the ability to remotely control both the engine speed and the torque to which it is subjected, tests were taken under steady-state conditions and over a substantial proportion of the engine's overall operating range. For NO control purposes diesel engines are <b>normally</b> fitted with <b>Exhaust</b> Gas Recirculation (EGR) as standard. Tests were carried out both in this default factory setup and without any NO control technologies, i. e., including the disconnection of the standard EGR. The variation of the NO emissions has been mapped across the corresponding speed and torque conditions. Additional data analysis techniques, which include multivariate analysis, have facilitated the identification of relationships both between individual parameters and the NO emissions; and between combinations of the parameters and the NO emissions...|$|R
40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low suction pressure compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert gas or jet ejector systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were <b>normally</b> arranged to <b>exhaust</b> back to the compressor suction. Early application of labyrinth/ejector seal systems were generally on compressors with suction pressures in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the seal system operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher suction pressures. The labyrinth/ejector seal systems have been applied to newer compressors with suction pressures as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil. This {{may be the result of}} noncritical-flow ejectors operating with critical pressure ratios. Labyrinth/ejector seal systems can be designed to perform satisfactorily with the higher compressor suction pressures, but these systems often require critical-flow ejectors. Despite their relatively low initial cost, the economics of labyrinth/ejector seal systems for high compressor suction pressures may not compare favorably with oil-type seal systems because of the energy required to recycle motive gas...|$|R
40|$|The 3 -dimensional atom probe (3 DAP) is {{a unique}} {{instrument}} providing chemical analysis at the atomic scale {{for a wide range}} of materials. A dedicated 3 DAP has been built specifically for analysing reactions at metal surfaces, called the catalytic atom probe (CAP). This paper presents an overview of results from the CAP on structural and chemical transformations to surface layers of Pt and Pt- 17. 4 at. %Rh catalysts following exposure to a number of gases typically emitted by vehicle engine <b>exhausts,</b> <b>normally</b> for 15 min at pressures of 10 mbar. Following exposure to the oxidising gases NO on Pt, and NO, O 2 or N 2 O on Pt-Rh, both surfaces appear disrupted, while for Pt-Rh, Rh enrichment of the surface atomic layer is noted over the entire specimen apex for exposure temperatures up to 523 K. However, for oxidising exposures at 573 - 773 K relatively clean, Rh-depleted surfaces are observed on { 0 0 1 }, { 0 1 1 } and { 0 1 2 } crystallographic regions of Pt-Rh. It is suggested that this result is due to surface diffusion of oxide species over the specimen apex, towards the { 1 1 1 }-orientated areas where the oxides appear to be stabilised. In contrast, CO exposure appears to have little effect on the either the surface structure or composition of the Pt-Rh alloy. Finally, combinations of two gases (NO + CO, O 2 + NO) were also dosed onto Pt-Rh alloys in the same exposure. These revealed that while NO and CO can co-adsorb without interference, CO prevents the build up of oxide layers and reduces the extent of Rh segregation seen under NO exposure alone. On exposing Pt-Rh to NO after an oxygen exposure, heavily oxidised surfaces, Rh segregation and no intact NO molecules were seen, confirming the ability of oxidised Pt-Rh to dissociate nitric oxide. © 2007 Elsevier B.
