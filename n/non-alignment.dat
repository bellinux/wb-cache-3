5|$|In 1949 Sweden {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a security policy aiming for <b>non-alignment</b> in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies <b>non-alignment</b> in peace for possible neutrality in war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. Sweden have been active participants in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} foreign policy {{coordination}} and developing ties, Nasser, President Sukarno of Indonesia, President Tito of Yugoslavia, and Prime Minister Nehru of India founded the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1961. Its declared purpose was to solidify international <b>non-alignment</b> and promote world peace amid the Cold War, end colonization, and increase economic cooperation among developing countries. In 1964, Nasser was made president of the NAM and held the second conference of the organization in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|The ruling Swedish Social Democratic Party have {{remained}} in favour of neutrality and <b>non-alignment.</b> This preference is shared by their partners, the Green Party, {{as well as the}} Left Party. The centre-right Moderate Party and the Liberal Party are the largest parties by current parliamentary representation in favor of NATO membership. The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea is credited with renewed public calls for NATO membership from notable politicians. The Centre Party was opposed to NATO membership until September 2015, when party leadership under Annie Lööf announced that they would motion to change the party policy in order to push for Sweden to join NATO at their next party conference. The Christian Democrats, also previously opposed, likewise voted to support NATO membership at their party meeting on 9 October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Supporters among Ravalomanana's {{high-level}} Tiko staff {{established a}} group to promote his campaign, which he named Tiako Iarivo ("I Love Antananarivo"). The candidate spent over 700 million Malagasy francs on the campaign, drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations. His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate's face, name and slogan, and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of milk to the public. Ravalomanana's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden with milk canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who, through intelligence, determination and responsible management, succeeded in developing a thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city. The Ravalomanana campaign received support {{on the basis of}} his evident success as a manager, his leadership in the Christian community and his <b>non-alignment</b> with Ratsiraka's AREMA party, as well as his relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters. The campaign opened on 2 November 1999, and by 8 November Ravalomanana held a led in the polls. In the 14 November municipal elections, Ravalomanana was elected mayor of Antananarivo with 45 per cent of the votes.|$|E
25|$|As Foreign Minister, Ismail {{pushed for}} <b>non-alignment</b> and non-interference in the {{internal}} affairs of ASEAN countries. He also supported the establishment of a central bank to quell foreign investment worries about a lack of independence in Malaysian monetary policy.|$|E
25|$|Shastri {{continued}} Nehru {{policy of}} <b>non-alignment</b> but also built closer {{relations with the}} Soviet Union. In {{the aftermath of the}} Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the formation of military ties between the Chinese People's Republic and Pakistan, Shastri's government decided to expand the defence budget of India's armed forces.|$|E
25|$|International <b>Non-alignment</b> – This is {{a result}} of the {{fundamentally}} Bolivarist conceptions of Sandino as distilled through the modern understanding of Fonseca. The U.S. government and large U.S. economic entities were a significant part of the problem for Nicaragua. But experiences with the traditional parties allied with the Soviet Union had also been unsatisfactory. Thus it was clear that Nicaragua must seek its own road.|$|E
25|$|Article 152: The {{foreign policy}} of the Islamic Republic of Iran {{is based upon the}} {{rejection}} of all forms of domination, both the exertion of it and submission to it, the preservation of the independence of the country in all respects and its territorial integrity, the defence of the rights of all Muslims, <b>non-alignment</b> with respect to the hegemonic superpowers, and the maintenance of mutually peaceful relations with all non-belligerent States.|$|E
25|$|Palme was a pivotal, renowned, and {{polarizing}} figure domestically {{as well as}} {{in international}} politics since the 1960s. He was steadfast in his <b>non-alignment</b> policy towards the superpowers, accompanied by support for numerous third world liberation movements following decolonization including, most controversially, economic and vocal support for a number of Third World governments. Most famously, he was the first Western head of government to visit Cuba after its revolution, giving a speech in Santiago praising contemporary Cuban and Cambodian revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|Yugoslavia began {{a number}} of {{fundamental}} reforms {{beginning in the early}} 1950s, bringing about change in three major directions: rapid liberalization and decentralization of the country's political system, the institution of a new, unique economic system, and a diplomatic policy of <b>non-alignment.</b> Yugoslavia refused {{to take part in the}} communist Warsaw Pact and instead took a neutral stance in the Cold War and became a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement along with countries like India, Egypt and Indonesia, and pursued one of its center-left influences that promoted a non-confrontational policy towards the U.S.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} disconcerting {{relationship to}} the region is the Sino-Burmese relationship as Burma moves away from <b>non-alignment.</b> Myanmar's State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) has cultivated close ties with China due to its search for economic and military support. This has resulted in Myanmar being increasingly drawn into the Chinese sphere of influence. This relationship is unsettling since it can draw Myanmar away from a democratic path, while also allowing China easier access into the Indian Ocean; an important factor for Chinese power projection over the Nanyang region.|$|E
25|$|On the {{international}} scene, Nehru was {{a champion of}} pacifism and {{a strong supporter of}} the United Nations. He pioneered the policy of <b>non-alignment</b> and co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement of nations professing neutrality between the rival blocs of nations led by the US and the USSR. Recognising the People's Republic of China soon after its founding (while most of the Western bloc continued relations with Taiwan), Nehru argued for its inclusion in the United Nations and refused to brand the Chinese as the aggressors in their conflict with Korea. He sought to establish warm and friendly relations with China in 1950, and hoped to act as an intermediary to bridge the gulf and tensions between the communist states and the Western bloc.|$|E
25|$|President Daoud met Leonid Brezhnev on a {{state visit}} to Moscow from April 12 to 15, 1977. Daoud had asked for a private meeting with the Soviet leader to discuss with him the {{increased}} pattern of Soviet actions in Afghanistan. In particular, he discussed the intensified Soviet attempt to unite the two factions of the Afghan communist parties, Parcham and Khalq. Brezhnev described Afghanistan's <b>non-alignment</b> {{as important to the}} USSR and essential to the promotion of peace in Asia, but warned him about the presence of experts from NATO countries stationed in the northern parts of Afghanistan. Daoud bluntly replied that Afghanistan would remain free, and that the Soviet Union would never be allowed to dictate how the country should be governed.|$|E
25|$|Defenders of Peronism also {{describe}} the doctrine as populist, albeit {{in the sense}} that they believe it embodies the interests of the masses, and in particular the most vulnerable social strata. Admirers hold Perón in esteem for his administration's anti-imperialism, and <b>non-alignment,</b> as well as its socially progressive initiatives. Amongst other measures introduced by Perón's governments, social security was made universal, while education was made free to all who qualified, and working students were given one paid week before every major examination. Vast low-income housing projects were created, and paid vacations became standard. All workers (including white-collar employees) were guaranteed free medical care and half of their vacation-trip expenses, and mothers-to-be received three paid months off prior to and after giving birth. Workers' recreation centers were also constructed throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|China's {{repeated}} {{threats to}} intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons. Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict, thus irking India. At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India. These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy– India, which had previously championed the cause of <b>non-alignment,</b> distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union. By the end of the 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India. From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union. After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far.|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} years Israel sought to {{maintain}} a non-aligned position between the super-powers. However, in 1952, an antisemitic public trial was staged in Moscow in which a group of Jewish doctors were {{accused of trying to}} poison Stalin (the Doctors' plot), followed by a similar trial in Czechoslovakia (Slánský trial). This, and the failure of Israel {{to be included in the}} Bandung Conference (of non-aligned states), effectively ended Israel's pursuit of <b>non-alignment.</b> On 19 May 1950, Egypt announced that the Suez Canal was closed to Israeli ships and commerce. In 1952 a military coup in Egypt brought Abdel Nasser to power. The United States pursued close relations with the new Arab states, particularly the Nasser-led Egyptian Free Officers Movement and Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. Israel's solution to diplomatic isolation was to establish good relations with newly independent states in Africa and with France, which was engaged in the Algerian War.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} <b>non-alignment</b> during the Cold War meant that Nehru {{received}} financial and technical support from both power blocs in building India's industrial base from scratch. Steel mill complexes were built at Bokaro and Rourkela with {{assistance from the}} Soviet Union and West Germany. There was substantial industrial development. Industry grew 7.0 percent annually between 1950 and 1965 – almost trebling industrial output and making India the world's seventh largest industrial country. Nehru's critics, however, contended that India's import substitution industrialisation, which was continued long after the Nehru era, weakened the international competitiveness of its manufacturing industries. India's share of world trade fell from 1.4 per cent in 1951–1960 to 0.5 per cent over 1981–1990. On the other hand, India's export performance is argued to have actually showed sustained improvement over the period. The volume of exports went up {{at an annual rate}} of 2.9 per cent in 1951–1960 to 7.6 per cent in 1971–1980.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{ranks among}} the top twenty-five wealthiest {{countries}} in {{the world in terms of}} GDP per capita, and as the tenth most prosperous country in the world according to The Legatum Prosperity Index 2015. After joining the EEC, Ireland enacted a series of liberal economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth. The country achieved considerable prosperity between the years of 1995 and 2007, which became known as the Celtic Tiger period. This was halted by an unprecedented financial crisis that began in 2008, in conjunction with the concurrent global economic crash. However, as the Irish economy was the fastest growing in the EU in 2015, Ireland is again quickly ascending league tables comparing wealth and prosperity internationally. For example, in 2015, Ireland was ranked as the joint sixth (with Germany) most developed country in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index. It also performs well in several national performance metrics, including freedom of the press, economic freedom and civil liberties. Ireland is a member of the European Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the OECD. The Irish government has followed a policy of military neutrality through <b>non-alignment</b> since immediately prior to World War II and the country is consequently not a member of NATO, although it is a member of Partnership for Peace.|$|E
25|$|Sweden emerged unharmed by World War II. The Swedish <b>non-alignment</b> policy officially {{remained}} – Sweden rejected NATO membership but {{joined the}} United Nations and later EFTA. Tage Erlander (s) was Prime Minister from 1946 to 1969 – {{a period of}} exceptional economic and social prosperity, and generally low unemployment, but the housing situation posed problems {{as more and more}} people moved to the cities. Responding to the housing shortage, the government introduced the Million Programme – a national wave of suburban development with the aim of creating a million homes from 1965 to 1974. This period saw the beginning of large-scale immigration to a country that used {{to be one of the}} more ethnically homogeneous in the world. The first phase of immigration consisted of workers from southern Europe, who were actively wooed over by campaigns of advertisement and recruitment in their home countries, for instance Italy & Austria. In the 1970s and 1980s many refugees with families arrived from e.g. Chile, Kurdistan, Vietnam & Somalia, some of them with refugee status, others on the immigration quota. At the same time, the economy was entering less powerfully prosperous times: while Sweden continues to be a thoroughly industrialized nation with many businesses of cutting-edge innovation, especially in telephonics, energy management, chemicals, pharmaceutics & food industry, this growth both in production and complication is not generating a great amount of new employment in Sweden anymore, and therefore did not swallow the generations who have grown up since 1980.|$|E
500|$|As {{the leader}} of the SCLC, King {{maintained}} a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: [...] "I feel someone must remain in the position of <b>non-alignment,</b> so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either." ...|$|E
500|$|The Vietnam War {{tempered}} foreign {{involvement in}} Angola's civil war as neither the Soviet Union nor the United States {{wanted to be}} drawn into an internal conflict of highly debatable importance in terms of winning the Cold War. CBS Newscaster Walter Cronkite spread this message in his broadcasts to [...] "try to play our small part in preventing that mistake this time." [...] The Politburo engaged in heated debate over {{the extent to which the}} Soviet Union would support a continued offensive by the MPLA in February 1976. Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Premier Alexei Kosygin led a faction favoring less support for the MPLA and greater emphasis on preserving détente with the West. Leonid Brezhnev, the then head of the Soviet Union, won out against the dissident faction and the Soviet alliance with the MPLA continued even as Neto publicly reaffirmed its policy of <b>non-alignment</b> at the 15th anniversary of the First Revolt.|$|E
500|$|Although Exton was [...] "clearly a {{partisan}} figure" [...] {{in the politics}} of London, his most recent biographer has noted that he [...] "nevertheless belonged to a ruling oligarchy whose shared interests often made it a force for stability" [...] in those politics. In any case, he managed to negotiate a difficult political period with little harm coming to him or the city under his mayorality, even though this involved allying with both the crown and its opponents against the other on varying occasions. Paul Strohm has suggested that, although Exton is often viewed as being politically sympathetic towards Brembre's views, Strohm says the difference between them is that Exton was [...] "an honest and aboveboard player who did not scruple to expose his predecessor's hyperpartisan chicanery" [...] whose policies were much the same but lacking the [...] "criminal excesses" [...] of Brembre. Sumption, meanwhile, has summed up the Mayor as an [...] "astute trimmer whose main objective was to stay out of trouble," [...] whereas an earlier biographer believed that Exton remained loyal to the King, but was unable to go against the general feeling of his compatriots. Either way, Exton's policy was clearly one of <b>non-alignment.</b>|$|E
500|$|The MPLA {{government}} arrested tens {{of thousands}} of suspected Nitistas from May to November and tried them in secret courts overseen by Defense Minister Iko Carreira. Those who were found guilty, including Van-Dunem, Jacobo [...] "Immortal Monster" [...] Caetano, the head of the 8th Brigade, and political commissar Eduardo Evaristo, were shot and buried in secret graves. At least 2,000 followers (or alleged followers) of Nito Alves were estimated to have been killed by Cuban and MPLA troops in the aftermath, with some estimates claiming as high as 70,000 dead. The coup attempt had a lasting effect on Angola's foreign relations. Alves had opposed Neto's foreign policy of <b>non-alignment,</b> evolutionary socialism, and multiracialism, favoring stronger relations with the Soviet Union, which Alves wanted to grant military bases in Angola. While Cuban soldiers actively helped Neto put down the coup, Alves and Neto both believed the Soviet Union opposed Neto. Cuban Armed Forces Minister Raúl Castro sent an additional four thousand troops to prevent further dissension within the MPLA's ranks and met with Neto in August in a display of solidarity. In contrast, Neto's distrust of the Soviet leadership increased and relations with the USSR worsened. In December, the MPLA held its first party Congress and changed its name to the MPLA-Worker's Party (MPLA-PT). The Nitista coup took a toll on the MPLA's membership. In 1975, the MPLA had reached 200,000 members, but after the first party congress, that number decreased to 30,000.|$|E
500|$|The {{assassination}} of Chamorro's husband sparked the Sandinista Revolution. His image {{became a symbol}} of their cause and when Daniel Ortega led the Sandinista guerrillas triumphantly into Managua in July 1979, Chamorro was with them. A coalition to replace the Somoza regime was formed. Chamorro, represented the Democratic Union of Liberation ( [...] , UDEL) in the first Junta of National Reconstruction ( [...] , JGRN), which also included Ortega for the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( [...] , FSLN); Moisés Hassan Morales, of the pro-Sandinista National Patriotic Front ( [...] , FPN); Luis Alfonso Robelo Callejas, with the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement ( [...] , MDN); and Sergio Ramirez Mercado for the Group of Twelve (...) [...] This directorate, which initially promised an independent judiciary, free elections, free enterprise and a free press, was assisted by an 18-member Cabinet and a 33-member Council, whose membership represented a broad spectrum of Nicaraguan society. After the civil war of 1978-1979 and last-minute transferring of the national treasury to foreign banks by the Somoza regime, the country was devastated and it was believed that a Marxist-style government would restore prosperity; however, the Sandinistas soon began taking over television and radio stations and censoring newspapers. Following the lead of the Sandinista's mentor Fidel Castro, Cuban-style Marxism was implemented and Nicaragua increasingly took on the traits of a police state, in some respects. In others, while the Sandinistas did increase their ties with the Soviet bloc and embraced Marxist philosophy, they announced a <b>non-alignment</b> policy and continued discussions on diplomatic, economic, and military relationships with the United States.|$|E

2500|$|As the NAM {{countries}} were becoming split into different factions, and as fewer {{countries were}} willing to support his anti-Western foreign policies, Sukarno began to abandon his <b>non-alignment</b> rhetoric. Sukarno formed a new alliance with China, North Korea, North Vietnam, and Cambodia which he called the [...] "Beijing-Pyongyang-Hanoi-Phnom Penh-Jakarta Axis". After withdrawing Indonesia from the [...] "imperialist-dominated" [...] United Nations in January 1965, Sukarno sought to establish a competitor organization to the UN called the Conference of New Emerging Forces (CONEFO) with support from China, who {{at that time was}} not yet a member of United Nations.With the government heavily indebted to the Soviet Union, Indonesia became increasingly dependent on China for support. Sukarno spoke increasingly of a Beijing-Jakarta axis, which would be the core of a new anti-imperialist world organization, the CONEFO.|$|E
2500|$|After Indian {{independence}} {{and until the}} end of the Cold War, the relationship between the US and India was cold and often thorny. This was due to the closeness of the US towards India's arch-rival Pakistan during the War, with Pakistan joining the US-led Western Bloc in 1954. India's policy of being not aligned with either the US or the Soviet Union, but maintaining close ties with the latter, also impacted relations. American officials perceived India's policy of <b>non-alignment</b> negatively. Ambassador Henry F. Grady told then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the United States did not consider neutrality to be an acceptable position. Grady told the State Department in December 1947 that he had informed Nehru [...] "that this is a question that cannot be straddled and that India should get on the democratic side immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Bửu Hội {{advocated}} a new [...] "government of national solidarity" [...] in Saigon that incorporated the religious sects.

He felt that this would foster reconciliation between non-Communist nationalists in the south. Bửu Hội opposed a military buildup in the south, reasoning that the best defense against insurrection came from fostering popular participation in the administrative and economic institutions of the state. He favoured neutralism in South Vietnam's foreign affairs while remaining on positive terms with France and the United States. He argued that the colonial era and Vietnam's natural place in Asia was to join other nations such as India in a policy of <b>non-alignment.</b> He hoped that both North and South Vietnam could be admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
