5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, <b>nurturing,</b> <b>and</b> responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, <b>nurturing</b> <b>and</b> legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden tells {{a mythical}} saga of life's {{evolution}} on Earth, with a subtext of a creation myth and polytheistic evolution. The player takes {{the role of}} one of many billions of lifeforms created by Gaia, the <b>nurturing</b> <b>and</b> benevolent daughter of Sol, the Sun. Among the creatures known as life, there is a competition to evolve, and the best lifeform will eventually be granted the privilege of entering the Garden of Eden and becoming the husband and partner of Gaia. As the game progresses, it soon becomes apparent some mysterious external force is interfering with evolution on Earth in a destructive manner. Strange crystals not native to Gaia appear across the planet, and creatures that eat the crystals are transformed into monstrously powerful beings that dominate all other lifeforms, overconsume resources and disrupt the flow of evolution. In each Age the player character is tasked with confronting the species transformed by the crystals and defeating them so that the evolution of life can continue as intended.|$|E

25|$|The feminist {{historian}} Deborah Willis {{asserts that}} the witch-hunts resulted from a societal fear of maternal power. Willis argues {{that the people of}} early modern Europe all had similar fears about malevolent motherly <b>nurturing,</b> <b>and</b> that the witches' teat is a manifestation of that fear. Willis {{asserts that the}} witches' teat is a perversion of the female power to nourish and strengthen young.|$|E

Individuals who were judged high in generativity, (i.e. who had a commitment story) were found to recall a higher proportion of events related to aspects of generativity. In contrast, those participants without a prominent disposition towards generativity showed no such bias.|$|E

25|$|The sexual {{division}} of humans into {{male and female}} has been marked culturally by a corresponding {{division of}} roles, norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. Cultural differences by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for <b>nurturing</b> <b>and</b> caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.|$|E

25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{stated that}} proponents of {{attachment}} therapy correctly {{point out that}} most critics have never actually observed any of the treatments they criticize or visited any of the centers where the controversial therapies are practiced. Proponents argue that their therapies present no physical risk if undertaken properly and that critics' concerns are based on unrepresentative occurrences and misapplications of techniques, or misunderstanding by parents. Holding is described as gentle or <b>nurturing</b> <b>and</b> it is maintained that intense, cathartic approaches are necessary to help children with attachment disorders. Their evidence for this is primarily clinical experience and testimonials.|$|E
25|$|Parvati is {{expressed}} in many roles, moods, epithets and aspects. In Hindu mythology, she is an active agent of the universe, the power of Shiva. She {{is expressed}} in <b>nurturing</b> <b>and</b> benevolent aspects, as well as destructive and ferocious aspects. She {{is the voice of}} encouragement, reason, freedom and strength, as well as of resistance, power, action and retributive justice. This paradox symbolizes her willingness to realign to Pratima (reality) and adapt to needs of circumstances in her role as the universal mother. She identifies and destroys evil to protect (Durga), as well as creates food and abundance to nourish (Annapurna).|$|E
25|$|All {{practitioners}} of Agama Hindu Dharma share many common beliefs, mostly the Five Points of Philosophy: the Panca Srada. These include {{the belief in}} one Almighty God, belief in the souls and spirits and karma or {{the belief in the}} law of reciprocal actions. Rather than belief in cycles of rebirth and reincarnation, Hinduism in Indonesia is concerned more with a myriad of local and ancestral spirits. In addition, the religion focuses more on art and ritual rather than scriptures, laws and beliefs. Balinese Hinduism also holds to the concept of Tri Hita Karana, <b>nurturing</b> <b>and</b> maintaining a harmonious relationship between human and God, human and human, human and nature.|$|E

25|$|Co-existence {{was part}} of Johnson's other major {{historical}} legacy: the protection of British sovereignty and Anglo-American settlement as a bulwark against French control of northern New York State and the Great Lakes region more generally. Johnson was instrumental in sustaining British-Iroquois alliance through the Covenant Chain, which consolidated both Iroquois and British territorial and commercial interests against the rival Algonquin and French interests in New France before 1763. After Britain assumed control, Johnson eventually won a political dispute over Indian policy with Lord Jeffrey Amherst, who disdained the Iroquois alliance Johnson had so devoted himself to <b>nurturing</b> <b>and</b> defending. It was to Johnson that Pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him.|$|E

Mrs. O'Brien is gentle, <b>nurturing,</b> <b>and</b> authoritative, presenting the world to her children {{as a place of}} wonder. Mr. O'Brien is strict and authoritarian, and easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons with wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative.
