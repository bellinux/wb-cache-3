5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} among modern scholars {{on whether}} David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands {{which had been}} granted {{to him as a}} reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros, or if it had been the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II. As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship, it would be more reasonable to assume that he conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). As Jews {{became more and more}} excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own. Economic problems were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E

After Pitt's death in 1806, Ferguson did <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> retain his seat in Parliament. In the elections of 1806, he retained the seat by just two votes, and his opponent General Alexander Hay demanded he be investigated for bribery and corruption. Ferguson again beat Hay in the contest for the seat in June 1807, but {{this time with a}} more convincing majority of 54 to 39 votes. Ferguson was unopposed in the next three elections. Some records indicate that Ferguson never spoke in the Commons except to complain about a broken window behind his seat causing a draught. He is actually recorded as speaking on at least five occasions over the years.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E

Beginning in 1900, Boyce also edited the WFM journal, Miners Magazine. He left the position when he retired as union president in 1902.|$|E

25|$|After the war ended, {{the church}} went into decline. Older members died and {{were buried in}} the cemetery; younger ones left the area. They were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> replaced. Somers' early {{economic}} advantages had been offset when the railroads, which had begun extending themselves into Westchester during the 1840s, grew out having bypassed the town, and newcomers to the region settled where the tracks were.

He uncovers a minor bureaucrat named Gelman who testifies that {{twenty years}} earlier then-University of Chicago {{instructor}} Leffingwell invited Gelman {{to join a}} small Communist cell that included a fellow traveler who went by the pseudonym James Morton. After outright lies under oath by the nominee and vigorous cross examination by Leffingwell, Gelman is thoroughly discredited and deemed an unfit witness by the subcommittee and its charismatic chairman Utah Senator Brig Anderson. The subcommittee is ready to approve the nominee.|$|E

Such a dispersed system could <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> be controlled where there was a vigorous local market for the raw materials: wool was easily available in sheep-rearing regions, whereas silk was not.|$|E

25|$|Farragut had two {{problems}} {{to deal with}} in addition to any posed by the Confederates. The first, dealing with Butler and his army, was handled by simply ignoring him; the Army took no further part in his plans. The second was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> dismissed; part of Farragut's fleet was a semi-autonomous group of mortar schooners, headed by his foster brother David D. Porter. Porter was a master of intrigue who had the ear of Assistant Secretary Fox, and Farragut had to let the mortars be tried, despite his strong personal belief that they would prove worthless.|$|E
25|$|In November 1839 Cauchy {{was elected}} to the Bureau, and {{discovered}} immediately that the matter of the oath was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.|$|E

He {{therefore}} accepted an offer from Lee DuBridge of the chair of the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy at Caltech. However the work at the Atomic Energy Commission was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> left behind. Senator Bourke Hickenlooper charged the Commission with mismanagement, specifically cost overruns at Hanford, awarding a scholarship to a communist, and the loss of [...] of uranium from the Argonne National Laboratory.

500|$|Amongst {{individual}} Australian soldiers, {{the news}} of the victory helped to dispel some of the notions about the invincibility of the Japanese soldier that had developed in the psyche of Allied soldiers following the defeats of early 1942, and which had impacted on Allied planning up to that point. Some of these notions would remain {{until the end of the}} war, but {{the news of}} Milne Bay allowed some soldiers to rationalise the Japanese soldiers' past victories as being the result of tangible factors, such as numerical superiority, that could be overcome, rather than innate factors associated with the intangible qualities of the Japanese soldier that were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> overcome. After this, amongst the Allies there was [...] "a sense that fortune's wheel was turning", and although leaders such as Blamey emphasised the difficulties that lay ahead, a feeling of confidence in eventual victory emerged. MacArthur warned the War Department that success was attributable to good intelligence that allowed him to concentrate a superior force at Milne Bay, and might not be repeatable.|$|E
500|$|During the 1940s Blyton {{became a}} {{prolific}} author, her success enhanced by her [...] "marketing, publicity and branding {{that was far}} ahead of its time". In 1940 Blyton published two books– Three Boys and a Circus and Children of Kidillin– under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name), {{in addition to the}} eleven published under her own name that year. So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that [...] "Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels". But Blyton's readers were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher, with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock– two in 1940 and four in 1943– were reissued under Blyton's name. Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her boarding school story books and the first novel in the Naughtiest Girl series, The Naughtiest Girl in the School, which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the St. Clare's series, The Twins at St. Clare's, appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan.|$|E

[...] The Literary World {{agreed that it was}} [...] "the manliest and the loveliest work of Mr. Morris's genius", going on to predict that [...] "Whatever its immediate reception may be, William Morris's Sigurd is certain eventually to take its place among the few great epics of the English tongue." [...] The note of caution as to the reaction of the 19th century reading public was sounded more strongly by several other critics. [...] Theodore Watts wrote in The Athenaeum, [...] "That this is a noble poem there can be no doubt; but whether it will meet with ready appreciation and sympathy in this country is a question <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> disposed of." [...] He thought it [...] "Mr. Morris's greatest achievement", but worried about the choice of metre, which he thought monotonous in effect. In an unfavourable review for Fraser's Magazine, Henry Hewlett complained that [...] "The narrative seldom rises above mediocrity...the memory finds little to carry away, and the ear still less to haunt it."
