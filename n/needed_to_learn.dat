25|$|The notion for education-based {{workshops}} and displays developed {{out of a}} philosophical view; {{that the world was}} heading towards difficult times and that people <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to become more self-sufficient so that they would be less reliant on a system unable to provide spiritual and survivalist needs. If one was unable to access healthy food then the logical solution was to learn how to grow one's food.

25|$|After {{acquiring}} Valenzuela in {{the summer}} of 1979, the Dodgers assigned him to the Lodi Dodgers of the High-A level California League, where he posted a 1–2 record and a 1.13 earned run average (ERA) in limited action. The Dodgers felt that Valenzuela <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to throw an off-speed pitch, so they had Dodgers pitcher Bobby Castillo teach him to throw the screwball before the 1980 season. In 1980 Valenzuela was promoted to the Double-A level San Antonio Dodgers. There Valenzuela led the Texas League with 162 strikeouts, and he earned a 13-9 win-loss record and a 3.10 ERA.|$|E

First, children <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about themselves. This involves learning self-respect and self-esteem. Second, children <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about relationships. In learning about their relationships with others, there is a focus on social [...] "literacy" [...] (<b>learning</b> <b>to</b> see social influence) andemotional [...] "literacy" [...] (one's own self in relation to others). Third, children <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about resilience. This entails overcoming difficulties, facing challenges and <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> ensure long-term success. Fourth, children <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about aesthetics - This encourages the student to see the beauty of what is around them and <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> have awe in life.|$|R

25|$|The {{secretary}} general of the IAAF, Pierre Weiss, acknowledged the lack of European teams present at the competition, but said that problem was solely with world championships participation and not the sport of cross country running as a whole as the 2009 European Cross Country Championships had been successful. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated that European runners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from the East Africans to improve their performances. However, the decline in European interest had a direct effect on the scheduling of the world championships event, which had been changed from an annual to a biennial format by a large majority of votes at the 2009 IAAF Congress.|$|E
25|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology and neuroscience, spatial memory {{is the part}} of memory responsible for recording information about one's environment and spatial orientation. For example, a person's spatial memory is required in order to navigate around a familiar city, just as a rat's spatial memory is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the location of food {{at the end of a}} maze. It is often argued that in both humans and animals, spatial memories are summarized as a cognitive map. Spatial memory has representations within working, short-term memory and long-term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with spatial memory. Many methods are used for measuring spatial memory in children, adults, and animals.|$|E

25|$|In today's society, {{there is}} little {{understanding}} of the daily realities of actual agricultural life. Cowboys are more often associated with (mostly fictitious) Indian-fighting than with their actual life of ranch work and cattle-tending. The cowboy is also portrayed as a masculine ideal via images ranging from the Marlboro Man to the Village People. Actors such as John Wayne are thought of as exemplifying a cowboy ideal, even though western movies seldom bear much resemblance to real cowboy life. Arguably, the modern rodeo competitor is much closer to being an actual cowboy, as many were actually raised on ranches and around livestock, and the rest have <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> livestock-handling skills on the job.|$|E

Some required skills in crossing roads or using buses, others had health problems that they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to manage. Small trial group homes were created within the hospital to allow each group of friends to learn to manage and nurses assisted patients to go shopping for food or clothes or to the cinema building confidence and skills.|$|E
25|$|At Shanghai, the new missionaries first <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> {{the local}} Wu dialect, {{as well as}} Mandarin and the {{literary}} Wen-Li language. They soon learned that of the about twenty missionaries who had traveled to Shanghai to work under Bishop Boone since 1845, only about half remained—many experienced health problems, {{as well as the}} strains of cultural adjustment and physical dangers. Soon, they were able to substitute for the British chaplain who assisted foreign sailors, and by December Williams could read prayers in Chinese well enough to substitute for the bishop. Bishop Boone ordained both Williams and Liggins to the priesthood on 11 January 1857. They soon began making missionary journeys to various cities in the Yangtze River delta from their Shanghai base.|$|E

Previously, experts had told parents that babies <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E

BuzzFeed News wrote about the work during Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and contrasted the book's views on the changing American economy with Trump's statements from the campaign trail.

During his tenure as a prefect Xu Jiyu submitted a number of official memorials on domestic reform, which impressed the Daoguang Emperor and further helped Xu to rapidly rise through the ranks of the Qing civil service. Following the outbreak of the First Opium War, Xu was appointed circuit intendant of a coastal prefecture in Fujian province, where he witnessed the war with his own eyes, an experience that convinced him that China <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about the West.|$|E

Over the coming weeks, the feud between Joe and Booker intensified, with episodes ending with Booker T or Sharmell striking Samoa Joe with Sting's trademark bat as Impact! went off the air, leading {{to a question of}} whether Sting had turned on Samoa Joe and became a heel. Although still receiving a face reaction from the fans, Sting sided with Booker T. On August 10 at Hard Justice, Sting attacked A.J. Styles after he and Kurt Angle wrestled a Last Man Standing match. Sting later announced why he attacked Joe and Styles by saying that the younger generation <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about respecting veterans like Angle, Booker, and himself. He declared that he wouldn't retire until he had accomplished this mission. This led to mixed fan reactions, and sparked a feud between him and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe, as well as Jeff Jarrett who arrived to aid Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles by giving them his guitar as Sting had done with his bat.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Spain had stopped allocating new parcels {{of land in}} San Antonio and La Bahia, making it {{difficult}} for some families to accommodate their growth. Occupancy rights were granted to people in the northeast part of Texas, but the new residents had no official ownership of the land on which they lived. Just before Mexico achieved independence, Spain reversed its policies and passed a colonization law. Although the law did not state a religious requirement for settlers in Texas, it was understood that Spain's only religion was Catholicism, per the 1812 Constitution. Notably, article 28 of this law prohibited the importation of slaves into Spanish territories, and if brought to the area, they would be freed. Mexico adopted a similar law in 1824. The General Colonization Law which enabled all heads of household who were citizens of or immigrants to Mexico to be eligible to claim land. The law did not differentiate among races or social stature, and people who had been granted occupancy rights would be able to claim the land patent for the dwellings. Unlike its predecessor, the Mexican law required immigrants to practice Catholicism and stressed that foreigners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Spanish. Settlers were supposed to own property or have a craft or useful profession, and all people wishing to live in Texas were expected to report to the nearest Mexican authority for permission to settle. The rules were widely disregarded and many families became squatters.|$|E
25|$|Many Anglo-Saxon people <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Norman French to {{communicate}} with their rulers, {{but it is clear}} that among themselves they kept speaking Old English, which meant that England was in an interesting tri-lingual situation: Anglo-Saxon for the common people, Latin for the Church, and Norman French for the administrators, the nobility, and the law courts. In this time, and due to the cultural shock of the Conquest, Anglo-Saxon began to change very rapidly, and by 1200 or so, it was no longer Anglo-Saxon English, but what scholars call early Middle English. But this language had deep roots in Anglo-Saxon, which was being spoken a lot later than 1066. Research in the early twentieth century, and still continuing today, has shown that a form of Anglo-Saxon was still being spoken, and not merely among uneducated peasants, into the thirteenth century in the West Midlands. This was J.R.R. Tolkien's major scholarly discovery when he studied a group of texts written in early Middle English called the Katherine Group, because they include the Life of St. Katherine (also, the Life of St. Margaret, the Life and the Passion of St. Juliana, Ancrene Wisse, and Hali Meithhad—these last two teaching how to be a good anchoress and arguing for the goodness of virginity). Tolkien noticed that a subtle distinction preserved in these texts indicated that Old English had continued to be spoken far longer than anyone had supposed. In Old English there is a distinction between two different kinds of verbs.|$|E
