25|$|Not all was rosy for Gray however. He {{applied for}} extra gas coupons, {{reasoning}} {{that he would}} <b>need</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> drive about the countryside collecting plot material for the strip. But an Office of Price Administration clerk named Flack refused to give Gray the coupons, explaining that cartoons were not vital to the war effort. Gray requested a hearing and the original decision was upheld. Gray was furious and vented in the strip, with especial venom directed at Flack, government price controls, and other concerns. Gray had his supporters, but Flack's neighbors defended him in the local newspaper and tongue-lashed Gray. Flack threatened to sue for libel, and some papers cancelled the strip. Gray showed no remorse, but did discontinue the sequence.|$|E

The company had saved the profits, predicting that it would <b>need</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cover income tax and excess profits tax. After these taxes had been paid there was approximately £1 million left, which they again saved, hoping to use this to cover any financial difficulties that might arise. [...] The reserves were again boosted with government money paid under the Trade Facilities Act 1921, but between 1921 and 1925 the profits of the company rapidly dropped and, beginning from 1926, the directors supplemented the company income by taking money from the reserves.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{shows how}} Chicanas, like women {{of many other}} ethnicities, {{internalize}} these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In The House on Mango Street, for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman’s hips have: [...] "They’re good for holding a baby when you’re cooking, Rachel says... You <b>need</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> dance, says Lucy... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know." [...] Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros's characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her [...] "sexual initiation"—an assault {{by a group of}} Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was not there for her, but [...] "by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex". Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives.|$|E

2500|$|Neuro-linguistic {{programming}} (NLP) is {{an approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell us about that. RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't <b>need</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where we set up a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started. Now I cannot prove that but I've seen it enough times that I'm impressed with it.}} allergy, common cold, and learning disorders.|$|E

60|$|The {{conclusion}} in an induction is inferred {{from the evidence}} itself, and not from {{a recognition of the}} sufficiency of the evidence; as I infer that my friend is walking toward me because I see him, and not because I recognize that my eyes are open, and that eyesight is a means of knowledge. In all operations which require care, it is good to assure ourselves that the process has been performed accurately; but the testing of the process is not the process itself; and, besides, may have been omitted altogether, and yet the process be correct. It is precisely because that operation is omitted in ordinary unscientific reasoning, that there is any thing gained in certainty by throwing reasoning into the syllogistic form. To make sure, as far as possible, that it shall not be omitted, we make the testing operation a part of the reasoning process itself. We insist that the inference from particulars to particulars shall pass through a general proposition. But this is a security for good reasoning, not a condition of all reasoning; and in some cases not even a security. Our most familiar inferences are all made before we learn the use of general propositions; and a person of untutored sagacity will skillfully apply his acquired experience to adjacent cases, though he would bungle grievously in fixing the limits of the appropriate general theorem. But though he may conclude rightly, he never, properly speaking, knows whether he has done so or not; he has not tested his reasoning. Now, this is precisely what forms of reasoning do for us. We do not <b>need</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> enable us to reason, but to enable us to know whether we reason correctly.|$|E
6000|$|THERE grew a {{fragrant}} rose-tree {{where the}} brook flows, [...] With two little tender buds, and one full rose; [...] When {{the sun went}} down to his bed in the west, [...] The little buds leaned on the rose-mother's breast, [...] While the bright eyed stars their long watch kept, [...] And the flowers of the valley in their green cradles slept; [...] Then silently in odors they communed with each other, [...] The two little buds on the bosom of their mother. [...] "O sister," [...] said the little one, as she gazed at the sky, [...] "I wish that the Dew Elves, as they wander lightly by, [...] Would bring me a star; for they never grow dim, [...] And the Father does not <b>need</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> burn round him. [...] The shining drops of dew the Elves bring each day [...] And place in my bosom, so soon pass away; [...] But a star would glitter brightly through the long summer hours, [...] And I should be fairer than all my sister flowers. [...] That were better far than the dew-drops that fall [...] On the high and the low, and come alike to all. [...] I would be fair and stately, with a bright star to shine [...] And give a queenly air to this crimson robe of mine." [...] And proudly she cried, [...] "These fire-flies shall be [...] My jewels, since the stars can never come to me." [...] Just then a tiny dew-drop that hung o'er the dell [...] On the breast of the bud like a soft star fell; [...] But impatiently she flung it away from her leaf, [...] And it fell on her mother like a tear of grief, [...] While she folded to her breast, with wilful pride, [...] A glittering fire-fly that hung by her side. [...] "Heed," [...] said the mother rose, [...] "daughter mine, [...] Why shouldst thou seek for beauty not thine? [...] The Father hath made thee what thou now art; [...] And what he most loveth is a sweet, pure heart. [...] Then why dost thou take with such discontent [...] The loving gift which he to thee hath sent? [...] For the cool fresh dew will render thee far [...] More lovely and sweet than the brightest star; [...] They were made for Heaven, and can never come to shine [...] Like the fire-fly thou hast in that foolish breast of thine. [...] O my foolish little bud, do listen to thy mother; [...] Care only for true beauty, and seek for no other. [...] There will be grief and trouble in that wilful little heart; [...] Unfold thy leaves, my daughter, and let the fly depart." [...] But the proud little bud would have her own will, [...] And folded the fire-fly more closely still; [...] Till the struggling insect tore open the vest [...] Of purple and green, that covered her breast. [...] When the sun came up, she saw with grief [...] The blooming of her sister bud leaf by leaf. [...] While she, once as fair and bright as the rest, [...] Hung her weary head down on her wounded breast. [...] Bright grew the sunshine, and the soft summer air [...] Was filled with the music of flowers singing there; [...] But faint grew the little bud with thirst and pain, [...] And longed for the cool dew; but now 't was in vain. [...] Then bitterly she wept for her folly and pride, [...] As drooping she stood by her fair sister's side. [...] Then the rose mother leaned the weary little head [...] On her bosom to rest, and tenderly she said: [...] "Thou hast learned, my little bud, that, whatever may betide, [...] Thou canst win thyself no joy by passion or by pride. [...] The loving Father sends the sunshine and the shower, [...] That thou mayst become a perfect little flower;-- [...] The sweet dews to feed thee, the soft wind to cheer, [...] And the earth as a pleasant home, while thou art dwelling here. [...] Then shouldst thou not be grateful for all this kindly care, [...] And strive to keep thyself most innocent and fair? [...] Then seek, my little blossom, to win humility; [...] Be fair without, be pure within, and thou wilt happy be. [...] So when the quiet Autumn of thy fragrant life shall come, [...] Thou mayst pass away, to bloom in the Flower Spirits' home." [...] Then from the mother's breast, where it still lay hid, [...] Into the fading bud the dew-drop gently slid; [...] Stronger grew the little form, and happy tears fell, [...] As the dew did its silent work, and the bud grew well, [...] While the gentle rose leaned, with motherly pride, [...] O'er the fair little ones that bloomed at her side.|$|E
