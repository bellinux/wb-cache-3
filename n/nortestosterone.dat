Although {{recent data}} showed transdermal estrogens {{may be safe}} with respect to thrombotic risk, {{the impact of the}} route of estrogen administration and concomitant progestogens is not fully established. We used data from the E 3 N French prospective cohort of women born between 1925 and 1950 and biennially followed by questionnaires from 1990. Study population consisted of 80 308 postmenopausal women (average follow-up: 10. 1 years) including 549 documented idiopathic first venous thromboembolism. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional models. Compared to never-users, past-users of hormone therapy had no increased thrombotic risk (HR= 1. 1; 95 % CI: 0. 8 to 1. 5). Oral not transdermal estrogens were associated with increased thrombotic risk (HR= 1. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 1 to 2. 8 and HR= 1. 1; 95 % CI: 0. 8 to 1. 8; homogeneity: P= 0. 01). The thrombotic risk significantly differed by concomitant progestogens type (homogeneity: P< 0. 01) : there was no significant association with progesterone, pregnanes, and <b>nortestosterones</b> (HR= 0. 9; 95 % CI: 0. 6 to 1. 5, HR= 1. 3; 95 % CI: 0. 9 to 2. 0 and HR= 1. 4; 95 % CI: 0. 7 to 2. 4). However, norpregnanes were associated with increased thrombotic risk (HR= 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 2 to 2. 7). In this large study, we found that route of estrogen administration and concomitant progestogens type are 2 important determinants of thrombotic risk among postmenopausal women using hormone therapy.

The other three were novel compounds: two <b>nortestosterone</b> analogues derived from ORG 3236 (E- and Z- 13 -ethyl- 17 -hydroxy- 21 -iodo- 11 -methylene- 18, 19 -dinor- 17 alpha-pre gna- 4, 20 -diene- 3 -one; E- and Z-IPG 2) and one norprogesterone analogue derived from ORG 2058 (21 -[4 -iodophenoxy]- 16 alpha-ethyl- 19 -norpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 20 -dione; IPG 3). The E-iodovinyl <b>nortestosterone</b> compounds {{were obtained by}} a new route of synthesis. Competitive binding studies were performed to determine their binding affinities for the PR in three types of tissue (human MCF- 7 breast tumour cells and rat uterine and mammary tumour tissue) and for the androgen receptor (AR) in human MCF- 7 breast tumour cells, {{as well as for}} the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) in human plasma. All four 17 alpha-iodovinyl <b>nortestosterone</b> derivatives displayed high binding affinity for the human PR, that of Z-IPG 1 and E- and Z-IPG 2 being even higher than that of ORG 2058. Their affinities for the rat PR were somewhat lower, especially those of both E-isomers. The affinity of IPG 3 was lower for both the human and rat PR. The <b>nortestosterone</b> derivatives also showed AR binding, the relative binding affinities ranging from 4. 3 to 17. 0 % as compared with 5 alphaDHT. Additionally, neither of these steroids displayed any significant binding to either SHBG or CBG in human plasma. We conclude that the in vitro binding properties of all four 17 alpha-iodovinyl <b>nortestosterone</b> derivatives warrant evaluation of the distribution characteristics of their 123 I-labelled analogues to determine their usefulness as PR imaging agent...|$|E
40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde eine Aufarbeitungsmethode zur komponentenspezifischen Kohlenstoffisotopenmessung von Nortestosteron und dessen Precursor Dehydroepiandrosteron (DHEA) im Eberurin entwickelt. Die Urinextrakte, die von Ebern mit einheitlicher Fütterung von C 3 -Pflanzen stammten, wurden underivatisiert mit kalter On Column Technik auf das GC/C/IRMS-System aufgegeben. Das erarbeitete Aufreinigungsverfahren lieferte genügend reine Extrakte, so dass zuverlässige δ 13 C-Werte von Nortestosteron und DHEA erhalten werden konnten. Die Aufreinigungsschritte waren nach vorheriger Hydrolyse mit β-Glucuronidase aus dem Schneckenschleim der Helix pomatia eine Flüssig-/Füssigextraktion mit anschließender präparativer HPLC-Aufreinigung auf einer Normalphase für Nortestosteron und einer zusätzlichen {{reversed}} Phase für DHEA. Die Nortestosteronkonzentration im Eberurin wurde mit einer Spanne von 34, 8 µg/kg bis 1112, 0 µg/kg (Median: 224, 3 µg/kg) bestimmt, wobei der meiste Anteil ungebunden vorlag. Der Median des δ 13 C-Wertes von Nortestosteron lag bei - 26, 47 ‰. Das Vorläufersteroid DHEA bei der Nortestosteronbiosynthese wurde mit einer Konzentration im Eberurin von 196, 0 µg/kg bis 5184, 0 µg/kg ermittelt. Der Median lag mit 556, 0 µg/kg deutlich über der Konzentration von Nortestosteron, was durch den im Schwein dominierenden Delta 5 -Biosyntheseweg erklärt werden kann. Der Median des δ 13 C-Wertes von DHEA lag bei - 26, 63 ‰. Vergleicht man den gemessenen δ 13 C-Wert des Futters der Eber von - 25, 91 ‰ mit den gemessenenen 13 C-Werten von Nortestosteron und DHEA, spiegelt sich die isotopische Kohlenstoffzusammensetzung des Futters in denen der Steroiden wieder. Es konnten die Kohlenstoffisotopenverhältnisse einiger synthetischer Nortestosteronpräparate bestimmt werden. Zusätzlich konnten im Eberurin die weiteren Steroide Norandrostendion, Testosteron, Epitestosteron, Etiocholanolon, 5 -Androsten- 3 β, 17 β-diol, 5 β-Androstan- 3 α, 17 β-diol, 11 -Ketoetiocholanolon, Estren- 5 (10) - 3 α, 17 β-diol und das Eberpheromon 5 α-Androst- 16 -en- 3 β-ol nachgewiesen werden. Um mit der Methode der Stabilisotopen-Massenspektrometrie eine illegale Anwendung von Nortestosteron an Ebern nachweisen zu können, sind noch weitere Untersuchungen im Rahmen von Tierversuchen notwendig. Eber unbekannter Herkunft und unbekannter Fütterung müssen mit synthetischem Nortestosteron behandelt und die δ 13 C-Werte von Nortestosteron und DHEA oder eines anderen Vorläufers bestimmt werden. Zusätzlich müssen die δ 13 C-Werte der auf dem internationalen Markt befindlichen Nortestosteronpräparate bestimmt werden. This thesis {{describes a}} clean-up procedure and analytical method for the compound-specific isotopic measurement of <b>nortestosterone</b> and its precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) from urine of boars. The results were obtained with this method. To investigate {{the influence of}} individual animals and to exlude the influence by the diet, a group of boars of different breed were fed with a standardised C 3 -plant diet. The boars' urine was firstly treated with β-glucuronidase from Helix pomatia to hydrolyse glucuronides of the steroids. The resulting solution was subjected to a liquid/liquid extraction and a normal-phase HPLC clean-up step to achieve a matrix-free <b>nortestosterone</b> peak. For DHEA {{it was necessary to}} apply an additional reversed-phase HPLC clean-up step. The cleaned extracts were injected without derivatization of the steroids by cold on column injection into the GC/C/IRMS system. The developed clean-up procedure provided a sufficiently clean extract for reliable <b>nortestosterone</b> and DHEA carbon isotope measurements with baseline separation of these analytes and also allowed to detect more steroids like norandrostendione, testosterone, epitestosterone, etiocholanolone, 5 -androsten- 3 β, 17 β-diol, 5 β-androstan- 3 α, 17 β-diol, 11 -ketoetiocholanolon, estren- 5 (10) - 3 α, 17 β-diol and 5 α-androst- 16 -en- 3 β-ol. The extracts were also used for quantitative measurements by GC/FID. It could be shown that the major part of <b>nortestosterone</b> in the boars' urine was unconjugated, while DHEA was found exclusively as glucuronide. The concentration of <b>nortestosterone</b> in the boars' urine had values between 34. 8 µg/kg and 1112 µg/kg. The median was 224. 3 µg/kg and the median of the δ 13 C value of <b>nortestosterone</b> was - 26. 47 ‰. The concentration of DHEA, which originates from the delta 4 -pathway of swines, was between 196 µg/kg and 5184 µg/kg with a median of 556. 0 µg/kg. The median of the δ 13 C value of DHEA was - 26. 63 ‰. Both, the δ 13 C values of <b>nortestosterone</b> and of DHEA reflect the isotopic composition of the boars' feed, which had a δ 13 C value of - 25. 9 ‰. Seven different commercially available synthetic <b>nortestosterone</b> standards or preparations had δ 13 C values between - 29. 65 ‰ and - 29. 13 ‰. Just one (- 27. 28) was in the range of natural testosterone of boars' urine between - 27. 53 ‰ and - 24. 14 ‰. However, it still needs a higher degree of analytical validation and further animal experiments with applying synthetic <b>nortestosterone</b> and different diets before an illicit application of <b>nortestosterone</b> to boars can be reliably detected...|$|E

40|$|Growth-promoting {{agents are}} illicitly used during animal rearing {{processes}} and {{the detection of}} their use is limited by new compounds and dosing practices that limit the efficiency of current testing {{which is based on}} residue analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methodology. An alternative approach is to use indirect biological evidence as a screening tool to identify growth-promoter treated animals thus improving the effectiveness of residue testing through the targeted sampling of these animals. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a glycoprotein which binds and controls the levels of sex-hormones within the circulation. Using a biosensor assay based on measurement of binding to an immobilised 1 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (1 alpha-DHT) derivative, reduced SHBG binding capacities were detected in growth-promoter treated animals. During the course of a veal treatment regime based on repeated oestradiol benzoate, <b>nortestosterone</b> decanoate and dexamethasone administrations, treated male and female calves were shown to have significantly lower SHBG capacities. To assess the effectiveness of using SHBG binding capacities as a biomarker of treatment and to investigate the role of individual growth-promoter components to the SHBG capacity lowering effects, adult heifer animals were subjected to repeated doses of <b>nortestosterone</b> decanoate. These animals also demonstrated a reduction in SHBG capacity levels at Day 39 of the study, in contrast to oestradiol benzoate treated adult steers who were found to have unaltered levels. These findings suggest that the measurement of SHBG binding capacities using a biosensor assay has potential in the identification of illegally treated animals, particularly those exposed to androgens...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A {{specific}} radioimmunoassay {{was developed}} for 19 -nortestosterone (nandrolone) in urine.

All subjects tested positive via urinalysis for the presence of <b>nortestosterone</b> at days 3, 5, 7, and 10. There was no change in the urine testosterone-epitestosterone ratio at any day. Furthermore, as determined by serum chemistry tests, there was no effect on renal, hepatic, hematological, or bone marrow function. Thus, short-term ingestion of 19 -nor- 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione and 19 -nor- 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -diol may result in a positive drug test result without any harmful side effects...|$|E

30|$|Progestins {{are usually}} {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of endometriosis, as well as for contraception and hormone replacement therapy. These compounds interact with progesterone receptors (PRs) to activate or repress gene expression in target cells. Synthetic progestines are structurally classified into two major chemical classes (Benagiano et al. 2004). Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a 17 β-hydroxyprogesterone derivative (C- 21 progestogen) that is structurally related to progesterone, while norethisterone (NET) and levonorgestrel (LNG) are derivatives of 19 -northesteron (C- 19 <b>nortestosterone)</b> that are structurally related to testosterone. Of these compounds, {{it has been reported that}} MPA has a therapeutic effect on gynecological malignancies such as atypical endometrial hyperplasia (Ushijima et al. 2007), grade 1 endometrial carcinoma (Ushijima et al. 2007), low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (Amant et al. 2009), and adenosarcoma (Hines et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2010). However, thromboembolism is one of the most serious side-effects of MPA (Kuhl et al. 2006). Vein thromboembolism is found in 9.9 % of women with endometrial cancer (Satoh et al. 2008) and 4.9 % of those women with uterine sarcoma (Rodriguez et al. 2011). Thus, the use of MPA {{in the treatment of}} these malignancies may be limited.|$|E

Under these conditions there is a linear regression of response on log dose over the range of 156 =n- 500 =m. progesterone. Reduction of the 20 -ketone group or the 4 =n-double bond, introduction of 17 =aor 21 -hydroxyl groups or of an 11 -oxo group into the molecule reduces the activity in this test. Steroids with predominantly glucocorticoid, androgenic or oestrogenic activity do not produce this response. The relative potencies of a variety of synthetic steroids derived from progesterone or 19 =req- <b>nortestosterone</b> have been assessed. The results obtained in this test appear to be more closely related to the ability to maintain pregnancy than are those obtained in the usual assays for progestational activity.

40|$|Consumption of meat {{imported}} from South America, mainly Argentina and Brazil, does {{not result in}} the intake of exogenous hormones. In addition, there are no indications for the intake of elevated amounts of endogenous (natural) hormones. Testing for the illegal use of growth promoting compounds within the European Union is conducted {{within the framework of}} national residue control programmes, based on European legislation. Such testing takes place "on farm" and after slaughter. Most of the tests are conducted on excreta like urine and manure and on organ tissues. However, in case of import only the muscle tissue intended for consumption is available. Systematic testing of this material, however, has been very limited. Consequently limited information on the actual intake by consumers is available. This report describes the results of the analyses of approximately 300 samples of bovine and porcine meat for the presence of xenobiotic and endogenous hormones. None of the xenobiotic hormones analyzed for was detected in these analyses. In six samples of pork meat <b>nortestosterone</b> and boldenone were detected.

40|$|Background: Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum of all cells catalyzes the rearrangement of disulfide bridges during folding of membrane and secreted proteins. As PDI {{is also known}} to bind various molecules including hormones such as estradiol and thyroxin, we considered the hypothesis that adverse effects of endocrinedisrupter compounds (EDC) could be mediated through their interaction with PDI leading to defects in membrane or secreted proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings: Taking advantage of the recent description of the fluorescence self quenched substrate di-eosin-oxidized-glutathion (DiE-GSSG), we determined kinetically the effects of various potential pharmaceutical EDCs on the in-vitro reductase activity of bovine liver PDI by measuring the fluorescence of the reaction product (E-GSH). Our data show that estrogens (ethynylestradiol and bisphenol-A) as well as indomethacin exert an inhibition whereas medroxyprogesteroneacetate and <b>nortestosterone</b> exert a potentiation of bovine PDI reductase activity. Conclusions: The present data indicate that the tested EDCs could not only affect endocrine target cells through nuclear receptors as previously shown, but could also affect these and all other cells by positively or negatively affecting PDI activity. The substrate DiE-GSSG has been demonstrated to be a convenient substrate to measure PDI reductase activity {{in the presence of}} various potential EDCs.

40|$|The use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) in {{the world}} of sport has raised a major concern for the serious, {{sometimes}} life-threatening, side effects associated with these drugs. Most of the CNS effects are of psychiatric origin, and whether or not AASs are toxic to neurons is yet unknown. We compared the effect of testosterone with that of the AASs, 19 -nortestosterone (nandrolone), stanozolol, and gestrinone, on excitotoxic neuronal death induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in primary cultures of mouse cortical cells. In the most relevant experiments, steroids were applied to the cultures once daily during the 4 days preceding the NMDA pulse. Under these conditions, testosterone amplified excitotoxic neuronal death only at very high concentrations (10 muM), whereas it was protective at concentrations of 10 nM and inactive at intermediate concentrations. Low concentrations of testosterone became neurotoxic {{in the presence of the}} aromatase inhibitors, i. e. anastrozole and aminoglutethimide, suggesting that the intrinsic toxicity of testosterone was counterbalanced by its aromatization into 17 beta-estradiol. As opposed to testosterone, <b>nortestosterone,</b> stanozolol and gestrinone amplified NMDA toxicity at nanomolar concentrations; their action was insensitive to aromatase inhibitors, but was abrogated by the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide. None of the AASs were toxic in the absence of NMDA. These data suggest that AASs increase neuronal vulnerability to an excitotoxic insult and may therefore facilitate neuronal death associated with acute or chronic CNS disorders...|$|E
40|$|Background: Aromatase (CYP 19) catalyzes the {{conversion}} of androgens into estrogens. It is in particular involved in development, reproduction and breast cancer. One of its polymorphisms, W 39 R localized in the N-terminal region of CYP 19, significantly decreases breast cancer risk among Japanese women and was chosen for this study. In this work, we studied the structure– function relationships between W 39 R polymorphism and CYP 19 enzyme activity. Objective: To examine the kinetic properties of the mutant W 39 R recombinant protein in transfected human cells devoid of steroidogenic activity. Methods: Expression vectors for the wild-type or the mutated R 39 aromatase were transiently trans-fected into E 293 human embryonal kidney cells. The conversions of androstenedione to estrone and of testosterone and <b>nortestosterone</b> to 17 b-estradiol were assayed by RIA. Expression of recombinant cDNAs was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Results: W 39 R recombinant protein was devoid of aromatase activity whatever the substrate used. This absence of activity was not {{due to the lack}} of expression of the recombinant enzyme since the mRNA and protein were detected. Conclusion: Our present in vitro study shows that the R 39 mutant is unable to synthesize estrogens.

In embryonic <b>nortestosterone</b> treated males {{the appearance of a}} left 'ovotestis-like' gonad was observed. The occurrence of this ovotestis-like left gonad in the 19 -nortestosterone treated male is probably a secondary effect of the in ovo treatment since surgically bursectomised chicks did not show the testicular morphology and histological changes as observed in 19 -nortestosterone treated chicks. Additionally, both male and female hormonally or surgically treated chicks showed relatively enlarged adrenal glands. Hormonal bursectomy affected organ inhibin contents and plasma inhibin, testosterone, and FSH levels in males. Male hormonal treated chicks showed lower levels of plasma inhibin (p= 0. 0001), testosterone (p= 0. 01), and FSH (p= 0. 004), and a lower total testes inhibin content (p= 0. 0003) compared to intact chicks. However, none of these were significantly different between female intact and hormonal treated chicks, again indicating that the observed hormonal changes in males are not the result of the disappearance of the bursa but of the hormonal 19 -NT treatment.

The separation was achieved by using a reversed-phase Chromolith RP- 18 e column at controlled temperature, UV-detection at 245 nm and epitestosterone as internal standard. The method development involved optimization of different aqueous-organic mobile phases using methanol or acetonitrile as organic modifiers, flow-rate and temperature. The optimum separation for these compounds was achieved at 40 degrees C using ultrapure water:acetonitrile (71 : 29, v/v) as mobile phase and 3 mLmin(- 1) flow-rate, allowing the separation of AASs with baseline resolution in about 15 min. The optimized method {{was applied to the}} analysis of AASs in finishing pig feed samples. Prior to HPLC, sample preparation procedure was used by leaching using acetonitrile, saponification in a basic medium and solid-phase extraction using polymeric Abselut Nexus cartridges. Method validation has been carried out according to the European Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The extraction efficiencies, decision limits (CCalpha) and detection capabilities (CCbeta) for these compounds were in the range 83 - 96 %, 27 - 37 and 32 - 47 microgkg(- 1) range, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of hydroxylation of testosterone in calves treated with hormones at dosages schedules usually adopted in illegal treatment. Material and methods Calves were randomly organised in 6 groups as follow, control (C), and treated with estradiol (E, 25 mg), testosterone (T, 100 mg), <b>nortestosterone</b> (NT, 100 mg), E+T (25 mg + 100 mg), E+NT (25 mg + 100 mg). Single or combined hormones im administrations were at day 0 and after 14, 28 and 42 days. All the animals were slaughtered 14 days after the last treatment (day 58) and liver lobes collected for microsome preparations. Microsomes (0. 2 mg/ml) were incubated for 10 min, at 37 °C with 250 µM TST. Metabolites were extracted with methylene chloride and hydroxy-TST metabolites (OHT) were separated according to Purdon (1) with a Jasco HPLC using a C 18 column and ternary (water, acetonitrile, methanol) gradient elution. Elution times were compared with those of pure standards (Steraloids). Conclusions Liver microsomes from NT treated calves produced significantly (*P< 0. 001) lower amount of 6 beta-OHT, 16 beta-OHT, and 2 beta-OHT, and detectable quantities of two other metabolites: 11 alfa-OHT and 7 alfa-OHT, never found in the incubation extracts obtained with the other groups of treatment. The lacking of significant effects on OHT metabolites production in animal treated with E, T, E+NT and E+T it is likely due to the too long interval time (14 days) between the last hormone administration and the animal slaughtering. Nevertheless at that time the inhibitory effect related to the NT treatment was still evident...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{observed}} high selective binding to both the human and rat progesterone receptor (PR) in vitro, three 17 alpha-iodovinyl-substituted <b>nortestosterone</b> derivatives, i. e., the Z-isomer of 17 alpha-iodovinyl- 19 -nortestosterone (Z-IVNT; Z-IPG 1) and both the stereoisomers of 17 alpha-iodovinyl- 18 -methyl- 11 -methylene- 19 -nortestosterone (E- and Z-IPG 2), were selected for radio-iodination and subsequently evaluated as potential radioligands for PR imaging in human breast cancer. Their target tissue uptake, retention, and uptake selectivity were studied in female rats. The distribution studies revealed that PR-mediated uptake in the uterus and ovaries could only be demonstrated for Z-[123 I]IPG 2. The target tissue uptake selectivity was, however, low, with the highest uterus-to-nontarget tissue uptake ratios observed at 2 - 4 h postinjection (p. i.), being 4. 4, 1. 8, and 7. 4 for the uterus-to-blood, -fat, and -muscle ratio, respectively. For Z-[123 I]IPG 2, distribution was also studied in dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) -induced mammary tumour-bearing rats and in normal rabbits. Mammary tumour uptake of Z-[123 I]IPG 2 in the mammary tumour-bearing rat was also found to be PR-specific. In rabbits, higher selective target tissue uptake of Z-[123 I]IPG 2 was observed than in rats, resulting in uterus-to-blood, -fat, and -muscle ratios of 6. 6, 2. 2, and 21. 3 at 2 - 4 h p. i., respectively. In conclusion, Z-[123 I]IPG 2, which displayed high binding affinity for both the human and rat PR in vitro, showed specific PR-mediated target tissue uptake in rats and rabbits in vivo, the uptake selectivity being highest in the latter. Because the binding characteristics appeared to vary between species, a pilot study in breast cancer patients may be needed to decide whether Z-[123 I]IPG 2 can be of potential use as PR imaging agent in breast cance...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{tests can}} be used to screen samples for large groups of {{compounds}} having a particular effect, but {{it is often difficult to}} identify a specific compound when a positive effect is observed. The identification of an unknown compound is a challenge for analytical chemistry in environmental analysis, food analysis, as well as in clinical and forensic toxicology. In this study bioassay-guided fractionation, ultra high performance liquid chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) and accurate mass database searching was tested to detect and identify unknown androgens. Herbal mixtures and sport supplements were tested using an androgen bioassay and modifications in sample preparations were carried out in order to activate inactive pro-androgens, androgen esters and conjugated androgens to enable their detection in the bioassay. Two of the four herbal mixtures tested positive and bioassay-guided fractionation followed by UHPLC/TOFMS of positive fractions resulted in the identification of <b>nortestosterone</b> phenylpropionate, testosterone cyclohexanecarboxylate and methyltestosterone. Three of the four sport supplements reacted toxic in the bioassay or gave inconclusive results and were further investigated using UHPLC/TOFMS in combination with data processing software and an accurate mass database having approximately 40, 000 entries. This accurate mass database was derived from the PubChem database on the internet and coupled to the TOFMS software. This resulted in the tentative identification of several androgens, including methylboldenone, testosterone and the androgen esters methyltestosterone propionate or testosterone isobutyrate, testosterone buciclate and methylenetestosterone acetate. The study showed that bioassay-guided fractionation in combination with UHPLC/TOFMS analysis is a useful procedure to detect, isolate and identify unknown androgens in suspected samples. As an alternative, the use of data processing software in combination with an accurate mass database and coupled on-line with the TOFMS instrument software enabled the identification of androgens and androgen esters in the chromatogram even without bioassay-guided fractionation...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{estrogen}} therapy {{increases the}} risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among postmenopausal women. Although recent data have shown that transdermal estrogen may be safe with respect to thrombotic risk, the impact of the route of estrogen administration is not fully established. In addition, data on the role of combined progestogens are scarce. We used the data from the E 3 N Study, a French prospective cohort of 85943 postmenopausal women born between 1925 and 1950 and followed by biannually questionnaires sent from 1990 (mean duration: 10. 4 years). We identified 984 women with a first documented VTE (199 pulmonary embolisms and 785 deep vein thrombosis). The relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for obesity, parity, education level and time-period. Compared with non-users, the RR for VTE in current users of oral and transdermal estrogen therapy was 1. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 3 – 2. 0) and 1. 0 (95 %CI: 0. 8 – 1. 2), respectively. Among oral estrogens users, {{there was no significant difference}} in VTE risk across all progestogen subgroups. Transdermal estrogen alone or combined with either micronised progesterone or pregnane derivatives was not significantly associated with VTE risk (RR_ 0. 9; 95 %CI: 0. 6 – 1. 3, RR_ 0. 9; 95 %CI: 0. 7 – 1. 1 and RR_ 1. 0; 95 % CI: 0. 7 – 1. 3, respectively) whereas transdermal estrogen combined with either norpregnane derivatives or <b>nortestosterone</b> derivatives significantly increased VTE risk (RR_ 1. 4; 95 %CI: 1. 1 – 1. 8 and RR_ 3. 0; 95 %CI: 1. 3 – 7. 3, respectively). In conclusion, these data confirm that the route of estrogen administration as well as the type of progestogen may be important determinants of the VTE risk among postmenopausal women who use hormone therapy. Transdermal estrogen alone or combined with either micronised progesterone or pregnane derivatives may be safe with respect to VTE risk...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} "SYNTHETIC INVESTIGATIONS IN TERPENOIDS AND STEROIDS" {{consists of}} 3 Chapters Chapter-I {{deals with the}} synthetic studies on the hexacyclic nortriterpene Pfaffic acid 1, and {{is divided into two}} sections. Section-I begins with a brief introduction to Pfaffic acid 1, a naturally occurring hexacyclic nortriterpene, in particular to its isolation, structural elucidation and antitumor activity. The antitumor activities of the Pfafosides A, B, C, D, E and F, the glycosides of pfaffic acid 1, isolated from the same plant is also described. The discussion presents the synthetic strategy developed to construct the AB ring system along with the results of the attempted synthesis of DEF ring of Pfaffic acid 1. The retrosynthetic analysis of 1 identified the key intermediates as AB synthon 2, and the DEF synthon 3, Regioselective hydride reduction of Wieland-Mischer ketone, followed by hydroxyl protection and Woodward methylation gave the dimethylated compound 4 Deprotection of the hydroxyl group and reduction of the carbonyl followed by acetylation resulted in the diacetate 5 Oxidation of the diacetate 5 with PDC-/BuOOH-celite system followed by lithium-liquid ammonia reduction yielded the saturated keto diol 6, which on dehydration and subsequent acetylation afforded the enone acetate 2, which formed the AB ring of Pfaffic acid 1 The synthetic studies towards the construction of DEF rings of Pfaffic acid commenced with the preparation of the indane methanol 7 The alcohol 7 was synthesized starting from 5 -methoxyindan-l-one Thus 5 -methoxyindanone was converted into the hydroxymethyl compound 8 by Wittig reaction and subsequent hydroboration Swern oxidation of 7, followed by methylation and reduction resulted in the indane methanol 7 Lithium-ammonia reduction of 7 gave a dihydrocompound, which on hydrolysis with oxalic acid gave the isomeric enones 9 and 10 in 1 1 ratio On the other hand, hydrolysis of the dihydrocompound with 5 N HC 1 in methanol afforded the isomers 9 and 10 in 85 15 ratio Addition of KCN to the isomeric enone mixture (85 15) resulted in the lactone 11 in 60 % yield. The formation of the lactone 11 clearly established that the major isomer of the mixture has the angular hydrogen and hydroxymethyl group in as orientation as represented in 9, but unfortunately this geometry is unfavorable for the construction of the DEF ring of Pfaffic acid Similar Birch reduction of the alcohol 8 gave the corresponding dihydrocompound, which on hydrolysis with 5 N HC 1 in methanol afforded the isomeric alcohols 12 and 13 in 92 8 ratio Hydrogenation of the mixture followed by tosylation yielded the tosylates 14 and 15 in the same ratio Attempted intramolecular cyclisation of the tosylate mixture with different bases failed to yield any tricyclic compound, indicating that the major isomer has the unfavorable geometry for intramolecular alkylation. The origin of stereoselectivity during the hydrolysis of the enol-ether leading to the formation of the isomers 9 and 12 in major amount, was found to be due to a novel hydroxyl directed protonataon as represented in 16 Section-ll describes a novel oxidative C-C bond cleavage reaction with chromium reagents The alcohol 8 when oxidized with a variety of chromium reagents gave 5 -methoxyindan- 1 -one in good yields. The mechanism of this reaction seems to go via the enol 17, which undergoes C-C bond cleavage to afford 5 -methoxyindan-l-one. A number of 1 -hydroxymethyl indanes 18 and 1 -hydroxymethyl tetralins 19 were synthesized and their oxidation with PCC and PDC was examined In all these cases a smooth C-C cleavage was observed resulting in the respective aryl ketones Chapter-II deals with the synthetic investigations on the construction of the tricyclic ACE synthon 20, a potential intermediate for the synthesis of A-ring aromatic steroids, and is divided into two sections. Section-] describes the literature pertaining to the synthetic approaches towards A-ring aromatic steroids, with the emphasis being a critical analysis of the methodologies developed for estrone. Section-ll is divided into two parts Part-I presents the results of the synthetic studies on the construction of the tricyclic ACE synthon 20 The section starts with a need to develop a convenient methodology for the synthesis of aryltetralin 21 The new process developed for the synthesis of 21 involved a one pot Friedel-Crafts arylation of the 7 -methoxy-l-tetralol 22 with the phenol to afford the aryltetralin 21 in high yield This methodology was extended to the synthesis of a number of aryl tetralins 22 to show the generality of this reaction Benzylic oxidation of the acetate of 21, afforded the aryl ketone, which on hydrolysis followed by benzylation with yielded the tetralone 24 Wittig olefination of the tetralone 24, followed by hydroboration afforded the hydroxymethyl compound 25 Swern oxidation of the hydroxymethyl compound 25 and subsequent methylation and sodium borohydride reduction gave the aryltetralin 26 along with its isomer 27 Both these isomers were separated by column chromatography over silica gel and subjected to hydrogenation to afford isomeric diols 28 and 29 Birch reduction of 28 afforded the dihydrocompound, which on acid hydrolysis resulted in a mixture of compounds consisting of 30, 31, 32, and 33 The diastereomeric isomers 30 and 31 were separated together from the other set of diastereomeric isomers 32 and 33 by column chromatography over silicagel, but the individual diastereomers could not be separated On the other hand hydrolysis of the dihydrocompound for a longer period (24 h) yielded the compound 32 as a single isomer along with the mixture 30 and 31 Part-II describes a new synthetic methodology for the construction of bicyclo[3 2 2]nonanes, During the preparation of the aryltetralin derivative 28, a hitherto unknown double Friedel-Crafts reaction, leading to the formation of bicyclo[3. 2 2]nonane derivative was observed The diol 35 on treatment with phenol and A 1 C 1, unexpectedly underwent a novel double Friedel-Crafts reaction to afford the bicyclo[3 2 2]nonane derivative 36 The mechanism of this reaction was found to go via the aryl tetralin 28 and the generality of this reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of different aryltetralin derivatives 37, by reacting the diol with various arylating agents Chapter-III deals with the direct conversion of 130 -alkylgona tetraenes into 19 -nortestosterone derivatives Birch reduction of 8 -dehydroestradiol- 3 -methyl ether 38 and 9 (11) -dehydroestradiol- 3 -methyl ether 39 followed by acid hydrolysis results in a mixture of 19 -nortestosterone 40 and retro- 19 - <b>nortestosterone</b> 41 in varying amounts However, reduction of the acetates of 38 and 39 with sodium or lithium, in the presence of aniline affords exclusively 19 -nortestosterone 40 Similarly the acetate of 42 was converted to 18 -homo- 19 -nortestosterone 4...|$|E
