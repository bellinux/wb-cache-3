50|$|Early {{windshields}} {{were made}} of ordinary window glass, but {{that could lead to}} serious injuries {{in the event of a}} crash. A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields. The most notable example of this is the Pane vs. Ford case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through reckless driving. They were replaced with windshields made of toughened glass and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or <b>neoprene</b> <b>seal.</b> The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke. These windshields, hovever, could shatter from a simple stone chip. In 1919, Henry Ford solved the problem of flying debris by using the new French technology of glass laminating. Windshields made using this process were two layers of glass with a cellulose inner layer. This inner layer held the glass together when it fractured. Between 1919 and 1929, Ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Up to 168 full rings {{could be}} {{prepared}} per {{week in a}} 24-hour operation in the segment production plant that had been erected at the south portal. For each element, up to 880 kg of rebar were intertwined in about eight minutes and then filled with concrete. With the concrete setting in ten hours, the process was carried out twice {{a day at the}} height of the construction. Then the segments were taken to a checking point by cranes equipped with vacuum lifters. If they passed quality control—the proportion of the segments that failed was 0.3%—the segments were placed in a curing warehouse, where they hardened for three days and were then checked again for cracks. Finally, a <b>neoprene</b> <b>seal</b> was glued on and the segments were transported to a central warehouse. After 14 days there, they reached “B45” quality (capacity to handle 45 N per mm² or 450 kg per cm²) and after 56 days they reached “B65” quality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neoprene</b> <b>seals</b> are {{a tougher}} and more tear {{resistant}} alternative, though {{they must be}} correctly sized for the user, as they cannot be adjusted much. These are much more resistant to perishing than latex. Use of a lubricating liquid such as dishwashing liquid or KY jelly is suggested for donning <b>neoprene</b> wrist <b>seals.</b>|$|R
30|$|There was no {{significant}} difference in fracture rate; there were two fractures in the manual group (5  %) and one fracture in the motorized group (4  %). There were four different mechanical failures in the motorized group: dead batteries, a bent plug, a bent rod and a motor that failed because of torque. The unexpected battery failures were caused by excessively high chlorine levels in the rehabilitation facility swimming pool that dissolved the <b>neoprene</b> <b>seals.</b> All of these problems were diagnosed quickly, the failures were repaired and the lengthening procedures were continued.|$|R
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} drive towards {{improvements}} and achieving success in effective and long term sealing of portland cement concrete pavement contraction joints. A variety of joint sealing products and procedures have been applied in Iowa in search of improvements in seal performance. Hot poured rubberized asphalt products were mainly used for sealing all joints in earlier years for highways. In the 1980 s, silicone sealant products were becoming popular, especially for the major highways. As {{a high level of}} sealant performance was not achieved from silicones in Iowa conditions, other sealing products were tried. Preformed <b>neoprene</b> compression <b>seals</b> are being tried as a substitution for silicone sealants. Due to high costs of materials and installation with <b>neoprene</b> <b>seals,</b> the search for improvements through other joint sealing products and procedures continued. An agreement was made with Phoenix, North America, Inc., to provide and install preformed Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) compression joint seals. The research site was a 600 ft (183 m) test section of northbound I- 29 in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. Seal installation was done August 20, 1992. Seal performance has been good over the past seven years and the seals are still showing no significant signs of decreasing performance...|$|R
25|$|Seals at {{the wrists}} and neck prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against {{the skin around}} the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to sweat and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam neoprene, but are also available in silicone rubber. Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. <b>Neoprene</b> <b>seals</b> last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|R
40|$|Most {{pavement}} {{contraction joint}} seals in Iowa, in general, have been performing {{in less than}} a satisfactory manner. The effective life of the seals, in maintaining a watertight joint, has been only from two to five years. In search of improvements, research was proposed to evaluate preformed <b>neoprene</b> joint <b>seals.</b> The performance of those seals was to be compared mainly with the hot poured rubberized asphalt sealants and cold applied silicone sealants or other sealants commonly used at the time this research began. Joint designs and methods of sawing were also investigated. All evaluations were done in new portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. Three projects were initially selected and each included a research section of joint sealing. Some additional sites were later added for evaluation. Several joint sealants were evaluated at each research site. The various sites included high, medium and low levels of traffic. Evaluations were done over a five-year period. <b>Neoprene</b> joint <b>seals</b> provided better performance than hot or cold field formed joints...|$|R

40|$|All {{halothane}} vaporizers {{tested for}} leakage when turned off, leaked {{significant amounts of}} halo-thane and this may represent a hazard to patients liable to develop halothane hepatitis or malignant hyperpyrexia. The hazard from leaking vaporizers may be reduced considerably {{by the use of}} well-designed bypass units. Circuit contamination by halothane may still result from such sources as <b>neoprene</b> <b>seals</b> around flowmeters, breathing bags and anaesthetic hose which have had previous contact with halothane vapour, whether or not an apparatus is in use. The hazard from contami-nated hoses and bags may be reduced considerably by washing and then hanging in a halothane-free atmosphere for a day. The hazard from contaminated rubber or plastic components of the anaesthetic machine can be eliminated only by using one apparatus without the vaporizers having been attached at any time during its working life. Similarly, hazards may arise from trichloro-ethylene vaporizers and from circuit components contaminated with trichloroethylene. Lowe, Titel and Hagler (1971) have shown that the anaesthetic hoses and reservoir bags will absorb considerable quantities of halothane. We have high-lighted previously the problem of circuit contami...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "welding" [...] of {{cast iron}} is usually a brazing operation, with a filler rod made chiefly of nickel being used {{although}} true welding with cast iron rods is also available.Ductile cast iron pipe may be also [...] "cadwelded," [...] a process that connects joints {{by means of a}} small copper wire fused into the iron when previously ground down to the bare metal, parallel to the iron joints being formed as per hub pipe with <b>neoprene</b> gasket <b>seals.</b> The purpose behind this operation is to use electricity along the copper for keeping underground pipes warm in cold climates.|$|R
40|$|Building {{automobile}} {{bodies from}} lightweight materials using space-frame construction techniques is increasingly popular because of exhaust emission legislation. One proposed method of achieving {{this is by}} using plug and socket joints, which are injected with adhesive after assembly. A method for controlling this process, irrespective of component tolerances, is proposed here. A test rig representing a plug and socket joint was injected with the adhesive and a method for successfully filling the butt-jointed end of the joint found. The addition of a restriction to the joint's open end gave a method of filling the cavity without creating any air gaps. The use of <b>neoprene</b> O-ring <b>seals</b> for creating the restriction was investigated. The pressure of the adhesive at the joint inlet (gate) was recorded (data logger), and an analysis {{of this has been}} used to determine the point when adhesive injection can be arrested and the joint correctly filled...|$|R
25|$|The helmet may be {{of metal}} or {{reinforced}} plastic composite (GRP), and is either connected to a neck dam or clamped directly to a drysuit. The neck dam is {{the lower part of}} the helmet, which seals against the neck of the diver in the same way that the neck seal of a dry suit works. Neck dams may have <b>neoprene</b> or latex <b>seals,</b> depending on diver preference. Attachment to the neck dam is critical to diver safety and a reliable locking mechanism is needed to ensure that it is not inadvertently released during a dive. When using a dry suit, the neck dam may be permanently omitted and {{the lower part of the}} helmet assembly attached directly to the suit.|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} on the premature failures of <b>neoprene</b> strip <b>seals</b> in expansion joints in Iowa bridges. In a relatively large number of bridges, strip seals have pulled out of the steel extrusions or otherwise failed well before the expected life span of the seal. The most serious consequence of a strip seal failure is damage to the bridge substructure due to salt, water, and debris interacting with the substructure. A literature review was performed. Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 specifications and recommendations, practices in the states bordering Iowa, and Iowa DOT design and installation guidelines were reviewed. Iowa DOT bridge databases were analyzed. A national survey {{was conducted on the}} use and performance of strip seals. With guidance from the Iowa DOT, twelve in-service bridges with strip seal expansion joints were selected for detailed investigation. Effective bridge temperatures and corresponding expansion joint openings were measured, DOT inspection reports were reviewed, and likely cause(s) of premature failures of strip seals were proposed. Experimental results show that for a majority of these serious failures (all in concrete girder bridges), the joint opening at 0 °F predicted by the Iowa DOT design equations, the joint opening at 0 °F extrapolated from the experimental data, or both, are larger than the movement rating of the strip seal specified on the bridge plans. Other likely causes of premature failures of seals in the twelve bridges include debris and ice in the seal cavity, skew of bridge deck, improper installation, and improper setting of the initial gap...|$|R
2500|$|Precast {{segmental}} linings in {{the main}} TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, <b>neoprene</b> and grout <b>sealed</b> bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key. On the French side, a [...] diameter [...] deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was [...] below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff - same place as the marine tunnels - not from Folkestone. The platform {{at the base of}} the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary, which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the Foster Yeoman coastal super quarry at Glensanda in Loch Linnhe on the west coast of Scotland.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn open literature, {{there is}} little {{information}} available {{with regards to the}} engineering and technological issues for material corrosion, in relation to high pressure supercritical CO 2 pipeline transport from single point sources, such as the power industry. A typical CO 2 pipeline is designed to operate at high pressure in the dense phase. However, it is evident that although there is considerable experience of testing materials in lower pressure gaseous CO 2 in the oil and gas industry, {{there is little}} understanding of the behaviour of pipeline materials when in contact with impure CO 2 captured either from power plants or the oil and gas industry. In this particular project development, a dynamic dense phase CO 2 corrosion rig has been built (conditions: ∼ 85 bar, 40 °C and up to 5 l/min flow rate) in flow mode, to understand the effect of impurities (SO 2, O 2, H 2, NO 2 & CO) present in captured CO 2 on the pipeline transport materials. This unique facility in the UK was developed via the MATTRANS project funded by the E. ON-EPSRC strategic partnership (EP/G 061955 / 1). The test rig includes different metallic materials (X grade steel: X 60, X 70 and X 100) to assess the corrosion of pipelines, and different geometry components (tubes, plates, charpy and tensile coupons), to assess ageing and decompression behavior of polymeric <b>seals</b> (<b>Neoprene,</b> fluorocarbon, ethylene and Buna N) under water-saturated dense phase CO 2 with different impurity concentrations (0. 05 mol % SO 2; 4 mol % O 2; 2 mol % H 2; 0. 05 mol % NO 2; 1 mol % CO). The dynamic data generated from this dense phase CO 2 corrosion rig will give vital information with regards to pipeline suitability and lifetimes, when operating with dense CO 2...|$|R
