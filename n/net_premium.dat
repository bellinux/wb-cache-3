50|$|When a {{non-life}} insurance company closes {{a contract to}} provide insurance against loss, the revenues (premiums) expected to be received {{over the life of}} the contract are called gross premiums written. Insurance companies often purchase reinsurance to protect themselves against the risk of a loss above a certain threshold; the cost of reinsurance (reinsurance premiums) is deducted from gross premiums written to arrive at <b>net</b> <b>premiums</b> written. <b>Net</b> <b>premiums</b> written is the sum of all types of insurance premiums which a company may collect throughout the whole duration of existing insurance policies minus the costs like agent's commissions or payments made for reinsurance.|$|R
