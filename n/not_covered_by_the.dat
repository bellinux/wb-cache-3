5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|The higher {{authorities}} {{will take}} decisions in serious criminal charges and for appeals. The Norwegian Persecuting Authority {{is led by}} the Director General of Public Prosecutions, which since 1997 has been Tor-Aksel Busch. The director general makes decisions of indictment in cases with a maximum penalty of twenty-one years and certain other serious crimes. There are twelve subordinate agencies, ten regional and two supporting Kripos and Økokrim, respectively.

5|$|Despite the treaty, Henry {{set about}} inflicting severe {{penalties}} on the barons who had stood against {{him during the}} invasion. William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, was accused of fresh crimes, which were <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Alton amnesty, and was banished from England. In 1102 Henry then turned against Robert of Bellême and his brothers, {{the most powerful of}} the barons, accusing him of 45 different offences. Robert escaped and took up arms against Henry. Henry besieged Robert's castles at Arundel, Tickhill and Shrewsbury, pushing down into the south-west to attack Bridgnorth. His power base in England broken, Robert accepted Henry's offer of banishment and left the country for Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the find}} was {{reported}} under the Portable Antiquities Scheme, {{it was not}} declared treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act because single items of non-precious metal are <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> act. The finder and landowner were thus free {{to dispose of the}} helmet as they saw fit. The discovery was publicly announced by Christie's in mid-September 2010; the helmet was the centrepiece of its 7 October auction catalogue, featuring on the cover and six more pages. Its value was put at £200,000 – £300,000 ($309,200 – $463,800). The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing the helmet and making it the focus of a new Roman frontier gallery due to open in 2011. The campaign immediately attracted numerous donations, including £50,000 from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public (it was); a £1 million offer from the National Heritage Memorial Fund; a £300,000 pledge from the Headley Trust and the Monument Trust; £200,000 from the Art Fund; and £75,000 from the J Paul Getty Jr Charitable Trust. By the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched, the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £1.7 million. Behind the scenes, efforts were made to persuade the finder and landowner to agree a private sale with the museum, but these approaches failed.|$|E

40|$|For each {{prime power}} ℓ the plane curve X_ℓ with {{equation}} Y^ℓ^ 2 -ℓ+ 1 =X^ℓ^ 2 -X is maximal over F_ℓ^ 6. Garcia and Stichtenoth in 2006 proved that X_ 3 is <b>not</b> Galois <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hermitian curve {{and raised the}} same question for X_ℓ with ℓ> 3; {{in this paper we}} show that X_ℓ is <b>not</b> Galois <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hermitian curve for any ℓ> 3. Analogously, Duursma and Mak proved that the generalized GK curve C_ℓ^n over F_ℓ^ 2 n is not a quotient of the Hermitian curve for ℓ> 2 and n> 5, leaving the case ℓ= 2 open; here we show that C_ 2 ^n is <b>not</b> Galois <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hermitian curve over F_ 2 ^ 2 n for n≥ 5...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the state}} of the {{relationship}} between the two companies the MS was unhappy being wholly reliant on the Met for access to London and, unlike its railway to the north, south of Aylesbury there were several speed restrictions and long climbs, up to 1 in 90 in places. In 1898, the MS and the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short connecting branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. The Met protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible with the spirit and terms' of the agreements between it and the MS The MS was given authority to proceed, but the Met was given the right to compensation. A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS coal trains a day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. The MS wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas the Met considered this was <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Croatia indicted Božidar Vučurevićthe {{mayor of}} Trebinje and Bosnian Serb leader in eastern Herzegovina {{at the time}} of the offensivefor attacks against the {{civilian}} population of Dubrovnik. Jokić confirmed that he received orders from both Strugar and Vučurević. On 4 April 2011, Vučurević was arrested in Serbia and Croatia requested his extradition. He was released on bail on 17 June. In September, the extradition request was approved but Vučurević left Serbia and returned to Trebinje, avoiding extradition. In 2009, Croatian authorities filed charges against ten JNA officers, including Cokić, Ružinovski, Strugar, Jokić, Zec and Kovačević. They were charged with war crimes committed in the area of Dubrovnik prior to or after 6 December 1991, which were <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ICTY indictments. The charges were made after the ICTY supplied documents collected during its investigation. In 2012, Croatia indicted the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 5th Motorized Brigade and charged him with arson for burning 90 houses, businesses and public buildings in Čilipi from 5 to 7 October 1991.|$|E

We also show that S̃_q is <b>not</b> Galois <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hermitian curve maximal over F_q^ 4, and R̃_q is <b>not</b> Galois <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hermitian curve maximal over F_q^ 6.
