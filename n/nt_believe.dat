5000|$|Not many {{professional}} {{students of}} the <b>NT</b> <b>believe</b> that the Gospels are intended to be straight history or biography in the modem sense. Rather are they usually seen as theologically coloured, written by those who take Jesus Christ as the centre of their universe and who present us with what is essentially proclamation. Professor Michael Arnheim of the University of the Witwatersrand thinks this is entirely wrong; Christians ought to take the gospels au pied de la lettre, and then face some highly inconvenient facts: Jesus did not literally fulfil Jewish expectations of the Messiah and so was not the Messiah; many of the stories about him are plainly false or internally inconsistent; he himself does not exemplify the humility and above all the love even of enemies that he demanded; his ethical teaching is so unrealistic that it was bound to make Christians into the hypocrites that they are.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{notochord}} (<b>Nt)</b> is <b>believed</b> to play {{an important}} role in the development of axial organs. Abnormal development of the Nt has been considered to lead to a variety of congenital abnormalities. The aim of this study was to determine the nature and position of Nt malformation in rat embryos exposed to adriamycin (Ad). Materials and Methods: Time mated pregnant rats were injected daily with either Ad (2 mg/kg, ip) or saline on days 6 - 9 of gestation. Their embryos were harvested on gestational day 13, 5. Serial sections were analyzed histologically with routine Hematoxylene-eozin staining. Results: In normal embryos, the Nt was formed as a discrete axial structure in front of the neural tube and enveloped by perinotochordal mesenchyme. In the Ad treated embryos, the Nt was branched and split into two or three parts at various levels, and become thinner and had vacuoles. Conclusion: Abnormal localization and malformations of the Nt may lead to a significant congenital malformation in associated organs...|$|R

All the NTs show ferromagnetic nature {{at room temperature}} (RT). Better magnetic properties are observed in the co-doped BFO NTs with the value of saturation magnetization (MS) ~ 49 memu/g, magnetization at the remanence (MR) ~ 12 memu/g and coercive field (HC) ~ 103 Oe. Increase of ferromagnetic signature in the co-doped BFO <b>NTs</b> is <b>believed</b> {{to be due to}} the collapse of the space-modulated spin structure. Significant increase in the dielectric characteristics in co-doped BFO NTs suggests lowering of leakage current due to the reduction of the oxygen vacancies in the structure. Strong Magnetodielectric effect (MD), expressed by [εr(H) -εr(0) ]/εr(0) is observed in doped BFO NTs, where the increase of the dielectric constant is noticeable with the increase in the applied magnetic field. The codoped BFO NTs show noticeable increase in MD effect at a lower field (1 - 2 kOe) ...|$|R
40|$|Electrons in atoms possess both {{spin and}} orbital degrees of freedom. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, these are independent, {{resulting}} in large degeneracies in atomic spectra. However, relativistic effects couple the spin and orbital motion {{leading to the}} well-known fine structure in their spectra. The electronic states in defect-free carbon nanotubes (<b>NTs)</b> are widely <b>believed</b> to be four-fold degenerate, due to independent spin and orbital symmetries, and to also possess electron-hole symmetry. Here we report measurements demonstrating that in clean NTs the spin and orbital motion of electrons are coupled, thereby breaking all of these symmetries. This spin-orbit coupling is directly observed as a splitting of the four-fold degeneracy of a single electron in ultra-clean quantum dots. The coupling favours parallel alignment of the orbital and spin magnetic moments for electrons and anti-parallel alignment for holes. Our measurements are consistent with recent theories that predict the existence of spin-orbit coupling in curved graphene and describe it as a spin-dependent topological phase in NTs. Our findings {{have important implications for}} spin-based applications in carbon-based systems, entailing new design principles for the realization of qubits in NTs and providing a mechanism for all-electrical control of spins in NTs.

40|$|Abstract Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small non-coding RNA {{molecules}} (20 – 24 <b>nt),</b> which are <b>believed</b> to participate in repression of gene expression. They play important roles in several biological processes (e. g. cell death and cell growth). Both experimental and computational approaches {{have been used to}} determine the function of miRNAs in cellular processes. Most efforts have concentrated on identification of miRNAs and their target genes. However, understanding the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in the gene regulatory network is also essential to the discovery of functions of miRNAs in complex cellular systems. To understand the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in complex cellular systems, we need to identify the functional modules involved in complex interactions between miRNAs and their target genes. Results: We propose a rule-based learning method to identify groups of miRNAs and target genes that are believed to participate cooperatively in the post-transcriptional gene regulation, so-called miRNA regulatory modules (MRMs). Applying our method to human genes and miRNAs, we found 79 MRMs. The MRMs are produced from multiple information sources, including miRNA-target binding information, gene expression and miRNA expression profiles. Analysis of two first MRMs shows that these MRMs consist of highly-related miRNAs and their target genes with respect to biological processes. Conclusion: The MRMs found by our method have high correlation in expression patterns of miRNAs as well as mRNAs. The mRNAs included in the same module shared similar biological functions, indicating the ability of our method to detect functionality-related genes. Moreover, review of the literature reveals that miRNAs in a module are involved in several types of human cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The central {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to explore and expand {{the use of an}} uniform electric field for orientation and for subsequent spectroscopic investigation of asymmetric polar molecules in the gas phase. The systems of study were nitrobenzene (NB) and the nitrotoluene (NT) isomers. We were able to quantitatively determine the direction of the electronic transition dipole relative to the permanent dipole for these molecules, thus providing quantitative information on the symmetry of the second and third singlet excited electronic states. Transition to the second singlet excited state (S 2) was shown to have a dipole predominantly perpendicular to the permanent dipole, consistent with a localized excitation of the -NO 2 moiety. The transition dipole to the S 3 state for the meta and para isomers was almost completely parallel to the permanent dipole, opposite to that observed for the S 2 transition. The success of these experiments has demonstrated the ability of the Brute Force Orientation technique to quantitatively characterize the transition dipole properties of large molecules. The importance of this technique {{lies in the fact that}} most large molecules undergo rapid internal conversion and slow dissociation after absorption, therefore information on the symmetry properties of these systems is otherwise unattainable. In addition to the determination of the transition dipole direction, we were able to characterize many details of the dissociation process by analyzing the internal energy distribution of the Nitric Oxide (NO) photofragment. The Resonantly Enhanced Multi Photon Ionization spectrum of NO has revealed that the methyl group causes significant perturbation in the dissociation process, while it seems to have minimal effect on the transition dipole direction among NB and NT. All NT isomers showed significantly more vibrational excitation than previously reported for NB. Additionally, the meta and para isomers were observed to have a vibrational inversion behavior for v” ≥ 3, with the higher vibrational levels having larger populations. The higher vibrational levels were also found to have higher degree of rotational excitation. A bimodal behavior was also observed in the rotational distribution of several vibrational bands. A preference was observed for the π lobe being in the plane of rotation of the fragment. After a thorough comparison with relevant literature reports, and based on our experimental results, we present a model for the dissociation of <b>NT</b> isomers. We <b>believe</b> the bimodal rotational distribution and vibrational inversion indicate at least two dissociation channels in which isomerization of the nitro group and an NO 2 photofragment play essential roles...|$|R
