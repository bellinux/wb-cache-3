40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} the prevalence {{and characteristics of}} frequent <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients compared with the general population and evaluate the possible changes with positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment. <b>Nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> can be very bothersome to the patient and bed partner. Design: Case-control and longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Landspitali-The National University Hospital, Iceland. Participants: The Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort consisted of 822 untreated patients with OSA, referred for treatment with PAP. Of these, 700 patients were also assessed at a 2 -year follow-up. The control group consisted of 703 randomly selected subjects from the general population. Intervention: PAP therapy in the OSA cohort. Main outcome measures: Subjective reporting of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> on a frequency scale of 1 - 5 : (1) never or very seldom, (2) less than once a week, (3) once to twice a week, (4) 3 - 5 {{times a week and}} (5) every night or almost every night. Full PAP treatment was defined objectively as the use for = 4 h/day and = 5 days/week. Results: Frequent <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> (= 3 x a week) was reported by 30. 6 % of male and 33. 3 % of female OSA patients compared with 9. 3 % of men and 12. 4 % of women in the general population (p< 0. 001). This difference remained significant after adjustment for demographic factors. <b>Nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> was related to younger age, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, sleepiness and insomnia symptoms. The prevalence of frequent <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> decreased with full PAP treatment (from 33. 2 % to 11. 5 %, p< 0. 003 compared with the change in non-users). Conclusions: The prevalence of frequent <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> was threefold higher in untreated OSA patients than in the general population and decreased to general population levels with successful PAP therapy.

40|$|Introduction Brucellosis is {{a common}} {{zoonotic}} disease which has {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical manifestations and complications in humans. Brucellosis is an endemic disease in Iran. The aim of this case report was to introduce acute hepatitis as a rare complication of acute brucellosis. Case Presentation First case, a 25 -year-old man, who complained from fever, chillness, <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating,</b> nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain, and was admitted to the hospital. Laboratory tests showed a five-fold increase in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and increased total and direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Second case, a 63 -year-old man, who complained from fever, chillness, weight loss, malaise and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating,</b> and was admitted to the hospital. Laboratory tests showed an eight-fold increase in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and increased total and direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient had jaundice at the third day of admission. The results of seroagglutination tests, Wright and 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 ME) were positive for both patients. The patients were diagnosed as having acute brucella hepatitis and were treated with standard regimen of anti-brucella drugs and improved completely after six weeks of treatment. Conclusions Brucellosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis in patients with jaundice and fever manifestations especially if there is a history of unpasteurized dairy products ingestion and life in endemic areas because early diagnosis and treatment of the patient can decrease complications and mortality rate...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) {{is a major}} endemic {{vector-borne disease}} in Southern Europe. We present two cases of VL, both characterized by splenic complications. Methods and results: Case 1 : A 47 -year-old female presented with effort angina, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. The clinical course was complicated by splenic infarction. Although bone marrow biopsy failed to show amastigotes, diagnosis was performed by a fast agglutinating screening test (FAST) and confirmed by a direct agglutinating test (DAT). The patient was treated successfully with AmBisome. Case 2 : A 22 -year-old male who had undergone a splenectomy to treat splenic rupture related to a minor trauma four months earlier presented with fever, <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweats</b> and weight loss. The lack of pancytopenia {{was due to the}} absence of the spleen. The first biopsy did not identify parasites, but because the FAST had been positive, another bone marrow biopsy was performed, which demonstrated leishmaniasis. This patient was treated with the same schedule of AmBisome infusion. Discussion: 1) The clinical presentation of VL can be atypical, 2) splenic complications can characterize this disease, and 3) specific serology may be an important tool to reach a diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Some {{bees and}} wasps have evolved nocturnal behavior, presumably to exploit night-flowering plants or avoid predators. Like their day-active relatives, they have {{apposition}} compound eyes, a design usually found in diurnal insects. The insensitive optics of apposition eyes {{are not well}} suited for nocturnal vision. How well then do nocturnal bees and wasps see? What optical and neural adaptations have they evolved for nocturnal vision? Results: We studied female tropical <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweat</b> bees (Megalopta genalis) and discovered {{that they are able}} to learn landmarks around their nest entrance prior to nocturnal foraging trips and to use them to locate the nest upon return. The morphology and optics of the eye and the physiological properties of the photoreceptors have evolved to give Megalopta's eyes almost 30 times greater sensitivity to light than the eyes of diurnal worker honeybees, but this alone does not explain their nocturnal visual behavior. This implies that sensitivity is improved by a strategy of photon summation in time and in space, the latter of which requires the presence of specialized cells that laterally connect ommatidia into groups. First-order interneurons, with significantly wider lateral branching than those found in diurnal bees, have been identified in the first optic ganglion (the lamina ganglionaris) of Megalopta's optic lobe. We believe that these cells have the potential to mediate spatial summation. Conclusions: Despite the scarcity of photons, Megalopta is able to visually orient to landmarks at night in a dark forest understory, an ability permitted by unusually sensitive apposition eyes and neural photon summation...|$|R

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of asthmatic children with OSA and the symptoms for {{a high risk of}} OSA. Subjects and methods: It was a prospective and descriptive study. The data of asthmatic children including medical history, clinical examination, blood tests, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (NO), and respiratory polygraphy were registered for analyses. Results: Eighty-five asthmatic children {{with a mean age of}} 9. 5 ± 2. 1  years were included. The prevalence of OSA was 65. 9 % (56 / 85) in study subjects. The prevalence of severe OSA in children with moderate asthma was significantly higher than intermittent and mild asthma. The percentage of asthmatic children with OSA who had snoring, sleep disturbance, and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweats</b> was significantly higher than that of asthmatic children without OSA (48. 2 % vs 17. 2 %, 71. 4 % vs 27. 5 %, and 55. 1 % vs 31. 0 %, respectively). The presence of allergic rhinitis and snoring was associated significantly with a high probability for the presence of OSA. Conclusion: Children with asthma have a risk of OSA.

40|$|Nocturnal bees, wasps and ants have {{considerably}} larger ocelli {{than their}} diurnal relatives, suggesting {{an active role}} in vision at night. In a first step to understanding what this role might be, the morphology and physiological optics of ocelli were investigated in three tropical rainforest species – the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweat</b> bee Megalopta genalis, the nocturnal paper wasp Apoica pallens and the diurnal paper wasp Polistes occidentalis – using hanging-drop techniques and standard histological methods. Ocellar image quality, in addition to lens focal length and back focal distance, was determined in all three species. During flight, the ocellar receptive fields of both nocturnal species are centred very dorsally, possibly in order to maximise sensitivity to the narrow dorsal field of light that enters through gaps in the rainforest canopy. Since all ocelli investigated had a slightly oval shape, images were found to be astigmatic: images formed by the major axis of the ocellus were located further from the proximal surface of the lens than images formed by the minor axis. Despite being astigmatic, images formed at either focal plane were reasonably sharp in all ocelli investigated. When compared to the position of the retina below the lens, measurements of back focal distance reveal that the ocelli of Megalopta are highly underfocused and unable to resolve spatial detail. This together with their very large and tightly packed rhabdoms suggests a role in making sensitive measurements of ambient light intensity. In contrast, the ocelli of the two wasps form images near the proximal boundary of the retina, suggesting the potential for modest resolving power. In light of these results, possible roles for ocelli in nocturnal bees and wasps are discussed, including the hypothesis that they might be involved in nocturnal homing and navigation, using two main cues: the spatial pattern of bright patches of daylight visible through the rainforest canopy, and compass information obtained from polarised skylight (from the setting sun or the moon) that penetrates these patches...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{describe}} the incidence {{and understanding of}} early postmenopausal symptoms in rural Xhosa women. Methods: After written informed consent, 137 women were interviewed within five years after natural menopause using the Greene Climacteric Scale.

We report {{the case of a}} 37 year old male patient who presented with intermittent fever, <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating</b> and asthenia. Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography identified pericardial effusion and a mass compressing the right ventricle. After percutaneous drainage of the effusion, the mass was not visible and deemed to have been septations of the effusion. Chest computed tomography (CT) did not show the mass visible on the X-ray. At one month follow-up, the pericardial mass was again visible on echocardiography and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT-guided biopsy showed malignant mesenchymal cells. Complete resection was attempted, but not possible due to diffuse infiltration of the epicardium. Histological examination of the resected tissue revealed an undifferentiated primary pericardial synovial sarcoma. The patient refused adjuvant treatment and died 15 days later. Surgical resection is considered the cornerstone of treatment of this rare type of malignant tumor of the young; our patient presented with a diffusely infiltrating tumor which could not be resected and required reoperation for tamponade and left pericardectomy.

40|$|Abstract — Sleep apnea (AP) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known sleeping disorder characterized by pauses of airflow to the lungs and often results in day and night time symptoms such as impaired concentration, depression, memory loss, snoring, <b>nocturnal</b> arousals, <b>sweating</b> and restless sleep. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), the most common SA, {{is a result of}} a collapsed upper respiratory airway, which is majorly undiagnosed due to the inconvenient Polysomnography (PSG) testing procedure at sleep labs. This paper introduces an automated approach towards identifying sleep apnea. The idea is based on efficient feature extraction of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal by employing a hybrid of signal processing techniques and classification using a linear-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). The optimum set of RR-interval features of the ECG signal yields a high classification accuracy of 97. 1 % when tested on the Physionet Apnea-ECG recordings.

The study included 38 perimenopausal women, aged 43 - 49 years, with regular cycles of 26 - 32 days in length and menopausal symptoms. Endocrine status was determined by assay of basal levels of gonadotropins (LH, FSH), E 2, and P every week until menstrual bleeding, {{before and during the}} first month of therapy. Plasma levels of LH and FSH were suppressed in the first month of therapy while E 2 had a mean value of 45 +/- 12 pg/ml.

40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an {{increasing}} problem worldwide. Yet, {{a large number of}} patients may remain undiagnosed. Dentists could suspect OSA, but little is known about their knowledge and attitudes towards the topic. An email questionnaire was sent to dentists working in Helsinki Health Centre, Helsinki, Finland (n = 226). It consisted of demographic data, items on dentists' overall knowledge of OSA and factors associated with it, and their possibilities and willingness {{to take part in the}} recognition and treatment of OSA patients. Altogether, 70 · 9 % (n = 134) of dentists eligible for the study completed the questionnaire. Of them, 79 · 1 % (n = 106) were general practitioners and 20 · 9 % (n = 28) dentists with specialty training. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (99 · 3 %) and weight control (99 · 3 %) were both generally acknowledged as effective methods to treat OSA.

40|$|Childhood OSA is {{increasingly}} recognized {{to be associated}} with a variety of complications including neurocognitive and cardiovascular diseases. The intermediate link between OSA and end organ damage has been suggested to be inflammation, and both local airway and systemic inflammation have been described in adults with OSA. A non-invasive technique of sputum induction was utilised to show that children with OSA also have airway inflammation, as characterized by a significant increase in neutrophils, and the severity of OSA also correlated significantly with the degree of neutrophilic inflammation (Chapter 7). This finding may lead to research on the use of anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents or antibiotics for the treatment of childhood OSA. Another marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured in a cohort of children with OSA before and after treatment (Chapter 8). Children with OSA had higher CRP levels compared to their non-OSA counterparts, and the raised CRP decreased significantly following treatment suggesting that the inflammatory response is potentially reversible. The cardiovascular risk factors of insulin levels and blood pressure (BP) were evaluated and children with OSA had higher serum insulin and greater systolic and diastolic BP compared to healthy controls (Chapters 9 and 10). These findings suggest that children with OSA may be at risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its devastating consequence. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) The original research studies undertaken were based on nocturnal sleep examinations to explore childhood OSA in two main aspects, namely its assessment, and a better understanding of its complications in children. The gold standard for diagnosing OSA is overnight polysomnography (PSG), which is an expensive investigation that is not routinely available at all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Alternative valid assessment tools for OSA that are more cost-effective are needed. The feasibility of using radiographic techniques to assess severity of OSA was explored, {{and the size of the}} upper airway, as reflected by the tonsillar pharyngeal (TP) ratio obtained from lateral neck radiograph, correlated well with the severity of OSA (Chapter 4). A defined TP cutoff could accurately predict moderate-to-severe OSA with high sensitivity and specificity. This method could be used in clinical practice to prioritize patients with suspected OSA for further evaluation. A locally applicable questionnaire scale was examined for its validity and accuracy in diagnosing children with OSA (Chapter 5). The presence of three symptoms (snoring, mouth breathing and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>sweating)</b> was found to have high predictive value in correctly identifying children with the condition. The question of whether a single night PSG study is adequate in diagnosing OSA was examined together with the assessment for the presence of night-to-night variability in PSG and respiratory parameters in childhood sleep (Chapter 6). Forty-four obese children and 43 age and sex-matched healthy controls underwent two consecutive nights PSG examination. Although a first night effect was clearly documented, a single night PSG study would have correctly identified over 80 % of children with OSA. This finding has significant resource implications.
