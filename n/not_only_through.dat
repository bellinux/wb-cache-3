5|$|In further {{meetings}} held in June 1941 Himmler outlined to top SS leaders the regime's {{intention to}} reduce {{the population of the}} Soviet Union by 30 million people, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> direct killing of those considered racially inferior, but by depriving the remainder of food and other necessities of life.|$|E
25|$|These ethics {{are governed}} <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> the instrumentality of {{physical}} actions, but also through verbal action and thoughts. Thus, ahimsa {{has to be}} observed through mind, speech, and body. The other rules of the ascetics and laity are derived from these five major vows.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the karma theory in Buddhism is merit transfer. A person accumulates merit <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> {{intentions}} and ethical living, but also is able to gain merit from others by exchanging goods and services, such as through dāna (charity to monks or nuns). Further, a person can transfer one's own good karma to living family members and ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Action potentials, {{which are}} {{necessary}} for neural activity, evolved in single-celled eukaryotes. These use calcium rather than sodium action potentials, but the mechanism was probably adapted into neural electrical signaling in multicellular animals. In some colonial eukaryotes such as Obelia electrical signals do propagate <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> neural nets, but also through epithelial cells in the shared digestive system of the colony.|$|E
25|$|The binding of ANP to its {{receptor}} {{causes the}} conversion of GTP to cGMP and raises intracellular cGMP. As a consequence, cGMP activates a cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG or cGK) that phosphorylates proteins at specific serine and threonine residues. In the medullary collecting duct, the cGMP generated in response to ANP may act <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> PKG but also via direct modulation of ion channels.|$|E
25|$|Duke Alexander was one {{the richest}} princes in Russia, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> his landed and funded property, {{but also because}} of the great wealth Eugenia had {{inherited}} from her grandfather Nicholas I. Alexander was also second-in-line to the throne of Oldenburg, as Frederick Augustus II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg had only one young son, Hereditary Grand Duke Nikolaus; were he to die before his father, Alexander would have become heir presumptive.|$|E
50|$|A loudspeaker's flyback {{current is}} <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{dissipated}} <b>through</b> the amplifier output circuit, but also through the internal {{resistance of the}} loudspeaker itself. Therefore the choice of different loudspeakers will lead to different damping factors when coupled with the same amplifier.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possibility}} to explain gravitation {{in this context}} is by using both tensor (of degree n>1) and scalar fields, i.e. so that gravitation is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> given <b>through</b> a scalar field nor through the metric. These are scalar-tensor theories of gravitation.|$|R
6000|$|The success {{achieved}} {{last year}} by [...] "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"--a book that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> ran <b>through</b> many large editions, but brought the author hundreds of letters from interested little folks--has induced me to follow that tale with another, herein presented.|$|R
25|$|During the 13th century, when German {{settlers}} {{were invited}} to Ukraine by the princes of Galicia-Vollhynia, German words {{began to appear in}} the language spoken in Ukraine. Their influence would continue under Poland <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> German colonists but also through the Yiddish-speaking Jews. Often such words involve trade or handicrafts. Examples of words of German or Yiddish origin spoken in Ukraine include dakh (roof), rura (pipe), rynok (market), kushnir (furrier), and majster (master or craftsman).|$|E
25|$|Puck {{suggests}} a secret history of these routes, for unsurprisingly they attracted long extant folk lore, running <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> the physical countryside but also through the invisible geography, the 'mental terrain', of pre-industrial country-folk. Shakespeare's lines leave {{little doubt that}} the physical corpse roads came to be perceived as being spirit routes, taking on qualities which lingered in the folklore of his age and which he incorporated into his play knowing {{that it would be a}} familiar concept.|$|E
25|$|While some of Moby's {{earlier work}} {{garnered}} critical and commercial success within the electronic dance music scene, Play {{was both a}} critical success and a commercial phenomenon. The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> {{a large number of}} hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. It eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all-time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.|$|E
30|$|We {{also present}} a {{strictly}} min-hop (MH) routing scheme as a complement to MHED routing. Min-hop routing is not optimal in delivery time; however, it <b>not</b> <b>only</b> routes <b>through</b> the shortest path {{in terms of}} hop count, but also chooses the earliest delivery path among minimum hop paths.|$|R
50|$|Bakhtin concludes {{by arguing}} {{that the role of}} the novel is to draw the {{authoritative}} into question, and to allow what was once considered certain to be debated and open to interpretation. In effect, novels <b>not</b> <b>only</b> function <b>through</b> heteroglossia, but must promote it; to do otherwise is an artistic failure.|$|R
30|$|Social {{innovations}} need <b>not</b> {{be sustained}} <b>only</b> <b>through</b> profit based social businesses {{but can also}} rely on open source do-it-yourself culture or third party subsidization {{of the cost of}} providing services.|$|R
25|$|As {{a border}} town {{situated}} at the Bosnian-Serb Drina river, Zvornik was of great strategic importance. It is significant because Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are linked at that point <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> a road bridge between the Zvornik urban area and the Karakaj industrial zone, and another one in Zvornik itself, but also via a railroad bridge between Karakaj {{and the town of}} Čelopek. It represents an important link along the Belgrade-Sarajevo line, as well as within the Belgrade-Tuzla line.|$|E
25|$|Hahn {{encourages}} {{the viewer to}} think deeper, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> the use of different physical processes in her artwork, but also through the multiplicity of meanings in her photographs. In most of her work, Hahn integrates humor and irony as she explores the meanings generated by formal combinations. Some of her prints include the sprocket holes of the 35mm negative, which allude to its 35mm film origins: but by hand coloring with bright paints, she {{draws attention to the}} mixture of craft with industrial mediums.|$|E
25|$|Harmonix {{continues}} to support Rock Band 3 <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> additional downloadable content, but by continually updating the core software for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 owners, addressing critical issues and incorporating new features. This has included adding {{support for the}} Rock Band Network Audition mode for Rock Band Network 2.0 (supporting the unique Rock Band 3 feature set), and, due to high demand from the game's fans, unofficial support for the light-and-fog stage kit device previously developed for Rock Band 2 on the Xbox 360.|$|E
50|$|India's highest {{award for}} {{lifetime}} achievement in sports is the Dhyan Chand Award {{which has been}} awarded annually from 2002 to sporting figures who <b>not</b> <b>only</b> contribute <b>through</b> their performance but {{also contribute to the}} sport after their retirement. The National Stadium, Delhi was renamed Dhyan Chand National Stadium in 2002 in his honour.|$|R

50|$|About 10,000 {{years ago}} the Scandinavian land mass started to rise up as {{enormous}} glacial ice started to melt. The lower parts of the valleys became flooded, and so created what we today know as the Hardangerfjord. The valley was originally <b>not</b> <b>only</b> made <b>through</b> glacial erosion but by the high pressure melting water which pushed its way beneath the ice.|$|R
25|$|Pac-Man {{has been}} {{featured}} in Namco's long-running Namco Museum video game compilations. Downloads of the game have been made available on game services such as Xbox Live Arcade, GameTap, and Virtual Console. Namco has released mobile versions of Pac-Man for BREW, Java, and iOS, as well as Palm PDAs and Windows Mobile-based devices. A port of Pac-Man for Android can be controlled <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> an Android phone's trackball but through touch gestures or its on-board accelerometer. , Namco had sold more than 30 million paid downloads of Pac-Man on BREW in the United States alone.|$|E
25|$|Pliny {{ends the}} letter {{by saying that}} Christianity is {{endangering}} people of every age and rank and has spread <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> the cities, but also through the rural villages as well (neque tantum...sed etiam), but {{that it will be}} possible to check it. He argues for his procedure to Trajan by saying that the temples and religious festivals, which before had been deserted, are now flourishing again and that there is a rising demand for sacrificial animals once more – a dip and rise which A.N. Sherwin-White believes is an exaggeration of the toll Christianity had taken on the traditional cult.|$|E
25|$|The venom {{from this}} species {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of several drugs. One is called echistatin, which is an anticoagulant. Even though many other snake venoms contain similar toxins, echistatin is not only especially potent, but also simplistic in structure, which makes it easier to replicate. Indeed, it is obtained <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> the purification of whole venom, but also as a product of chemical synthesis. Another drug made from E. carinatus venom is called ecarin and is the primary reagent in the ecarin clotting time (ECT) test, which is used to monitor anticoagulation during treatment with hirudin. Yet another drug produced from E. carinatus venom is Aggrastat (Tirofiban).|$|E
50|$|Reporting bribes online is <b>not</b> the <b>only</b> {{mechanism}} <b>through</b> which Sakker El Dekkene compiles its information. A hotline at +961 76808080 is {{also available}} for citizens to report incidents of bribery and corruption.|$|R
50|$|The House of Finance is a {{public-private}} partnership. It is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> financed <b>through</b> {{state resources}} but also through private sponsors. In March 2011, Goethe-University founded the House of Finance Foundation {{to support the}} financing of all activities within the House of Finance {{in the areas of}} research and education. President {{of the board of trustees}} of the House of Finance is Otmar Issing.|$|R
50|$|In December 1974, Sony {{attempted}} to standardize their Betamax format by inviting Matsushita (Panasonic) and JVC to license the system. Apparently to their surprise, both companies refused. At the time, Matsushita <b>not</b> <b>only</b> sold <b>through</b> its own Panasonic brand, but was the majority shareholder in JVC as well. Through 1976 Sony was unrivalled in the VCR market, selling 30,000 {{units in the}} US alone.|$|R
25|$|Eleanor Nesbitt, a {{professor}} of History and Religions in India, states that the colonial government hardened the caste-driven divisions in British India <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> its caste census, but {{with a series of}} laws in early 20th century. The British colonial officials, for instance, enacted laws such as the Land Alienation Act in 1900 and Punjab Pre-Emption Act in 1913, listing castes that could legally own land and denying equivalent property rights to other census-determined castes. These acts prohibited the inter-generational and intra-generational transfer of land from land-owning castes to any non-agricultural castes, thereby preventing economic mobility of property and creating consequent caste barriers in India.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} America's entry into World War I had seriously {{weakened}} {{the real estate}} market, so in early 1915 Lane accepted a friend's offer of a stopgap job as an editorial assistant {{on the staff of}} the San Francisco Bulletin. The stopgap turned into a watershed. She immediately caught the attention of her editors <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> her talents as a writer in her own right, but also as a highly skilled editor for other writers. Before long, her photo and byline were running in the Bulletin daily, churning out formulaic romantic fiction serials that would run for weeks at a time. Lane's first-hand accounts of the lives of Henry Ford, Charlie Chaplin, Jack London, and Herbert Hoover were published in book form.|$|E
25|$|Bubbles in {{financial}} markets {{have been studied}} <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>through</b> historical evidence, but also through experiments, mathematical and statistical works. Smith, Suchanek and Williams designed a set of experiments in which an asset that gave a dividend with expected value 24 cents {{at the end of}} each of 15 periods (and were subsequently worthless) was traded through a computer network. Classical economics would predict that the asset would start trading near $3.60 (15 times $0.24) and decline by 24 cents each period. They found instead that prices started well below this fundamental value and rose far above the expected return in dividends. The bubble subsequently crashed before the end of the experiment. This laboratory bubble has been repeated hundreds of times in many economics laboratories in the world, with similar results.|$|E
50|$|Using an EMR to {{read and}} write a patient's record is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{possible}} <b>through</b> a workstation but, {{depending on the type of}} system and health care settings, may also be possible through mobile devices that are handwriting capable, tablets and smartphones. Electronic Medical Records may include access to Personal Health Records (PHR) which makes individual notes from an EMR readily visible and accessible for consumers.|$|R
