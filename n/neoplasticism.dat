5000|$|Mondrian's art was intimately {{related to}} his spiritual and {{philosophical}} studies. In 1908, he {{became interested in the}} theosophical movement launched by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in the late 19th century, and in 1909 he joined the Dutch branch of the Theosophical Society. The work of Blavatsky and a parallel spiritual movement, Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy, significantly affected the further development of his aesthetic. Blavatsky believed {{that it was possible to}} attain a more profound knowledge of nature than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge. In 1918, he wrote [...] "I got everything from the Secret Doctrine," [...] referring to a book written by Blavatsky. In 1921, in a letter to Steiner, Mondrian argued that his <b>neoplasticism</b> was [...] "the art of the foreseeable future for all true Anthroposophists and Theosophists." [...] He remained a committed Theosophist in subsequent years, although he also believed that his own artistic current, <b>neoplasticism,</b> would eventually become part of a larger, ecumenical spirituality.|$|E

50|$|His {{first contact}} with the motorracing enthusiasts started in 1972 at a small Racing Car Show in the Netherlands, {{followed}} by shows in Zandvoort during their Grands Prix there. This is where he received encouragement from Formula One team bosses Ken Tyrrell, Teddy Mayer and driver Emerson Fittipaldi. A 1975 showing at the Whitechapel Art Gallery and a One-Man 1979 London exhibition allowed him to introduce both his motor racing and Science fantasy paintings and which culminated in exhibitions in Venice (Museum of Modern Art) and in Mdina, Malta. From 1983 he became a regular exhibitor at the British Racing Car Shows in London and Birmingham and at the Silverstone Coys festivals and Goodwood Festivals of Speed. In 1998 he had a one-man exhibition at the 'Napier Gallery' on Jersey. The show's patron was a Formula-1 sponsor and was officially opened by the Formula-1 team boss, Eddie Jordan. Since his US arrival, Arthur Benjamins has exhibited in Scottsdale, various Arizona Fine Art Expos. Barrett-Jackson car auctions and various shows in Palm Springs, California. He currently teaches <b>Neoplasticism</b> for the 'Children’s Art Program' at the Peoria (AZ) library.

50|$|De Stijl was a Dutch artistic {{movement}} that saw {{prominence in the}} period between 1917-1930.

While remaining true to neoplasticist geometric rigor, he introduced circles and diagonals.The angles may be unexpected, far from 45°.Between 1958 and 1962 Gorin was absorbed in painting {{the contrast between the}} circle and the linear network.After that he returned to relief. His works were now truly three-dimensional, designed to retain harmony while viewed from different angles rather than as compositions seen only from the front.|$|E

[...] "He simplified his palette to the bold colors and black and white of <b>neoplasticism</b> and reduced his visual vocabulary to squares and rectangles." [...] "Diller developed a highly personal language based on three major compositional themes. These themes, which he labeled “First,” “Second,” and “Third,” explored the picture plane in relation to forms in movement and forms in constant opposition." [...] "By 1934 Diller had likely become the earliest American exponent of Mondrian's type of geometrical abstraction." [...] "In the early 1940s, he began creating wall-mounted wood constructions, and during the 1950s and 1960s his sculptures developed into the large-scale, free-standing, formica works {{for which he is}} well known." ...|$|E
5000|$|Clerk {{first came}} to {{national}} attention in the U.S. {{in the spring of}} 1956, when he was chosen as one of three artists to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art's 9th New Talent Exhibition.

[...] Since the mid-1950s, his work has been included in many group and solo shows. In 2010, the gallery Cortex Athletico in Bordeaux, France, mounted a large show of paintings and smaller sculptures. Called 70/10, the show presented a dialogue between recent works and those of the 1970s.

5000|$|Unlike the Cubists, Mondrian still {{attempted}} to reconcile his painting with his spiritual pursuits, and in 1913 {{he began to}} fuse his art and his theosophical studies into a theory that signaled his final break from representational painting. While Mondrian was visiting home in 1914, World War I began, forcing him to remain in The Netherlands {{for the duration of}} the conflict. During this period, he stayed at the Laren artist's colony, where he met Bart van der Leck and Theo van Doesburg, who were both undergoing their own personal journeys toward abstraction. Van der Leck's use of only primary colors in his art greatly influenced Mondrian. After a meeting with Van der Leck in 1916, Mondrian wrote, [...] "My technique which was more or less Cubist, and therefore more or less pictorial, came under the influence of his precise method." [...] With Van Doesburg, Mondrian founded De Stijl (The Style), a journal of the De Stijl Group, in which he first published essays defining his theory, which he called <b>neoplasticism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Proponents of De Stijl {{sought to}} express a new utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They {{advocated}} pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only primary colors along with black and white. Indeed, according to the Tate Gallery's online article on <b>neoplasticism,</b> Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay 'Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art'. He writes, [...] "... this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour." [...] The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows [...] "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line." [...] The Guggenheim Museum's online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: [...] "It Stijl was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; {{and the relationship between}} positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines." ...|$|E
50|$|It’s widely {{believed}} by most historians that Piet Mondrian, a {{turn of the}} century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend. Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism. In Piet Mondrian's <b>Neoplasticism</b> movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods. Although Mondrian {{is said to be the}} key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with Georges Seurat and Claude Monet. However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as Yves Saint Laurent to create the famous Mondrian Dresses. Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. Pop Art incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution. Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s. The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion. Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} Trifunović’ {{hypothesis}} {{that there are}} three objective lines in the development of modern art was psychologically evaluated. According to Trifunović, in the first line (Cézanne - cubism - <b>neoplasticism</b> - suprematism) the geometrization of form prevails, in the second (Van Gogh - expressionism - abstract expressionism) the use of color is dominant, whereas the main features of the third line (Gauguin - fauvism) are symbolic use of color and reduction of perspective. Fifteen reproductions of paintings that represent the three developmental lines were used as stimuli. The subjects were asked to judge the stimuli on nine bipolar 7 -step scales. These scales constitute the three factors of instrument SDF 9 : Evaluation, Arousal and Regularity (3 scales x 3 factors = 9 scales). Four clusters of paintings were obtained: Abstract-expressionistic (moderate Evaluation, high Arousal and low Regularity), Figural-expressionistic (very low Evaluation, low Arousal and high Regularity), Constructivistic (moderate Evaluation, low Arousal and high Regularity) and Realistic (high Evaluation, high Arousal and high Regularity). The results partially confirm Trifunović’ hypothesis indicating that, besides the formal features, the content (abstract vs. figural) is also significant factor of subjective clustering of paintings...|$|E
40|$|After F. T. Marinetti, {{the leader}} of futurism, theorized parole in libertà (or words in freedom) in his manifestoes, {{numerous}} futurists participated in this verbo visual practice. Although paroliberismo was a characteristic form of expression that dominated futurist poetics preceding, during, and after World War I, little scholarly {{work has been done}} on the words in freedom authored by women and how they might differ from those created by their male counterparts. Women, outcast as they were by futurism both in theory and often in practice, participated nevertheless in the avant garde movement known for announcing its disdain for women in its Founding Manifesto of 1909. This dissertation takes an interdisciplinary approach to analyzing the position of the female futurist and her mixed-media contributions during the years in which paroliberismo was carried out in futurist circles. I examine rare and under studied verbo visual works done by women between 1914 and 1924. My readings seek to understand the in between position of women futurists, which, I argue, stems from the word image duality they employ and goes on to include other intermediary positions such as intertextuality, intermittent autobiography, and concomitant futurist and non-futurist allegiances. In chapter one, I analyze the two volume narrative entitled Diario d'una giovane donna futurista, penned by a certain Flora Bonheur, believed by many to be a pseudonym. I argue that the first volume is a parody of futurism, whereas the second volume is a parody of passatismo. Diario is therefore structured around a chiasmus and contributes to both futurism and passatism. Chapter two analyzes the parole in libertà and the illustrations that accompany Diario. Both the words in freedom and the illustrations function in a similar way and stray from standard futurist practices. Furthermore, the illustrations of Diario, executed by Luigi Bignami, are all in dialogue with the iconography of the popular erotic postcard and are often in conflict with Bonheur's text. In chapter three I look at two examples of women's handwritten parole in libertà [...] Benedetta's Spicologia di 1 uomo (1919) and Rosa Rosà's Ricevimento thè signore nessun uomo (1917). I contend that some women futurists employed handwriting instead of creative typography to execute their free word works in order to reinsert a tie to the literary I that Marinetti had banned from futurism. In chapter four, I look at Benedetta's illustrated novel, Le forze umane (1924), and situate it intertextually with Piet Mondrian's writings on <b>neoplasticism.</b> I claim that Benedetta appropriates Mondrian's art theory both thematically and structurally in her first novel in attempts to alter futurism. The dissertation uncovers the word image strategies women futurists employ in order to find subject positions for themselves in a misogynistic and anti-feminist avant garde movement. In so doing, the contributions of women futurists are finally, after years of being anthologized, examined on their own terms and shed light on the paradoxical position of the woman futurist...|$|E
