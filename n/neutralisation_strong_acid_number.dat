40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} phosphorus-zeolite H-ZSM- 5 interactions, {{a variety of}} phosphorus-modified zeolite H-ZSM- 5 materials were studied in a multi-spectroscopic manner. By deploying single pulse 27 Al, 31 P MAS NMR, 2 D heteronuclear 27 Al- 31 P correlation (HETCOR), 27 Al MQ MAS NMR spectroscopy, TPD of pyridine monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy, and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) the interplay and influence of acidity, thermal treatment and phosphorus on the structure and acidity of H-ZSM- 5 were established. It was found that while acid treatment {{did not affect the}} zeolite structure, thermal treatment leads to the breaking of Si-OH-Al bonds, a decrease in the <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> site <b>number</b> and the formation of terminal Al-OH groups. No extra-framework aluminium species was observed. Phosphorus precursors interact with the zeolitic framework through hydrogen bonds and physical coordination, as phosphorus species can be simply washed out with hot water. After phosphatation and thermal treatment two effects occur simultaneously, namely (i) phosphorus species transform into water insoluble condensed poly-phosphoric acid and (ii) phosphoric acid binds irreversibly to the terminal Al-OH groups of partially dislodged four-coordinated framework aluminium, forming local silico-aluminophosphate interfaces. These interfaces are potentially the promoters of hydrothermal stability in phosphated zeolite H-ZSM- 5. © the Partner Organisations 2014...|$|R

30|$|Wettability of acid {{volcanic}} {{reservoir rock}} from the Hailar Oilfield, China, was studied with crude oils of different <b>acid</b> <b>numbers</b> generated from an original crude oil with an <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of 3.05 mg KOH/g. The modified oils and their resultant <b>acid</b> <b>numbers</b> were: A (2.09 mg KOH/g), B (0.75 mg KOH/g), C (0.47 mg KOH/g), D (0.30 mg KOH/g), and E (0.18 mg KOH/g). Contact angles and improved Amott water indexes were measured to {{study the effects of}} temperature and <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> on the wettability of the acid volcanic reservoir rock. Experimental results indicated that the wettability was not sensitive to variation in temperature when using the same oil, but the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of the crude oil was a key factor in changing the wettability of the rock. The Amott water index, Iw was an exponential function of the <b>acid</b> <b>number,</b> and the Amott water index increased as the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> decreased (i.e. Amott water index exponentially decreased with the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> increase). The Iw value of the core saturated with oil A, with an <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of 2.09 mg KOH/g, ranged from 0.06 to 0.11, which indicated low water wetness. If the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of the oil decreased to 0.18 mg KOH/g, the Iw value increased to 0.95, which indicated strong water wetness. The contact angle decreased from 80 ° to 35 ° when the aid number decreased from 0.75 to 0.18 mg KOH/g, indicating a change towards more water wet conditions. The oil recovery by spontaneous imbibition of water also increased as the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of the oil decreased. As an example, at 80 °C, the recovery of Oil A with an <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of 2.09 mg KOH/g was only 7.6 %, while Oil E with an <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of 0.18 mg KOH/g produced 56.4 %, i.e. an increase of 48.8 %.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{strength}} of an acid is generally discussed {{as a unique}} feature of the acid itself according to its chemical structure. <b>Strong</b> <b>acids</b> have a lower pKa value, and weak acids have a higher one.

However, there are some acids {{for which it is}} very difficult to say, from their pKa values, whether they are strong or weak.
