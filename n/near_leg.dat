6000|$|... 170. I cannot {{arrest you}} to-day by the {{statement}} {{of any of the}} laws of sight and distance which determine the proper depth of bas-relief. Suppose that depth fixed; then observe what a pretty problem, or, rather, continually varying cluster of problems, will be offered to us. You might, at first, imagine that, given what we may call our scale of solidity, or scale of depth, the diminution from nature would be in regular proportion, as for instance, if the real depth of your subject be, suppose a foot, and the depth of your bas-relief an inch, then the parts of the real subject which were six inches round the side of it would be carved, you might imagine, at the depth of half-an-inch, and so the whole thing mechanically reduced to scale. But not a bit of it. Here is a Greek bas-relief of a chariot with two horses (upper figure, Plate XXI). Your whole subject has therefore the depth of two horses side by side, say six or eight feet. Your bas-relief has, on the scale,[131] say the depth of the third of an inch. Now, if you gave only the sixth of an inch for the depth of the off horse, and, dividing him again, only the twelfth of an inch for that of each foreleg, you would make him look a mile away from the other, and his own forelegs a mile apart. Actually, the Greek has made the <b>near</b> <b>leg</b> of the off horse project much beyond the off leg of the near horse; and has put nearly the whole depth and power of his relief into the breast of the off horse, while for the whole distance from the head of the nearest to the neck of the other, he has allowed himself only a shallow line; knowing that, if he deepened that, he would give the nearest horse the look of having a thick nose; whereas, by keeping that line down, he has not only made the head itself more delicate, but detached it from the other by giving no cast shadow, and left the shadow below to serve for thickness of breast, cutting it as sharp down as he possibly can, to make it bolder.|$|E

The three positions grounded to the frame for each leg are stationary. The upper and lower rockers move back and forth along a fixed arc and the crank traces out a circle.|$|R
50|$|The Gannosuke Clutch has an attacking wrestler {{facing the}} opponent, {{grabbing}} their arm, twisting {{it into a}} modified hammerlock and then performing a front somersault while holding the trapped arm in place as well as legsweeping the opponent's <b>near</b> <b>leg,</b> rolling the opponent backwards while the attacking wrestler keeps the hammerlock applied while also holding the opponent's <b>near</b> <b>leg</b> down with their own leg.

5000|$|The [...] "broken" [...] leg (which is {{thrust into}} the air first at {{take-off}}) is always the <b>nearer</b> <b>leg</b> to the bar. Thus someone who uses a left foot take-off (where the left foot transmits the jump force and is the latter to leave the ground) will approach the bar from its right hand side, curving to his left so that the bar approaches his right shoulder. The right leg will drive {{into the air and}} the jumper's body rotates anti-clockwise around the vertical axis to present his back to the bar in flight.|$|R

Her feet were twenty-three inches from the <b>nearest</b> <b>leg</b> of the table. We carefully examined the tapes which were sewed to her sleeves. They were tied, and the doubled ends tacked precisely as described so many times, and to remove the tacks we were forced to use a hammer. It is useless to talk of a possible release of her arms during the phenomena of the cone.|$|R

5000|$|The kata is {{also noted}} for its use of the [...] "Nami Gaeshi", the {{returning}} wave kick. The kick has many different potentials for application, including the sweeping or redirecting of a low kick, a kick or knee {{to the inside of}} an opponent's thigh, knee, tibia, and ankle. It also has the movement training potential for the basics of the sequential summation of movement. Some interpret the move as a low [...] "yoko-geri" [...] (side kick) from naihanchi-dachi to the opponent's farthest ankle, inside-calf, or knee, and returning the kick to the body around the opponent's <b>nearest</b> <b>leg</b> across one's body to the hip and back down to naihanchi-stance.|$|R

50|$|The {{attacker}} {{stands behind}} and {{to one side}} of the opponent. The attacker wraps one arm around the waist of the opponent and grabs the back of the opponent's <b>near</b> <b>leg</b> with their other arm.

5000|$|A cradle is a move {{where the}} {{attacker}} performs the cradle by grabbing {{the neck of}} his opponent with one arm, and wrapping the elbow of the other arm behind the knee of the opponent.
