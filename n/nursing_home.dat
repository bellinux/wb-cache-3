The aim of this study was to explore the use of pain assessment strategies (verbal, numeric, and observation rating scales and standardized questions) in <b>home</b> care and <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. Health care providers who were responsible for the patients' medications replied to a questionnaire. In-home care and <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in 11 randomly selected municipalities in Mid-Norway were included. Three hundred ninety-two individuals were included in this study (70 % response rate) : 271 (69 %) from <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and 121 (31 %) from home care. The respondents working in home care had a higher educational level than those in working in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Pain assessment instruments were not used frequently in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home care. Verbal and numeric rating scales were used significantly more frequently in home care than in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Registered <b>nurses</b> (RNs) in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> used standardized questions significantly more often than did RNs in home care.

40|$|Background and Objectives: We {{sought to}} obtain {{data about the}} {{prevalence}} of dementia in rural <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in Germany. Methods: We conducted our data between 2007 and 2009 in the diocese of Passau, Germany. By using a questionnaire we asked all <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> {{in the area to}} provide information about patients with dementia. We obtained detailed data from three <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> by personal visits, telephone calls and mail. Results: Out of 72 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> 40 provided the requested data. The 40 facilities included in our study house a total of 3, 928 residents, 1, 892 of whom are diagnosed with dementia (48 %). Three <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> provided us with more detailed information. Conclusions: We conclude that the prevalence of dementia in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in Germany is comparable to those rates reported in other countries. As {{there is a lack of}} information globally on rural populations affected by dementia, further international research in this area will give important insights into the risk factors, the variables influencing the course of the disease, and the special care needs of this population...|$|R

The program began with the reporting of quality measures for <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> {{in a handful of}} states. In those states, 78 percent of the <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> reported that they tried to improve, according to CMS. The next step for the program was the publication of performance by <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> nationwide on 10 measures ranging from the percentage of residents with pressure sores to those in physical restraints. A $700,000 advertising campaign publicizing the measures began in conjunction with the release of the data. The intention of the program was to provide consumers with a comparison of <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> while encouraging the homes to get better, according to a statement by Scully at the time. Critics of the program complained that <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> were being asked to do additional work in order to report the measures while they were dealing with funding cutbacks.|$|R

40|$|Switzerland is {{a federal}} State where policy {{decisions}} and implementation regarding long-term care regulation are by rights incumbent to the regional and local governments (Canton and Town Council).

Moreover, long-term care for the elderly is supplied by private for-profit <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> public <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and non-profit <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> respectively.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} cost-efficiency in Switzerland’s <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> an issue of concern to policy makers because of {{the rapid growth of}} elderly care expenditure and the aging of the population. The fact that <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in Switzerland exist in different institutional forms, private for-profit, government and non-profit status, raises the issue of their relative cost efficiency. A panel data of 17 public and 19 nonprofit <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> operating over the 9 -year period from 1993 to 2001, in one of the 26 Swiss cantons, Ticino, is studied. Ticino’s <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> are heavily regulated and monitored by the canton’s authorities. However, given that in public firms there are more bureaucratic constraints and agency problems, one can expect a relatively low level of cost-efficiency. In this paper the effect of institutional form on efficiency is studied using a translog stochastic cost-frontier model. Several specifications are used to study the robustness of the results. The results suggest that the institutional form influences the efficiency of the studied <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in that non-profit foundations {{are likely to be more}} cost-efficient than the <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> operated by government administration. The results also suggest that a great majority of the <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in the sample do not fully benefit from the scale economies. This implies that efficiency gains can be obtained with larger capacities or joint operations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Municipal eldercare is {{increasingly}} multifaceted. First line managers in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services {{are responsible for}} personnel, budget and processes. The resources and work conditions of these managers have changed over time. The first line manager is often responsible not only for economic but also for quality development of their unit. Research focusing on first line management within municipal eldercare is lacking in specific contexts, for example, research on leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services. Aims. The aim of this thesis is to study and analyze perceptions of leadership in eldercare. The main objective is to analyze differences in leaders’ and nursing assistants’ perceptions of leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services, and to study leadership factors and their associations with psychosocial work environment among nursing assistants who are engaged in eldercare. Design and methods. This thesis is based on two studies, and uses cross-sectional data from two different surveys: the Developmental Leadership Questionnaire, DLQ (Larsson, 2006 a) and a Questionnaire for Psychological and Social factors at Work, QPS, (Dallner, et al., 2000). Assessments from 21 leaders and 95 nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services were analyzed in study I. Assessments from 1132 nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and in home help services (n= 844 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and n= 288, home help service units) were analyzed in article II. The data were analyzed with descriptive and analytic statistics. Results. Nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> assessed their leaders to be more controlling and observant than <b>nursing</b> assistants in <b>home</b> help services. According the leaders self assessment, leaders in home help services were less successful at being supportive, being a good example, and promoting creativity than leaders in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Psychosocial work environment was related to leadership factors, but stronger associations occurred more frequently in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> than in home help services. The leadership factors empowering leadership, support from superiors, focus on human resources and control over decisions were associated with better results on all the variables that {{were related to the}} psychosocial work environment in both <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and in home help services. Conclusions and implications for practice. Organisational differences in conducting leadership in old age care must be considered. Some leadership characteristics are better conditions for creating and maintaining a positive psychosocial work environment for nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services. Due to the differences in organisational settings, {{it is important to consider}} the differences in conditions for conducting leadership. To influence nursing assistants’ performance and to increase quality in eldercare in the long term, appropriate leadership is necessary. Therefore, it is important for the leaders to provide support in work, help to develop skills, encourage employees to participate in important decisions, and show interest in nursing assistants’ well-being. Also, the leaders might benefit if they reduce the specialisation of work, which counteracts the possibility to have variation in work in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services. In particular, <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> should benefit if they reduce the amount of role conflicts, and if nursing assistants receive reasonable quantitative work demands. The municipality eldercare should take into account the organisational differences in conducting leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in relation to home help services. Recruiting leaders with characteristics that are desirable in the specific context will create better conditions for a good psychosocial work environment in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services...|$|R
40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To study leadership factors and their associations with psychosocial work environmental among nursing assistants who {{are engaged in}} old age care and to analyse (i) differences {{in the assessment of}} leadership factors and the assessment of psychosocial work environmental in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services and (ii) the association between the psychosocial work environment and factors that are related to leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services. Background Leadership factors are an important element of the psychosocial work environment in old age care. The physical distance between leaders and nursing assistants is larger in home help services than in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Therefore, it is important to study leadership separately in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services. Design Assessments from 844 nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and 288 in home help services (45 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and 21 home help service units) were analysed. Methods The data were analysed using linear regression. Age, gender, number of staff at the unit, number of years at the current working unit and educational level were controlled in Model 1. Summarised indexes that were based on all independent variables except the main independent variable were additionally controlled in Model 2. Results Psychosocial work environment was related to leadership factors, but stronger associations occurred more frequently in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> than in home help services. Empowering leadership, support from superiors, the primacy of human resources and control over decisions were associated with higher assessments on all the variables that were related to the psychosocial work environment in both the <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services. Conclusions Organisational differences in conducting leadership in old age care must be considered. Some leadership characteristics are better prerequisites for creating and maintaining a positive psychosocial work environment for nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and home help services. Implications for practice Due to the differences in organisational settings, {{it is important to consider}} the differences in prerequisites in conducting leadership.
