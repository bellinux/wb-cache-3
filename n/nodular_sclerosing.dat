Hodgkin's usually present in 40-50's with <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> type (7), and non-Hodgkin's in all age groups. Can also be primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma with exceptionally good prognosis. Common symptoms include fever, weight loss, night sweats, and compressive symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, wheezing, Superior vena cava syndrome, pleural effusions (10,11). Diagnosis usually by CT showing lobulated mass. Confirmation done by tissue biopsy of accompanying nodes if any, mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy, or thoracotomy. FNA biopsy is usually not adequate. (12,13,14) Treatment of mediastinal Hodgkin's involves chemotherapy and/or radiation. 5 year survival is now around 75%. (15) Large-cell type may have somewhat better prognosis. Surgery is generally not performed because of invasive nature of tumor.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the ganglioside content of normal human keratinocytes and basal cell carcinomas (BCC). The total ganglioside {{content of the}} epidermis was 0. 098 ± 0. 01 μg lipid-bound sialic acid/mg dry weight. GM 3 was the predominant ganglioside of epidermis. GM 2 and GD 3 were also found in significant amounts. Polysialylated gangliosides were identified in only small amounts. In contrast to all other body locations, breast epidermis showed large amounts of GM 1. The total ganglioside content of <b>nodular</b> and <b>sclerosing</b> facial BCC was approximately 3. 5 times that of normal facial epidermis. This marked elevation of total ganglioside was not affected by dermal ganglioside contamination, because the total ganglioside content of the dermis {{was similar to that}} of the epidermis. The relative percentage of GM 2 was significantly decreased, whereas the relative percentage of GM 3 was slightly decreased in BCC. 9 -O-acetyl-GD 3 was present in the BCC, but not in normal epidermis or dermis. 9 -O-acetyl-GD 3 may be a surface marker for BCC. Furthermore, the alterations in amount and composition of individual gangliosides on neoplastic membranes may lead to novel therapeutic interventions...|$|R

Some of the effects are attributable to particular DRB 1 and DQB 1 alleles, while other effects are best explained by haplotypes marking the entire class II region. The latter effects {{might be due to}} variation in additional, as-yet-unexamined loci in the class II region or to particular combinations of alleles from two or more loci. These data also explain why earlier studies showed HLA linkage but not association, and they substantiate the specific involvement of the immune system in certain neoplastic diseases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Morphologic and histochemical {{characteristics}} were noted for three spontaneous tumors with eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules {{that occurred in}} aged Fischer 344 rats. Macroscopic lesions were widely distributed in the body, mainly involving the intra-abdominal adipose tissue, pancreas, and mesenterium. These lesions were generally hard swellings with <b>nodular</b> and <b>sclerosing</b> areas. Bloody ascites was a concomitant finding. Histologically, the tumor cells were round, from 9 to 30 m in diameter {{with one or two}} round to oval nuclei, and characterized by eosinophilic granules (0. 5 – 2. 0 m) that stained definitely to weakly positive with the periodic acid–Schiff reaction and demonstrated no metachromasia with toluidine blue stain. Furthermore, the granules were characterized by a positive reaction with lectin histochemistry for concanavalin A (Con A), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA-E 4), lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), and recinus communis agglutinin (RCA-I) in all tumors and for ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), and soybean agglutinin (SBA) in one tumor. Positive reactions for anti-rat mast cell protease II and CD 8 were not demonstrated immunohistochemically. Abundant glycogen was noted in the large tumor cells from one rat. With electron microscopy, the cytoplasmic granules were identified as electron-dense homogenous bodies bounded by a single unit membrane. These characteristics {{are similar to those of}} granulated metrial gland cells, but further study is needed to clarify the cell of origin for these tumors...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} or absence of composite nodules, corresponding to recently described structural and functional units in the human reactive lymph node, was investigated in 22 lymph nodes involved by Hodgkin's disease using in situ immuno- and enzymehistochemical techniques. In 10 / 13 cases of <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> subtype, typical composite nodules composed of adjacent B- and T-domains and surrounded by a rim of high endothelial venules were recognized. In association with these venules, a concentrical rim of fusiform shaped Alk Phase+ fibroblastic reticulum cells was observed. Reed-Sternberg cells and their morphological variants were exclusively found in the T-area of these composite nodules. In 5 / 6 cases of mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease, B lymphoid follicles were apparent. No vascular relationship with the tumourally involved areas was noticed.

40|$|Forty six {{lymph nodes}} were {{examined}} with the indirect immunoperoxidase technique for {{the distribution of}} fibronectin and laminin. Fibronectin was present {{in the framework of}} the tissue and the basal lamina of blood vessels, giving a clear outline of nodal architecture. Intracellular fibronectin was observed in cases of reactive sinus histiocytosis, when about a third of macrophages exhibited strong positivity. Mast cells were positive. A pronounced increase in extracellular fibronectin was seen in <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease, although heavily hyalinised areas exhibited only superficial positivity. Reed-Sternberg and mononuclear Hodgkin's cells were consistently negative for fibronectin. Laminin staining was localised to vascular and marginal sinus basement membranes. No cellular positivity was evident. The distribution of laminin indicated a pronounced increase in vascularity in <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease, which was especially prevalent within the dense fibrous trabeculae. In contrast, however, examination of the other Rye subtypes showed a lesser degree of vascularity with numbers of vessels similar to those observed in reactive follicular hyperplasia.

40|$|Several {{recent reports}} have {{suggested}} that nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease (NLPHD) may be distinct from other forms of Hodgkin's disease and may be {{more closely related to}} B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is primarily based on immunophenotypic studies that have shown that the L & H cells in NLPHD demonstrate a B-cell phenotype. In 1989, Poppema reported that the T cells in NLPHD differ from T cells in other forms of Hodgkin's disease in that they demonstrate reactivity for Leu 7 (CD 57). In this study we tested the hypothesis that Leu 7 (CD 57) reactivity of small lymphocytes in NLPHD is an immunophenotypic feature that distinguishes NLPHD from <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease and from certain B-cell lymphomas that may histologically simulate NLPHD, namely T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Using an image analysis method, we found Leu 7 (CD 57) reactivity in an average of 18. 9 % of the small lymphocytes in the nodules of NLPHD compared with 3. 9 % in <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease, 4. 3 % in T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma, and 2. 1 % in follicular lymphoma. Moreover, Leu 7 (CD 57) -reactive small lymphocytes often showed a distinctive pattern in NLPHD, forming a ring of cells around the large L & H cells. While scattered Leu 7 (CD 57) -reactive lymphocytes were found in the other disorders, the percentage of reactive cells and the pattern of reactivity were significantly different in NLPHD. These results suggest that Leu 7 (CD 57) reactivity may be used as an additional immunophenotypic criterion in distinguishing NLPHD from <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease, T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma. The clinical and biological significance of Leu 7 (CD 57) reactivity of small lymphocytes in NLPHD merits further investigation...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} 45 lymph nodes {{involved}} by Hodgkin's disease {{have been examined}} {{by means of the}} unlabelled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method for the demonstration of factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII R Ag). In addition, five lymph nodes showing reactive follicular hyperplasia were studied. In the specimens of <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease, many blood vessels were present, as demonstrated by virtue of F VIII R Ag in endothelial cells. These vessels were present within and, especially, around the nodules in this subtype; in addition the fibrous trabeculae were densely vascular. High vascularity was also a feature of specimens of the cellular variant of <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease. However, the other three Rye subtypes of the disease showed a striking paucity of F VIII R Ag-positive blood vessels. The reactive nodes showed numerous vessels around and between follicles but the lymph sinuses were consistently negative.

40|$|<b>Nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by dense collagen fibrosis. Although transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-fl) is an important bifunctional growth factor for fibroblasts and is stored and released by many cells, it requires acidification to pH 2. 0 - 3. 0 before it becomes a biologically active growth factor. We show here that the L 428 Hodgkin's cell releases a high molecular weight TGF that competes for the TGF-ft cell membrane receptor but not the TGF-a recep-tor. This growth factor is most active at physiologic pH and is 97 % inactivated by acidification. Hodgkin's TGF is also inac-tivated by proteases and can be preserved by protease inhibi-tors. The Hodgkin's TGF can be separated from an autocrine growth factor using either column chromatography or elec-troelution from gels and is shown to have a molecular weight of- 350, 000. Incubation of the Hodgkin's TGF in SDS releases a 25, 000 -D protein with reduced biological activity but which cross-reacts with anti-TGF-ft IgG. We propose that L 428 <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> Hodgkin's disease fibrosis is mediated by a potent high molecular weight TGF-,B which, unlike TGF-, 8 characterized to date, is secreted in a form most active at phys-iologic pH...|$|E

40|$|In {{persons with}} HIV/AIDS (PWHAs), Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (HL) risk is increased. However, HL incidence in PWHAs has unexpectedly increased since {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) was introduced. We linked nationwide HIV/AIDS and cancer registry data from 1980 through 2002. Immunity {{was assessed by}} CD 4 T-lymphocyte counts at AIDS onset. Annual HL incidence rates were calculated for 4 through 27 months after AIDS onset. During 477 368 person years (py's) of follow-up in 317 428 persons with AIDS (PWAs), 173 HL cases occurred (36. 2 per 105 py's). Incidence was significantly higher in 1996 to 2002 than earlier. Incidence in PWAs with 150 to 199 CD 4 cells/μL was 53. 7 per 105 py's, whereas in PWAs with fewer than 50 CD 4 cells/μL, it was 20. 7 per 105 py's (Ptrend =. 002). For each HL subtype, incidence decreased with declining CD 4 counts, but <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> decreased more precipitously than mixed cellularity, thereby increasing the proportion of mixed cellularity HL seen in PWAs. We conclude that HL incidence is lower with severe immunosuppression than with moderate immunosuppression, and HAART-related improvements in CD 4 counts likely explain the increasing HL incidence in PWHAS observed since 1996. With more severe immunosuppression, <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> HL becomes infrequent, explaining the higher proportion of mixed cellularity HL found in PWAs. Pathogenesis implications are discussed...|$|E

40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper by Jim 9 nez-Heffernan et al {{on the value of}} fine needle aspiration cytology in initially diagnosing Hodgkin's disease (HD). 1 Their leading pitfall is the false negative diagnosis because of the scarcity of aspirated material. This happens most frequently when aspirating cases of <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> HD. The authors stated, "Disproportion between the lymph node size and cellularity should raise the possibility of lymph node fibrosis and therefore (the possibility) of <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> HD. " This also has been my experience. The authors recommend, "More aspiration procedures with immediate microscopic evaluation are necessary to avoid this error. " May I suggest something else that I have found helpful? Examine the patient carefully, and if the large lymph nodes are yielding hypocellular aspirates, do not persist in aspirating these masses. Instead, proceed to aspirate adjacent smaller nodules or contralateral smaller nodules. In these locations you will obtain more cellular and diagnostic material. I agree with the authors that better results are obtained when the pathologist performs the fine needle aspiration (FNA). When this is not possible, there has to be close collaboration between the aspirators and the cytopathologists. "FNA selects patients in whom a lymph node biopsy is necessary. " May I add that it also can guide the surgeon's hand by recommending which lymph node to biopsy? This {{is likely to be a}} smaller one that yielded material satisfactory for cytologic examination...|$|E

40|$|Hodgkin's disease (HD) shows rare {{neoplastic}} Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells {{embedded in}} an abundant reactive infiltrate containing, among other cell types, neutrophilic granulocytes. Interleukin (IL) - 8 is chemotactic for neutrophils. The expression of IL- 8 was tested by {{in situ hybridization}} with 35 S-labeled IL- 8 -specific RNA probes on 38 cases of HD. Reactive lesions, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B and T phenotype, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis served as controls. IL- 8 expression was observed in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in 3 of 33 cases of classical HD and in reactive cells in 20 of 33 HD cases as evidenced by combined isotopic in situ hybridization and immunohistology for the demonstration of cell-type-characteristic antigens or enzyme histochemistry for chloroacetate esterase. IL- 8 -positive cells were more numerous in cases of <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> HD {{as compared with the}} mixed cellularity histotype (P = 0. 01). The number of IL- 8 -positive cells and the density of neutrophils were positively correlated (P < 0. 01). In 5 cases of lymphocyte-predominant HD, IL- 8 expression was not displayed. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases contained IL- 8 transcripts only in 1 of 23 cases in sparse reactive cells. In 4 of 7 cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, IL- 8 -specific signals were displayed in S 100 -negative cells. In conclusion, IL- 8 expression in HD is largely confined to reactive cells and associated with infiltration by neutrophils.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and distribution}} of plasmacytoid monocytes (so-called plasmacytoid T cells) were investigated immunohistochemically in 40 cases of Hodgkin's disease. Large numbers of plasmacytoid monocytes were found in all cases of lymphocyte predominance, <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing,</b> and mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease, characterized by a minor degree of architectural effacement. They occurred at the periphery of lymphoid aggregates which mimic the composite nodule of the reactive lymph node and which contained Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants. Despite some immunophenotypic similarities, no further arguments were found to support a relationship between plasmacytoid monocytes and Reed-Sternberg cells.

Applying a monoclonal antibody (PD 7 / 26) to leukocyte common antigen (T 200), we have also investigated reports that the L&H variants in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease are strongly immunoreactive for leukocyte common antigen in contrast to the lack of reactivity of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells and variants thereof in other forms of Hodgkin's disease. All six monoclonal anti-granulocyte antibodies reacted against RS cells and "Hodgkin's cells" in the <b>nodular</b> <b>sclerosing</b> (NSHD) and mixed cellularity (MCHD) types, with strong cell membrane and juxtanuclear (Golgi) staining. In contrast an anti-leukocyte antibody PD 7 / 26 was unreactive with RS cells and variants thereof in NSHD and MCHD. On the other hand, RS cells and L&H variants thereof in the nodular L&H form of Hodgkin's disease (nodular lymphocyte predominant type) showed reactivity with PD 7 / 26 but not with the anti-granulocyte markers. Rare L&H cells in 2 cases of diffuse lymphocyte predominant type showed reactivity with some, but not all, of the anti-granulocyte antibodies. These findings provide further support for the concept that the nodular L&H type of Hodgkin's disease represents an entity distinct from other forms of this disorder.
