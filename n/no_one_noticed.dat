This was the first time Swanson had heard the name of Joseph P. Kennedy, with whom she later had an affair, and who arranged financing for her next few pictures, including Queen Kelly (1929).|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} of bodies was slow. Spanish law required that, {{in order to}} avoid the spread of disease, bodies be buried within 24 hours and remain buried for at least five years. Three bodies were caught in the wreckage at the surface. But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed</b> them until February 23 (a full week after the explosion), and by then vultures had devoured much of the corpses. Although only 19 corpses had been found, the city of Havana held a funeral for the dead. Thousands of people turned out for the funeral cortege and watched as the Spanish military bore the 19 elaborate coffins with great ceremony through the streets to Colon Cemetery, Havana. Another 135 bodies were recovered on February 19. The New York Times reported that this included the limbs of about 10 men. Twenty-four of them were identifiable. Two of the eight wounded (including Coxswain Alfred J. Holland) died that day as well.|$|E

[...] She said she had downloaded the material onto music CD-RWs, erased the music {{and replaced it with}} a compressed split file. Part of the reason <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed,</b> she said, was that staff were working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and [...] "people stopped caring after 3 weeks." ...|$|E

500|$|The bridge set {{was moved}} from Stage 6 {{to the larger}} Stage 8 on the Paramount lot between season 1 and 2, {{and in the process}} was re-assembled {{slightly}} asymmetrically, an error <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed</b> despite remaining that way {{through the rest of the}} series. Other modifications made to the bridge set included redesigned rear bridge stations so that LeVar Burton's character Geordi La Forge, in his new role as Chief Engineer, could have a work station on the bridge, and modifications to several chairs to fit the actors better. A viewscreen was added to the observation lounge and a new set was created to represent the Ten-Forward lounge. The lounge was the final set to be designed for The Next Generation by Herman Zimmerman. He explained that [...] "Ten-Forward became the place where ordinary crew and the officers could co-mingle, and where aliens who were not allowed on the bridge could interact with other crew-members. It was a very important set for the telling of stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1939, Prokofiev {{composed}} his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7, and 8, Opp. 82–84, {{widely known}} today as the [...] "War Sonatas." [...] Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No. 6: 8 April 1940), Sviatoslav Richter (No. 7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and Emil Gilels (No. 8: Moscow, 30 December 1944), they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter. Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev, [...] "having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created" [...] (i.e. in Zdravitsa) then subsequently, in the three sonatas, [...] "expressed his true feelings". As evidence, Jaffé {{has pointed out that}} the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on a Robert Schumann lied 'Wehmut' ('Sadness', which appears in Schumann's Liederkreis, Op. 39): its words translate, [...] "I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales... sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth... everyone delights, yet no one feels the pain, the deep sorrow in the song." [...] Ironically (it appears <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed</b> his allusion), Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize (Second Class), and No. 8 a Stalin Prize (First Class).|$|E

2500|$|The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1989 is the magazine's top-selling {{issue of}} all-time.

[...] The St. Petersburg Times brought the picture to the magazine's attention. Sports Illustrated managing editor Mark Mulvoy responded, [...] "You're the first person to tell me this. Twenty million people have read that issue and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed</b> it. We did not do it on purpose. This was not an attempt to sneak the word into Sports Illustrated. I regret it." [...] The Register-Guard wrote that the magazine was accustomed to criticism for Swimsuit Issue photos being too revealing. The newspaper published an accompanying photo of the magazine cover with the caption, [...] "The SI cover was OK, but page 225 wasn't".|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{followers}} of Swaminarayan Hinduism, Narayana took birth as the saint Swaminarayan due to a curse by Durvasa. The story goes that shortly after Krishna's passing, Uddhava proceeded to Badrinath, the abode of Nara-Narayana. He joined the many divine sages and saints who were there listening to Nara-Nayana's discourses. As Nara was speaking, Durvasa arrived at the assembly from Mount Kailash, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed</b> him because they were all so engrossed in the discourse. He waited [...] for one ghadi(about half an hour), for someone to welcome him with the respect {{he felt he was}} entitled to, but still no one realised he was there. Seeing no one rise to receive him, he took this as an insult and cursed the entire assembly, saying that they would all be born as humans and suffer insults and agony from the wicked. Nara-Narayana's parents, the god Dharma and goddess Bhakti, pacified Durvasa, who then softened his curse saying that Narayana Himself (again, represented here as the Supreme Being) would be born as Dharma and Bhakti's son, and His birth would relieve them all from the clutches of evil. So saying, Durvasa made his way back to Kailash.|$|E

5000|$|According to Wilson, {{the album}} is written from a female perspective, and the concept and story are {{inspired}} by the case of Joyce Carol Vincent, where a woman living in a large city dies in her apartment and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> misses her for over three years, despite her having family and friends. Wilson explained:"The basic story, or concept of the record - it's about a woman growing up, who goes {{to live in the}} city, very isolated, and she disappears <b>one</b> day and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>notices.</b> There's more to it than that. Now, what's really interesting about this story is that your initial reaction when you hear a story like that is, 'Ah, little old bag lady that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>notices,</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> cares about.' Vincent wasn't that. She was young, she was popular, she was attractive, she had many friends, she had family, but for whatever reason, nobody missed her for three years." ...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed</b> it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.|$|E
2500|$|At 2:00 AM on July 29 to take {{advantage}} of the cool of night, Nolan resumed his heartless track south-east by compass. Nolan had wanted to start earlier but a horse went down and unable to move. The men cut its throat and drank its blood. Nolan again repacked what he thought was most important and abandoned the rest. The rode then walked the horses and repeated the process over and over. As the day progressed, the walks got longer because of the condition of the animals. The clouds helped, but no rain fell on Nolan's command on the [...] "Staked Plains." [...] They lost another horse and watched rain appear to fall from whence they had come. After some [...] they rested from their back-breaking labor through the heat. In their dehydrated exhaustion, when several animals walked away and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>noticed.</b> [...] The men were becoming a bit crazed due to the lack of water and the heat. [...] The men were thirsty but could not drink, they were starving but could not eat what they had and now vertigo with dimness of vision began to set in. The men appeared deaf and stuporous as their bodies began to shut down. [...] Men began to fight over the thick blood cut from the remaining horses. [...] Nolan and Cooper struggled to keep their remaining men alive and were as harsh as they needed to be. Another soldier walked away from the command and he would finally find water about 3:00PM the next day or some ninety-six hours without water.|$|E
