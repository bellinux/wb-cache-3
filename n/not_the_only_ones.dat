5|$|Prison officials, {{fed up with}} Stroud's {{activities}} and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth. Stroud, however, discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison's administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife. Prison officials were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> perturbed with Stroud's marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women were nothing but trouble for her son. Whereas previously {{she had been a}} strong advocate for her son, helping him with legal battles, she now argued against his application for parole, and became a major obstacle in his attempts to be released from the prison system. She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937.|$|E

25|$|Soldiers were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> made {{prisoner}} {{during the}} war; civilian populations were also impacted. Historian Annette Becker has extensively studied {{this aspect of}} the war. After the invasion, the German Army started by taking hostages, first of all the towns’ leading citizens. Several invaded countries were affected by civilian deportations: France, Belgium, Romania, Russia, etc. 100,000 were deported from France and Belgium.|$|E

This gave Bragg's men the advantage of surprise when they opened fire on McCook's forces at 2 PM on October 8. While McCook was being pushed back on the left flank, the Union center held strong until the right flank began to collapse.|$|E

25|$|Particle {{physicists}} {{are most}} interested in baryons with no orbital angular momentum (L=0), as they correspond to ground states—states of minimal energy.

This phenomenon of having multiple particles in the same total angular momentum configuration is called degeneracy.

25|$|Various gold rushes {{occurred}} in Australia over {{the second half}} of the 19th century. The most significant of these, although <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones,</b> were the New South Wales gold rush and Victorian gold rush in 1851, and the Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s. They were highly significant to their respective colonies' political and economic development as they brought a large number of immigrants, and promoted massive government spending on infrastructure to support the new arrivals who came looking for gold. While some found their fortune, those who did not often remained in the colonies and took advantage of extremely liberal land laws to take up farming.|$|E
25|$|Over their 10 {{years of}} marriage, the Richardsons had five sons and one daughter, {{and three of}} the boys were named Samuel after their father, but all of the boys died after just a few years. Soon after William, their fourth child, died, Martha died on 25 January 1731. Their {{youngest}} son, Samuel, was to live past his mother for a year longer, but succumbed to illness in 1732. After his final son died, Richardson attempted to move on with his life; he married Elizabeth Leake, and the two moved into another house on Blue Ball Court. However, Elizabeth and his daughter were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> living with him because Richardson allowed five of his apprentices to lodge in his home. Elizabeth had six children (five daughters and one son) with Richardson; four of their daughters, Mary, Martha, Anne, and Sarah, reached adulthood and survived their father. Their son, another Samuel, was born in 1739 and died in 1740.|$|E
