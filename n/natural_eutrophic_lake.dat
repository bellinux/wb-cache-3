40|$|DNA barcoding is a {{technique}} in which species identification is performed using universal DNA sequences from a small fragment of the genome (Lahaye et al. 2007). Biodiversity characterization/conservation {{would be one of}} the main benefits of the widespread application of barcoding, in terms of speed, low cost, reliability, and improved resolution power. In combination with scuba diving, it could become a useful complement for ecological and taxonomical assessments of aquatic vegetation. Here, this method was tested for the first time on plants inhabiting a wetland area. Our objective was to provide a test for future in situ application of DNA Barcodes by evaluating the efficacy of species discrimination under the criteria of methods and natural cooccurrence of the species in the ecosystem. After collecting and identifying ca. 40 specimens, DNA Barcoding was performed using the three most efficient markers (trnH-psbA, rbclA, rpoC 1) proposed by the Consortium for the Barcode Of Life (CBOL). Investigated plants were collected in the WWF protected wetland area “Lago di Alviano” which covers around 900 hectares of ecosystems important for migratory birds as well as many other animals and plants. Among the studied species, many are typically present in <b>natural</b> <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> with Magnopotamion or Hydrocharition-type vegetation in Europe. Two of them are floating on the water, five are submerged, thirteen emerged or living very close to water and five sampled species are trees closely related to water habitats.

40|$|The {{existence}} of strong potential synergies between the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Habitats Directive (HD) is widely acknowledged. Indeed, ensuring favourable conservation conditions for aquatic habitats and species of conservation concern {{is closely related}} to the achievement of a good ecological status in water bodies. However, since these two sets of European laws are generally applied without any coordination, an inefficient use of resources may adversely affect their goals. The main negative outcome is an increase in the cost of monitoring programs for collecting data in nature (i. e., physical and chemical parameters, species and habitats, plant communities). The use of macrophytes as a bioindicator, as imposed by the WFD, may instead help to integrate data on aquatic EU habitats and enhance knowledge of such habitats outside the Natura 2000 network. The aim of present study was to evaluate the usefulness of data collected in WFD monitoring surveys as a means of inferring the occurrence and the distribution of lacustrine aquatic habitats in countries belonging to the European Union (EU). The main aim of the analysis was to identify the depth gradient distribution of diagnostic macrophyte taxa in two EU habitats (3140, i. e., Chara -dominated benthic communities, and 3150, i. e., <b>natural</b> <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes)</b> using data collected in lakes in Lombardy (northern Italy), some of which are included in the Natura 2000 network (10 out 16). While recognizing the limitations of the data collected within the two frameworks, the results confirmed the marked usefulness of WFD data as a means of enhancing the knowledge available on lacustrine aquatic habitats in the EU. WFD data can actively help to improve the basic information on aquatic habitats, thereby more effectively supporting regional strategies for biodiversity conservation as well as recovery programs.  </p...|$|R

In this paper, carbon steel as common material of hydraulic structure was the investigated object, and its early corrosion behavior affected by microbes (algae and microbe) in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> was studied using immersion test, electrochemical measurements and infra-red spectrometry techniques.

Substantial isotope dilution of labeled phosphate uptake by unlabeled phosphate occurred, which implied that the phosphate was hydrolyzed extracellularly in both systems. Comparable nucleotidase activities were measured in the <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lake</b> and Lake Michigan, but the significance of the phosphate regenerated relative to particulate phosphorus pools was an order of magnitude greater in Lake Michigan.

Comparison of this trend with published N: P in lake nutrient sources suggests that TN: TP reflects the source of nutrients: the ratio is high in oligotrophic lakes because they receive their N and P from natural, undisturbed watersheds which export much less P than N; mesotrophic and <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> receive various mixtures of nutrient sources that have lower average N: P, and very <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> have N: P that correspond very nearly to the N: P of sewage.

40|$|Six {{reproductive}} {{classes of}} male Oligosarcus hepsetus (Cuvier, 1829), a medium-sized carnivorous Characiform species, are described based on macroscopic and histological techniques. A total of 175 individuals were caught monthly between April 2001 and June 2002 in the Lajes Reservoir, Brazil, {{one of the}} largest impoundment areas in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The reproductive classes were based upon changes in the testicular morphology and stages of germinative cells, i. e., resting, early maturing, late maturing, mature, partially spent and totally spent. Fish in the resting class showed testes with spermatogonia and spermatocytes along the wall of seminal lobules, while spermatids were present in the lumina of the lobules. During early maturing, active spermatogenesis occurs throughout the testis; in the late maturing and mature classes, the lobules are swollen with sperm that are typical of fish in breeding condition. Spent testes presented seminal lobules with residual spermatozoa, coinciding with decreasing GSI and greatly reduced sperm production. Overall, the testicular morphology and class of maturity development of O. hepsetus in the Lajes reservoir did not differ significantly from those of closely related species in other lentic environments.

40|$|AbstractEutrophication and its {{accompanying}} algal {{development in}} lakes is a nuisance {{and may be}} problematic for aquatic life, but limited algal development may have some beneficial consequences. Dissolved oxygen concentration and pH increases attributed to algae in algal-based treatment ponds may occur in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> and can result in the inactivation of faecal coliforms in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> We investigated the die-off of Escherichia coli placed in dialysis tubes in a <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lake</b> at different depths and locations. The importance of E. coli attachment to algae and suspended matter was also assessed. Algal presence in the lake resulted in significant decay of E. coli. At chlorophyll a concentration ≤ 0. 08 mgL− 1 in Weija Lake, decay rate of E. coli is directly proportional to the chlorophyll a concentration of the lake. Under laboratory conditions, as chlorophyll a concentration increases in light however, an optimum chlorophyll a concentration (0. 24 mg/L) is reached after which the rate of decay of E. coli decreases. These results show that limited algal presence representing optimum chlorophyll a concentration in restored ecosystems may have public health benefits for rural communities in developing countries that depend on raw water for domestic activities...|$|R

In both Lakes, inorganic species (As(V + III)) dominated over other forms of arsenic all the year round. Most of methylarsenic fraction was dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), and the concentration of monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA) was below the detection limit. Measurements of size-fractioned arsenic concentrations in water column indicate {{that most of the}} DMAA was distributed in truly dissolved fraction (0. 45 μm) and colloidal (10 kDa- 0. 45 μm) fractions. Arsenic speciation in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>Lake</b> Kiba fluctuated greatly with season.

On the other hand DMAA concentration was higher in Lake Biwa compared to that in Lake Kiba.

Inorganic, methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic species were determined by combining hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry with ultraviolet irradiation. Organoarsenicals (mainly methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions) comprised 30 - 60 % of the total arsenic in most lakes during summer. On the other hand, inorganic arsenic species (As(III + V)) dominates (about 60 - 85 %) during winter. The occurrence of ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic was higher in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> than those in mesotrophic lakes in both seasons. The concentration of dimethyl arsenic (DMAA) was high in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> during winter; and in mesotrophic lakes during summer.
