40|$|One of the {{problems}} sensor networks face is adversaries corrupting nodes along {{the path to the}} base station. One way to reduce the effect of these attacks is multipath routing. This introduces some intrusion-tolerance in the network by way of redundancy but at the cost of a higher power consumption by the sensor nodes. Erasure coding can be applied to this scenario in which the base station can receive a subset of the total data sent and reconstruct the entire message packet at its end. This thesis uses two commonly used encodings and compares their performance with respect to power consumed for unencoded data in multipath routing. It is found that using encoding with multipath routing reduces the power consumption {{and at the same time}} enables the user to send reasonably large data sizes. The experiments in this thesis were performed on the Tiny OS platform with the simulations done in TOSSIM and the power measurements were taken in PowerTOSSIM. They were performed on the simple radio model and the lossy radio model provided by Tiny OS. The lossy radio model was simulated with distances of 10 feet, 15 feet and 20 feet between nodes. It was found that by using erasure encoding, double or triple the data size can be sent at the same power consumption rate as unencoded data. All the experiments were performed with the radio set at a <b>normal</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> and later a high <b>transmit</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R

However, the <b>transmit</b> <b>powers</b> {{have not}} been {{calibrated}} as the experimental setup {{does not allow for}} such a measurement. Nevertheless, we can change the <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of the UEs by switching between predefined <b>power</b> amplifier (PA) <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> settings, which are denoted by values from − 4 dB to − 32 dB. The PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting of − 4 dB addresses the highest <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> possible and equals approximately a total <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of 23 dBm at a bandwidth of 30 PRBs. Since a PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting ensures a constant <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> density over the complete bandwidth that is allocated, the total UE <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> changes when changing the bandwidth of the UE. In order to decrease the receive power of UE 0 even more than it is possible with the <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> we add a fixed 20 dB attenuator for this UE’s UL transmission (see Fig. 2).|$|R
