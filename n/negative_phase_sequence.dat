40|$|Extracting <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> {{components}} {{from the}} three-phase AC voltages and currents {{has been a}} long standing challenge for protection engineers. This paper presents a novel numeric, three-phase filtering algorithm for extracting the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> components from sampled three phase measurements. The algorithm has been formulated to be suitable for use in a numeric relay to determine either the absolute value of the negative phase quantities or the relative value of the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> to the positive phase sequence measured at the operating point. To demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm, the paper presents results that show that the level of <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> components can typically be extracted within 30 milliseconds following a disturbance using a basic post-extraction smoothing filter. This demonstration used a nominal sampling rate of 1200 samples per second and an automatic frequency tracking algorithm to maintain synchronisation between the sampling clock and the power system frequency...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} blast {{protective}} design {{emerged in the}} late 1940 s and focussed mainly on large scale (nuclear) explosive loading massive structures. In these situations, positive phase effects were seen to dominate and the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> could effectively be ignored. Recently, however, the threat has moved to smaller scale explosives and increasingly lightweight structures. Here, the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> becomes important, however despite this the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> is often overlooked. This research presents a numerical investigation on the <b>negative</b> <b>phase,</b> with a primary focus on an accurate numerical scheme for modelling the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> blast pressure. Numerical tests are performed on deformable targets to determine fully reflected blast parameters, with associated numerical modelling conducted using Abaqus/Explicit. Moreover, the failure modes are obtained for light-weight panel employing the Perzyna model for metallic materials. The computational methods are adapted for better representation of the <b>negative</b> <b>phase,</b> including mesh refinement strategies, modelling of the explosive event and accurate description of the air behaviour. The results herein {{can be used to}} inform blast resistant designers on how to accurately model <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> effects...|$|R
40|$|Ionospheric data {{at three}} South-American {{stations}} (in low, mid and high latitudes) show <b>negative</b> <b>phases</b> {{in the high}} latitude location during magnetic storms. The <b>negative</b> <b>phases</b> in foF 2 are caused by changes in the ratio between atomic and molecular concentrations of the neutral atmosphere. We find that at high latitudes the <b>negative</b> <b>phases</b> are well explained by the [O]/[N 2] rate changes. As the latitude decreases, as the wind influence on the F 2 layer peak is dominant, the propagation of gravity waves can explain short-lived <b>negative</b> <b>phases.</b> In low latitudes, disturbed thermospheric winds can cause time delays in the normal pattern of foF 2, creating alternating positive and <b>negative</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Structural {{response}} of reinforced concrete (RC) elements for analysis and design are often obtained using the positive {{phase of the}} blast pressure curve disregarding the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> assuming insignificant contribution from the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> of the loading. Although, some insight {{on the effect of}} <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> of blast pressure based on elastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) analysis was presented before, the influence of <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> on different types of resistance functions of SDOF models and on realistic finite element analysis has not been explored. In this study, the effects of inclusion of pulse <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> on structural {{response of}} RC elements from SDOF analysis and from more detailed finite element analysis have been investigated. Investigation of SDOF part has been conducted using MATLAB code that utilizes non-linear resistance functions of SDOF model. Detailed numerical investigation using finite element code DIANA was conducted on the significance of the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> on structural response. In the FE model, different support stiffness was used to explore the effect of support stiffness on the structural response due to blast <b>negative</b> <b>phase.</b> Results from SDOF and FE analyses present specific situations where the effect of large <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> was found to be significant on the structural response of RC elements...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} method is demonstrated {{which allows the}} level of <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> (NPS) voltage at a busbar to be expressed as a sum of phasors representing independent sources. The method is extended to enable the balancing capability of Static Var Compensators (SVCs) with individual phase voltage control to be assessed. The capability of such SVCs and the allowable levels of NPS voltage on the system, including any short term limits, can be combined in a capability chart showing the unbalanced loads which can be supplied from a substation. The approach facilitates the treatment of fixed unbalances due to filters or intentional offsets designed to maximise the SVC balancing range for specific loads.

There are different types of generator protection which are existing in actual field like reverse power protection, stator and rotor earth fault protection, <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> protection, over current protection, over voltage protection etc. To give a feel and exposure of these protections, hardware simulation is implemented. Protections against six faults and abnormalities have been simulated. This simulation panel has been practically built at the Power System Laboratory of BVM Engineering College, Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat. In this project, we are using contactor instead of circuit breaker. For the protection, we have used electromagnetic and static relays.

40|$|Waves {{propagating}} inwardly to {{the wave}} source are called antiwaves which have <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> velocity. In this paper {{the phenomenon of}} <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> velocity in oscillatory systems is studied {{on the basis of}} periodically paced complex Ginzbug-Laundau equation (CGLE). We figure out a clear physical picture on the <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> velocity of these pacing induced waves. This picture tells us that the competition between the frequency ω_out of the pacing induced waves with the natural frequency ω_ 0 of the oscillatory medium is the key point responsible for the emergence of <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> velocity and the corresponding antiwaves. ω_outω_ 0 > 0 and |ω_out|<|ω_ 0 | are the criterions for the waves with <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> velocity. This criterion is general for one and high dimensional CGLE and for general oscillatory models. Our understanding of antiwaves predicts that no antispirals and waves with <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> velocity can be observed in excitable media...|$|R

40|$|Left turn <b>phase</b> <b>sequences</b> {{has long}} been a {{discussion}} item for traffic engineers. Every traffic engineer has a preference in the application of the left turn <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> at signalized intersections. Leading left turn <b>phasing</b> <b>sequence</b> is the popular application in {{the country as a whole}} due to issues related to driver expectancy. Driver expectancy is an essential factor in the decision for the use of such signal phasing operation. Violation to driver expectancy will normally lead to safety implications at signalized intersections. Some agencies as a policy implement leading left turn <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> due to this very same reason. Very few agencies mix the application of leading and lagging left turning <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> at different intersections within the jurisdiction.

The {{control of a}} general load by a binary weighted switched capacitor system is discussed in this paper along with a simple control scheme where the capacitor bank across a line pair is adjusted to control the fundamental voltage magnitude for that line pair. In a three-phase three-wire system, it is shown that an ideal reactive source can control positive sequence magnitude and cancel any <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> terms.

40|$|As {{power system}} {{interconnection}} becomes more prevalent, {{there has been}} an increase in use of thyristor controlled shunt connected compensation devices for dynamic power system compensation and power transmission capacity increase. A Static Var Compensator (SVC) functions as a variable reactance capable of operating in both the inductive and capacitive region as required on a cycle by cycle basis to provide compensation at the point of connection to the power system. Voltage regulation is the operational objective of most SVCs. Therefore, transient response of SVC control systems impacts overall power system performance and inappropriate settings may lead to voltage instability. SVCs are also commonly used to convert single phase load into balanced three phase load, thereby reducing <b>negative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> voltages and currents within the power transmission system. As most load balancing SVCs are consistently operated to their capacity, removal from service to apply and test control system setting changes impacts system regulation and stability. Therefore, model development of a load balancing type SVC control system to predict response to setting changes may provide an alternative to lengthy outages of SVC plant. This paper examines the theoretical basis of thyristor controlled shunt compensation, establishing conditions for voltage support and unbalanced load compensation. Load balancing type SVC control system model development and validation is documented...|$|E

The phase {{transition}} behaviour of three homologous discotic mesogens, the hexa‐n‐alkoxyanthraquinones HOAQ(n), n indicating {{the number of}} carbon atoms in the alkoxy group, was investigated under hydrostatic pressures up to 500 [*]MPa using a high pressure differential thermal analyser. The T vs. P phase diagrams of HOAQ(6), HOAQ(8) and HOAQ(9) were constructed for solution‐ (Cr 0) and melt‐crystallized (Cr 1) samples of the compounds. HOAQ(6) shows the reversible Cr 0 –rectangular columnar phase (Colr) –hexagonal columnar phase (Colh) –isotropic liquid (I) <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> at atmospheric pressure. The stable Colr phase of HOAQ(6) has a decreased temperature range with increasing pressure and then the Colr phase disappears under pressures above about 350 [*]MPa; instead the Cr 0 –Colh–I <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> is exhibited. For HOAQ(8), the solution‐grown sample exhibits the stable Cr 0 –Colh–I <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> at atmospheric pressure. Applying pressure to the solution‐grown sample induces {{the formation of the}} stable Colr phase in the pressure region between 10 and 350 [*]MPa, leading to the Cr 0 –Colr–Colh–I <b>phase</b> <b>sequence.</b> The pressure‐induced Colr phase disappears under higher pressures.
