50|$|The {{neutron flux}} is a {{quantity}} used in nuclear reactor physics {{corresponding to the}} total length travelled by all neutrons per unit time and volume, or nearly equivalently number of neutrons travelling through a unit area in unit time.

5000|$|While nuclear {{reactors}} are usually in sturdy housings, {{it was not}} immediately realized that long-term neutron bombardment can embrittle steel. When, for example, ex-Soviet submarine reactors are not given full maintenance or decommissioning, there is a cumulative hazard that steel in the containment, or piping that can reach the core, might lose strength and break. Understanding those effects {{as a function of}} radiation type and density can help predict when poorly maintained nuclear facilities might become orders of magnitude more hazardous. [...] "During power operations of light-water-cooled, pressurized water nuclear power reactors, radiation-induced embrittlement will degrade certain mechanical properties important to maintaining the structural integrity of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). Specifically, fast-neutron (E > 1 MeV) radiation-induced embrittlement of the RPV steel could lead to a compromise of the vessel integrity, under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure, through a reduction in the steel’s fracture toughness. This so-called fast-neutron embrittlement is a complex function of many factors including the <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence,</b> the neutron energy spectrum, and the chemical composition of the steel. Additional factors may also come into play, such as the neutron fluence-rate, whose effects have not been fully investigated. Because of the obvious safety implications brought about by a potential breach in the pressure vessel’s integrity, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) has issued requirements designed to help ensure that the structural integrity of the reactor pressure vessel is preserved." [...] The requirements of this objective, however, assume that the reactor was built to stringent safety factors.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the radiation damage of imaging systems is based on all different types of analogue/digital cameras with uncooled as well as actively cooled image sensors in the VIS/NIR/MWIR spectral ranges. The Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code {{has been used to}} determine the <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> at different camera locations in JET. An explicit link between the sensor damage and the <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> has been observed. Sensors show an increased dark-current and increased numbers of hot-pixels.

Such levels of fluence will be reached after ≈ 14 - 22 ELMy H-mode pulses during the future D-T campaign. Furthermore, dynamical noise seen as a random pattern of bright pixels was observed in the presence of hard radiation (neutrons and gammas). Failure of the digital electronics inside the cameras as well as of industrial controllers is observed beyond a <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> of about ∼ 4 × 109 neutrons/cm 2.

3000|$|To {{irradiate}} the tumors implanted {{into the}} left hind legs of mice, a device made of acrylic resin and capable of holding 12 mice was used, and the tumor-bearing mice were irradiated with a reactor neutron beam at a power of 1 MW at KUR or γ-rays after being fixed in position with adhesive tape. A lithium fluoride (LiF) thermoplastic shield was employed to avoid irradiating other body parts except implanted solid tumors. Neutron irradiation was performed using a reactor neutron beam with a cadmium ratio of 9.4. The <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> was measured from the radioactivation of gold foil at both {{the front and back}} of the tumors. Since the tumors were small and located just beneath the surface, the <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> was assumed to decrease linearly from the front to back of the tumors. Thus, we used the average <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> determined from the values measured at the front and back. Contaminating γ-rays, including secondary γ-rays, doses were measured with a thermoluminescence dosimeter (TLD) powder {{at the back of the}} tumors.

The <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> is one of the crucial parameters for Oklo reactors. Several approaches to its determination were elaborated in the past. We consider whether it possible to use the present isotopic La 138 / 139 data for RZ 10 as an additional indicator of neutron fluences in the active cores of the reactors. We calculate the dependence of the Oklo La 138 abundance on <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> and elemental lanthanum concentration. The <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence</b> in RZ 10 can be deduced from lanthanum isotopic data, but requires reliable data on the primordial elemental abundance.

Transmutation detectors TMD could be a solution in this case. The transmutation detectors are materials in which stable or long-lived nuclides are produced by nuclear reactions with neutrons.

The {{idea of the}} second method consists in the measurement of the reverse dark current increase, which is linearly proportional to <b>neutron</b> <b>fluence,</b> induced by the fast neutron irradiation in planar silicon detectors.

The baseline design options, temperature profiles, and materials of construction discussed here are based on historical designs as well as modern convertors operating at lower power levels. This notional design indicates convertors primarily made of metallic components that experience minimal change in mechanical properties for fast <b>neutron</b> <b>fluences</b> less than 10 (sup 20) neutrons per square centimeter.
