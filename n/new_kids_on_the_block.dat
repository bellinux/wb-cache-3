25|$|In 1989, Manchester-based Nigel Martin-Smith {{sought to}} create a British male vocal singing group {{modelled}} on <b>New</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Block.</b> Martin-Smith's vision, however, was a teen-orientated group that would appeal {{to more than one}} demographic segment of the music industry. Martin-Smith was introduced to young singer-songwriter Gary Barlow, who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15. Impressed with Barlow's catalogue of self-written material, Martin-Smith decided to build his new-look boy band around Barlow's musical abilities. A campaign to audition young men with abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990. At 22, Howard Donald was one of the oldest to audition, but he was chosen after he got time off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process. Prior to auditioning, Jason Orange had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme The Hit Man and Her. Martin-Smith also selected 18-year-old bank employee Mark Owen and finally 16-year-old Robbie Williams to round out the group, which initially went by the name Kick It.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} {{the first batch}} of originals in 1990, Yankovic focused his attention on parodies. By early 1991, only three parodies had been recorded.

In fact, several cartons of promo singles were pressed, but they were deleted from the record company's catalogue at the last minute. These CDs were later discovered by Yankovic and his drummer, Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz, in a trash heap and have since become collector's items. [...] "The Plumbing Song," [...] a double parody of Milli Vanilli's hit singles [...] "Baby Don't Forget My Number" [...] and [...] "Blame It on the Rain" [...] was also recorded. In a 1992 interview with Dr. Demento, Yankovic said that he believed the parody to be [...] "kind of redundant" [...] {{at that point in}} time, given the lip-synching scandal that had effectively destroyed the band almost two years prior. In reference to this scandal, Yankovic also jokingly affirmed that he did indeed sing lead vocals on his parody.|$|E
