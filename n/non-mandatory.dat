25|$|Following the Cultural Revolution in China, some Xing Yi forms {{have been}} adapted {{to fit the}} needs of modern {{practitioners}} of the competitive sport of Wushu. This meant that various movement forms from the art were adapted to a competitive format, in which the emphasis was put on aesthetics and flowery movements, rather than on fighting. The style is nonetheless relatively rare in wushu competitions because all wushu practitioners must compete in several mandatory events, which make Xing Yi, a <b>non-mandatory</b> art, a secondary priority in wushu competitive circles.|$|E
25|$|Teams are {{expected}} to keep the Race fanny pack containing their cash, passports, clues, and other documents with them at all times.

Teams may check in after losing or abandoning any <b>non-mandatory</b> items (e.g., items of clothing), but they must continue the race without them.|$|E
25|$|Indiana's income {{had been}} {{problematic}} {{in the two}} decades preceding Whitcomb's term and had necessitated major tax increases to fund the growing budget. Whitcomb had committed to not increasing the tax burden on the state in his campaign, but the state was not permitted to take on debt and was in need to growing its reserve funds. To increase the budget surplus, Whitcomb embarked {{on a number of}} cost reduction measures that required no legislative support. He created by executive order a commission of sixty business leaders to examine the entire operation of the state government and recommend changes to improve its operational efficiency. He used their findings to alter work flows that resulted in an annual savings of $12 million. They also made recommendations that would improve the efficiency of state taxes through better auditing techniques that once implemented raised state revenue by 8%. Additional savings were realized when because of the vastly improved government efficiency, less staff was needed to complete the work allowing the state to cut its workforce by 10%. Whitcomb also saved money by withholding <b>non-mandatory</b> pay raises for most state employees.|$|E
500|$|Catmull and Lasseter {{also brought}} to Feature Animation the Pixar {{model of a}} [...] "filmmaker-driven studio" [...] {{as opposed to an}} [...] "executive-driven studio"; they {{abolished}} Disney's prior system of requiring directors to respond to [...] "mandatory" [...] notes from development executives ranking above the producers in favor of a system roughly analogous to peer review, in which <b>non-mandatory</b> notes come primarily from fellow producers, directors, and writers. Most of the layers of [...] "gatekeepers" [...] (midlevel executives) were stripped away, and Lasseter established a routine of personally meeting weekly with filmmakers on all projects {{in the last year of}} production and delivering feedback on the spot. The studio's team of top creatives who work together closely on the development of its films is known as the Disney Story Trust; it is somewhat similar to the Pixar Braintrust, but its meetings are reportedly [...] "more polite" [...] than those of its Pixar counterpart.|$|E
