40|$|Abstract: <b>Needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{is the key}} {{component}} of diesel engine cylinder. Changing the nozzle Orifice chamferinging will influence the flow coefficient and spray performance. Firstly, we proposed a physical model of abrasive flow field inside the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> based on computational fluid dynamics technology. Then, we set the computing method and boundary type. Finally, we simulated the abrasive flow field using fluent software. The result is useful for guidance in the actual grinding process. Intrudction As the highest thermal efficiency power machinery, diesel engine has been widely used in transportation, engineering machinery, mining machinery and agricultural machinery, and so on. Diesel performance primarily depends {{on the merits of}} its injection system performance. <b>Needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{as one of the most}} important components in injection system, it will directly affect the performance of the injection system 0. Chamferinging on the orifice can greatly improve the flow coefficient and the flow velocity of diesel in grinding 0. But, the relationship between the size of chamferinging and the increment of orifice flow coefficient is not clear. Besides, it is difficult to measure the size of orifice chamferinging because it is inside the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> and the diameter of <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> is small. As a result, this dissertation utilizes the software fluent to simulate and analyze the flow field in <b>needle</b> <b>valve,</b> and confirms the impact of orifice chamfering on the injection performance. It is significant to guide the actual grinding.

Such valves have been called by various names such as regulating, throttling, metering, or <b>needle</b> <b>valves.</b> For example, <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> have elongated conically-tapered discs and matching seats for fine flow control.

A <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> degrader was modified to include partial recirculation of degraded fuel and heat addition in the bypass loop.

At fuel temperatures below - 20 C, degradation becomes increasingly difficult and a single pass technique results in unacceptable filtration performance.
