25|$|The Estonian {{literary}} tradition started by Kreutzwald continued with Koidula but whereas The Bard of Viru tried {{to imitate the}} regivärss folk traditions of ancient Estonian, Koidula wrote (mostly) in modern, Western European end-rhyming metres that had, by the mid 19th century, become the dominant form. This made Koidula's poetry much more accessible to the popular reader. But the major importance of Koidula lays <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> her preferred form of verse but in her potent use of the Estonian language. Estonian was, still, in the 1860s, in a German dominated Baltic province of Imperial Russia, {{the language of the}} oppressed indigenous peasantry. It was still the subject of orthographical bickering, still used in the main for predominantly patronising educationalist or religious texts, practical advice to farmers or cheap and cheerful popular story telling. Koidula successfully used the vernacular language to express emotions that ranged from an affectionate poem about the family cat, in Meie kass (Our Cat) and delicate love poetry, Head ööd (Good Night) to a powerful cri de coeur and rallying call to an oppressed nation, Mu isamaa nad olid matnud (My Country, they have buried you). With Lydia Koidula, the colonial view that the Estonian language was an underdeveloped instrument for communication was, for the first time, demonstrably contradicted.|$|E
25|$|On the {{posterior}} {{aspect of the}} head are the occiput, postgena, occipital foramen, posterior tentorial pit, gula, postgenal bridge, hypostomal suture and bridge, and the mandibles, labium, and maxilla. The occipital suture is well founded in species of Orthoptera, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> other orders. Where found, the occipital suture is the arched, horseshoe-shaped groove {{on the back of}} the head, ending at {{the posterior}} of each mandible. The postoccipital suture is a landmark on the posterior surface of the head, and is typically near the occipital foremen. In pterygotes, the postocciput forms the extreme posterior, often U-shaped, which forms the rim of the head extending to the postoccipital suture. In pterygotes, such as those of Orthoptera, the occipital foramen and the mouth are not separated. The three types of occipital closures, or points under the occipital foramen that separate the two lower halves of the postgena, are: the hypostomal bridge, the postgenal bridge, and the gula. The hypostomal bridge is usually found in insects with hypognathous orientation. The postgenal bridge is found in the adults of species of higher Diptera and aculeate Hymenoptera, while the gula is found on some Coleoptera, Neuroptera, and Isoptera, which typically display prognathous-oriented mouthparts.|$|E

It took {{another six months}} of editing to create a shorter, 110-minute version of the film, but upon its release in 1973 American Graffiti was {{extremely}} successful both with critics and at the box office. Shortly after its release, Roger Greenspun described the film and its editing: [...] "American Graffiti exists <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> its individual stories as in its orchestration of many stories, its sense of time and place. Although {{it is full of}} the material of fashionable nostalgia, it never exploits nostalgia. In its feeling for movement and music and the vitality of the night—and even in its vision in white—it is oddly closer to some early Fellini than to the recent American past of, say, The Last Picture Show or Summer of '42." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of Dejan, his province, except for the župe of Žegligovo and Upper Struma, was {{appropriated}} to nobleman Vlatko Paskačić, whose hereditary land was Slavište directly to the south. [...] Vukašin Mrnjavčević, of whom there are no notable mentions until 1365, became more powerful (ultimately the most powerful nobleman in Macedonia) after the deaths of Vojislav Vojinović, Dejan and despot Jovan Oliver (whose status in Macedonia was very high), as Vukašin's rise would have been unlikely during the lifetime of these men. Vukašin's younger brother Jovan Uglješa is also thought to {{have participated in the}} dismemberment of Dejan's province, as he used this chance to take the provinces which bordered on the oblast (province) of Ser (Serres). No one looked to the young sons of Dejan who would later become very important. Dejan's death benefited Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> territorial expansion (which is not so sure), but because Dejan's disappearance ended any stronger candidate to counter the Mrnjavčević family.|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Macaulay {{fulfilled}} two roles. At {{the start}} of an innings, when the ball was new and hard, he opened the bowling with medium-fast deliveries that swung away from right-handed batsmen. In this style, he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow considered him {{to be better than}} any similar bowler in the 1920s except Maurice Tate, the leading medium paced bowler in England. Macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on the needs of the match situation and the type of pitch. When the pitch was suitable for spinning the ball, he bowled medium-paced off breaks. Wisden said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a sticky wicket, a pitch which has been affected by rain, making it erratic and difficult to bat on. His obituary further stated: [...] "Under suitable conditions for using the off-break, batsmen seemed at his mercy." [...] This was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out, {{but at the same time}} it was very difficult to score runs against him. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that [...] "on a rain-damaged pitch he was in his glory." [...] He would make small adjustments to the positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of the wicket, often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so. Robertson-Glasgow said that [...] "only the best could survive the onslaught except by a miracle", and described Macaulay as a great bowler. The cricket writer Jim Kilburn suggested that Macaulay was [...] "a great cricketer. He was great <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> mathematical accomplishment... as in cricketing character." ...|$|E
