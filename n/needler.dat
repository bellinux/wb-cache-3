25|$|Roger McGough {{was born}} in Litherland, Lancashire on the {{outskirts}} of Liverpool. His ancestry is Irish and he was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He was a pupil at St Mary's College in Crosby with Laurie Taylor, future sociologist and criminologist, before going on to study French and Geography at the University of Hull. McGough lived in one of the university residences, <b>Needler</b> Hall, for three years from 1955 and served as hall librarian. Contemporaneously, the poet Philip Larkin became the university's librarian; newly arrived at Hull, he served as a sub-warden at <b>Needler</b> Hall, though he lived in private accommodation nearby. Several years later McGough corresponded with Larkin about poetry, sending him some of his own poems as he still lacked the confidence to approach the man directly. Larkin replied, thanking McGough for the poetry, which he had enjoyed reading. He added that he believed that McGough walked an impressionistic tightrope which, though exhilarating, meant that on occasion he fell off.|$|E
500|$|Technologically, the Covenant are {{described}} in [...] and [...] to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research. Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted {{that there may be}} something more to the Covenant's weaponry, saying [...] "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but something far more dangerous, arcane, and destructive." [...] A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the <b>Needler,</b> which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of [...] "homing in" [...] on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the <b>Needler</b> and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1968, P-Orridge began {{studying}} for {{a degree in}} Social Administration and Philosophy at the University of Hull. Hull was chosen {{in an attempt to}} study at [...] "the most ordinary non-elitist, working-class, red brick university", but P-Orridge disliked the course and unsuccessfully tried to transfer to study English. With a group of friends, they founded a 'free-form' student magazine entitled Worm which waived all editorial control, publishing everything placed into the magazine's pigeonhole, including instructions on how to build a molotov cocktail. Three issues were published between 1968 and 1970 before the Hull Student's Union banned the publication, considering it legally obscene and fearing prosecution. Developing a keen interest in poetry, P-Orridge won the 1969 Hull University <b>Needler</b> Poetry Competition, judged by Compton lecturer Richard Murphy and the poet Philip Larkin, who was then Chief Librarian at the university. P-Orridge became involved in radical student politics through their friendship with Tom Fawthrop, a member of the Radical Student Alliance who had led a student occupation of the university's administrative buildings {{as a part of the}} worldwide student protests of 1968. In 1969, P-Orridge attempted to reconstruct the occupation for a film, in the hopes that it would itself become a genuine protest occupation, but this venture failed due to a lack of participants.|$|E

500|$|Ensemble {{expanded}} the Halo universe during the game's development, {{in order to}} create enough units to give players strategic options. Among the new units was the Gorgon, a biped mech that used weapons called <b>Needlers</b> to destroy light aircraft. However, Ensemble later realized that the Gorgon invalidated a rule they had established: [...] "anything with two legs that walks" [...] was an infantry unit. Instead, the team added a new aircraft called the Vampire. The UNSC, meanwhile, lacked a melee unit to match the Covenant's hand-to-hand power. Ensemble considered using the original, less advanced Spartan Mark I suits of armor, in keeping with Halo lore, but once added these units were indistinguishable from Spartans in appearance. Instead, they created a lumbering, mechanized unit called the Cyclops, a nod to Age of Mythology.|$|R
50|$|Cottingham {{is used by}} the University of Hull as {{the site}} of several of its {{accommodation}} campuses: The Lawns to the north-west of the village; and Thwaite Hall, and <b>Needler's</b> Hall, both built on the grounds of late 18th century merchant's houses, and extending the original residences. There are several other large halls and houses of distinction within and {{on the periphery of the}} village, mostly dating from the late 18th and early 19th century, including Southwood Hall (17th century), Newgate House, Eastgate House, Westfield House, The Green Wickets, Springfield House, Beech House, Elmtree House, 'The Bungalow', and Snuff Mill House. Within the historic village boundary there are some humbler buildings dating from the 18th century and earlier, which are now listed, The remainder of Cottingham's housing includes post-railway Victorian terraces, as well as a large amount of interwar period and post Second World War housing.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} mapping a {{dynamically}} consistent hydrographic field and associated absolute geostrophic {{flow in the}} eastern North Atlantic between 24 deg and 36 deg N is related directly to {{the solution of the}} so-called thermocline equations. A nonlinear optimization problem involving <b>Needler's</b> P equation is solved to find the hydrography and resulting flow that minimizes the vertical mixing above about 1500 m in the ocean and is simultaneously consistent with the observations. A sharp minimum (at least in some dimensions) is found, apparently corresponding to a solution nearly conserving potential vorticity and with vertical eddy coefficient less than about 10 (exp - 5) sq m/s. Estimates of `residual' quantities such as eddy coefficients are extremely sensitive to slight modifications to the observed fields. Boundary conditions, vertical velocities, etc., are a product of the optimization and produce estimates differing quantitatively from prior ones relying directly upon observed hydrography. The results are generally insensitive to particular elements of the solution methodology, but many questions remain concerning the extent to which different synoptic sections can be asserted to represent the same ocean. The method can be regarded as a practical generalization of the beta spiral and geostrophic balance inverses for the estimate of absolute geostrophic flows. Numerous improvements to the methodology used in this preliminary attempt are possible...|$|R

50|$|<b>Needler</b> Hall was a hall of {{residence}} of the University of Hull, located on Northgate in Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire, England.
