Intellectual Property (IP) and its value are often not adequately appreciated. In the increasingly knowledge-driven economy, IP is a key consideration in day-to-day business decisions because new ideas and products appear almost daily in the market, which results in continuous innovation and research. Therefore, this paper will focus on the importance of IP for universities of technology and also further demonstrates how IP can become an economic tool and the challenges faced by these universities in implementing an IP system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} institutional investor involvement in and the operating performance of large firms. We confirm {{a significant relationship between}} a firm’s operating cash flow returns and both the percent of institutional stock ownership and the number of institutional stockholders. However, the positive relationship between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> al investors holding stock and operating cash flow returns is found only for pressure-insensitive institutional investors (those with no business relationship with the firm). The number of pressure-sensitive institutional investors (those with an existing or potential business relationship with the firm) has no impact on performance. These results suggest that institutional investors that need to protect actual or promote potential business relationships with firms in which they invest are compromised as monitors of the firm, and lend credence to calls for greater independence of board members from firms. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is an exploratory and descriptive study that analyzes the ‘information user’ subject {{articles published in}} thirteen Brazilian scientific journals on Library an information science during thirteen years, between 2001 and 2013. From the methodological point of view, the study is based on this area literature focused on the information user, on user studies and Bibliometric concepts. The quantitative analysis aimed to map the scientific production and explicit indicators to help the information user subject and scientific politics. The results show the most productive journals, chronological development of scientific production that increase {{in the last six}} years of the study period, geographic distribution of article production institution, author productivity and collaboration between researchers. Although the south-east region has the biggest production, because of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> with postgraduate courses, the two more productive authors are teachers, one in the masters degree in Brazilian north-east and the other, in a graduate course in an university in the south of the country.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a parsimonious theoretical model {{to explain the}} mechan-ics of a developing countrys catching-up behavior with endogenous institutional change. We characterize the optimal institutional adjustment scheme and how this would a¤ect the growth experience both in the transitional dynamics and the long-run steady state. Our main results include:(1) Under perfect international credit market, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> adjustment is 8 ̆ 5 nite and they only occur pre-cisely when the learning barrier just becomes binding. It implies that the less developed economy keeps catching up with the developed economy continuously until no further institution adjustment is made. Permanent level di¤erence {{may or may not}} exist on the balanced growth path, depending on the last endoge-nous institutional change. When the credit market is imperfect, the catching-up might occur intermittently and the institution adjustment is typically slower be-cause of the 8 ̆ 5 nancial constraint, which has both transient and permanent growth and level e¤ects;(2) Both one-shot and piecemeal institution reforms could be opti-mal institutional adjustment schemes, depending on the initial conditions and the completeness of the credit market; (3) The size of institutional adjustment could also depend on whether the central government is politically strong enough and whether the reform is more pro-market...|$|E
40|$|Gamma-camera {{tomography}} gives uniform in-plane and cross-plane resolution with {{propagation of}} the defect from one plane to another determined {{only by the}} usual camera-collimator resolution. These images may be reformatted by computer to portray slices in any orientation. Cross plane resolution is slightly worse than for the other methods, but it is uniform. The efficiency is less than either quadrant slant hole or seven pinhole apertures. Rotating cameras are not portable nor can they be used for dynamic studies. Both slant hole collimators and seven pinhole apertures distort the object in the depth dimension because of the limited viewing angle. The slant hole geometry provides somewhat better sampling and less plane-to-plane cross talk especially for the more distant planes. The full width half maximum of the depth response is not a sensitive indicator of this problem because the depth response function has very long tails. To date, best overall performance of the limited angle methods is offered by the 40 [deg] slant hole collimator on a large field-of-view camera. This, however, is not a portable unit and has a field-of-view too small for about 10 % of the patients. Seven pinhole imaging offers the advantage of having been well studied by a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution.</b> 87 - 90 A large pool of normal patient studies exists and the performance is well documented. Although the seven pinhole alone is suited to dynamic studies, any of the methods may be adapted to multigated studies...|$|E

The reason of his origin was structural transition of polish economy, which was accompanied by the privatization and necessity of reconstruction of the capital market. Those processes needed financing, and {{in the role of}} venture capital was seen. During the last fifteen years the role, the importance and the way of functioning of venture capital market in Poland have been changed. However, always it was visible its positive influence on the entrepreneurship development, creation of stable financial system and on the economy at all. That is why, more often the government and other authorities undertake initiatives which should help to develop this small, but so important, part of capital market. Till the end of 2004, venture capital funds have invested in Poland more than 5, 7 mid PLN, financing by this way mainly small and medium sized enterprises. And their investment preferences were very various, as in terms of economy sector, as in terms of size of enterprises. However, the fact is they always invest in enterprises risky, but those who have a big chance to growth. The aim of this paper is presenting fifteen years old history of polish venture capital market, showing how it is look nowadays and introduce perspectives on his development in the future. I will also present in it how, during this time, the structure, the way of operating and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> involved in the venture capital market (mainly venture capital funds) have been changed.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the diverse {{challenges}} that the masses faced in the procurement of housing from the public and private sector housing market, many people had turned to seek assistance through the organized informal sector, especially the co-operative society. This study explored Co-operative Societies intervention in housing provision with the ultimate aim of establishing empirically the different methods of meeting housing needs of their members in Lagos State. Ikeja Area office, having the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> based Co-operative Societies in Lagos Metropolis was purposely selected for the study. Thus structured questionnaires were administered to two groups of respondents, the principal officers of the selected 54 institution based co-operative societies together with their 315 members. Secondary data were also collected through the review of relevant publications and records of some of these societies. Primary data analysis was carried out with tables, percentages and relative importance index while independent sample t-test was used to find if there is any statistical significance between the opinion of the principal officers and members on the success rates of the methods of housing provision engaged by the co-operative societies. The study found that amongst others that both categories of respondents have similar opinion on the method of housing provision commonly engaged with housing development loan (corporate scheme) ranking first, followed by land acquisition, documentation, layout and allocation, private housing project loan, then land acquisition, documentation, development and allocation with complete house purchase (universal) trailing behind. The study also revealed that most co-operative societies generate their funds and hardly receive financial assistance from external sources. The study concluded by suggesting a model that would incorporate external assistance from government, non-government and parent institutions and as well synchronize the various methods to make deliver a wholesome housing acquisition process for members of institution based co-operative societies...|$|E
