During an Inside Soap feature on the Moon {{brothers}} vs the Mitchell brothers, Kate Woodward said [...] "Two sexy brothers to shake up Albert Square? That sounds familiar! But are Anthony and Tyler really the new Grant and Phil Mitchell?" [...] Lapinskas commented on this, saying [...] "It's {{a lot of pressure}} to put us both under, but what a duo to be compared to!... Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal". Cecile Metcalf of the Daily Mail branded Anthony [...] "the loveable rogue of the square, with a cheeky answer for everything".|$|E
500|$|In 2011, SFX named [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] {{as one of}} {{the best}} Sci-Fi TV Mockumentaries, saying that it worked as an example of the genre and was not too bad on rewatch. The article noted that criticisms of the episode ranged from [...] "Kay's overacting and the silly Slitheen-esque monster to {{annoyance}} at how, well, lame the members of LINDA are." [...] Louisa Pearson of The Scotsman noted that hardcore fans would dislike the comedy and the [...] "panto" [...] performance of Kay, but commented, [...] "It's true, this episode came close to being a spoof, but it was actually quite <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rest from the Doctor. Even saving the world gets boring sometimes." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode a grade of D-. He was positive towards the first 30 minutes, which he described as a [...] "touching little tale" [...] with interesting characters, but called the final 10 minutes [...] "juvenile attack on the audience's intelligence and emotions" [...] that ruined the episode with [...] "a laughable monster and offensive humor at exactly the wrong moment". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan criticised Kay's performance, calling the Abzorbaloff [...] "a marvellous idea and it's a pity his creativity was absorbed by a turn from a visiting comedian". In a review of the series, Stephen Brook of The Guardian stated that he [...] "hated" [...] the episode, describing it as a [...] "parody of Doctor Who fans". The scene where Elton says he and Ursula have [...] "a bit of a love life" [...] was criticised by some commentators, who felt that the resultant implication of having oral sex with a paving slab was unsuitable for Doctor Whos large family audience; others, however, dismissed this dialogue as a harmless joke that children would not understand. [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] was placed in 153rd position in Doctor Who Magazine Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009, which ranked every Doctor Who story to that point in order of preference.|$|E
2500|$|The protests also {{received}} international coverage – Jon Stewart referenced the audio recordings and the protests in The Daily Show, noting that [...] "It must be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> democracy {{so young and}} idealistic you can still be disappointed in it." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, in 1999 Speed reprised {{the role}} of Natalie Price, four years after her initial departure. Her return was {{prompted}} by her friend and EastEnders co-star Ross Kemp, who initiated contact between her and producer Matthew Robinson. Speed commented [...] "I have changed. I've grown up and I'm more confident. I've had more life experiences. I've had bad times, lived in different places. I'm a bit more grown up and settled now. And as I've grown older I appreciate that it's much <b>nicer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> regular job. When EastEnders asked me back, I thought, `Cool, I can pay the mortgage." ...|$|R
2500|$|On a {{documentary}} with Fearne Cotton, Jones confirmed that McFly have three unreleased albums. The band are currently on a hiatus but hint on a future reunion, with Jones stating [...] "It's really <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bit of breathing space after 12½ years with McFly. We've {{never really had}} this time off, so we'll give it a few months and see how we feel. When we're all refreshed, we'll go and smash an album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Hook and Stephen Morris, {{two of the}} {{founding}} members of Joy Division, generally praised the film. However, Morris has disputed its accuracy, saying [...] "None of it's true really" [...] but acknowledged the need to bend facts because [...] "the truth is too boring". Hook criticised the preview audience's reaction, saying how {{at the end of}} the film [...] "it really hurt and everybody started clapping. It would've been <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dignified silence".|$|E
2500|$|Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that the wardrobe department struggled {{to come up with a}} static identity for Melanie at first; however, this she felt turned out to be a good thing: [...] "What I really liked about it was, when we started looking for costumes , the wardrobe department couldn't quite fit where I was going. I'd wear Army pants and trainers some days and then jeans some other days and then I'd be all suited and booted at other times. I said, 'That's what girls do! That's how I am. Some days I'm in scruffs and some days I'm really dressed up. It would be really <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> character who's not so predictable.'" [...] Rosalind Powell, head of the EastEnders wardrobe design team in 2000, said that Mel had [...] "colourful and stylish" [...] wardrobe from retailers such as Kookai and Oasis. Powell added, [...] "Although she's a barmaid, she can still afford to wear nice clothes, she just doesn't have a very big wardrobe." ...|$|E

[...] She had her own voice, and the pulses of her heart better under command than had he; but she also felt that the {{occasion}} was trying to her. The man had loved her honestly and truly,--still did love her, paying her the great homage of bitter grief in {{that he had lost}} her. Where is the girl who will not sympathise with such love and such grief, if it be shown only because it cannot be concealed, and be declared against the will of him who declares it? ...|$|R

500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought it would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown {{at the end of the}} episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|R

[...] Eurogamer gave it 7/10 saying [...] "Agent 47 doesn't begin Hitman: Absolution with amnesia, but the six years that have passed since we last took control of him in Blood Money do seem to have dulled his creators' {{recollections}} of what made him so popular in the first place." [...] GameSpot gave it 7.5/10 saying [...] "Hitman: Absolution's vivid world and enjoyable stealth-action gameplay overshadow its few notable inconsistencies." [...] IGN gave it 9/10 saying [...] "It’s <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> game that doesn’t just encourage improvisation; it requires it." [...] Forbes and Kotaku both gave Absolution positive reviews. Giant Bomb gave it 4/5, as did Joystiq. Destructoid gave it 8.5/10. GameArena gave the game a 3/10 saying [...] "IO Interactive needs to restart from the Blood Money checkpoint and try again— they screwed up this run spectacularly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pop Justice praised Scherzinger's {{choice to}} release [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] as her second single. They said [...] "For the {{follow-up}} [...] Nicole {{has taken the}} controversial move of recording a song that is also basically brilliant... It is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> decent song about love because love is the official topic of pop and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is a fool to themselves and {{needs to have a}} long sit down." [...] A review from Rap-Up agreed saying that on [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath", Scherzinger takes it the club with the [...] "empowering pop jam" [...] and declares her independence. Robbie Daw from Idolator praised the song, based just on its demo. He said [...] "Well, okay—we will allow that this song already sounds better than every Pussycat Dolls single combined." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy praised the song awarding it five out of five stars. In his review, Copsey said [...] "That said, we found ourselves mildly red-faced on a recent excursion while listening to Nicole Scherzinger's latest chart assault... Who could blame us though?" [...] He went on the praise the Gloria Gaynor-like conviction displayed by Scherzinger as well as the song's overall production. Ben Norman from About.com, in a review for Killer Love said that, [...] "'Don't Hold Your Breath' is an absolute standout {{and one of the best}} tracks she has offered in any association she's had. Bradley Stern of MTV Buzzworthy described the song's production as [...] "gorgeous". In July 2013, The Huffington Post ranked [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] at number 23 on its list of the top 50 number ones of the last ten years. Cosmopolitan listed the song at number 9 on the magazine's [...] "Best Breakup Songs". The article also included [...] "I Don't Need a Man" [...] at number two which Scherzinger wrote for her former girl group, The Pussycat Dolls. BecomeGorgeous.com acknowledged the song as one of the best break up songs for girls saying, [...] "Nicole Scherzinger truly understands what you're going through and suggests a pretty good line to address your ex when he thinks you're coming home to make up: Don't Hold Your Breath." ...|$|E
