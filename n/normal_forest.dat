This research was conducted in forest management unit (FMU) of Randublatung, state-owned forest company (Perhutani), located at Central Java. The risk of forest damages, called casualty per cent, was calculated using a series of age class structures based on a 10 -year periodic forest inventory for four sequential planning periods: 1983 / 1992, 1993 / 2002, 2003 / 2012,to 2013 / 2022. The <b>normal</b> <b>forest</b> was determined based on the stands area basis, which was defined based on the final cutting area that already incorporates casualty per cent, {{in such a way that}} each year the newly planted forests areas have relatively the same number. The results showed that without casualty per cent, the <b>normal</b> <b>forest</b> built every year in FMU Randublatung was 456 ha/year for a 60 -year rotation cycle.

40|$|Current Mexican forest {{management}} {{is the product}} of a history that dates back to 1926. Earlier approaches were directly or indirectly aimed at attaining the <b>normal</b> <b>forest</b> model. Around 1980, multi-resource and environmental impact considerations were mandated for all private timber operations. Timber-oriented silviculture was deemed insufficient to take proper care of non-timber values in the forest. Concerns about water quality, biodiversity, and natural conservation were the motives for promoting voluntary best management practices, in 2012 and afterwards. In this research, two traditional Mexican {{forest management}} schemes, Sicodesi and Plan Costa, enhanced with best management practices, are compared to Mapa, a management method specifically designed to manage landscape attributes. Results from two successive forest inventories 10 and 13 years apart show that Sicodesi and Plan Costa, even when modified to comply with best management practices, failed to maintain proper stewardship of non-timber values. Mapa, however, employed multiple means to drive forest dynamics to fulfill multi-resource objectives, constrained by self-financing and competitive profitability. These capabilities in Mapa enabled some degree of control over non-timber values, but many more important processes occur beyond the property boundary, and beyond the planning scope considered in Mapa and all other forest planning methods...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{particular}} uneven-aged forest stand management pattern {{that is often}} advocated in practice. The forest structure under consideration {{is similar to a}} normalized forest à la Faustmann, with the following difference: rather than being single aged, each forest tract contains trees of two age classes so that it is submitted to a form of selective cutting. Each harvest involves all of the older trees and {{only a fraction of the}} younger ones; hence the name mixed rotation. Trees left standing at harvest help stimulate natural regeneration and improve various environmental and amenity characteristics of the forest. We model this effect by using a cost function that varies with respect to the harvest rate of younger trees. We derive the properties that this cost function must exhibit in order some form of mixed rotation to be superior to the conventional single rotation à la Faustmann; we also characterize the mixed rotation in terms of duration and the harvest rate of younger trees, and we compare its properties with Faustman's rule. forest management, Faustmann's rule, <b>normal</b> <b>forest,</b> synchronized forest, uneven-aged lots, amenity value, mixed rotation, selective cutting...|$|E

A main advantage of model-assisted estimation is that unbiasedness of estimators does not rely on the suitability of the model, but the model only helps to improve the precision of an estimator known to be (approximately) unbiased. Model-based and hybrid inference rely on the suitability of the model, but may have several advantages under conditions where access to field plots is difficult or expensive. All three approaches rely on the possibility to develop accurate models, which is possible for several important forest variables (such as biomass), but not for all variables that are included in a <b>normal</b> national <b>forest</b> inventory.|$|R

The results show a considerable degree of conflict between the proposed criteria. By applying several goal programming models, different Paretian efficient solutions were obtained. In addition, some results in Monte Carlo analysis for several criteria show notable variations. This fact is especially notable for the mushroom production criterion.

The present investigation, therefore, was carried out to evaluate the role of open cast coal mining in alteration of native soil characteristics. Soil samples are collected from disturbed soils of Ledo colliery and undisturbed forest soil. Soil characteristics of Ledo colliery deviated from forest soil. The pH of the disturbed soil was 4. 53 compared to 5. 83 of undisturbed forest soil. Open cast mining significantly (P< 0. 05) altered the soil pH from <b>normal</b> <b>forest</b> soil. Statistically insignificant deviation of soil Temperature, MC, OC, N and Mg in disturbed soil was observed. However, pH, P, K and Ca of disturbed soil varied from forest soil significantly (P< 0. 05). The concentration of all the heavy metals studied viz.

40|$|Because some {{consequences}} of fire resemble {{the effects of}} industrial forest harvesting, forest management is often considered as a disturbance having effects {{similar to those of}} natural disturbances. Although the analogy between forest management and fire disturbance in boreal ecosystems has some merit, {{it is important to recognize}} that it has limitations. First, <b>normal</b> <b>forest</b> rotations truncate the natural forest stand age distribution and eliminate over-mature forests from the landscape. Second, in the boreal mixedwoods, natural forest dynamics following fire may involve a gradual replacement of stands of intolerant broadleaf species by mixedwood and then softwood stands, whereas current silvicultural practices promote successive rotations of similarly composed stands. Third, the large fluctuations observed in fire frequency during the Holocene limit the use of a single fire cycle to characterize natural fire regimes. Short fire cycles generally described for boreal ecosystems do not appear to be universal; rather, shifts between short and long fire cycles have been observed. These shifts imply important changes in forest composition at the landscape and regional levels. All of these factors create a natural variability in forest composition that should be maintained by forest managers concerned with the conservation of biodiversity.
