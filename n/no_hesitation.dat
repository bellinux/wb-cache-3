5|$|The coroner {{reported}} that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol {{were found in}} Smith's system {{at the time of}} his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including Clonazepam, Mirtazapine, Atomoxetine, and Amphetamine. There were <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
5|$|However, the SA Cricket Association had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in {{appointing}} Bradman {{as their}} {{delegate to the}} Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside {{some of the men}} he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and {{played a major role in}} planning for post-war cricket.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should {{have nothing to do with}} it. On the other hand, he showed <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E

5|$|The referee {{added two}} minutes of injury time {{at the end of}} extra time, during which time Manchester United won another free kick, but Scholes' shot was {{straight}} at the Arsenal defensive wall. Then, with just seconds left in regulation time, Ronaldo made a break towards the Arsenal half, only to be cynically body-checked by Reyes. Referee Styles made <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> and showed Reyes a second yellow card, making the Spaniard the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final, after Manchester United's Kevin Moran in 1985. The full-time whistle went immediately after Reyes' dismissal, and the match finished at 0–0, making it the first FA Cup Final to result in a penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{was well}} {{received}} by the Scotsman, but The Times Literary Supplement was not entirely enthusiastic:Among the little books that have become as much a manifestation of autumn as falling leaves, one looks first for whatever Miss Beatrix Potter gives... In her new book... {{although there is no}} diminution in the charm and drollery of the drawings, Miss Potter's fancy is not what it was. The story is inconclusive. Next year we think she must call in a literary assistant. We have <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in calling her pencil perfect.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E

25|$|Silvestre Bello, another negotiator, {{said that}} the hostage takers said they want to escape due to abuse from prison {{officials}}. He {{said that the}}y claimed that three of their companions had their ears chopped off by prison officials and also added that they demanded {{to be transferred to}} the National Penitentiary in Muntinlupa. He said there would be <b>no</b> <b>hesitations</b> to impose sanctions on prison officials involved if the investigation warranted such action. Bello also defended the military's action saying that the prisoners were determined not to be taken alive.|$|R
25|$|Trumper was modest, {{retiring}} and generous. A teetotaller and non-smoker, {{his general}} conduct {{was an example}} to his fellow players, {{and he was a}} great favourite with the public both in England and Australia. Monty Noble had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in calling him the world's greatest batsman, a genius without compare.|$|E
25|$|The {{currency}} depreciated sharply as {{a result}} of the First World War, which was financed mostly by the issue of War Bonds rather than through taxation. Consumer prices rose sixteenfold during the war, as the government had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in running the Austro-Hungarian Bank's printing presses to pay its bills: this triggered a higher inflation rate than in other combatant countries.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{arrived in}} Nottingham for the Trent Bridge test giddy after regaining the Ashes, {{and being the}} first Australian side to win a series in England since the 1975 Ashes series.

He was once a habitual smoker but he eventually quit after a doctor's suggestion due to health concerns. Duterte is an avid reader of Robert Ludlum and Sidney Sheldon novels. Duterte is also known for his straightforward and vocal attitude in public especially in interviews, showing <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in using profanity profusely live on-screen on numerous occasions despite formal requests by media groups and schools beforehand to abstain.|$|E
25|$|By early 1842 it was {{apparent}} to the commissioners that Maori who had accepted payment in money or goods had {{had no intention of}} total alienation of all the land within the vast general boundaries outlined in some of the deeds. Godfrey and Richmond had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in dismissing as utterly unintelligible, to Maori or European, some of the pretentious deeds drawn up in pseudo-legalistic English. In many cases the commissioners accepted the evidence of Maori over that of the claimants. They found boundaries to be inadequately described in most deeds, the acreages grossly exaggerated, the claims overlapped, with Maori usually having little idea of area or boundaries in English terms.|$|E

50|$|Potts {{was in the}} United States {{when she}} was {{approached}} by the Holby City casting director {{about the role of}} Eddi. After reading the character breakdown, Potts loved the idea of Eddi so much that she filmed her own audition and sent the tape over to the casting director. She was then offered the role on the strength of her audition and signed a yearlong contract. Potts admitted that she had previously shied away from long-term roles, but she had <b>no</b> <b>hesitations</b> about signing up to play Eddi. She added that her first week on set was a shock due to the amount of scenes they film in a day, but she thought it was good training. Potts made her first screen appearance as Eddi during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2011.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of the conquest much ecclesiastical {{property}} had been secularized and, despite the demands of the clergy, this had not been returned to the churches. The Chronicle of the Morea reports that when the churches refused to provide their fair share of military aid, Geoffrey I seized their property and devoted the income from it to the construction of the powerful castle of Clermont. Furthermore, Geoffrey I was also accused of treating the Greek priests as serfs because their numbers had considerably increased, since the Greek prelates showed <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in conferring orders on peasants to permit them to escape the burdens of serfdom. These events resulted in a prolonged conflict with the church.|$|E

To prevent Jeanine from holding another prisoner exchange, Dauntless vote to execute Eric, which Tobias does with <b>no</b> <b>hesitation,</b> while to avoid a dependence on Candor, Dauntless leave for their headquarters and disable most of the security cameras inside. However, Tris is alerted by Christina that one undisarmed camera causes three Dauntless members: Marlene, Hector, and Kee, to become simulated into attempting to commit suicide unless a Divergent is handed over; out of the three, {{they are unable to}} save Marlene.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{plausible}} {{reason why}} Manoj Prabhakar {{had to wait}} 3 to 6 years to report match-fixing allegations. Manjrekar's statement contradicted Prabhakar's on the events at Sharjah in October 1991. No evidence was provided {{with respect to the}} Singer Cup incident nor was a report made to the Captain, Coach or Vice-captain. Manoj's allegation against Aamir Sohail and Mohammad Azharuddin on the toss incident was factually incorrect as there was no match when these 2 cricketers captained their countries in Sharjah. Manoj Prabhakar refused to name the attempted briber in spite of assurances from the judge himself. The judge concluded that Manoj's allegation was a result of his getting back at Mohammad Azharuddin. The judge had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in rejecting the allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar.|$|E

60|$|No sooner did I {{reach my}} little desk in Jamaica Plain than I began to write, {{composing}} {{in the glow}} of a flaming conviction. With a delightful (and deceptive) sense of power, I graved with heavy hand, as if with pen of steel on brazen tablets, picture after picture of the plain. I had <b>no</b> doubts, <b>no</b> <b>hesitations</b> about the kind of effect I wished to produce. I perceived little that was poetic, little that was idyllic, and nothing that was humorous in the man, who, with hands like claws, was scratching a scanty living from the soil of a rented farm, while his wife walked her ceaseless round from tub to churn and from churn to tub. On the contrary, the life of such a family appealed to me as an almost unrelievedly tragic futility.|$|R

25|$|Former President Joseph Estrada {{expressed}} condemnation {{towards the}} rebels {{saying that a}} peace talk with them would not work and believes a declaration of an all-out war against them is only {{the solution to the}} peace process in Mindanao. Former President Fidel V. Ramos remains supportive of the peace process even though he explains that the finalization of the peace process may be after President Benigno Aquino III's term. Despite his expression of support towards the peace process, Ramos still criticized Aquino saying “There should be <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> {{on the part of the}} commander in chief. Otherwise, it will be part of your legacy to be always hesitant, flip-flopping.” He criticized Aquino, who is also the commander-in-chief of the PNP and the AFP, for his apparent poor strategic direction and asserts that it is the soldier, the policeman, the law enforcer, the guardian of security that suffers because of his decisions. Ramos also insists that Aquino should have made consultation with retired police officers and soldiers before the security operation in Mamasapano.|$|E
25|$|United's chances {{continued}} to flow thick and fast. Michael Carrick rounded the goalkeeper {{only to be}} tackled on the line by Distin, whilst Patrice Evra had a shot turned onto the post by David James before things went {{from bad to worse}} for the Manchester side. With 12 minutes to play, Portsmouth counter-attacked down the right hand side, forcing a two-on-two situation. The ball was squared to Milan Baroš, who was felled by Kuszczak in the box. The referee had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in sending Kuszczak off, despite both Rooney and Anderson having gotten back behind the ball before the foul. Nevertheless, referee Atkinson's decision meant that United had no recognised goalkeeper available for the remaining time. Wayne Rooney offered his services, but that would have left United without a recognised centre-forward, so Rio Ferdinand was given the responsibility of attempting to save the penalty. However, although he dived the right way, Ferdinand was unable to get a hand to the ball, and Sulley Muntari gave Portsmouth the lead. United fought hard to get their deserved equaliser, but even Ronaldo's free kick was off-target, and United were knocked out of the FA Cup.|$|E
25|$|United had {{the run of}} {{the play}} {{in the first half of}} the final, {{dominating}} Chelsea in terms of possession, and took the lead in the 26th minute through a Cristiano Ronaldo header off a Wes Brown cross. However, in the last minute of the first half, a ball into the United box was deflected to Frank Lampard, who capitalised on a slip by Van der Sar to equalise for the Londoners. The second half was much more even, but no further goals were scored and the match went to extra time. Midway through the second half of extra time, a large incident involving Carlos Tevez and John Terry kicked off. In the ensuing melée, the referee spotted a slap on Nemanja Vidić by Didier Drogba, and had <b>no</b> <b>hesitation</b> in sending the Ivorian international off. Despite the man advantage, United were unable to find a winner and the match went to penalties. Both teams converted their first two penalties, but then the most unlikely of players missed his – Cristiano Ronaldo, who stepped up with his usual self-confidence, could only stare on as Petr Čech saved his shot. Just when the match looked lost, John Terry stepped up for the Blues, only for his standing foot to give way as he struck his shot and the ball hit the post. This took the match to sudden death penalties, though only two further rounds were required. Ryan Giggs scored United's seventh penalty, meaning that Nicolas Anelka had to score in order to keep Chelsea in the game. His shot, however, was poorly struck, and at the perfect height for United's Dutch goalkeeper to save, granting United their third European Cup title.|$|E
