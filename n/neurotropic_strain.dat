Autoantibodies were produced to brain only; various other tissues tested were negative. These antibodies were not elicited by other influenza A or B viruses, including closely related recombinant strains, but were elicited by the isolated hemagglutinin of A/Bellamy/ 42 strain and by formaldehyde-fixed WSN virus [...] demonstrating that infection was not essential for the induction of autoantibodies. In histological studies, reaction with anti-viral antisera was specific to gray matter and was confined to sera that recognized the 37 -kDa protein. Antibody binding was prominent in regions comprised of neuronal cell bodies in cellular layers of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum and was undetectable in myelin-rich regions, such as the corpus callosum.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{an inflammatory}} demyelinating {{disease of the}} CNS. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} significant axonal injury also occurs in MS patients and correlates with neurological dysfunction, but it is not known whether this neuronal damage is a primary disease process, or occurs only secondary to demyelination. In the current studies, <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strains</b> of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that induce meningitis, encephalitis, and demyelination in the CNS, an animal model of MS, were used to evaluate mechanisms of axonal injury. The pathogenic properties of genetically engineered isogenic spike protein recombinant demyelinating and nondemyelinating strains of MHV were compared. Studies demonstrate that a demyelinating strain of MHV causes concomitant axonal loss and macrophage-mediated demyelination. The mechanism of axonal loss and demyelination in MHV infection is dependent on successful transport of virus from gray matter to white matter using the MHV host attachment spike glycoprotein. Our data show that axonal loss and demyelination can be independent direct viral cytopathic events, and suggest that similar direct axonal damage may occur in MS. These results have important implications for the design of neuroprotective strategies for CNS demyelinating disease, and our model identifies the spike protein as a therapeutic target to prevent axonal transport of neurotropic viruses...|$|R

We established T cell lines specific for the truncated N protein fragments and tested their potential to mediate protection by transfer experiments.

40|$|The {{observations}} of many workers have amply shown that infection {{of a host}} by one virus may, under certain conditions, afford temporary protection against infection by another. The antagonistic action between the two viruses, which results in the dominance of one and confers on the host a transitory resistance to superinfection with the other, is generally referred to as "interference," This phenomenon was first described for plant viruses. McKinney (I) in 1929 reported that the yellow-mosaic tobacco virus did not multiply in plants previously infected with the related common-mosaic virus. Interference between various plant viruses has been studied by many others since then, and the work has been summarized recently by Price (2).

The infectivity of dilutions of virus suspensions held in bottles or cells was determined after exposure to light under a variety of conditions; the influence of exposure was indicated by comparison with the infec-tivity of control suspensions kept in darkness. The infectivity titres indicated by serial dilutions, in phosphate saline, of unfiltered fresh suspensions of egg strains of the viruses of vesicular stomatitis, influenza, Newcastle disease and fowl-plague following exposure to daylight for 4 hr. were 3 - 5 logarithmic units lower than those indicated by the dark controls.

40|$|Serial {{mutagenesis}} with 5 -fluorouracil {{has been}} employed to derive an attenuated strain of Rift Valley fever virus {{for use as}} a live virus vaccine. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne viral disease principally of cattle and sheep, involving periodic epizootics particularly in central and south Africa (Peters & Meegan, 1984). In these domestic animals the disease is characterized by a febrile illness, the development of liver necrosis and, in severe cases, death frequently associated with haemorrhagic symptoms (Findlay, 1932). Infection of pregnant animals often leads to abortion; infection of very young lambs and calves almost invariably leads to death (Easterday, 1965). The agent of RVF is an enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Phlebovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae (Bishop & Shope, 1979). The main vectors of the virus are arthropods, although direct host-to-host transmission involving contact or aerosol infection may be an alternative route of virus dissemination (Peters & Meegan, 1984). Vaccines against RVF for both veterinary and human use have been developed.

On the other hand, there were no apparent differences in the occurrence of viral antigen in ependymal cells, indicating a selective change in affinity for neurons in the brain.

40|$|A {{number of}} viruses can {{initiate}} {{central nervous system}} (CNS) diseases that include demyelination as a major feature of neuropathology. In humans, the most prominent demyelinating diseases are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by JC papovirus destruction of oligodendrocytes, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, an invariably fatal childhood disease caused by persistent measles virus. The most common neurological disease of young adults in the developed world, multiple sclerosis, is also characterized by lesions of inflammatory demyelination; however, the etiology of this disease remains an enigma. A viral etiology is possible, because most demyelinating diseases of known etiology in both man and animals are viral. Understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelination derives {{for the most part}} from the study of animal models. Studies with <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strains</b> of mouse hepatitis virus, Theiler’s virus, and Semliki Forest virus have {{been at the forefront of}} this research. These models demonstrate how viruses enter the brain, spread, persist, and interact with immune responses. Common features are an ability to infect and persist in glial cells, generation of predominantly CD 8 + responses, which control and clear the early phase of virus replication but which fail to eradicate the infection, and lesions of inflammatory demyelination. In most cases demyelination is to a limited extent the result of direct virus destruction of oligodendrocytes, but for the most part is the consequence of immune and inflammatory responses. These models illustrate the roles of age and genetic susceptibility and establish the concept that persistent CNS infection can lead to the generation of CNS autoimmune responses. Journal o...|$|R

However, additional phenotypic characteristics are necessary for HIV- 1 neurotropism. Furthermore, <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strains</b> are not necessarily neurovirulent. To better understand the determinants of HIV- 1 neurovirulence, we isolated viruses from brain tissue samples from three AIDS patients with dementia and HIV- 1 encephalitis and analyzed their ability to induce syncytia in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and neuronal apoptosis in primary brain cultures. Two R 5 X 4 viruses (MACS 1 -br and MACS 1 -spln) were highly fusogenic in MDM and induced neuronal apoptosis. The R 5 viruses UK 1 -br and MACS 2 -br are both neurotropic.

In the small percentage of IL- 10 −/− mice that survived, no differences in either demyelination or inflammation were observed. Together, these results suggest that IL- 10 is not required for viral clearance, and although it appears {{to be one of the}} mechanisms responsible for inhibiting the extent of inflammation in the CNS during acute JHMV infection, it has little role in the eventual resolution of CNS inflammatory responses...|$|E
40|$|Smithburn (1949) {{reported}} that humoral immunity to Rift Valley fever (R. V. F.), transmitted from an immune ewe to her twin lambs, persisted {{for about five}} months and was not affected by weaning. He postulated {{that this might be}} of practical value in protecting young lambs during the period of maximum susceptibility to Rift Valley Fever virus. In the Republic of South Africa, arthropod-borne diseases of sheep such as Rift Valley fever, Wesselsbron disease and bluetongue occur seasonally during the late summer and autumn, and almost invariably disappear soon after the first frosts of winter. Bearing this in mind, practical use is made of transmitted passive immunity to protect the lambs. Autumn lambing is advocated, and farmers are advised to immunise all their sheep during the spring, first with a polyvalent bluetongue vaccine and later with a combined Rift Valley fever-Wesselsbron vaccine. On account of the abortifacient and embryotropic properties of the neuroadapted Rift Valley fever and Wesselsbron disease viruses which form the basis of the live attenuated virus vaccine, prophylactic immunisation is restricted to non-pregnant animals. At present, for the preparation of the Rift Valley fever vaccine, Smithburn's neurotropic attenuated strain of virus at the 102 nd mouse intracerebral passage level is used. Mulligan (1937) prepared a similar type of vaccine from a <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strain</b> of virus at the 92 nd mouse passage level. He {{reported that}} “the vaccine proved safe for lambs six weeks old and produced a good immunity. Tested in the field, on a large number of pregnant ewes and newly born lambs, this vaccine was found to be unsafe for the newly born lambs and to cause abortion in some of the pregnant ewes. Vaccination of pregnant ewes, moreover, did not appear to result in the transfer of the immune bodies through the colostrum to the lamb although, in this connection, it must be stated that lambing had started at the time vaccination was practised and the interval between inoculation and the birth of a lamb was never more than a few days. It became apparent, however, that the vaccine, while it might be of service in protecting maiden ewes, was not suitable for controlling an outbreak in pregnant ewes and very young lambs. " Kaschula (1953) using Smithburn's neurotropic virus at the 86 th passage level reported abortions among pregnant ewes and the death of lambs shortly after birth under field conditions in South Africa. The investigations reported in this communication were undertaken initially to determine the effect of the strain of Rift Valley fever virus incorporated in the vaccine on pregnant ewes and day-old lambs.

Animals immunized by extraneural routes, on the other hand, are not uniformly resistant to neural infection with neurotropic yellow fever virus. Monkeys which have undergone systemic infection with virus of the avirulent 17 D strain or of several jungle strains resist only small intracerebral doses of neurotropic virus; while mice, even when possessed of very high serum-antibody levels as the result of intraperitoneal hyperimmunization, manifest only an irregular resistance to intracerebral challenge inocula. The difference in the resistance of neurally and extraneurally immunized animals is not related to similar differences in the levels of protective antibody in the sera. Indeed, the average of the serum-antibody titers of the hyperimmune mice is several times that of the intracerebral immunes. A possibly significant relation does exist, however, between the resistance of mice to neural infection and the content of protective antibody in the brain. The protective activity of suspensions of brains from mice surviving cerebral infection was found to be several times that of brain suspensions from the hyperimmunized animals. It is concluded that the superior resistance to neural infection of animals whose immunity results from a previous non-fatal infection of the nervous system is effected by a specific local mechanism which is based at least in part upon an increased concentration of antibody in the cerebral tissue...|$|E

For HSV- 2 strains, only one polymorphism (G 420 T) which resulted in an amino acid substitution (residue 139, Leu→Phe) was detected. Phenotypic determination of resistance to ACY by a plaque reduction assay of 48 HSV isolates was not correlated with the sequence results of 11 strains in that 7 of these with genotypic polymorphisms were susceptible to the drug in vitro. In addition, of 32 ACY-resistant HSV strains, 28 (87. 5 %) had no polymorphisms detected in the 335 -bp amplicon of the TK gene. There was no statistical difference in the frequency of polymorphisms according to the source of the specimens. We conclude that the detection of nucleic acid polymorphisms in a previously implicated 335 -bp segment of the TK gene cannot be interpreted as indicative of either ACY resistance or neurotropism of HSV strains from dermal, genital, and CSF sources...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{infection of the}} neuronal and astroglial cells of {{the central nervous system}} has been proposed to contribute to HIV- 1 -associated dementia. Recently it was shown that differences in the nucleotide sequence of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of different HIV- 1 strains govern the tissue-specific pattern of viral expression. The LTR from central nervous system-derived HIV- 1 strains JR-FL and JR-CSF directs expression in the neurons of transgenic mice, in contrast with the lymphotropic LAI strain. By in vitro footprinting, gel retardation, and methylation interference experiments, we have studied the interactions of host cell proteins from human neuronal, glial, HeLa, and Jurkat T cells with the LTRs from the neurotropic JR-FL and JR-CSF strains, compared with the LAI strain. Proteins belonging to the nuclear receptor family bind with different affinities to variant - 352 to - 324 sites. Gel supershift assays with Jun and Fos antibodies showed that the AP- 1 transcription factor present in the various cell types was unable to recognize the - 352 to - 324 and - 306 to - 285 AP- 1 putative binding sites. Interestingly, Jun and Fos components of AP- 1 interact with the variant TGGCTCA sequence located in the - 247 to - 222 region of both <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strains.</b> These interactions were cell type specific, since they were detected only with extracts from glial and HeLa cells and not from neuronal or Jurkat cells. Cotransfection experiments further revealed that the - 247 to - 222 sequence is able to mediate AP- 1 -induced transcriptional activation in glial and not neuronal cells...|$|R
40|$|RNA interference, {{a natural}} {{biological}} phenomenon mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), {{has been demonstrated}} in recent studies {{to be an effective}} strategy against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). In the present study, we used 21 -bp chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes whose sequences were derived from the gp 41 gene, nef, tat, and rev regions of viral RNA. These sequences are conserved in select <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strains</b> of HIV- 1 (JR-FL, JR-CSF, and YU- 2). The designed siRNAs exerted a potent antiviral effect on these HIV- 1 strains. The antiviral effect was mediated at the RNA level (as observed by the down-regulation of the HIV- 1 -specific spliced transcript generating a 1. 2 -kbp reverse transcription [RT]-PCR product) as well as viral assembly on the cell membrane. Spliced transcripts (apart from the most abundant transcript generating a 1. 2 -kbp RT-PCR product) arising from an unspliced precursor likely contributed, albeit to a lesser extent, to the antiviral effect. The resultant progeny viruses had infectivities similar to that of input virus. We therefore conclude that these siRNAs interfere with the processing of the unspliced transcripts for the gp 41 gene, tat, rev, and nef, eventually affecting viral assembly and leading to the overall inhibition of viral production. Apart from using the gp 41 gene as a target, the conservation of each of these targets in the above-mentioned viral strains, as well as several primary isolates, would enable these siRNAs to be used as potent antiviral tools for investigations with cells derived from the central nervous system in order to evaluate their therapeutic potential and assess their utility in inhibiting HIV- 1 neuropathogenesis and neuroinvasion...|$|R
40|$|Chimeric viruses {{constructed}} {{between a}} highly pathogenic Feline Immunodeficiency Virus isolate (FIV-C 36) and a less pathogenic but <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strain</b> (FIV-PPR) {{have been used}} to map viral genetic determinants of in vivo pathogenicity. Chimeric virus FIV-PCenv, which contains FIV-C 36 genome from the 3 ' region of pol to upstream of the 3 'LTR on an FIV-PPR backbone, was previously shown to be replication-competent in vivo, inducing altered CD 4 (+) T-cell and neutrophil profiles intermediate between parental strains following a delay in viral replication during initial infection. Examination of FIV-PCenv proviral sequences recovered at week 11 post-infection revealed two changes compared to initial viral inoculum; the most significant being arginine to histidine in the integrase region of Pol at residue 813 (R 813 H). Pooled plasma from the initial in vivo study was used to inoculate a second cohort of cats to determine whether similar virulence and kinetics could be established following primary infection. Viral replication kinetics and immunocyte profiles were monitored in blood, bone marrow, and saliva over a one-year period. Passaged FIV-PCenv again displayed intermediate phenotype between parental strains, but unlike primary experiments, the onset of acute viremia was not delayed. CD 4 / 8 alterations were noted in all groups of animals, though significant changes from controls were delayed in FIV-PPR infected animals compared to FIV-C 36 and FIV-PCenv. In vivo passage of FIV-PCenv increased replication-competence relative to the initial molecularly-cloned chimera in association with one adaptive nucleotide change in the 5 ' end of the genome relative to primary tissue culture inoculum, while mutations in the 3 ' end of the genome were not detected. The results are consistent with the interpretation that 3 ' elements contribute to heightened virulence of FIV-C 36, and that integrase residue 813 {{plays an important role in}} facilitating successful in vivo replication...|$|E
40|$|Chronic measles {{encephalitis}} was induced in C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{with the}} hamster <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strain</b> of measles virus when virus {{which had been}} passaged at low dilution in the brains of suckling C 57 BL/ 6 mice was inoculated intracerebrally into 1 - to 6 -month-old mice. One-third to two-thirds of mice surviving the acute infection were consistently found to develop chronic neurologic dysfunction within 3 weeks to 1 year post-infection. The acute mortality was higher in males than in females and showed a slight decline with increasing age in males. Indirect immunofluorescence (IF) studies using measles virus-specific sera from a subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patient and from a hyperimmune rabbit demonstrated abundant viral antigen in regions of telencephalon and diencephalon correlated {{with the appearance of}} typical central nervous ystem signs in both acute and chronic disease. Viral antigen was found in infected neurons in the grey matter. Deposition of immune complexes was minimal as observed in adjacent brain sections tained with goat anti-mouse antibody by direct IF. Occasional necrotic foci and perivascular cuffing were observed in brains from chronically infected mice. Although several animal models of chronic measles encephalitis have been described (for review, see Fraser & Martin, 1978), neither the mechanisms ofmeasles virus persistence nor the immune responses to the virus have been completely characterized, partly because of the outbred nature of the hosts utilized. Chronic measles encephalitis n an inbred host was first described by Rammohan et al. (1980) with the hamster neurotropic (HNT) strain of measles virus in SJL/J mice. However, SJL/J mice are known to have altered immune functions (McFarlin & Waksman, 1982); therefore, in the present work, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were used to investigate the induction of chronic measles encephalitis by intracerebral (i. c.) infection with mouse-adapted HNT measles virus...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a progressive}} inflammatory and/or demyelinating {{disease of the}} human central nervous system (CNS). Most of the knowledge about the pathogenesis of MS has been derived from murine models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and vital encephalomyelitis. Here, we infected female C 57 BL/ 6 mice with a <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strain</b> of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV- 59 A) to evaluate whether treatment with the multifunctional antioxidant tempol (4 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 1 -piperidinyloxy) affects the ensuing encephalomyelitis. In untreated animals, neurological symptoms developed quickly: 90 % of infected mice died 10 days after virus inoculation and the few survivors presented neurological deficits. Treatment with tempol (24 mg/kg, ip, two doses {{on the first day}} and daily doses for 7 days plus 2 mM tempol in the drinking water ad libitum) profoundly altered the disease outcome: neurological symptoms were attenuated, mouse survival increased up to 70 %, and half of the survivors behaved as normal mice. Not Surprisingly, tempol substantially preserved the integrity of the CNS, including the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, treatment with tempol decreased CNS vital titers, macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration, and levels of markers of inflammation, such as expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, transcription of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, and protein nitration. The results indicate that tempol ameliorates murine viral encephalomyelitis by altering the redox status of the infectious environment that contributes to an attenuated CNS inflammatory response. overall, our study supports the development of therapeutic strategies based on nitroxides to manage neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a complex}} inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that affects {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) white matter, and for which no effective cure exists. Indeed, whether the primary event in MS pathology affects myelin or axons of the CNS remains unclear. Animal models are necessary to identify the immunopathological mechanisms involved in MS and to develop novel therapeutic and reparative approaches. Specifically, viral models of chronic demyelination and axonal damage have been used to study the contribution of viruses in human MS, and they have led to important breakthroughs in our understanding of MS pathology. The Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model {{is one of the most}} commonly used MS models, although other viral models are also used, including <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strains</b> of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that induce chronic inflammatory demyelination with similar histological features to those observed in MS. This review will discuss the immunopathological mechanisms involved in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). The TMEV model reproduces a chronic progressive disease due to the persistence of the virus for the entire lifespan in susceptible mice. The evolution and significance of the axonal damage and neuroinflammation, the importance of epitope spread from viral to myelin epitopes, the presence of abortive remyelination and the existence of a brain pathology in addition to the classical spinal cord demyelination, are some of the findings that will be discussed in the context of this TMEV-IDD model. Despite their limitations, viral models remain an important tool to study the etiology of MS, and to understand the clinical and pathological variability associated with this disease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractCells {{expressing the}} spike (S) {{glycoprotein}} of the <b>neurotropic</b> JHM <b>strain</b> (JHMV) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) {{are susceptible to}} lysis by B cells derived from naı̈ve mice, including B cells from perforin-deficient mice. Cytolysis requires interaction of the virus receptor and the viral S glycoprotein, is independent of other viral-induced components, {{and is not a}} unique property of B cells. Neutralizing anti-S-protein monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a mAb specific for the viral receptor inhibit lysis. However, cells infected with an MHV strain unable to induce cell–cell fusion are resistant to lysis and lysis of JHMV-infected cells is inhibited by an anti-S-protein nonneutralizing mAb which prevents S-protein-mediated cell fusion. These data suggest that B cells may function as antibody-independent innate immune response during JHMV infection in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} receptor for the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) {{has been}} identified {{as a member of the}} murine carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family (R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 : 5533 - 5536, 1991). However, the receptor protein was not detected in some of the susceptible mouse tissues. We therefore examined whether other types of MHV receptor might exist. By polymerase chain reaction with the conserved sequences of murine CEA gene family members (mmCGM) as primers, we detected two CEA-encoding RNAs in the mouse liver. One of them (1. 3 kb) encodes mmCGM 1, which has previously been identified as the receptor for MHV, and the other one (0. 8 kb) was shown to encode another member of mouse CGM, mmCGM 2. The sequence analysis showed that mmCGM 2 lacks 564 nucleotides in the middle of the gene compared with mmCGM 1. These two CEA transcripts are probably derived from the same gene by an alternative splicing mechanism. Expression of either of these cDNA clones in COS- 7 cells rendered these cells susceptible to MHV infection, suggesting that not only mmCGM 1 but also mmCGM 2 serves as a receptor for MHV. The mmCGM 2 was the major CEA species in the mouse brain, which is a main target organ for the <b>neurotropic</b> <b>strains</b> of MHV. Very little mmCGM 1 was detected in the mouse brain or in cells of the susceptible mouse astrocytoma cell line DBT. This result indicates that MHV may utilize different CEA molecules as the major receptor in the mouse brain and in the liver. This is a first identification of multiple receptors for a single virus. The presence of different receptors in different tissues may explain the target cell specificity of certain MHVs...|$|R
