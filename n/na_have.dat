5000|$|Year 2004 saw {{the show}} easily {{coasting}} through the ratings after Morning Girls with Kris and Korina folded {{and was replaced}} with Good Morning, Kris and Morning Star in succession.

Year 2005 saw the show competing against Boy Abundas morning talk show Homeboy and Roderick Paulate and Amy Perezs variety show M.R.S. (Most Requested Show) on ABS-CBN, and Chowtime Na! on IBC-13. However, Sis was still the preferred morning talk show of most Filipino viewers, as they clobbered the competition in the ratings.

He served as dean of the College of Business Administration, which was named after him on April 12, 2013 by the University of the Philippines Board of Regents (BOR) as the Cesar E.A. Virata School of Business. Several interest groups, including U.P.

30|$|In this paper, {{the author}} tends to {{demonstrate}} how verba in loco actus plays an important and unique role in the Na’s Daba ritual process, by presenting his own studies on ritual discourse based on a long-term investigation. The Na (also known as the Mosuo People) on the Sichuan-Yunnan Border in the Southwest China have long been a “hotspot” of anthropological and ethnological studies. They call themselves “nazi,” “naRu,” or “nahing,” while “Zi,” “Ru,” and “hing” all refer to “people.” 2 The Na are an agricultural group {{with a population of}} about 30, 000. They mainly live in Muli County and Yanyuan County in Sichuan Province and Zhongdian County (now known as Shangri-La County) and Ninglang County in Yunnan Province. The Na’s kinship system is matrilineal: “lhe” is the basic kinship and economic unit, which is translated as “lignée”; the kinship unit superior to lignée is “sizi,” which means “lineage” (Cai 1997, p. 97 – 99, p. 129 – 132). The <b>Na</b> <b>have</b> their own language, which is a Tibeto-Burman language of the Sino-Tibetan family, but there is no writing system. They are adepts of Tibetan Buddhism since at least the Ming Dynasty (Compile Committee of Yanyuan County Annals 2000, p. 1153). Meanwhile, the <b>Na</b> <b>have</b> their own religious tradition, which is represented by—and named after—the character “Daba,” specialist of ritual and divination.|$|E
