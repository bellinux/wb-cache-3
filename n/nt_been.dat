40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{our experience}} with the circle nephrostomy tube (NT) (Cook Medical), a drainage system uniquely designed for use after multiple-access percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). Methods A retrospective review of 1317 consecutive patients undergoing 1599 PNLs at IU Health Methodist Hospital was performed. All multiple access cases utilizing circle <b>NTs</b> <b>were</b> reviewed and analyzed. The method of insertion of circle <b>NT</b> <b>was</b> demonstrated. Results A total of 1843 accesses were obtained in 1599 renal units (RUs) : 380 upper pole, 129 interpolar, and 1334 lower pole. Multiple accesses in this series were required in 282 RUs (17. 6 %). Following multiple-access PNL, circle NTs, Cope loop, and reentry Malecot <b>NTs</b> <b>were</b> inserted in 91 RUs (32. 3 %), 208 RUs (73. 8 %), and 31 RUs (11 %), respectively.

40|$|AbstractPhe–Phe {{nanotube}} internalization in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells is}} imaged through the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) study. Size-selective separation of peptide nanotubes (<b>NTs)</b> <b>is</b> {{of great value}} {{when we think about}} its application in biocompatible drug delivery. This paper describes a simple size-selective separation protocol for separating Phe–Phe NTs. During the synthesis, it is commonly observed that peptide <b>NTs</b> <b>are</b> formed with a range of sizes in their width and length and hence easy separation techniques of <b>NTs</b> <b>are</b> essential. Removal of the monomers from <b>NTs</b> <b>is</b> also important. Microscopic imaging of peptide <b>NTs</b> <b>is</b> also important in this context and particularly when these are used in the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Herein, we report a straightforward size-selective separation of peptide NTs by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and imaging the fractions through TEM, confocal, and deconvolution microscopic techniques. Here, we report, for the first time, use of deconvolution fluorescence microscopy to detect NTs. As commonly used photo microscope cannot resolve the images of very small particles (e. g., less than micron scale), electron microscopy is widely used in imaging of NPs. Hence, systematic peptide NTs separation followed by these characterization techniques provides an option to study the internalization of NTs inside cells. Intake of peptide <b>NTs</b> inside cells <b>is</b> promising for their use in drug delivery as well as in imaging study...|$|R

40|$|Neurotensin (<b>NT)</b> <b>is</b> a peptide {{expressed}} {{in the brain and}} in the gastrointestinal tract. Brain NT inhibits food intake, but the effects of peripheral <b>NT</b> <b>are</b> less investigated. In this study, peripheral NT decreased food intake in both mice and rats, which was abolished by a NT antagonist. Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we found that peripheral NT activated brainstem and hypothalamic regions. The anorexigenic effect of <b>NT</b> <b>was</b> preserved in vagotomized mice but lasted shorter than in sham-operated mice. This in combination with a strong increase in c-Fos activation in area postrema after ip administration indicates that NT acts both through the blood circulation and the vagus. To improve the pharmacokinetics of NT, we developed a pegylated NT peptide, which presumably prolonged the half-life, and thus, the effect on feeding was extended compared with native NT. On a molecular level, the pegylated NT peptide increased proopiomelanocortin mRNA in the arcuate nucleus. We also investigated the importance of NT for the decreased food intake after gastric bypass surgery in a rat model of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). <b>NT</b> <b>was</b> increased in plasma and in the gastrointestinal tract in RYGB rats, and pharmacological antagonism of NT increased food intake transiently in RYGB rats. Taken together, our data suggest that <b>NT</b> <b>is</b> a metabolically active hormone, which contributes to the regulation of food intake...|$|R

Serial sections were analyzed histologically with routine Hematoxylene-eozin staining. Results: In normal embryos, the <b>Nt</b> <b>was</b> formed as a discrete axial structure in front of the neural tube and enveloped by perinotochordal mesenchyme.
