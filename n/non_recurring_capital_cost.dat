40|$|American {{consumers}} make {{a number}} of decisions that significantly impact their energy use. Some {{of the most important}} of these decisions were identified and analyzed for the purpose of including them in a Consumer Energy Decisions Model (CEDM). These decisions included housing choices that affect space heating, water heating, solar photovoltaic and transportation. The CEDM was used to calculate values of <b>recurring</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> for all permutations of all the decision components for New York City, Minneapolis and Seattle. These results were analyzed using Pareto plots of <b>recurring</b> versus <b>capital</b> <b>cost.</b> There was a wide range of costs associated with the different solutions, indicating that there is tremendous value in making good energy decisions. The type of vehicle showed the most notable effect on return on investment. Four vehicles were analyzed, a Toyota Camry, Camry Hybrid, Jetta Turbo Diesel (TDI) and an electric Nissan Leaf. The hybrid showed the worst return on investment relative to the Camry with a payback rate of about 9 years, while the TDI and Leaf had payback rates of 1 - 2 and 6 - 10 years relative to the Camry, with the added benefits of using less energy and emitting less CO₂. Housing choices were the next most favorable investments, with payback rates around 10 years for the most economical choices. They showed good returns at some points but showed diminishing returns as continued improvements were made. Finally, the solar PV and solar hot water options are bad investments for the sites analyzed, which receive much less sunlight than other parts of the country. The effects of incentives and tax credits were not analyzed in this study. by Nicholas Daniel Sisler. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Large-scale {{displacement}} of petroleum {{will come from}} low-cost cellulosic feedstocks such as straw and corn stover crop residues. This project has taken a step toward making this projection a reality by reducing <b>capital</b> and energy <b>costs,</b> the two largest cost factors associated with converting cellulosic biomass to chemicals and fuels. The technology exists for using acid or enzyme hydrolysis processes to convert biomass feedstock (i. e., waste cellulose such as straw, corn stover, and wood) into their base monomeric sugar building blocks, which can, in turn, be processed into chemicals and fuels using a number of innovative fermentation technologies. However, while these processes are technically possible, practical and economic barriers make these processes only marginally feasible or not feasible at all. These barriers are {{due in part to}} the complexity and large fixed and <b>recurring</b> <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> of unit operations including filtration, chromatographic separation, and ion exchange. This project was designed to help remove these barriers by developing and implementing new purification and separation technologies that will reduce the <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> of the purification and chromatographic separation units by 50 % to 70 %. The technologies fundamental to these improvements are: (a) highly efficient clarification and purification systems that use screening and membrane filtration to eliminate suspended solids and colloidal material from feed streams and (b) fractal technology based chromatographic separation and ion exchange systems that can substitute for conventional systems but at much smaller size and cost. A non-hazardous ''raw sugar beet juice'' stream (75 to 100 gal/min) was used for prototype testing of these technologies. This raw beet juice stream from the Amalgamated Sugar LLC plant in Twin Falls, Idaho contained abrasive materials and membrane foulants. Its characteristics were representative of an industrial-scale heterogeneous plant extract/hydrolysis stream, and therefore was an ideal model system for developing new separation equipment. Subsequent testing used both synthetic acid hydrolysate and corn stover derived weak acid hydrolysate (NREL produced). A two-phased approach was used for the research and development described in this project. The first level of study involved testing the new concepts at the bench level. The bench-scale evaluations provided fundamental understanding of the processes, building and testing small prototype systems, and determining the efficiency of the novel processes. The second level of study, macro-level, required building larger systems that directly simulated industrial operations and provided validation of performance to minimize financial risk during commercialization. The project goals and scope included: (1) Development of low-capital alternatives to conventional crop-based purification/separation processes; and (2) Development of each process to the point that transition to commercial operation is low risk. The project reporting period was January 2001 to December 2004. This included a one year extension of the project (without additional funding) ...|$|R

These concepts involve a range of technology risks, the highest risk being represented by the thermophotovoltaics and spectrophotovoltaics approaches which involve manipulation to of the incoming spectrum to enhance system efficiency. The planar array (solar blanket) has no technology risk and a moderate payback. The primary characteristics, components, and technology concerns of each of these concepts are summarized.

30|$|This <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> {{method is}} {{comparable}} to the method in GETEM with a few simplifications. GETEM considers a more detailed exploration, development and construction scheme where <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> can be distributed over different years, and different discount rates can be assigned to different years. In GEOPHIRES, we consider the <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> occur overnight and a lumped <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> multiplier is available to capture effects such as <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> escalation and debt on interest during construction. Further, unlike GETEM, GEOPHIRES does not consider <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> for leasing, permitting and transmission lines. However, they could be manually added by the user as an additional <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> term. While GEOPHIRES v 1.0 only considered 15 % contingency on drilling <b>costs,</b> all <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> terms in GEOPHIRES v 2.0 now consider 15 % to align with more standard practices (as in GETEM). Similar to GETEM, no process contingency is considered in GEOPHIRES v 2.0. However, if deemed applicable to a project, the user can manually account for process contingency by assigning a multiplier to the <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> correlations (e.g., 1.2 for 20 % process contingency).|$|R

40|$|Low-carbon {{electricity}} generation, i. e. renewable energy, {{nuclear power}} and carbon capture and storage, is more capital intensive than electricity generation through carbon emitting fossil fuel power stations. High <b>capital</b> <b>costs,</b> expressed as high weighted average <b>cost</b> of <b>capital</b> (WACC), thus tend {{to encourage the}} use of fossil fuels. To achieve the same degree of decarbonization, countries with high <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> therefore need to impose a higher price on carbon emissions than countries with low <b>capital</b> <b>costs.</b> This is particularly relevant for developing and emerging economies, where <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> tend to be higher than in rich countries. In this paper we quantitatively evaluate how high <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> impact the transformation of the energy system under climate policy, applying a numerical techno-economic model of the power system. We find that high <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> can significantly reduce the effectiveness of carbon prices: if carbon emissions are priced at USD 50 per ton and the WACC is 3 %, the cost-optimal electricity mix comprises 40 % renewable energy. At the same carbon price and a WACC of 15 %, the cost-optimal mix comprises almost no renewable energy. At 15 % WACC, there is no significant emission mitigation with carbon pricing up to USD 50 per ton, but at 3 % WACC and the same carbon price, emissions are reduced by almost half. These results have implications for climate policy; carbon pricing might need to be combined with policies to reduce <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> of low-carbon options in order to decarbonize power systems...|$|R
