5000|$|After {{showing a}} {{prototype}} labelled [...] "HP 15c+" [...] at the HHC 2010, HP announced the HP 15c Limited Edition (NW250AA) on 1 September 2011. It {{is based on}} a flashable controller utilizing the same ARM7TDMI core already used in the 2008 revision of the 12C but in a different package, an Atmel AT91SAM7L128-AU running an emulator written by Cyrille de Br√©bisson to execute the old HP <b>Nut</b> <b>code</b> much faster than on the original hardware. The calculator was released alongside the HP 12c 30th Anniversary Edition. This model is powered by two CR2032 batteries, and can easily be differentiated from the original model by the [...] "Limited Edition" [...] script below the company logo as well as the black text on brushed metal back label, as opposed to the white text on black of the original.|$|R

5000|$|The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a geocode {{standard}} for referencing the subdivisions of Ireland for statistical purposes. The standard is developed and {{regulated by the}} European Union. The NUTS standard is instrumental in delivering the European Union's Structural Funds. The <b>NUTS</b> <b>code</b> for Ireland is IE and a hierarchy of three levels is established by Eurostat. Below this are two further levels of geographic organisation - the Local administrative unit. In Ireland, the LAU-1 subdivisions correspond to an administrative division within the country. The LAU-2 level is not used for local government purposes.|$|E
50|$|The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a geocode {{standard}} for referencing the subdivisions of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for statistical purposes. The <b>NUTS</b> <b>code</b> for the UK is UK {{and there are}} 12 first level regions within the state. Within the UK, there are 9 such regions in England, together with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The standard is developed and regulated by the European Union (EU). The NUTS standard is instrumental in delivering the EU's Structural Funds. A hierarchy of three levels is established by Eurostat. The sub-structure corresponds to administrative divisions within the country. Formerly, the further NUTS divisions (IV and V) existed; these have now been replaced by Local administrative unit (LAU-1 and LAU-2 respectively).|$|E

50|$|For each EU member country, a {{hierarchy}} of three NUTS levels is established by Eurostat in agreement with each member state; the subdivisions in some levels do not necessarily correspond to administrative divisions within the country. A <b>NUTS</b> <b>code</b> begins with a two-letter code referencing the country, which {{is identical to the}} ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (except UK instead of GB for the United Kingdom and EL instead of GR for Greece). The subdivision of the country is then referred to with one number. A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. Where the subdivision has more than nine entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering. A similar statistical system is defined for the candidate countries and members of the European Free Trade Association, but they are not technically part of NUTS governed by the regulations.|$|E
