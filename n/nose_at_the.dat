5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact that}} Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{served to}} protect Sutton Pool, {{which is where}} the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the {{establishment}} of Plymouth Dockyard. In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth. A series of fortifications were built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers <b>Nose</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596; it was the site of the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).|$|E

25|$|The {{excitement}} and {{interest of the}} dying game now centred around the batting performance of Alan Knott. His last day survival {{was more than just}} occupation of the crease.

It was a magnificent solo effort of defiance.|$|E

As the Yankee fans booed Stengel, he thumbed his <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd and blew a kiss toward the Yankee players, outraging the team's principal owner, Jacob Ruppert, who demanded that Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis fine or suspend Stengel. Judge Landis declined, [...] "a man who wins two games with home runs may feel a little playful, especially if he's a Stengel".

500|$|Looking {{for a new}} {{headquarters}} Comcast asked Arden Group and Mariner Commercial Properties to {{work together}} and combine the properties into one building. The two developers briefly held discussions about combining the two sites, but by 2001 no agreement was reached and both developers had decided to move on with their own towers. As they sought to build competing condominium towers, {{the relationship between the two}} developers soon turned into a feud between the firm's lead partners, Craig Spencer of Arden Group and Tim Mahoney of Mariner Commercial Properties. In 2003 Mahoney received permission from the City Zoning Board of Adjustment to build a 50-story residential tower at the 1441 Chestnut Street site. At the zoning hearing Spencer attempted to block approval by saying the building was too tall and that it would damage his site by blocking views and casting shadows. He also said the tower was [...] "snubbing his <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> traditional zone of respect around City Hall." [...] Spencer filed a lawsuit to block construction of the building and a Court of Common Pleas ruled that the Zoning Board erred in approving 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner appealed the ruling.|$|E
500|$|The {{small head}} of Massospondylus was {{approximately}} half {{the length of}} the femur. Numerous openings, or fenestrae, in the skull reduced its weight and provided space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. These fenestrae were present in pairs, one {{on each side of the}} skull. At the front of the skull were two large, elliptical nares, which were roughly half the size of the orbits. The orbits were proportionally larger in Massospondylus than in related genera, such as Plateosaurus. The antorbital fenestrae, smaller than those seen in Plateosaurus, were situated between the eyes and the <b>nose.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> rear of the skull were two more pairs of temporal fenestrae: the lateral temporal fenestrae immediately behind the eye sockets, which were shaped like an inverted [...] "T" [...] in Massospondylus, and the supratemporal fenestrae on top of the skull. Small fenestrae also penetrated each mandible. The shape of the skull is traditionally restored as wider and shorter than that of Plateosaurus, but this appearance may be due just to differential crushing experienced by the various specimens. Some features of the skull are variable between individuals; for example, the thickness of the upper border of the orbit and the height of the posterior maxilla. These differences may be due to sexual dimorphism or individual variation.|$|E

2500|$|Chrysler {{made many}} {{attempts}} at improving the aerodynamics of the 500 by adding noses {{rumored to be}} up to [...] long. The Charger Daytona finally received an [...] nose. The full size Charger Daytona was tested with an [...] <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Lockheed-Martin Georgia facility. The test was a success and the project was greenlighted. The nose piece was only part of the innovation. The Charger Daytona also received a [...] tall wing in rear. This wing was bolted through the rear quarter panels and into the rear subframe. Although proven to be less effective than shorter wing designs, the engineer responsible {{for the development of the}} wing, John Pointer, chose the tall design so the wing would be in [...] "clean air" [...] to help increase the car's overall speed. That the tall wing prevents interference with operation of the trunk lid can be considered a fortunate coincidence. The tall wing also helped out in another unintended way, by giving the car directional stability due to its deeply splinted sides.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} description refers {{mainly to}} the external anatomy of the common European shrimp, Crangon crangon, as a typical example of a decapod shrimp. The body of the shrimp {{is divided into two}} main parts: the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax, and a long narrow abdomen. The shell which protects the cephalothorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp and is called the carapace. The carapace typically surrounds the gills, through which water is pumped by the action of the mouthparts. The rostrum, eyes, whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace. The rostrum, from the Latin rōstrum meaning beak, looks like a beak or pointed <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of the shrimp's head. It is a rigid forward extension of the carapace and can be used for attack or defense. It may also stabilize the shrimp when it swims backward. Two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum. These are compound eyes which have panoramic vision and are very good at detecting movement. Two pairs of whiskers (antennae) also issue from the head. One of these pairs is very long and can be twice the length of the shrimp, while the other pair is quite short. The antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they touch, and also allow them to [...] "smell" [...] or [...] "taste" [...] things by sampling the chemicals in the water. The long antennae help the shrimp orient itself with regard to its immediate surroundings, while the short antennae help assess the suitability of prey.|$|E
