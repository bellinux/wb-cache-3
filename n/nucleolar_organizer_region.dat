40|$|Background: Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> {{is higher}} in {{malignant}} nuclei as compared to reactive and benign nuclei. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the role of Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> and its extent in differentiating benign and malignant lesions, particularly with respect to follicular neoplasms of the thyroid. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, cross sectional study which included 110 patients presenting with thyroid swelling. The fi ne needle aspiration smears were studied by conventional methods and silver staining for Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region.</b> In 50 cases, diagnosis was confi rmed by histopathology. The Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> count was done and the mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> count per nucleus was calculated along with pattern of distribution. Results: Mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> count was higher in neoplastic as compared to non-neoplastic and infl ammatory lesions. Papillary carcinoma had the highest mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> count (5. 40 ± 0. 86) and the lowest count was seen in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (2. 10 ± 0. 36). Higher mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> count was recorded in follicular carcinoma (4. 84 ± 1. 42) as compared to follicular adenoma (3. 5 ± 0. 27) which was found to be statistically signifi cant (P< 0. 05). Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> dots were arranged in clusters in colloid goiter whereas scattered discrete black dots were seen in neoplastic lesions. Conclusion: Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> study of thyroid can be used as an additional diagnostic adjunct with cytomorphological features to differentiate benign and malignant follicular neoplasms.

40|$|DNA was {{prepared}} from wild-type and two mutant stocks of Drosophila melanogaster that differed in their dosage of the <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region.</b> The relative amounts of DNA from the <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> in these preparations of DNA {{were determined by}} hybridization with 3 H-labelled 28 S rRNA. As expected, the amount of 3 H-labelled 28 S rRNA that hybridized was {{directly related to the}} dosage of <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region.</b> No positive correlation was observed between the amount of 3 H-labelled 5 S RNA that hybridized and the dosage of <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region.</b> Thus genes for 5 S RNA are located primarily, if not exclusively, outside the <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region.</b> The haploid genome of the wild-type D. melanogaster used in this work has 106 genes for 28 S rRNA and 96 – 105 genes for 5 S RNA...|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} {{pattern of}} the C-heterochromatin and <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> (nOr) distribution, both between and within two cytotypes of M. arvalis with 46 chromosomes, are described. The positive C-bands were observed on six or seven small bi-armed autosomal pairs and in two, three or four acrocentric autosomal pairs. Only a small dark C-band was observed in the acrocentric homologue from a large heteromorphic autosomal pair in the complement of specimens belonging to the obscurus cytotype. The <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> was localized in the secondary constrictions in three autosomal pair in the specimens of the obscurus cytotype.

40|$|Recombinant human interferon-gamma was {{administered}} intradermally (10 micrograms in 0. 1 ml) to healthy adult human volunteers from day 1 to day 3, and epidermal cell proliferation was measured on whole skin biopsies at day 6. Three independent parameters were assessed, namely, a) epidermal keratin- 16 expression, b) keratinocyte proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and c) keratinocyte silver <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> counts. Significantly increased {{scores for each}} parameter were observed after interferon-gamma injection (P < 0. 01 in each case) compared to site-matched controls. Keratin- 16 expression was confined to suprabasal epidermis, whereas proliferating cell nuclear antigen and silver <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> counts were particularly elevated in the basal epidermis.

40|$|The volumic {{rearrangement}} of both chromosomes and immunolabeled upstream binding {{factor in}} entire well-preserved mitotic cells was studied by confocal microscopy.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the quantification of the <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>regions</b> (AgNORs) is a useful parameter for evaluation of the proliferative potential of non-neoplastic granulosa cells in ovarian follicles at different stages of development. Seven ovaries from six-month-old rats, all of which in metestrus-diestrus, were studied. The number of AgNORs from 60 granulosa cell nuclei was quantified in secondary follicles with two to three layers of cells and in follicles with more than five layers of granulosa cells. Follicles with two to three layers had larger AgNORs in lower numbers, whereas more developed secondary follicles the AgNORs were predominantly smaller, scattered throughout the nucleus, and in significantly higher numbers. In conclusion, quantification of the <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>regions</b> is an appropriate parameter for differentiation of the proliferative potential of non-neoplastic granulosa cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of daughter nuclei and the re{{formation of}} nucleolar structures was studied after microinjection of antibodies to RNA polymerase I into dividing cultured cells (PtK 2). The fate of several nucleolar proteins representing {{the three main}} structural subcomponents of the nucleolus was examined by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The {{results show that the}} RNA polymerase I antibodies do not interfere with normal mitotic progression or the early steps of nucleologenesis, i. e., the aggregation of nucleolar material into prenucleolar bodies. However, they inhibit the telophasic coalescence of the prenucleolar bodies into the chromosomal <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>regions,</b> thus preventing the formation of new nucleoli. These prenucleolar bodies show a fibrillar organization that also compositionally resembles the dense fibrillar component of interphase nucleoli. We conclude that during normal nucleologenesis the dense fibrillar component forms from preformed entities around <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>regions,</b> and that this association seems to be dependent on the presence of an active form of RNA polymerase I...|$|R

The testicles are rounded (Veliidae), elongated (Gerridae) or spiral (Notonectidae) {{and have a}} transparent membrane covering them. The complement chromosome was 2 n = 23 (22 A + X 0, L. aduncus and Rhagovelia sp), 25 (24 A + X 0, B. albinerva and H. platensis), 26 (22 A + 2 m + XY, Martarega sp), 29 (28 A + X 0, C. palmaris), or 39 (38 A + X 0, R. whitei) chromosomes, and the only species with a different sex chromosome system was Martarega sp, which showed an XY system and m-chromosomes. The meiotic behavior of all species was similar: holocentric chromosomes and heteropyknotic material at prophase, interstitial and/or terminal chiasmata, and first reductional division for the autosomes and the reverse for the sex chromosomes. The only difference observed {{was related to the}} very large size of Martarega sp cells in all stages of spermatogenesis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relationship}} between the population doubling time and the quantity of silver-stained <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> <b>region</b> (AgNOR) interphase proteins was studied in cell culture at three different temperatures used to modulate the cell cycle duration. METHODS: After MIB 1 and AgNOR combined staining, the quantity of AgNOR proteins was measured in cycling cells by image cytometry.
