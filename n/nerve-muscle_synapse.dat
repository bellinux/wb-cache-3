Recently, we have demonstrated that agrin, a multidomain heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a crucial role in the development of the <b>nerve-muscle</b> <b>synapse,</b> binds to the three-stranded coiled-coil domain of laminin- 1. The interaction with laminin mediates the integration of agrin into basement membranes. Here we characterize the binding site within the laminin- 1 coiled coil in detail. Binding assays with individual laminin- 1 full-length chains and fragments revealed that agrin specifically interacts with the gamma 1 subunit of laminin- 1, whereas no binding to alpha 1 and beta 1 chains was detected. By using recombinant gamma 1 chain fragments, we mapped the binding site to a sequence of 20 residues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a coiled-coil conformation of this binding site is required for its interaction with agrin. The finding that recombinant gamma 1 fragments bound at least 10 -fold less than native laminin- 1 indicates that the structure of the three-stranded coiled-coil domain of laminin is required for high-affinity agrin binding.

Endosomes formed rapidly (1 – 2 s) at all frequencies, concomitant with clathrin-mediated vesicular endocytosis (CME). Endosomes dissipated rapidly into vesicles (∼ 10 s).

Vesicles budded from these smaller endosomes, from large endosomes that had not undergone fission into smaller ones, and from precursor membrane infoldings that had not yet internalized. In snake, exocytosed vesicular membrane is not competent for reuse until after a delay (> 3 min). We found that time required for endosome processing is not responsible for this delay. Endosome processing might, however, limit availability of some vesicles for release at very high levels of use.

After a motor neuron is stimulated, the nerve impulse reaches the presynaptic terminal, where it evokes release of acetylcholine (ACh) into the synapse. The nAChR depolarizes the postsynaptic muscle and triggers muscle action potentials; muscle contraction follows.

In the postsynaptic membrane, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are highly concentrated for effective communication between presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. Over the past decades, a significant progress has been made to understand the signaling molecules and their signaling pathways involved in the anchoring and clustering of AChRs in the postsynaptic membrane at developing NMJs. However, the mechanisms underlying the dynamic trafficking of AChRs to/from the postsynaptic membrane remain unclear. Using Xenopus primary culture system together with molecular manipulation techniques, we found that actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) /cofilin regulated actin-dependent vesicular trafficking of AChRs to the postsynaptic membrane. Active ADF/cofilin was concentrated in small puncta adjacent to AChR clusters and was spatiotemporally correlated with the formation and maintenance of surface AChR clusters. Furthermore, during the pathogenic mechanisms of AChR endocytosis in myasthenia gravis, the disappearance of ADF/cofilin was closely correlated to the disassembly of AChR clusters induced by the treatment of pathogenic antibodies.

40|$|The precise {{orchestration}} of synaptic differentiation {{is critical}} for efficient information exchange in the nervous system. The <b>nerve–muscle</b> <b>synapse</b> forms in response to agrin, which is secreted from the motor nerve terminal and induces the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and {{other elements of the}} postsynaptic apparatus on the subjacent muscle cell surface. In view of the highly restricted spatial localization and the plasticity of neuromuscular junctions, it seems likely that synapse formation and maintenance are regulated by additional, as-yet-unidentified factors. Here, we tested whether neurotrophins modulate the agrin-induced differentiation of postsynaptic specializations. We show that both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 4 (NT- 4) inhibit agrin-induced AChR clustering on cultured myotubes. Nerve growth factor and NT- 3 are without effect. Muscle cells express full-length TrkB, the cognate receptor for BDNF and NT- 4. Direct activation of this receptor by anti-TrkB antibodies mimicked the BDNF/NT- 4 inhibition of agrin-induced AChR clustering. This BDNF/NT- 4 inhibition is likely to be an intrinsic mechanism for regulating AChR clustering, because neutralization of endogenous TrkB ligands resulted in elevated levels of AChR clustering {{even in the absence of}} added agrin. Finally, high concentrations of agrin can occlude the BDNF/NT- 4 inhibition of AChR clustering. These results indicate that an interplay between agrin and neurotrophins can regulate the formation of postsynaptic specializations. They also suggest a mechanism for the suppression of postsynaptic specializations at nonjunctional regions...|$|E

40|$|The {{nervous system}} {{requires}} rapid, efficient, and accurate transmission between cells for proper functioning. Synapses are the predominant structures through which such vital communication occurs. How synapses are formed, maintained, and eliminated are questions of fundamental importance. At the <b>nerve-muscle</b> <b>synapse,</b> {{formation of the}} postsynaptic apparatus is directed by agrin. The hallmark activity of agrin is the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) into dense clusters opposite the presynaptic nerve terminal. Early events in the agrin signal transduction cascade include activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK and tyrosine phosphorylation of AChRs, but how these events lead to AChR cluster formation is unknown. Using the calcium buffer BAPTA, we demonstrate that intracellular calcium fluxes are necessary for agrin-induced formation of AChR clusters. However, clamping calcium fluxes before agrin stimulation does not alter agrin-induced phosphorylation of either MuSK or AChRs, indicating that this calcium-dependent step occurs downstream of both MuSK and AChR phosphorylation. These results identify a new step in the agrin signaling pathway required {{for the formation of}} AChR clusters. We show that intracellular calcium fluxes also {{play an important role in}} stabilizing AChR clusters. Clamping intracellular calcium fluxes results in rapid dispersal of AChR clusters and dephosphorylation of both MuSK and AChRs, even if agrin is continually present. Furthermore, the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate inhibits both the dispersal and dephosphorylation, indicating a role for a tyrosine phosphatase in AChR cluster dispersal. Our data indicate that AChR clusters are maintained by agrin/MuSK-induced intracellular calcium fluxes that tonically inhibit a tyrosine phosphatase localized to AChR clusters. Our findings also show that distinct molecular mechanisms mediate the formation and the dispersal of agrin-induced AChR clusters. The work presented here expands our understanding of synaptic differentiation in several ways. First, I characterized a new, calcium-dependent step required for the formation of agrin-induced AChR clusters. Next, I showed that postsynaptic specializations must be actively maintained, and describe a molecular mechanism that stabilizes AChR clusters. Finally, dispersal and formation of AChR clusters occurs by distinct pathways. Our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the formation and modulation of synapses will help us to better understand how the nervous system develops and responds to the world around us...|$|E

Repetitive stimulation of either the presynaptic neuron or the postsynaptic myocyte led to a potentiation of synaptic transmission at M+ synapses. All potentiation effects of NT- 4 overexpression were abolished by the extracellular presence of TrkB-IgG but not by the presence of TrkA-IgG, indicating that postsynaptic secretion of NT- 4 was responsible for the synaptic modification...|$|R
5000|$|His {{laboratory}} studies of nerve systems, the electrophysiology and biochemistry of <b>nerve-muscle</b> contacts and <b>synapses</b> {{in the brain}} led {{to a range of}} interesting findings and discoveries, among others concerning the effect of adrenalin and noradrenalin on improving the effectiveness of nerve connections and non-quantal discharge of neurotransmitters. He is the author and co-author of 450 publications, 180 of which in international journals including Nature. He wrote the book [...] "Nerve-Muscle connections" [...] in 1990 and, together with MUDr. J. Slavíček, the English monograph [...] "Monophasis Action potential of the Heart, Experimental and Clinical Aspects" [...] in 2005. In 1977, through his groundbreaking discoveries he founded a physiological scientific school {{for the study of the}} non-quantal release of neurotransmitters, presented an integrated theory of this second main mechanism for the transfer of information at nerve and muscle synapses (the location of signal transmission). This field was not only developed in his laboratory and among his many co-workers, but also at several other universities. His concept of the mechanism of the origin and activity of diffusive non-quantal release is part of the neurobiology textbook and is taught at many universities.|$|R
