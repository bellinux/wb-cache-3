5000|$|Salter's duck, {{also known}} as the <b>nodding</b> <b>duck</b> or by its {{official}} name the Edinburgh duck, is a device that converts wave power into electricity. The wave impact induces rotation of gyroscopes located inside a pear-shaped [...] "duck", and an electrical generator converts this rotation into electricity with an overall efficiency of up to 90%. The Salter's duck was invented by Stephen Salter in response to the oil shortage in the 1970s {{and was one of the}} earliest generator designs proposed to the Wave Energy program in the United Kingdom. The funding for the project was cut off in the early 1980s after oil prices rebounded and the UK government moved away from alternative energy sources. As of 2008 no wave-power devices have ever gone into large-scale production.|$|E
5000|$|While {{historic}} {{references to}} the power of waves do exist, the modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was begun in the 1970s by Stephen Salter, in response to the Oil Crisis. His 1974 invention became known as Salter's Duck or <b>Nodding</b> <b>Duck,</b> although it was officially referred to as the [...] "Edinburgh Duck". In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity. According to sworn testimony before the House of Parliament, The UK Wave Energy programme was shut down on 19 March 1982, in a closed meeting. An analysis of Salter's Duck resulted in a miscalculation of the estimated cost of energy production by a factor of 10, an error which was only recently identified. Some wave power advocates believe that this error, combined with a general lack of enthusiasm for renewable energy in the 1980s (after oil prices fell), hindered the advancement of wave power technology.|$|E
