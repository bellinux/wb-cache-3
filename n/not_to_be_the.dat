5|$|In 1942 Ernst Lubitsch {{directed}} a motion picture titled To Be or <b>Not</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be.</b> <b>The</b> {{story is a}} comedy about a troupe of Polish actors in the Nazi era. A key plot point revolves around the famous soliloquy. The story was remade in 1983 in a film starring (and produced by) Mel Brooks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E

5|$|In January 1973, {{hope was}} renewed when the Paris Peace Accord was signed, ending the {{conflict}} (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted {{in hopes of}} securing a chance for peace. It was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription and, in April, insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes. The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.|$|E
5|$|Many fans {{hoped to}} see him play for Italy at Euro 2004, or with the 2004 Olympic squad that {{eventually}} managed a Bronze medal, but this was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case. However, he was given an international send-off by Trapattoni at age 37 in a friendly match against Spain on 28 April 2004, in which he wore the number 10 shirt for the final time, {{as well as the}} captain's armband for part of the match. Although Baggio entertained the crowd with his creativity and skill, he was unable to score, despite winning a free-kick from which Vieri's equalising goal arose. The match finished 1–1 and Baggio was given a standing ovation after being substituted off for Fabrizio Miccoli. This was Baggio's 56th and final match for Italy, {{and it was the first}} time an Italian footballer's career had been celebrated this way since Silvio Piola retired.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{praised by}} the Emperor {{and the people}} of China, who all bow to her, an {{unprecedented}} honor. Mulan accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts but politely declines his offer to be his advisor and instead asks to return to her family. She returns home and presents the imperial gifts to her father, but he is more overjoyed to have his daughter back safely. Li Shang, who has become enamored with Mulan, soon arrives under the guise of returning her helmet but accepts the family's invitation for dinner. Earlier in the film, Mulan was declared unfit for marriage, but this now appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case with her strong budding romance with Li Shang. Mushu is granted a position as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration.|$|E

5|$|The Dissenters {{proposed}} Robert Webb, who {{had previously}} served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. The recent history of the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. That however proved <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case, {{and a group of}} Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb did not want the expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving the Dissenters without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund.|$|E
5|$|The only {{disagreements}} {{were over}} {{the size and}} range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> barrier it might seem; common components {{could be used in}} both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed. The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time {{it was clear that the}} two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus engines, being developed for the TSR-2, allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.|$|E
5|$|This however was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of General Nansouty's {{action at}} the great Battle of Wagram. Although the great cavalry attack had done much to ease the {{pressure}} on Napoleon's left-centre, the latter's situation remained critical. The Emperor thus launched the Corps of General Jacques MacDonald in an attack against the Austrian right-centre. MacDonald's attack formation, formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought, was a huge infantry attack column or square, comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for Napoleonic warfare. Four squadrons of Nansouty's carabiniers-à-cheval were sent to support the flank of this attack, {{with the rest of}} his division further back. Realising that his advance is hampered by intense Austrian artillery fire, MacDonald aimed to clear the enemy guns before him, asking for a cavalry charge from Walther's Guard cavalry on his right and Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division on his left. With no direct orders from the Emperor and his commander, Marshal Bessières, out of action, Walther opted not to move, while Nansouty did send his men forward but, having been positioned too far back, he arrived only after the enemy guns had moved away.|$|E

5|$|With Western Europe neutralised, the OKL and OKW {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Britain, which was now home to the Allied base of operations in Europe. Hitler hoped Britain would negotiate for an armistice, for which he was prepared to offer generous terms. The tentative offers made by Hitler were rejected by the Churchill coalition government. Hitler now ordered the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to prepare for an amphibious assault of Britain, codenamed Operation Sealion. The Luftwaffe was to eliminate enemy air power and the Kriegsmarine was ordered to make all the necessary preparations for transporting the Heer (Army) across the English Channel. The Luftwaffe's task came first. Once the RAF had been rendered impotent, Göring and Hitler hoped that an invasion would be unnecessary. If this proved <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case, the Luftwaffe would then support the army and prevent the Royal Navy interdicting German sea traffic. Göring named the offensive against the RAF as Operation Eagle Attack (Adlerangriff).|$|E
