5|$|Unfortunately, all has transpired {{according}} to Shockwave's plans: the Ammonites, Lost Light and Necrotitan were pupeteered {{to ensure that}} Metroplex would return to Cybertron and bring {{the last of the}} ores with him, while Optimus Prime was deliberately lured into the Dead Universe so that he could destroy Nova Prime and remove his control over it. Using all of his combined ores, fueled by the energy of the Dead Universe — channeled through an unwitting Galvatron — Shockwave intends to bend space and time to his will, collapsing all of reality into a singularity that will be used to feed Cybertron for eternity. As the majority of the Autobots and Decepticons battle the colossal Ammonite army Shockwave summons to the planet, a small team ventures into Crystal City to confront him, where they are soon rejoined by Optimus Prime's team, who emerge through a portal within the unknowingly-undead Brainstorm. Metalhawk sacrifices himself to unbalance the ore equation, destroying the Ammonites, while Bumblebee is killed by Shockwave; inspired by the words and the sacrifice of his <b>new</b> <b>friend,</b> Megatron dons the Autobot symbol, an action that throws Shockwave into confusion. The scientist's loss of focus causes him to lose control of his chronal drive, setting his mind adrift in time and resulting in the re-emergence of his pre-Shadowplay self. Horrified at what he has become, Shockwave allows Optimus and Megatron to kill him, destroying the drive and bringing an end to his plan.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{campaign}}— The Chinese campaign focuses loosely on the 1421 hypothesis and {{is about}} a Chinese treasure ship discovering the New World before Christopher Columbus. The story mainly focuses on Jian Huang, a Ming captain who has long dreamed of seeing the outside world, and his partner and <b>new</b> <b>friend,</b> Lao Chen, a large, powerful, and crude sailor, who are given orders to help expand the Ming Empire. In the beginning, the treasure fleet is attacked by Wokou pirates while still under construction. On orders of the spoiled and selfish Admiral Jinhai, nephew of the unnamed emperor, Huang and Chen save the fleet and eliminate the pirates. The fleet then embarks westward and is next seen to land in a port {{on the coast of}} India. There many of the crew, including Huang and Chen, are attacked by soldiers of the Indian Zamorin and flee with part of the fleet to a nearby island where they set up a new base and mount a rescue mission to save Jinhai and the remaining crew who have been captured by the Zamorin's troops and (as they discover) some Chinese defectors. The fleet continues west at Jinhai's insistence, although many ships turn back, and eventually are cast ashore in the Yucatán by a storm. Chen and Huang go to rescue crews of the other ships from hostile Aztec soldiers. When they return, they find that Jinhai has disappeared. Huang suspects that he was captured along with many of the fleet's crewmembers and mounts a rescue mission. Huang and Chen cut through the jungle and rescue many of their comrades, but Jinhai is not among them. Huang's small army of sailors then enters a nearby Aztec city, where they learn that Jinhai has set himself up as an emperor or perhaps a god among the Aztecs and that it was Jinhai who plotted with the Zamorin in India. Huang and Chen escape an ambush by Jinhai's soldiers and flee back to the coast through a series of caves, rescuing more of their crew along the way. Once back at the coast they set up a base and counterattack, defeating and killing Jinhai. After the battle, Huang, Chen, and the surviving crew members scour the beaches for all evidence of their presence and then sail home to China, hoping that no one will ever know they were there.|$|E

25|$|Before {{arriving}} in England, Sargent began sending paintings for {{exhibition at the}} Royal Academy. These included the portraits of Dr. Pozzi at Home (1881), a flamboyant essay in red and his first full-length male portrait, and the more traditional Mrs. Henry White (1883). The ensuing portrait commissions encouraged Sargent to complete his move to London in 1886. Notwithstanding the Madame X scandal, he had considered moving to London as early as 1882; he had been urged to do so repeatedly by his <b>new</b> <b>friend,</b> the novelist Henry James. In retrospect his transfer to London may be seen to have been inevitable.|$|E
