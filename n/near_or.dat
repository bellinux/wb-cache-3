5|$|Doria passed <b>near</b> <b>or</b> {{through the}} {{northern}} Caribbean Islands and the Bahamas as a tropical depression, though effects, if any, are unknown. Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160miles (260km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22mph (35km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall {{of up to}} 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7feet (1.7m) above the mean low water level.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{initiating}} advisories on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau {{noted the}} potential for heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the southwestern Caribbean. The advisories recommended for small ships to remain at harbor across the region. Initially, the hurricane was predicted to move <b>near</b> <b>or</b> through the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Cuba. As a result, Cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed <b>near</b> <b>or</b> through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E
5|$|A ship sunk in {{the western}} Gulf of Mexico on October1, {{which was the first}} {{indication}} of the second tropical cyclone of the season. The storm moved slowly northeastward toward the southeastern Louisiana coastline, intensifying to its estimated peak winds of 70mph (115km/h). On October4, it passed <b>near</b> <b>or</b> over southeastern Louisiana, producing heavy rain and gusty winds in New Orleans. Flooding was observed in portions of the city, and the West Rigolets Lighthouse on Lake Pontchartrain suffered $5,000 in damage due to the storm (1868USD, $81,000 2010USD). The storm accelerated northeastward and struck near Apalachicola, Florida late on October4.|$|E

5|$|After exiting Cuba {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the {{hurricane}} weakened greatly. On October20 it passed {{a short distance}} west of Key West, Florida, and very early on October21 the hurricane moved over Marco Island with winds of 90mph (150km/h). The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed <b>near</b> <b>or</b> over Miami. It accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas. Gradually weakening, the storm interacted with an approaching cold front; late on October23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front.|$|E
5|$|At Altoona, {{the route}} again {{overlaps}} I-80 until Newton, where it splits away from I-80. The highway passes <b>near</b> <b>or</b> through {{the cities of}} Kellogg, Grinnell, Victor, Marengo, the Amana Colonies, and Tiffin before entering the Coralville / Iowa City area. Through Coralville and Iowa City, US6 has no direct access to I-80, I-380, or US218; other routes like Iowa Highway 1 (Iowa1) and Iowa965 provide direct access. From Iowa City, the highway heads to the east-southeast through West Liberty and Atalissa. Near Wilton, the route heads north to I-80 where it again overlaps to Davenport. At Davenport, US6 then follows I-280 and US61 before entering the city. On {{the eastern side of}} Davenport, it joins I-74 and enters Bettendorf before leaving Iowa for Illinois.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be a}} problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes <b>near</b> <b>or</b> through the sites of several former CCC camps.|$|E

5000|$|LA 10 {{was created}} in the 1955 renumbering, largely {{combining}} the routes of former State Routes 22 and 35. [...] Pieces of important cross-state routes such as former State Routes 1 and 5, as well as short connectors such as former State Routes 27, 41, and 257 were used to create a continuous route running north of and parallel to the existing US 190 corridor across the state. Class [...] "A": La 10—From a junction with La-US 171 at <b>or</b> <b>near</b> Pickering through <b>or</b> <b>near</b> Pitkin, Elizabeth, Oakdale, Ville Platte and Washington to a junction with La-US 71 at <b>or</b> <b>near</b> Lebeau and from a junction with LA 19 at <b>or</b> <b>near</b> McManus through <b>or</b> <b>near</b> Clinton, Greensburg, Fluker, Franklinton and Bogalusa to the Mississippi State Line east of Bogalusa.Class [...] "B": La 10—From a junction with La-US 71 at <b>or</b> <b>near</b> Lebeau through <b>or</b> <b>near</b> Melville, Morganza, New Roads, St. Francisville and Jackson to a junction with La 19 at <b>or</b> <b>near</b> McManus. 1955 legislative route description Despite its length, most of the route of LA 10 has remained the same since 1955. The only major change has been the bypassing of New Roads and St. Francisville resulting from the construction of a cable-stayed bridge across the Mississippi River that replaced the toll ferry connecting the two communities.|$|R
50|$|Relative clauses in Yabem {{are created}} by use of the demonstrative pronouns/adjectives, which come in several forms themselves.The three series above {{represent}} three degrees of proximity in the demonstratives. First series correlates to something <b>nearest</b> <b>or</b> most relevant to the 1st person (the speaker), and the second series corresponded to the 2nd person (addressee), while the third series corresponds to what is <b>nearest</b> <b>or</b> most relevant to the 3rd person (non-speech act participant). The forms beginning with t- are those that offer a specific or precise degree of evidentiality (with regard to the referent). Examples of this degree of precision can be seen below.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a lack of {{substantial}} archaeological or literary evidence to support the defence-in-depth theory. J.C. Mann points out that there is no evidence, either in the Notitia Dignitatum or in the archaeological record, that units along the Rhine or Danube were stationed in the border hinterlands. On the contrary, virtually all forts identified as built or occupied in the 4th century on the Danube lay on, very <b>near</b> <b>or</b> even beyond the river, strikingly similar to the 2nd-century distribution.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass <b>near</b> <b>or</b> through the pole.|$|E
