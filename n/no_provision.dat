5|$|The Crimes Act made <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for the {{creation}} of federal prisons. Instead, a September 21, 1789 concurrent resolution asked the state legislatures to authorize their prisons to imprison federal prisoners. The first federal prison was not opened until 1894 at Fort Leavenworth.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, 1800, the Indiana Territory {{was created}} {{by an act of}} Congress, but <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for an {{official}} seal was included in the measure. The earliest recorded use of Indiana Territory's seal was on court documents that were signed by Governor William Henry Harrison in January 1801. The seal he used was an adaptation of the original seal created for the Northwest Territory. Although its origin is uncertain, it is likely that it was Harrison who made the alterations.|$|E

5|$|The 4th North Korean Division in the {{meantime}} was suffering serious logistical setbacks from lack of food, equipment, ammunition and, weapons. Conscripts from local South Korean villages were brought in to replace mounting losses. There was also virtually <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for the wounded in the division, and the North Korean forces began to come apart under these stresses. Still, the division's morale remained relatively high and General Lee refused to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

5|$|EU {{legislation}} makes <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for {{the preservation}} and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E
5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E

5|$|The Ecological {{footprint}} measures {{human consumption}} {{in terms of}} the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for other organisms). The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries).|$|E
5|$|They were {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Type 13 fire-control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I, but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925. It controlled the main and secondary guns; <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> was made for anti-aircraft fire until the Type 31 fire-control director was introduced in 1932. A modified Type 14 fire-control system was tested aboard Nagato in 1935, and later approved for service as the Type 34. A new anti-aircraft director, designated the Type 94, used to control the 127mm AA guns, was introduced in 1937, although it is unknown when they were installed on the ships. The 25mm AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for a jury from the vicinage. If {{it could have been}} done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be {{impracticable}} in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} constitution made <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> for {{a vacancy}} {{in the office}} of the lieutenant governor; in the event of the lieutenant governor's death or resignation, the lieutenant governorship usually remained vacant until the end of the term. In 1938, following the resignation of lieutenant governor Henry Gunderson, Governor Philip La Follette appointed Herman Ekern lieutenant governor to fill the vacancy. This appointment was challenged in court, and ruled valid in the case State ex rel. Martin v. Ekern. In 1979 the constitution was amended to explicitly allow this: in the event of a vacancy {{in the office of}} the lieutenant governor, the governor nominates a candidate who becomes lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term upon his approval by the Wisconsin Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate.|$|E
5|$|When the Indiana Territory {{was first}} created, <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> was {{allowed for the}} {{creation}} of popularly elected government. Congress granted the President power to appoint a General Court to serve as a legislative and judicial branch of the territorial government. The court consisted of five members, and the President delegated the task of choosing the members to the Governor of the territory. This remained the form of government until 1805 when Congress granted the territory the right to legalize slavery if they so choose. In doing so, they removed the court's legislative powers, leaving it with only judicial authority, but still to be appointed by the President through the Governor. The formation of a new legislative council was approved and each county in the territory was granted the right to elect one representative to it. The council had the authority to pass laws, but they all had to be approved by the Governor before they could be enacted.|$|E
