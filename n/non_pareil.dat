It was agreed with the Gardners that Gerald would live with her on a tea plantation named Ladbroke Estate in Maskeliya district, where he could learn the tea trade. In 1901 Gardner and the Elkingtons lived briefly in a bungalow in Kandy, where a neighbouring bungalow had just been vacated by the occultists Aleister Crowley and Charles Henry Allan Bennett. At his father's expense, Gardner trained as a [...] "creeper", or trainee planter, learning all about the growing of tea; although he disliked the [...] "dreary endlessness" [...] of the work, he enjoyed being outdoors and near to the forests. He lived with the Elkingtons until 1904, when he moved into his own bungalow and began earning a living working on the <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil</b> tea estate below the Horton Plains. He {{spent much of his}} spare time hunting deer and trekking through the local forests, becoming acquainted with the Singhalese natives and taking a great interest in their Buddhist beliefs. In December 1904, his parents and younger brother visited, with his father asking him to invest in a pioneering rubber plantation which Gardner was to manage; located near the village of Belihil Oya, it was known as the Atlanta Estate, but allowed him a great deal of leisure time. Exploring his interest in weaponry, in 1907 Gardner joined the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps, a local volunteer force composed of European tea and rubber planters intent on protecting their interests from foreign aggression or domestic insurrection.|$|E
40|$|Particle size {{reduction}} of dry material by milling {{is a key}} unit operation for the pharmaceutical, agricultural, food and paper industries. Knowledge of particle flow and {{size reduction}} in a hammer mill is thus critical to optimize the design and operation of such equipment. Milling experiments are performed using lactose <b>non</b> <b>pareils</b> in a laboratory scale Hammer Mill. The {{size and shape of}} the resultant progeny of particles are analyzed by sieves/light scattering and microscope/image analysis techniques respectively. Discrete Element Method (DEM) based computational methods are developed to perform a quantitative examination of granular flow, fracturing and subsequently fragmentation patterns for the same hammer mill. A parametric study was performed to understand the effect of hammer speed (rotational), feed rate, hammer-wall tolerance on size reduction process. Simulations were carried out to study the effect of mill speed on kinetic energy of particles...|$|R
40|$|Solution {{layering}} {{technique was}} used to prepare pellets of Salbutamol Sulphate. A multiparticulate system was prepared with pH independent and pH dependent coatings, and evaluated as pulsatile drug delivery system. Salbutamol sulphate release was studied from methacrylate coated pellets from <b>non</b> <b>pareils.</b> Morphology was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy for the characterization of prepared pellets. Combination of Eudragit RSPO (pH independent) and Eudragit L 100 (pH dependent) was used for coating of the pellets. Different concentrations of this polymeric combination were loaded on to the drug-loaded pellets. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of physicochemical properties of the polymers on the release profile of Salbutamol sulphate from the pellets dosage form. The in-vitro study suggested that Eudragit RSPO and Eudragit L 100 at 10 % coating level led to an optimum pulsatile release behavior. The coated pellets prepared by solution layering technology successfully released drug after specific lag time indicating pulsatile drug delivery. It was revealed that Eudragit RSPO has the effect to retard drug release. The results generated in this study showed that proper selection of polymeric materials based on their physicochemical properties is important in designing pellets dosage form with suitable dissolution profile...|$|R

Murder is a craft for the [...] "Butcher's Boy," [...] a reference to his foster father, [...] "Eddie the Butcher," [...] who raised him to follow in both of his two trades: the cold-blooded killer with a gimlet eye, and an actual butcher for a cover life. When Eddie dies an unnatural death, his adoptive son continues in his footsteps, but leaves the butcher shop behind. After dispatching an innocent union employee and a U.S. Senator, he arrives in Las Vegas, Nevada to pick up his fee. Instead of a payoff he finds himself on the wrong end of a murder contract. His reputation as a <b>non</b> <b>pareil</b> professional killer has always ensured he would be paid, even by men who think no more about murder than scratching an itch, men who nonetheless would not risk creating such an adept enemy. The story brings that scenario to life as the Butcher's Boy seeks to collect the debt by terrorizing the Mafia—lifelong source of his freelance jobs and current nemesis—into backing off.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{commercial}} almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D. A. Webb] orchards in Chile, {{the percentage}} of fruit set is low and commonly reaches 5 – 30 %. As almond trees bloom during a cool period and also suffer from self-incompatibility, any factor that can improve pollination, pollen germination and pollen tube growth or extend the effective pollination period, such as the application of plant bioregulators (PBRs), should be beneficial for fruit production. Results: Three plant bioregulators (PBRs) : brassinolide (BL), gibberellic acid (GA 3) and kinetin (KN) were evaluated for pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vitro, {{as well as for}} fruit set in almond cultivars <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil</b> and Carmel, in central Chile, during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. For pollen germination in vitro, the BL concentration of 10  mg L- 1 had the highest value in <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil</b> (97. 7 %), after 4  h germination in 2014 growing season (the control was 90. 9 %). KN at a concentration of 50  μL L- 1 induced the longest pollen tube growth of 1243. 4  μm in Carmel after 8  h germination in 2013 (the control was 917. 7  μm). In <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil,</b> the highest percentage of fruit set (31. 0 %) was achieved in 2014 by spraying during bloom at pink bud stage with KN at 50  μL L- 1 (the control was 16. 7 %). Conclusions: A significant favorable effect of the tested PBRs was observed in pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vitro, as well as on fruit set in <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil</b> and Carmel almonds...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{yield of}} almonds [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D. A. Webb] could be low due to climatic {{problems}} and any factor improving kernel size and weight, {{such as the}} use of plant bioregulators (PBRs), should be beneficial. Results: Three plant bioregulators: 24 -epibrassinolide (BL), gibberellic acid (GA 3) and kinetin (KN) were applied at three spray concentrations to <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil</b> and Carmel cultivars, at two phenological stages during bloom, in the 2014 and 2015 seasons. The results showed significant differences (P <  0. 0001). For total dry weight of <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil,</b> the best treatment was BL (30  mg·L- 1), with an average of 1. 45  g, while the control was 1. 30  g, at pink button during 2015. For Carmel, the best dry weight was 1. 23  g, achieved with BL (30  mg·L- 1) at fallen petals in both seasons. The average dry weight of the controls varied between 1. 13 and 1. 18  g. The greatest almond lengths and widths in <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil</b> were 24. 98  mm and 15. 05  mm, achieved with BL (30  mg·L- 1) and KN (50  μL·L- 1) treatments, respectively, applied at pink button in 2015. In Carmel, the greatest length and width were 24. 38 and 13. 44  mm, obtained with BL (30  mg·L- 1) applied at the stages of pink button and fallen petals, respectively, in 2015. The control reached lengths between 22. 33 and 23. 38  mm, and widths between 11. 99 and 12. 93  mm. Conclusions: The use of the bioregulators showed significant favorable effects on dry weight, length and width of kernels at harvest, in both cultivars...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Triacylglycerol {{composition}} of 10 almond culti-vars grown in seven different environments {{was determined by}} high-performance liquid chromatography, and multivariate sta-tistical techniques (principal component and cluster analysis) were used to detect and establish associations among almond cultivars. In particular, linear discriminant analysis showed that cultivars Desmayo Largueta, Masbovera, Texas, <b>Non</b> <b>Pareil,</b> Tuono, and Guara are {{different from each other}} and can be clas-sified in different groups. This statistical approach also predicted the origin of eight hybrids produced from these cultivars. As a result, it is concluded that triacylglycerol composition in al-monds can distinguish genetic from environmental effects on almond triacylglycerol composition...|$|E
40|$|In vitro in vivo {{correlation}} of metoprolol tartrate sustained release capsules were studied in this investigation. The half-life of metoprolol is 3 to 4 hours. Peak plasma concentrations vary widely and occur about 1. 5 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. In this study, <b>non</b> <b>pareil</b> seeds were prepared and coated with metoprolol tartrate using polyvinyl pyrollidone and iso propyl alcohol. Drug coated pellets were then coated with different proportion of microcrystalline wax and glyceryl di stearate using carbon tetrachloride as solvent. The release pattern of drug coated pellets and wax coated pellets were evaluated in vitro by dissolution test apparatus. Theoretical sustained release was compared with formulated sustained release. In vivo evaluation of metoprolol sustained release has been studied. A single dose {{was carried out in}} six rabbits with two sequences, cross over study. Blood samples were collected at one hour intervals. The plasma concentration of metoprolol was estimated by reverse phase HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma concentration of metoprolol and time data. The mean in vitro dissolution curve of the product is compared with the mean in vivo absorption curve generated by Wagner – Nelson method. The mean data for the in vivo percent absorbed were plotted versus time and the in vitro drug release versus time were superimposed on the first plot. The simplest way to demonstrate a correlation is to plot the percentage absorbed in vivo versus the percentage released in vitro at the same time...|$|E
