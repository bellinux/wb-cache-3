25|$|Albanian bitumen {{extraction}} has a {{long history}} and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman Coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the <b>natural</b> <b>bitumen</b> on an industrial scale.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} academic {{study of}} the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 {{that a third of}} global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 {{in order to meet the}} target of 2°C. Hence continued exploration or development of reserves would be extraneous to needs. To meet the 2°C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market. The impact on producers in Canada would be far larger than in the U.S. Open-pit mining of <b>natural</b> <b>bitumen</b> in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production.|$|E

2500|$|The name {{tar sands}} {{was applied to}} {{bituminous}} sands in the late 19th and early 20th century.

2500|$|The crude bitumen {{contained}} in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as [...] "a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow." [...] Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) {{that it will not}} flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses. [...] The World Energy Council (WEC) defines <b>natural</b> <b>bitumen</b> as [...] "oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10° API". [...] The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. [...] <b>Natural</b> <b>bitumen</b> and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria.

40|$|The {{aliphatic}} hydrocarbon distributions {{obtained from the}} <b>natural</b> <b>bitumens</b> of three Leg 75 sediments were compared using computerised gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (C-GC-MS). The kerogens isolated from these sediments were heated in sealed tubes at 330 °C using the techniques of hydrous (i. e. heating kerogen {{in the presence of}} water) and anhydrous pyrolysis (i. e. heating dry kerogen alone). These experiments were then repeated at a lower temperature (280 °C). At 330 °C, under anhydrous conditions, considerable destruction of biomarkers in the ancient kerogens (i. e. pre-Tertiary) occurred, whereas with water present significant amounts of hopanes were obtained. However, with more recent kerogens (which contain larger amounts of chemically bound water), both anhydrous and hydrous pyrolysis gave a similar suite of biological markers, in which long chain acyclic isoprenoids (C 40) are significant components. Lowering the temperature of pyrolysis to 280 °C yielded biological markers under both hydrous and anhydrous conditions for all kerogens. n-Alkenes were not detected in any of the pyrolysates; however, a single unknown triterpene was discovered in several of the hydrous and anhydrous pyrolysates. The results tentatively indicate that the chief value to petroleum research of kerogen hydrous pyrolysis lies in its ability to increase the yield of pyrolysate. High temperature hydrous pyrolysis (280 - 330 °C), under high pressure (2000 psi), does not appear to mimic natural conditions of oil generation.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} of a {{range of}} irradiated and nonirradiated <b>natural</b> terrestrial <b>bitumens</b> has revealed that radiolytic alteration is generally associated with an increase in structural disorganisation. An interpretational methodology designed to overcome the considerable difficulties in obtaining reproducible, meaningful parameters of structural disorganisation is also presented, and should prove useful for future Raman applications. Raman investigation of a set of bitumens reported to have formed by the radiolytic polymerisation of light hydrocarbons, such as methane, has revealed excessive structural disorganisation, relative to biogenic complex-hydrocarbon-derived bitumens of similar radioelement concentrations, which may indicate the importance of precursor materials on the organic products of irradiation. Variations in the R 1 ratio (D 1 /G band intensity) are found to be the best guide to variations in structural organisation. Comparisons of Raman spectra of the same sample, but produced by different exciting wavelengths, reveal the importance of the selection of a suitable laser wavelength.

40|$|A {{large portion}} of Canada's {{reserves}} of crude oil consists of extra heavy crude and <b>natural</b> <b>bitumens.</b> As the reserves of conventional crude oil continue to decline, heavy oil and bitumen are becoming increasingly important sources of hydrocarbon liquids. Oil­-in-water emulsions provide an alternative to heating and dilution methods for transportation of these viscous heavy oils through conventional pipelines. One {{of the most important}} preconditions for implementing this technology is prediction of the flow behavior and stability of the heavy oil-in-water emulsions. Inversion, a process by which one type of emulsion (such as oil-in-water) is converted to another (such as water­-in-oil), is critical because it could cause a region of very high viscosity to form in the pipeline. This research attempts to investigate the causes of inversion, and to develop a simple and effective laboratory method for selecting suitable surfactants and their concentrations at the emulsion pipeline operation conditions. The inversion of heavy crude oil-in-brine emulsions stabilized with non-ionic surfactants has been studied experimentally. Tests were carried out in beakers and in a cone and plate viscometer. The effects of shear rate, surfactant species and concentration, temperature, and oil fraction on emulsion inversion were studied. Toroid tests were carried out to compare the data generated from the cone and plate viscometer to that for a pipeline. It was found that inversion of oil-in-brine emulsions was always associated with the disappearance of the non-ionic surfactant from the aqueous phase. The surfactant affinity (i. e., hydrophilic property) for the aqueous phase thus appeared to be critical in the stabilization of these emulsions. Increasing the number of ethylene oxide units increased the hydrophilic property of the non-ionic surfactant and the stability of the emulsion. The emulsion stability also depends on the strength of the interfacial adsorption film. High shear rates not only destroyed the film, but also displaced fragments of the film back to the aqueous phase. The emulsions remained stable only when the surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase was above the C. M. C. level, meaning there was enough surfactant stock to maintain the stability of the interfacial adsorption film. High temperatures reduced the physical strength of the interfacial adsorption film and the repulsive force between oil droplets, encouraging the flocculation and inversion. The toroid tests indicated that the cone and plate viscometer is probably a good simulation of the emulsion flow behavior in pipelines. A laboratory method to select a suitable surfactant type and concentration has been developed using the cone and plate viscometer...|$|R
