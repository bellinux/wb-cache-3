However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. <b>No</b> <b>Little</b> Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.|$|E

In many ways the diplomas of [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] represent the stylistic peak of the Anglo-Saxon diplomatic tradition, a fitting complement to Æthelstan's own momentous political feats and to the forging of what would become England." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1890, Congress passed {{legislation}} giving federal sponsorship to an exposition {{to commemorate the}} 400th anniversary of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World. The act had established a World's Columbian Exposition Commission to oversee the fair. Leading citizens of Chicago established a World's Columbian Exposition Company ("the Company") to organize the construction, and the Company generally emerged as successful in the resulting infighting as to which group would be in charge. Had {{it not been for}} Daniel Burnham, head of the Company's Board of Architects, the fair might never have been built. Burnham, whose favorite saying was, [...] "Make <b>no</b> <b>little</b> plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood", became the czar of the exposition's construction.|$|E
500|$|A more {{pressing}} problem for Brueys {{was a lack}} of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Constant attacks by Bedouin partisans, however, required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party. Hence, up to a third of the fleet's sailors were away from their ships at any one time. Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix, reporting that [...] "Our crews are weak, both in number and quality. Our rigging, in general, out of repair, and I am sure it requires <b>no</b> <b>little</b> courage to undertake the management of a fleet furnished with such tools." ...|$|E

Jones was further memorialized in historian Joseph Addison Waddell's Annals of Augusta County, Virginia (1886), in which Waddell remarked of Jones: [...] "He was considered {{a man of great}} ability and unbending integrity. His only fault, or the only one which tradition tells of, was an extremely irritable temper, which, when aroused, expressed itself in the strongest terms he could command, mingled with <b>no</b> <b>little</b> profanity. Having a scorn of all dishonesty and meanness, he did not spare a miscreant by tongue or pen." [...] In his Historic Families of Kentucky (1889), historian and genealogist Thomas Marshall Green said of Jones: [...] "Gabriel Jones rose rapidly in his profession; in attainments he was second to no man at the colonial bar; in native ability he was conspicuous among those who stood in the first rank." ...|$|E

500|$|Longchamp died in January 1197, at Poitiers, {{while on}} a {{diplomatic}} mission to Rome for Richard, and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin. Much of the information on his career comes from people hostile to him, for example, Gerald of Wales called Longchamp that [...] "monster with many heads". The historian Austin Lane Poole says that Gerald described Longchamp as more like an ape than a man. Longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well-educated man. He was supported by others among his contemporaries, including Pope Clement III, who, when he appointed Longchamp legate, wrote that he did so {{at the urging of}} the English bishops. When he was one of four men named bishop in 1189, medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes wrote that the four new bishops were [...] "men of <b>no</b> <b>little</b> virtue and fame". Historian John Gillingham wrote that Longchamp's [...] "record of his life in politics and administration was a good one, spoiled only by his failure in 1191".|$|E
500|$|In 1907, Taft had won {{the first}} {{commission}} from the Ferguson Fund to create the Fountain of the Great Lakes at the Art Institute of Chicago. Immediately afterwards, inspired by Daniel Burnham's [...] "Make <b>no</b> <b>little</b> plans" [...] quote, he begin lobbying for a grand Midway beautification plan. In 1912, Art Institute Trustee Frank G. Logan formally presented Taft's plans to the fund's administrators at the Art Institute of Chicago. Taft's proposed Midway Plaisance beautification plan included two possible commemoration themes. His first choice was to honor {{the memory of the}} World's Columbian Exposition that had been held in Jackson Park in 1893. His alternative was to commemorate the centennial of the 1814 Treaty of Ghent [...] "marking a century of perfect understanding between England and America". Since other plans to commemorate the Exposition were under way, the second theme choice was adopted as the justification for a second Taft commission from the Ferguson Fund. Contemporary newspaper accounts anticipated that Taft's entire Midway beautification plan would be approved easily.|$|E
500|$|In early 1844, Halkett {{successfully}} {{tested a}} prototype boat-cloak on the River Thames, paddling it [...] without taking on any water, despite, in his words, being [...] "met by—passed by—and almost run down by—various Metropolitan Steamers plying {{to and fro}} in their several vocations, and causing <b>no</b> <b>little</b> commotion in the troubled waters of the River". Buoyed by this success, he took the prototype boat-cloak with him while on naval service, using it whenever the opportunity arose to test it under various sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett hoped to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions, in the rough seas of the Bay of Biscay, but the weather was unusually calm. He was forced to take down his umbrella, and paddle, recalling later that [...] "the winds that day were too civil by half, and the sleepless bay almost quite dormant". The boat-cloak was positively received by explorers; John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that [...] "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".|$|E

While at Michigan, Heikkinen was also {{the president of the}} undergraduate “M” club in 1938 and president of U-M’s senior honor society, “Michigamua.” Detroit News sports editor H.G. Salsinger wrote that Heikkinen “writes poetry, and one of his poems appeared in a literary publication in 1938.” The Associated press noted that Heikkinen was “a high-ranking student whose hobby is poetry” An Ann Arbor paper wrote: “He’s extremely intelligent, dabbling in such fields as creative writing, drama, and poetry with considerable vim and <b>no</b> <b>little</b> skill during his spare moments. He is completely unassuming, unusually quiet, and above all a real gentleman." [...] In August 1939, Heikkinen was hired by a magazine to write a story on college football. Newspapers reported that Heikkinen was “collecting dividends on the reputation he made as a poet and writer as an undergraduate.” In 1937, Heikkinen was the subject of an article titled, “But He’s No Sissy.” The articles noted that Heikkinen “adheres strictly to a liquid diet” and drank a full quart of milk after every game as part of a special diet due to a stomach disorder.|$|E
