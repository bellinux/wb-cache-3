5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have made <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the royal line of succession.|$|E
5|$|He {{suffered}} a stress fracture to the pubic bone which {{kept him out}} {{for more than three}} months from November 2007 until he returned to first-team action for Middlesbrough's 2–0 FA Cup victory over Mansfield Town on 26 January 2008. He was sent off in the 80th minute in a match against Arsenal on 15 March 2008 after kicking Gaël Clichy in the face with his boot, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. Mido was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} 2007–08 season in April following a hernia operation on a pelvic injury. He made the bench for Middlesbrough's opening Premier League fixture against former club Tottenham and came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute and scored four minutes later after deflecting Didier Digard's shot. The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1–0 in the lead, but they eventually lost the game 2–1. This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league. Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough's 0–0 draw, with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA. He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court.|$|E

Girls in school and those wanting to return were supported by being given school materials. Parents and their participating daughters had to sign a registration form. If the girl was unmarried, parents had to agree not to marry their daughter during the two-year program and, if this condition was met, the girl and her family would receive a goat {{at the end of}} the program. The intervention increased school attendance and delayed marriage for girls aged 10 to 14 years compared with controls.

40|$|In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, {{randomized}} clinical trial, the tolerability of {{a proprietary}} larch arabinogalactan preparation (ResistAid?) was investigated. METHODS: 199 healthy participants {{were randomly assigned}} to receive either placebo (n = 98) or an arabinogalactan preparation (n = 101) over a period of 12 weeks. As safety parameters the total number of adverse events, changes in various biochemical and laboratory parameters as well as the global evaluation of tolerability by investigator and subjects compared to placebo were evaluated. RESULTS: In total 16 adverse events were observed in 16 subjects, with <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> between the arabinogalactan and the placebo group (p = 0. 935). There were <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> in the mean changes of the measured biochemical and laboratory parameters. The tolerability of the arabinogalactan extract was rated as “very good” or “good” by the investigators for 99 % of the subjects and by 98 % subjects in self-assessment with <b>no</b> statistical <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> placebo. CONCLUSION: The measured parameters as well as the evaluation of the tolerability by the investigators and the subjects demonstrate a very good tolerance profile of the proprietary arabinogalactan extract with <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> placebo when taken for 12 weeks...|$|R

However, this made <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the T93/30's competitiveness, and the drivers continued to qualify and race near or {{at the back of the}} field. Reliability was slightly improved, however, and the team managed its second double-finish at the Belgian Grand Prix. In addition, Badoer made it to the finish for three races in a row, including a top ten result at Scuderia Italia's second home race in Monza. This event was judged to be the car's most competitive performance of the year, helped by the fact that the Ferrari engines were equipped with pneumatic valves for the first time.|$|E
25|$|A {{completely}} one-sided match saw Bermuda amass 304/9 (Arnold Manders 75) {{and then}} bowl out Fiji for just 69, {{with two men}} bowling unchanged throughout: A Edwards took 6-38 while T Burgess claimed 4-29. The USA's total of 152 looked vulnerable as Derek Abraham picked up 4-27, but Canada collapsed in reply and were dismissed for 79, Kamran Rasheed taking 4-22. An ICC Trophy record 172 from Simon Myles, who put on 174 for the third wicket with Nigel Stearns (62) guided Hong Kong to 324/5, and 63 from Gibraltar's Gary De'Ath made <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the result as they finished on 180/5, 144 runs adrift. The Netherlands won another one-sided game as they made 271/6 (RE Lifmann 98, RJ Elferink 64) and then ran through Papua New Guinea's batting, Paul-Jan Bakker taking 5-18 as PNG were bowled out for a mere 52.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately {{and not as}} one would expect where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) as opposed to voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way as}} underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E
