In this report we investigate the correlation between the number of <b>non</b> <b>compacted</b> segments and entity of systolic dysfunction from the registry and subregistries of the SIEC. METHOD: To identify the correlation between ventricular dysfunction and number of segments involved in non compaction we evaluated a consecutive series of 238 patients affected by non compaction, from the SIEC (Società Italiana di Ecografia Cardiovascolare) registry. The average age of patients was 41. 5 years (range: 1 - 92 years), 137 were males and 101 females. In 122 cases we found ventricular systolic dysfunctions with an EF average of 34. 6 %. The number of affected segments by non-compactation and diastolic dysfunction were found to be non-independent predictors of LV systolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: From the analyses we carried out, it seems that ventricular dysfunc...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundIsolated left {{ventricular}} noncompaction (ILVNC) {{is a rare}} cardiomyopathy characterized by deep trabeculations in the ventricular wall which define recesses with the main chamber. The aim of our study was to compare segmental and global peak systolic longitudinal strain (pSSL) in ILVNC considering various {{left ventricular}} ejection fraction (LVEF). Methods 28 patients (17 - 74 years old, mean age 46 ± 16) with ILVNC were retrospectively enrolled and compared to 40 controls (group 1). Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to LVEF group 2 =LVEF> 50 % (n= 15) and group 3 = LVEF< 50 % (n= 13). pSSL was compared in each 17 left ventricular segments of the 3 groups. ResultsNumber of <b>non</b> <b>compacted</b> segments was higher in group 3 than in group 2 (5. 9 ± 1. 7 vs 4. 6 ± 1. 3, p= 0. 008). Tissue Doppler Imaging E’ was lower in group 3 compared with group 1 (p< 0. 001) whereas E’ was not different between groups 1 and 2. Global pSSL (- 15. 75 ± 4. 8 and - 22. 18 ± 1. 9 p< 0. 001), basal mean (p< 0. 001), middle mean (p< 0. 001) and apex mean (p< 0. 001) were lower in patients with ILVNC compared to group 1. Basal mean (p= 0. 013), middle mean (p< 0. 001), apex mean (p< 0. 001) and global pSSL (- 19. 07 ± 2. 3 and - 22. 18 ± 1. 9 p< 0. 001) were lower in group 2 compared to controls. Basal pSSL of normally compacted basal segment in ILVNC were lower compared to basal pSSL in controls (septum p< 0. 001; lateral, p= 0. 009; inferior, p= 0. 008; anterior, p= 0. 009). There was a significant correlation between the number of non-compacted segments and the global pSSL (r=- 0. 418, p= 0. 027). ConclusionGlobal left ventricular pSSL is reduced in patients with ILVNC even those with normal LVEF. Even in basal normally compacted segments, segmental correspondent pSSL is lower in patients with ILVNC compared to controls. This finding suggests that ILVNC is a diffuse left ventricular cardiomyopathy not only affected <b>non</b> <b>compacted</b> segments. Our results suggest that pSSL could be an early predictor of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in ILVNC...|$|R
