When the dimerized ionic phase is photoexcited, the interference effect is clearly observed owing to the coherence of charge density and lattice displacements. Namely, the two pulses constructively interfere with each other if the interval is a multiple of the period of the optical lattice vibration, while they destructively interfere if the interval is a half-odd integer times the period, in the processes toward the <b>neutral</b> <b>phase.</b> The interference is strong especially when the pulse is strong and short because the coherence is also strong.
