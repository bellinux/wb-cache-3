It is a bar dessert which {{requires}} <b>no</b> <b>baking</b> and {{is named after}} the city of Nanaimo, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. It consists of a wafer crumb-based layer topped by a layer of custard flavoured butter icing which is covered with melted chocolate made from chocolate squares. Many varieties exist, consisting {{of different types of}} crumb, different flavours of icing (e.g., mint, peanut butter, coconut, mocha), and different types of chocolate.|$|E

60|$|The shopkeepers {{had been}} {{notified}} {{to close their}} places of business on the tacit condition of having their windows broken for non-compliance, {{but in the early}} forenoon they were still slowly and partially putting up their shutters. You could get in through the darkened doors up till noon; after that it was more and more difficult. But {{it would be hard to}} say how far and how deep the sciopero went. In our hotel we knew of it only the second day through the failure of the morning rolls, for there had been <b>no</b> <b>baking</b> overnight. Most of the in-door service was of Swiss or other foreign extraction, and the mechanism of our comfort, our luxury, was operated as usual. Our floor facchino, or porter, went to the meeting of the unions in the evening, being an Italian. Otherwise the strike fell especially on the helpless and guiltless foreigner, who might be, and very often was, in sympathy with the strikers. He had to walk to the ruins, the galleries, the gardens, the churches, if he wanted anything of them; he could not get a carriage even from a stable.|$|E

50|$|Mexican {{breads and}} other baked goods {{are the result}} of centuries of {{experimentation}} and the blending of influence from various European baking traditions. Wheat, and bread baked from it, was introduced by the Spanish {{at the time of the}} Conquest. While the consumption of wheat has never surpassed that of corn in the country, wheat is still a staple food and an important part of everyday and special rituals. While Mexico has adopted various bread styles from Europe and the United States, most of the hundreds of varieties of breads made in the country were developed here. However, there is little to <b>no</b> <b>baking</b> done in Mexican homes; instead, Mexicans have bought their baked goods from bakeries (and street vendors) since the colonial period.|$|E

40|$|These {{studies on}} the use of lards in plain cake were {{initiated}} in the fall of 1932 and completed during the summer of 1936. The major results of these investigations with cake have been included in a series of four theses by Martin (11), Buel (2), Minard (13) and Myers (15). Cakes containing fat may be divided into two types: 1. The pound cake, named from the proportions formerly used by our great-grandmothers, consists of a pound each of fat, sugar, flour and eggs, with <b>no</b> <b>baking</b> powder or soda. The volume of the cake depends upon the expansion of moisture from the eggs and from the air incorporated-in the creamed mixture and in the beaten eggs. Although the old pound cake recipe is generally modified for modern formulas, it is essentially a type carrying a high percentage of fat, and the texture is rather close, fine, even and compact. 2. Far more commonly used at present by homemakers is a loaf, cup or layer cake, the volume of which depends upon air incorporated in beaten eggs, a leavening agent such as baking powder or soda, the expansion of the moisture into steam and, to a much lesser extent, upon the air incorporated in creaming. An analysis of recipes commonly used for this type of cake shows that they may be very lean, containing as little as 18 parts of fat per 100 parts of flour. A frequently used yet a fairly rich recipe may carry from 40 to 50 parts of fat, and a very rich one may carry 60 to 70 or occasionally 75 parts of fat per 100 parts of flour...|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{was sometimes}} used in cooking green vegetables, as {{it gives them}} a bright green colour—which has been described as artificial-looking—due to its reacting with chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllin. However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is <b>no</b> longer common. <b>Baking</b> soda is still used, though, in the traditional British mushy peas recipe for soaking the peas. It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats. Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|R
50|$|On {{the basis}} of rock type, type of intrusion, chemistry, and age of rocks, two main groups of younger Early Paleoproterozoic igneous {{intrusive}} (plutonic) rocks have been distinguished within the Vishnu Basement Rocks. One group, which dates between 1.74 and 1.71 Ga, consists of large plutons such as the Zoroaster pluton, the Ruby pluton, and the Diamond Creek pluton There is <b>no</b> noticeable <b>baking</b> and metamorphism of the country rock adjacent to them. Because of this, they were likely shallowly emplaced beneath the volcanic arc in which the metavolcanics and metasediments of the Granite Gorge Metamorphic Suite accumulated. In addition, these intrusive rocks have undergone all the deformation that has also affected their adjacent country rock. This further indicates that they are just slightly younger than the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks they intrude. This and their calc-alkaline granitic composition, {{which is similar to}} plutons forming in modern 'subduction zone related' volcanic arcs, indicates that they are remnants of early volcanic arc systems associated with Early Paleoproterozoic subduction zones. Comparable volcanic arc systems, which are associated with subduction zones, are active today in the Aleutian Islands and Indonesia (e.g., Sumatra and Java).|$|R
40|$|Background. Bread is a {{valuable}} source of proteins, minerals and calories. Baking soda prevents the absorption and digestion of bread and more salt used in production of bread also causes different diseases. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the amount of soda and salt in bakeries. Method. Cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on 50 bakeries district during 2009. 400 samples were collected in four steps randomly. The standard PH < 6. 2 indicative of <b>no</b> consumption of <b>baking</b> soda in bread and salt less than 2 g/ 100 g was considered as the reference. Results. The PH less than 6. 2 was seen in 91. 5 of samples and analyzed by random effect analysis. In 64. 5 of samples, the amount of salt was more than the standard. Conclusion. The amount of baking soda used in the bakeries was not high; bakers either had no enough knowledge about the amount of salt or had more other reasons. Drastic measures are recommended...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: Food {{poisoning}} {{has been}} always {{a major concern}} in health system of every community and cream-ﬁlled products {{are one of the}} most widespread food poisoning causes in humans. In present study, we examined the preservative effect of the cinnamon oil in cream-filled cakes. Methods: Antimicrobial activity of Cinnamomum verum J. Presl (Cinnamon) bark essential oil was examined against five food-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium) to investigate its potential for use as a natural preservative in cream-ﬁlled baked goods. Chemical constituents of the oil were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. For evaluation of preservative sufficiency of the oil, pathogens were added to cream-ﬁlled cakes manually and 1 μL/mL of the essential oil was added to all samples except the blank.   Results: Chemical constituents of the oil were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and twenty five components were identiﬁed where cinnamaldehyde (79. 73 %), linalool (4. 08 %), cinnamaldehyde para-methoxy (2. 66 %), eugenol (2. 37 %) and trans-caryophyllene (2. 05 %) were the major constituents. Cinnamon essential oil showed strong antimicrobial activity against selected pathogens in vitro and the minimum inhibitory concentration values against all tested microorganisms were determined as 0. 5 μL/disc except for S. aureus for which, the oil was not effective in tested concentrations. After <b>baking,</b> <b>no</b> observable microorganism was observed in all susceptible microorganisms count in 72 h stored samples.  Conclusion: It was concluded that by analysing the sensory quality of the preserved food, cinnamon oil may be considered as a natural preservative in food industry, especially for cream-filled cakes and pastries...|$|R
40|$|In this {{proposed}} process, there is <b>no</b> wet and <b>baking</b> pro-cess. It is beneficial to prevent wet contamination during the lithography process. Furthermore, exclusion n pre/ post baking process and development process implify an ordinary lithography process. Patterned ye film on SiO 2 substrate after CF 4 {{is shown in}} Fig. 10. Patterned ye film is observed on the substrate in this scanning electron microscope (SEM) photograph. Slightly roughened ye film surface is also observed; how-ever, the pattern shape was kept like the original drawing pattern. In Fig. 11, SiO 2 surface after removing dye resist is shown. A ~m order line and space pattern is observed. By our laser equipment, a laser beam was focused about 1. 5 ~m diameter. It is {{difficult to get a}} narrower dye mask pat-tern. However, submicrometer pattern dye film (10) has been observed using an optical recording disk head. It is expected that more narrow pattern lithography will be made using short wavelength laser with automatic self-focused optics such as an optical disk head. Conclusion Deposited ye film's CF 4 gas etching durability is inves-tigated. The etching rate for dye film is deemed small enough for S iQ and Si lithography process with CF 4 dry etching. The novel all dry lithography process is proposed based on dye film properties. Using laser beam scannings, a line and space pattern are drawn on a dye film with heat-mode abrasion. Drawn pat-terns are carved on SiO 2 and Si substrates with dye film masks by the all-dry etching process. A ~m order lithogra-phy pattern is observed with SEM. Heat-mode resist process is a promising optical resist process for the future, because of its all-dry processing without contamination. Acknowledgment...|$|R
