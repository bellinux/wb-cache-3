Anna Botsford Comstock, {{the head of the}} Department of <b>Nature</b> <b>Study</b> at Cornell University, was a prominent figure in the <b>nature</b> <b>study</b> movement and wrote the Handbook for <b>Nature</b> <b>Study</b> in 1911, which used nature to educate children on cultural values.

2500|$|The <b>nature</b> <b>study</b> {{movement}} (alternatively, <b>Nature</b> <b>Study</b> or nature-study) was {{a popular}} education movement in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] <b>Nature</b> <b>study</b> attempted to reconcile scientific investigation with spiritual, personal experiences gained from interaction with the natural world. [...] Led by progressive educators and naturalists such as Anna Botsford Comstock, Liberty Hyde Bailey, Louis Agassiz and Wilbur S. Jackman, <b>nature</b> <b>study</b> changed the way science was taught in schools by emphasizing learning from tangible objects, something that was embodied by the movement's mantra [...] "study nature, not books".|$|R
40|$|The {{experiences}} and perceptions {{that people with}} intellectual disability (ID) who have participated in vocational education have about their <b>study</b> <b>paths</b> is a less studied theme in Finland and also internationally. The purpose {{of this research was}} to find out whether their transitions from basic education to vocational education have been successful in their opinion and how their parents perceived the <b>study</b> <b>paths.</b> The purpose of this research was to analyze the <b>study</b> <b>paths</b> of young adults with ID and their school experiences as described by themselves and their parents. The focus was on memories of basic education, transition to vocational education, and studies at the vocational special education school. The research participants comprised 14 young adults with ID (aged 17 - 23, 10 boys and 4 girls) and their parents (N= 14). They all had personal study plans in basic education, and except for one, they all had completed basic education according to their study plans. The research leaned on the narrative research approach. The youngsters and their parents were interviewed personally in 2012 and 2014. The <b>study</b> <b>paths</b> of young people with ID could be grouped into three narratives: the fluent, complex, and interrupted <b>study</b> <b>paths.</b> <b>Study</b> success in young people with ID is a sum of many factors. The study illustrates four core factors directing the study processes: the student, school community, curriculum, and teacher. In addition, support from home is extremely important to the fluency of <b>study</b> <b>paths.</b> The purpose of education should be to prepare train, rehabilitate, and guide students with ID into good life that includes work, health, and relationships. Based on this study, educational options for people with ID are limited and should be developed so that secondary education would educate future experts to work markets and promote learning and societal participation in the young who need special support...|$|R
