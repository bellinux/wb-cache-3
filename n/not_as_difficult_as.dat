5|$|The high-{{definition}} upgrade was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> {{it might}} have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed to be set as there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

Japanese magazine Gamest ranked Rugal 48th {{on their list}} of the top 50 video game characters introduced in 1994, sharing the spot with Chang Koehan. Video games publications have commented on Rugal's character, adding praise and criticism. Retro Gamer praised the character, stating he [...] "rocks hard...harder than Street Fighters M. Bison". GameAxis Unwired compared Rugal with Street Fighters Akuma in regards to their significacies to their respective developers, with Rugal called the [...] "cheapest [...] in SNK's games." [...] 1UP.com praised the introduction of Omega Rugal in KOF '95, noting him to be [...] "one of the most stylish boss designs in fighting history", although players could hate him due to {{how difficult it is}} to defeat him. However, they mentioned that one of the good points from KOF '96 was the absence of Rugal. Eurogamer reviewer Matt Edwards also commented that Rugal was very hard to defeat and that he started [...] "a trend in the KOF series of notoriously overpowered bosses who are hard to take down". IGN's Jeremy Dunhan praised Rugal, describing how his character developed the new rules for the King of Fighters tournament, and noted the difficulty in defeating Rugal himself. Listing him as one of the [...] "12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit", GamesRadar claimed that Rugal's difficult as a boss led gamers to coin the term [...] "SNK Boss syndrome." [...] In retrospective, Gaming Age writer Jeff Keely found Rugal and Orochi as difficult bosses but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> Krizalid from The King of Fighters '99. Den of Geek listed Rugal's upgraded form from Capcom vs. SNK 2 as the best altered character due to how it takes Akuma's special moves as well as other traits. The same site also listed him as the sixth best character from the KOF complimenting him as a good villain based on his traits. Complex listed him as one of the most challenging bosses in gaming, citing how overpowered were some of his moves most notably his [...] "Genocide Cutter". Despite criticizing most of the live-action movie based on the series, Derek Elley from Film Biz found Rugal's role enjoyable.|$|E
