These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns.

This assay is a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which serum antibodies compete with labeled F 105, a human mono-clonal antibody whose corresponding epitope overlaps the conformation-dependent CD 4 BS, for binding to puri-fied recombinant gp 120 coated on a solid phase. <b>Ninety-nine</b> <b>percent</b> (109 <b>of</b> 110) of HIV- 1 -positive French patients and 91 % (51 of 56) of HIV- 1 -positive African patients had CD 4 BS antibodies, indicating that the con-formational CD 4 BS epitope is well conserved among different subtypes of HIV- 1. Titers of CD 4 BS antibodies according to clinical status appeared to be not statistically different. A longitudinal study in 21 seroconverters showed that, for the majority of individuals, CD 4 BS antibodies appeared early and persisted at relatively high titers for several years. None of 21 HIV- 2 -seropositive patients had CD 4 BS antibodies in our assay, suggesting that the antibodies produced during HIV- 2 infection are not cross-reactive with the CD 4 BS of HIV- 1 gp 120.

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that pelvic motion {{is closely related to}} pitching performance {{over the course of a}} season. Few studies have examined pelvic motion and its relationship to an acute pitching variable. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between pelvic motion and hand velocity in college-aged pitchers. Nine healthy club baseball team pitchers performed two tests: A pelvic motion test, and a hand velocity test during a pitch. The pelvic motion test required participants to lift their kicking leg 10 cm off the ground, then hold that position for two seconds before returning to a double leg stance. This procedure was repeated five times. The hand velocity test required participants to perform five maximal-effort pitches thrown from a wind-up position. Motion of the pelvis and hand during the tests was recorded with a passive infrared marker-based motion analysis system (Vicon). Angular displacements (tilts) of the pelvis and peak hand velocity were computed from coordinate data using Nexus software (Vicon). Given the low sample size, <b>ninety-nine</b> <b>percent</b> confidence intervals were used to interpret the correlation (Pearson’s r) between pelvic motion and hand velocity.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a glimpse into}} the worlds of mediation and settlement negotiation. Because they are almost always private, there has been relatively little empirical analysis of the dynamics of settlement or mediation. This article analyzes a unique data set derived from a mediator’s contemporaneous notes of mediations involving employment disputes, such as claims of discrimination or wrongful termination. Although the data set includes over four hundred cases, since they were all mediated by a single mediator, this article {{can be viewed as a}} case study. Among the most interesting facts uncovered by this analysis are the following. Mediation can be extremely effective in facilitating settlement. The mediator studied here achieved a settlement rate of over 94 %. There are very few gender differences, whether one looks at the gender of the plaintiff or the gender of the lawyers. For example, settlement rates are the same for male and female plaintiffs and lawyers. On average, cases settle much closer to the defendant’s first offer than the plaintiff’s, irrespective of case type, size of law firm, or other factors. A mediator’s proposal appears to be the most effective mediation technique.

40|$|Background Trials {{evaluating}} {{the effects of}} interventions usually provide little insight into the factors responsible for (lack of) changes in desired outcomes. A process evaluation alongside a trial can {{shed light on the}} mechanisms responsible for the outcomes of a trial. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate exposure to and experiences with a computerized decision support system (CDSS) intervention, in order to gain insight into the intervention’s impact and to provide suggestions for improvement. Methods A process evaluation was conducted as part of a large-scale cluster-randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of the CDSS NHGDoc on quality of care. Data on exposure to and experiences with the intervention were collected during the trial period among participants in both the intervention and control group - whenever applicable - by means of the NHGDoc server and an electronic questionnaire. Multiple data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results <b>Ninety-nine</b> <b>percent</b> (n[*]=[*] 229) <b>of</b> the included practices generated data for the NHGDoc server and 50 % (n[*]=[*] 116) responded to the questionnaire: both general practitioners (GPs; n[*]=[*] 112; 49 %) and practice nurses (PNs; n[*]=[*] 52; 37 %) participated. The actual exposure to the NHGDoc system and specific heart failure module was limited with 52 % of the GPs and 42 % of the PNs reporting to either never or rarely use the system. Overall, users had a positive attitude towards CDSSs. The most perceived barriers to using NHGDoc were a lack of learning capacity of the system, the additional time and work it requires to use the CDSS, irrelevant alerts, too high intensity of alerts and insufficient knowledge regarding the system. Conclusions Several types of barriers may have negatively affected the impact of the intervention. Although users are generally positive about CDSSs, a large share of them is insufficiently aware of the functions of NHGDoc and, finds the decision support not always useful or relevant and difficult to integrate into daily practice. In designing CDSS interventions we suggest to more intensely involve the end-users and increase the system’s flexibility and learning capacity. To improve implementation a proper introduction of a CDSS among its target group including adequate training is advocated.
