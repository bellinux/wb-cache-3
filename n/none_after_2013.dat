5000|$|As a low {{production}} car, Volvo {{intended to}} lease the Volvo C30 Electric to corporate customers, mainly companies, authorities and government agencies. Initial deliveries were {{scheduled for the}} third quarter of 2011 throughout Europe, including in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. Volvo planned to build about 250 cars by the end of 2012, and possibly more if market interest takes off. Volvo also planned to allocate a total of 100 Volvo C30 Electrics for the US, half of which would be destines on the West Coast and the other half on the East Coast. Volvo is targeting the leases to corporate and government fleet users at a price of around [...] per month in the U.S. and [...] per month in Europe on a three-year lease. As this pricing is much higher than other electric cars available in the market by 2011, Volvo explained that their prices reflect the actual cost of the limited-production car. During 2011, 6 units were registered in France. A total of 126 units have been leased in Sweden through September 2012 since 2011. As of 5 July 2013, the C30 is no longer available to order from Volvo, nor is it appearing in the model line up on the Volvo Cars website. The last C30's from current stock will be registered by the end of <b>2013,</b> but <b>none</b> produced <b>after</b> July <b>2013.</b>|$|R
