25|$|The violent {{insurgency}} began {{shortly after}} the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and increased during the occupation. Originally, the insurgents targeted the coalition force (a majority of whom are from the United States and the United Kingdom) and the interim government (e.g., the Coalition Provisional Authority) formed under the occupation. The insurgency grew during the period between the invasion of Iraq {{and the establishment of}} a <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 2004, the {{occupation}} was nominally ended by the CPA, which transferred limited {{power to a}} <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> led by Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. The multinational military alliance continued to assist the Allawi government in governing the Iraqis. The purpose of the Occupation of Iraq was, according to U.S. President George W.

25|$|The fall of Baghdad saw the {{outbreak}} of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of Al-Kut and Nasiriyah launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain {{the capital of the}} <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b> Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.|$|E

50|$|In his 2004 sermons {{and public}} interviews, al-Sadr {{repeatedly}} demanded an immediate withdrawal of all U.S.-led coalition forces, all foreign troops under United Nations control, {{and the establishment}} of a <b>new</b> central <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government,</b> not connected to the Ba'ath party or the Allawi government.|$|R
50|$|The Mahdi Army—a Shia militia {{created in}} the summer of 2003 by Muqtada al-Sadr—began to fight Coalition forces in April 2004. 2004 saw Sunni and Shia militants {{fighting}} against each other and against the <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Interim <b>Government</b> installed in June 2004, and against Coalition forces, as well as the First Battle of Fallujah in April and Second Battle of Fallujah in November. The Sunni militia Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad became Al-Qaeda in Iraq in October 2004 and targeted Coalition forces as well as civilians, mainly Shia Muslims, further exacerbating ethnic tensions.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the defeat}} of the old Iraqi army, {{irregular}} forces, both Iraqi and external, have conducted attacks against the Coalition and, more recently, the <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b> In the early months following the [...] "end of major combat operations", insurgents conducted sniper attacks, suicide bombings at road checkpoints, and ambushes, resulting in about 112 multinational force personnel deaths per month.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2003, Paul Bremer {{announced}} {{the plan to}} hand over limited sovereignty to the Iraqi governing council by 30 June 2004. A draft constitution was written {{and approved by the}} Iraqi Governing Council in March 2004. [...] The United States has stated its plans to enter into what it calls a security agreement with the <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> and maintain military authority until a new Iraqi army is established. The Bush administration remained committed to this date despite the unstable security situation. The interim Iraqi government was named in May 2004, at which point the Iraqi Governing Council was dissolved, though there was heavy overlap between the two governing bodies.|$|E
2500|$|During the 14 July Revolution in 1958, the King of Iraq {{was overthrown}} {{and the country}} {{established}} diplomatic and political relationships with Warsaw Pact countries, while simultaneously severing relations with western nations. The Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) dropped the [...] "Royal" [...] from its name after the revolution. The Soviets were quick to supply MiG-17s, and later MiG-19 and MiG-21 fighters, as well as Ilyushin Il-28 bombers to the <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b> They also received 13 Ilyushin Il-14 transports in 1959 from Poland. The first MiG-17s were first delivered in 1958 to replace the de Havilland Vampire. During the late 1960s and or early 1970s additional MiG-17 examples may have been purchased and then forwarded to either Syria or Egypt.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of January 26, Salih Jabr fled to England. The king asked a Shi’ī {{religious}} scholar who {{had been involved in}} the 1920 uprisings with forming a <b>new</b> government.The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> looked to blame foreign agitators for the January uprisings. They looked at the Saudi support of the Independence Party and the Soviet links to the Communist party. They claimed that the Communist party received major donations from Jewish communists. However, records indicate that the Communist party spent very little money in January 1948, supporting the idea that the demonstrations were spontaneous and enjoyed large-scale popular support.|$|R
50|$|The Labour {{government}} remained ascendant in {{the opinion}} polls, but its popularity began to suffer from March 2003 {{as a result of}} Tony Blair's decision to send British forces to collaborate with the American forces in their invasion of Iraq, which led to the end of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, as well as his eventual capture, trial and execution by a <b>new</b> democratic <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b> However, there was a public outcry that the invasion of Iraq failed to uncover weapons of mass destruction which had long been believed to exist in Iraq. By the summer of 2003, several opinion polls were showing a narrow Conservative lead, and the Liberal Democrats were also shown to be enjoying a surge in support, largely seen {{to be the result of}} Charles Kennedy's anti-war stance.|$|R
50|$|With the {{overthrow}} of the Ba'ath government by the United States in 2003 the Kurds have increased diplomatic means to seek further gains towards legitimacy. The United States and Kurdish parties disagree over the ethnic alignment of the regional government, and this disagreement continues to stall any concrete gains from occurring. The United States believes a non-ethnically defined government is best for the region so that the collective majority can broker an identity and connect both politically and as a society. However the Kurds do not agree with this concept, as they prefer a regional government explicitly built on the Kurdish identity. This {{is a step in the}} direction of autonomy and a method for the Kurdish population to showcase their abilities in governing themselves and generating a productive self-sufficient economy. Time will tell if these new negotiations and concepts will bear success for the Iraqi Kurdish plight. Massoud Barzani has been elected president of Iraqi Kurdistan and Jalal Talabani has been elected president of the <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> democratic <b>government.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On the {{execution}} day, Hussein said, [...] "I spent {{my whole life}} fighting the infidels and the intruders, [...] I destroyed the invaders and the Persians." [...] He also stressed that the Iraqis should fight the Americans and the Persians. Mowaffak al Rubiae, Iraq's National Security adviser, who was a witness to Hussein's execution described him as repeatedly shouting [...] "down with Persians." [...] Hussein built an anti-Iranian monument called Hands of Victory in Baghdad in 1989 to commemorate [...] his declaration of victory over Iran in the Iran-Iraq war (though the war is generally considered a stalemate, if not an Iraqi defeat). After his fall, {{it was reported that}} the <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> had organized the Committee for Removing Symbols of the Saddam Era and that the Hands of Victory monument had begun to be dismantled. However, the demolition was later halted.|$|E
2500|$|The Iraqi Air Force {{was founded}} in 1931, during British control of Iraq after {{the defeat of the}} Ottoman Empire in WW1, with only a few pilots. Aside from a brief period during the Second World War, the Iraqi Air Force {{operated}} mostly British aircraft until the 14 July Revolution in 1958, when the <b>new</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> began increased diplomatic relationships with the Soviet Union. The air force used both Soviet and British aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s. When Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, the air force grew very quickly when Iraq ordered more Soviet and French aircraft. Its peak came after the long and bloody Iran–Iraq War, which ended in 1988, when it consisted of 1029 aircraft of all types (of which 550 were combat ready), becoming the largest air force in the region. Its downfall came during the Gulf War (1990–91) and continued while coalition forces enforced no-fly zones. The remains of Iraq's air force were destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E

40|$|The Asahi {{newspaper}} is the second-most-read national broadsheet newspaper in Japan {{and is considered}} left-wing and anti-American (Komori et al. 2002). The Nihon Keizai {{newspaper is}} a broadsheet which specializes {{in the economy and}} is motivated by economic imperatives. In this study, one front-page lead story from the Asahi and one from the Nihon Keizai, both of which report on the handover of power to the <b>Iraqi</b> Interim <b>Government</b> on 28 June, 2004, are selected to investigate the nature of the 2 ̆ 7 reporter 2 ̆ 7 voice in Japanese. The analytical tools used are appraisal analysis (Martin and White 2005) and generic structure potential analysis (Hasan 1996). The study demonstrates that these lead stories are far from being 2 ̆ 7 neutral 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 objective 2 ̆ 7 : the authorial reporters in each article take an evaluative position in relation to the handover of power to the <b>new</b> provisional <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b> However, these two reporter positions are not overtly expressed but rather are presented through two different rhetorical strategies, construing two covert arguments but within a similar organizational structure. The chapter concludes that White 2 ̆ 7 s definition of 2 ̆ 7 reporter 2 ̆ 7 voice, as it applies to English, applies equally to these two Japanese news stories...|$|R

Despite the attempts to resolve the conflict by providing Kurds with a recognized autonomy in north Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan), the negotiations failed in 1974, resulting in resumed hostilities known as the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War, which resulted in the collapse of the Kurdish militias and the reconquest of northern Iraq by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> troops.
